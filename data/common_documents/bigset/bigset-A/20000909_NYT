TROJANS QB ANXIOUS TO MAKE POSITIVE STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everyone else has spent the past two weeks
quizzing USC quarterback Carson Palmer about his poor performance
against Penn State, so wide receiver Kareem Kelly figured he might
as well get his turn, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was a little excited and anxious, and forcing a
lot of passes,'' Kelly said following the pair's conversation.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little more forthcoming than Palmer has usually been
when assessing himself. Words like ``excited'' and ``anxious'' are
rarely heard from the laid-back sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for Carson and me to get our timing
down,'' said Kelly, who caught just two passes against Penn State.
``He wasn't too effective in the Penn State game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his emotions produced such an unexpectedly weak opening
effort, all eyes will be on Palmer tonight as the 11th-ranked
Trojans play Colorado at 5 at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Can Palmer bounce back? It's a question USC (1-0) will be forced
to answer early and often, because the Buffaloes (0-1) allowed
Colorado State to run for just 65 yards, while giving up 327 yards
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ready,'' Palmer said. ``A lot more comfortable. But
we'll know on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is eager for a big game, if for no other reason so he can
avoid another 14 days of speculation over why he had a rare off day
passing, after completing just 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards against
the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets old,'' he said. ``Yup, I'm tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett believes Palmer, who played for the first
time since breaking his collarbone last September, suffered
first-game jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Carson will have that kind of game too many
times,'' Hackett said. ``I'm not saying that he won't have another
one, but I think the development with his receivers will continue
to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of things that happened in that game,
lots of different things, like playing with new people. That's
going to be the case for a while. Let's face it, we are playing
some freshmen and sophomores all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the focus on Palmer, few have considered that Kelly was
nearly shut out of the offense, as the Trojans were content to milk
the clock and run the ball against Penn State. He hasn't exactly
had an easy couple of weeks himself, but Kelly, who is expected to
have a breakout season, is being patient _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me how many catches I have, as long as we
can pull out victories,'' Kelly said. ``Last year, I had nine
catches for 175 yards in a game and we still lost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett seems determined this week to make Kelly as
prominent as Palmer, especially after watching game tapes of
Colorado State shredding the Buffaloes' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to run the ball, but on the other hand, if they
are not going to give us a chance to run the ball, we are going to
rely on Kelly and whatever he can get done,'' Hackett said. ``I
come back to Colorado State. The year before, Colorado State runs
the ball down Colorado's throat. This year, they are poor running
the ball. Colorado just nails them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, for one, is ready for more passing opportunities but
realizes USC probably won't beat Colorado unless tailback Sultan
McCullough (128 yards against Penn State) is a major part of the
offense again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we have a chance to pass more, but hopefully we'll run
the ball much better than Colorado State,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Colorado lost to Colorado State last week 28-24, the
still-respected Buffaloes are a critical team on the Trojans'
schedule. The fact Penn State flopped against Toledo took some
luster off USC's victory, and this will be a chance to address any
lingering skepticism over how much improvement has really been made
since last season.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if USC wins tonight, the rest of the schedule is
not terribly difficult. Of the next eight games, five are at the
Coliseum, and as of today, USC should be favored in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   It's one reason why USC players continue to make brazen
statements about the season, even if they have played just one
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very aggressive and hopefully go
undefeated,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that road trips will be fewer than normal, Hackett took
time out this week to lecture the Trojans about the importance of
playing well at the Coliseum, where USC is 10-3 in Hackett's
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   But USC has also blown two 21-point leads at home in those two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win back East (against Penn State) is good, but what really
matters is how you play in the Coliseum,'' Hackett said. ``This is
our house and we need to make sure everyone understands that. We're
focused and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: A crowd of 65,000 is expected. . . . Former Montclair
Prep football and basketball star Anwawn Jones will start at
defensiveend for Colorado. . . . Four Navy F-18 jets will fly by
before the game in a ``missing man'' formation as a tribute to
former USC swimmer Lt. Mathew Moneymaker, who died in a plane crash
last year upon takeoff from the aircraft carrier USS John F.
Kennedy.

MIX OF PIGSKINS AND PICKLE JUICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to raise a glass and drink a toast to the pleasant
surprises of the always-unpredictable start of the football season.
My tumbler stands ready on my desk, filled to the brim with pickle
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, pickle juice, the less-than-appetizing elixer that powered
the Philadelphia Eagles to their blowout-of-the-week victory over
the Dallas Cowboys. Owing to its apparent effectiveness in warding
off cramps while the Eagles were running around in the 109-degree
heat of Texas Stadium last Sunday, pickle juice suddenly is all the
rage in the nation's locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles said only one of their players experienced cramps
during the game and only five required intravenous fluids
afterward. In Texas, in September, that's considered progress.
</P>
<P>
   So now the University of Georgia has said it's supplying pickle
juice to its football players before practices and will give it to
them before today's game at South Carolina, believing the salt and
nutrients combat the cramps that struck several Bulldogs in their
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going with that pickle juice,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan
said, perhaps mindful that if the experiment doesn't go well, his
players will have a bye week to get their digestive systems back in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles trainer Rick Burkholder said he has been besieged by
other teams inquiring about the proper application of pickle power.
Burkholder's comments appeared in a press release Friday announcing
that Vlasic has signed on as the _ hold on for the inevitable _
official pickle of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally you wonder if UCLA and USC will tap into pickle juice
in order to gain every advantage in their home games against
Colorado and Fresno State today, or if the Bruins and Trojans have
grown complacent aftertheir 1-0 starts. Their trainers say thank
you very much, but they'll stick with water, salt pills, Gatorade
and other more conventional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   USC head athletic trainer Russ Romano noted that pickle juice is
scientifically unproven. Also, it's only fair to point out,
Gatorade is a Trojans sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The pickle-juice solution) has been floating around for years
and years, and every once in a while it pops up again,'' said Geoff
Schaadt, UCLA's director of athletic training and rehabilitation.
Another pregame panacea he keeps hearing about: Alka-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   Schaadt didn't even want to ponder this question: Dill? Sweet?
Kosher?
</P>
<P>
   He said Bruins players have been asking him about pickle juice
all week and he sounded weary of the subject. I told him the answer
to his problem is simple: Let the players taste the stuff and
they'll never ask again.
</P>
<P>
   After a sip of the juice from a jar of slow-cured dill pickles,
all I can say is !bold!a.) it's saltier than a Bobby Knight
halftime speech, and !bold!b.) its taste isn't QUITE as unappealing
as its appearance. If you happened to leave your glass of cloudy
yellow liquid unattended, there's very little risk somebody else
will drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, pickle-juice toasts seem appropriate for the stars of
the first couple of weeks of this NFL and college season, the
intriguing portion of the schedule when you discover every year
that half of everything you believed about football is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   __A toast to the Pacific 10.
</P>
<P>
   If you read some of the articles about the Pac-10's
embarrassments in 1999, you might have gotten the impression the
conference was about to fold. Then it started the 2000 season 7-0
against the rest of the nation, including USC's and UCLA's
victories over ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   What's to add, except to say the Pac-10 also held its own in the
NFL, with the top four quarterbacks in total offensive yardage last
Sunday being Cade McNown (UCLA and the Chicago Bears, 377 yards
passing and running), Jake Plummer (Arizona State and the Arizona
Cardinals, 341), Mark Brunnell (Washington and the Jacksonville
Jaguars, 306) and Chris Chandler (Washington and the Atlanta
Falcons, 276).
</P>
<P>
   __A toast to the road teams.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors beat the point spread in 12 of the 15 NFL games in the
opening week. If they continue to do well, this will suggest a
solution to Los Angeles' stadium problem. Forget a stadium, just
put together a team and let it play every game on the road.
</P>
<P>
   __A toast to a new generation of pro quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Stoney Case, Daunte Culpepper, Jay Fiedler, Donovan McNabb _ I
don't know who any of you are, but you were winners last week, and
it's your turn to show off. If Troy Aikman's concussion sidelines
him, and if Brett Favre's elbow sidelines him, it will mean that
none of the Super Bowl- winning quarterbacks of the 1990s is
active.
</P>
<P>
   __A toast to Dennis Miller.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling left out, unable to join in the Miller-bashing
because I wanted so badly for a smart, irreverent guy to succeed.
And then . . . Christo, Romulus and Remus, and ``Hey, Skittles!''
</P>
<P>
   __A toast to the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Duce Staley, an improved defense and that magic potion. The
Eagles might be the St. Louis Rams of 2000, assuming the Rams are
done with the label.
</P>
<P>
   That's all for now. Half a glass of this stuff and I'm starting
to think cramps would be preferable.

CAMPBELL HOPES 18 TACKLES NOT NEEDED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Campbell figured he had five, maybe six
tackles against Air Force. He figured wrong. He had 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge safety said he was just doing his job.
But 18 tackles in a game is not in a defensive back's job
description.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, we went to dinner and people were asking me
how many I had and I thought it was five or six,'' Campbell said.
``I was just going up and making plays. I don't think it's a big
deal. I'm supposed to tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN will count on Campbell to have another solid performance in
tonight's game against Southwest Texas State in San Marcos, Texas.
The Matadors (0-1) hope to bounce back from a 55-6 loss to Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Westlake High product, had nine solo and nine
unassisted tackles _ a couple which saved touchdowns _ a pass
deflection and forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Those are statistics linebackers commonly register.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a really fine football game,'' defensive-backs coach
Junior Thurman said. ``He made a lot of nice plays, read his keys
really well and not too many times was he caught out of position,
which is a plus. Basically, he played our defense the way it was
designed, most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a sophomore, said he never had more than a few tackles
in a game in high school. He had more tackles against Air Force
than he had all last year, when he played in four games and
recorded six tackles in limited action. He was also hampered by a
bulging disc in his back.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell, who will make his second start today, wasn't
thrilled when he was taken out for a few plays against Air Force.
When he found out he was rested solely to give other defensive
backs experience, he was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he was going to find a way to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing this year. I didn't care where _ I would've
played anywhere,'' he said. ``I just wanted to play anywhere _ wide
receiver, anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit on the sidelines coming in as a freshman, you learn a
lot of humility. I went from people throwing away from me in high
school to sitting on the sidelines. I was like, `Wait. I can play.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure playing time, Campbell said he gave up plenty
of extracurricular activities in the summer. Campbell said all he
did was work two jobs and work out in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell got his wish with plenty of work. The Matadors defense
was on the field for 94 plays and Campbell was in on 82 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taking its toll and so was the altitude,'' Campbell
said. ``I couldn't get my mouthpiece in sometimes because I had
cotton mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he received all the glory with 18 tackles, but it
was only because the rest of the defensive backs did their jobs,
too. And if there's a statistic he's talking about, it's not all
the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped an interception and I've never dropped a . . .
interception in my life,'' Campbell said. ``I'll never forget it. I
dropped an interception against Air Force. I told my coaches I'll
never drop one again. That keeps me up at night. But I'm my own
worst critic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman had plenty of praise for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much improved from spring football,'' Thurman said. ``He
dedicated himself in the offseason program and it's really paying
off. I look for him to lead the secondary, even though it's his
second year, he's relatively new and it's his first year
starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Campbell gone to any of the Pac-10 schools that recruited
him, he'd probably be sitting on the sidelines again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to play and got to get some experience,'' Campbell said.
``I was waiting all spring and all summer for that game to see if I
could play against a Division I team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad coming to Northridge. I was testing myself to see
if I could play a Division I school. I proved to myself that I
could compete. (Air Force) will be one of the top five rushing
teams in the country and to have 18 tackles was great. I got to
prove to myself I could play at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell doesn't play at all like his nickname _ ``Pretty Boy''
_ would suggest. Defensive lineman Jason Nicastro gave him the
nickname because Campbell let his hair grow out over the summer and
now has curly locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him, I was like, `Hey dude. You been
surfing?' '' Thurman said. ``I don't care how he looks, I just care
how he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And 18 tackles looks just fine.

 &HT;    STUDENT BATTLING OATH OF LOYALTY(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By EDYTHE JENSEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Mesa, ARIZ.) - Fabricio Rodriguez, Mesa Community College's
student vice president, isn't getting paid because he refused to
sign a loyalty oath that would have made him a felon for being a
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Civil Liberties Union is demanding that the Maricopa
County Community College District scrap the oath and give Rodriguez
more than $800 in back pay due him as an elected student officer.
Meanwhile, he faces eviction from his apartment and is surviving on
donated canned goods and borrowed textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Oaths like the one he is being required to sign were declared
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966. Justices ruled
in favor of a Tucson teacher who challenged them years before the
26-year-old Rodriguez was born.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's loyalty oaths date to the 1961 state ``Communist
Control Act.'' Although oaths tied to the law were declared
unconstitutional, the Cold War-era statute was never repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has no objections to generic loyalty oaths that require
government employees to abide by state and federal laws. The group
challenges those that make personal or political beliefs a
condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez refused to sign the oath, used by every college in the
Maricopa County Community College District, when he took office in
early August.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU Director Eleanor Eisenberg said the civil-rights agency is
likely to seek legislation next year to remove ``Communist
control'' from Arizona lawbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kushibab, lawyer for the community college district, would
not say whether the district plans to eliminate its anti-Communist
loyalty oath. ``I am researching the issue and will advise my
client next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MCC has offered to rewrite the oath to eliminate the reference
to the Communist Party for Rodriguez only, Kushibab said. But the
student officer said he won't sign it unless the oaths for all
college district employees are changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it unconstitutional to condition the ability to be
paid on this oath,'' Eisenberg said Friday, ``but signing it would
be a felony if you are a member or become a member of the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University requires student workers and employees
to sign loyalty oaths, but they are worded differently and omit
mention of political beliefs or party membership. The ASU oath is
constitutional, Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a sophomore honor student, volunteers as director for
a Mesa literacy and mentoring program for children.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Kearny miner, Rodriguez said he joined the
Communist Party after working as a miner in Arizona, Nevada and
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw in the mines and the treatment of workers firmed my
political beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel compelled to do more than agitate,'' he added,
citing his work as a literacy volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been unable to buy his college textbooks and
faces eviction from his Gilbert apartment Oct. 1 without the
minimum-wage salary that comes with the student office.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Elfbrandt, a Tucson teacher, challenged a nearly
identical school loyalty oath in the early 1960s. She worked
without pay for five years until the Supreme Court overturned local
decisions and ruled in her favor. Students who elected Rodriguez
last spring knew about his political beliefs, he said, because he
published them in campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   A few faculty members are helping him by lending him textbooks
and encouraging his fight, he said. Fellow literacy volunteers are
giving him canned goods. ``But I'm really strapped, and they know
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Milner, spokeswoman for MCC, said she knows of no previous
objections to the college loyalty oath, ``but we have no intention
of depriving this student of his paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Milner said she was under the impression that the oath's wording
was mandated by state law for all public employees. She added that
she was not aware of the 1966 Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Milner also said she did not know that ASU used a different
oath.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has been getting loyalty oath complaints for years, but
individuals have always stopped short of legal challenges ``because
it's an economic hardship, and most of them have families to
support,'' Eisenberg said. ``It takes a tremendous amount of
courage to do what Fabricio is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the ACLU would have taken the case no matter what
Rodriguez's beliefs because the loyalty oath allows tax-funded
institutions to withhold employee paychecks based on their personal
beliefs.

   DENVER _ The long, difficult and disappointing season for
Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes took another bad turn Friday
when he was suspended for six games for a beanball incident Aug. 27
at Chicago's Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes appealed the punishment handed down Friday by Frank
Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations. A
hearing date was not set, which enables Valdes to make his
scheduled start Monday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and surprised,'' Valdes said. ``It's the first
time it happened to me in 10 years of baseball. As soon as I found
out what's going on, I said, 'We have to appeal this thing.' I
thought it was no big issue. Now, you can't throw inside, or if you
hit a batter you get suspended for six games? Man. C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs righty Kerry Wood was suspended three games for throwing
behind Alex Cora's head in the top of the fifth inning following
Bruce Aven's second homer of the game. Wood began serving his
suspension immediately. Both players were also fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Valdes' first pitch was high and
inside to Mark Grace. Home plate umpire Mark Wegner warned both
benches. Valdes then hit Grace with a 3-1 pitch and was ejected
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't understand it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``(Wood's pitch) was so violent, flagrant. Kerry Wood should
have been thrown right there, and that didn't happen. Ismael, it
wasn't a knockdown, it was up and in. I don't know where Frank's
coming from on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   As points of reference, Tampa Bay's Dave Eiland, Tony Fiore and
Cory Lidle were each suspended three games for throwing at Boston
batters after a warning was issued. Boston's Pedro Martinez was
suspended five games for throwing at Cleveland's Roberto Alomar
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Valdes, Robinson said the reason for the six
games were for throwing at Grace, then for hitting him after a
warning was issued, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make a pitch inside and hit a batter, and I
get suspended for six games?'' said Valdes, who's 0-3 with a 6.08
ERA with the Dodgers. ``I'm surprised, I'm angry. I don't think I
deserve this many games.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Once Triple-A Albuquerque finishes the
playoffs, right-hander Eric Gagne and lefty Jeff Williams are
expected to be recalled. . . . Todd Hundley was the starting
catcher for the Dodgers, returning a day earlier than the club
announced from his mother's funeral in Chicago. . . . Center
fielder Devon White said he's only available to pinch-hit because
of his strained left quadriceps. White said he's about 75 percent
and he wasn't ready to run in the outfield. . . . Chicago-based
attorney Mike Abernathy filed motions to quash the subpoenas of the
18 Dodgers, and the since-traded Alan Mills, asked to testify in
the criminal case of Charles Carlin, charged with disorderly
conduct stemming from the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field. Abernathy
said the hearings about the subpoienas would be Thursday.

KINGS ADD DEPTH WITH DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings opened training camp
for the 2000-2001 season Friday morning with two two-hour practice
sessions and two new defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Lubomir Visnovsky and Andreas Lilja are not expected to have the
impact of Garry Galley, who was lost to free agency, and Sean
O'Donnell, who was taken by Minnesota in the expansion draft. But
just months after being selected in the June amateur draft, both
have a chance to make the club and add depth to a suspect blue
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' biggest offseason acquisition was free-agent
defenseman Mathieu Schneider. He will play the second unit and team
with Rob Blake on power-play situations. But Visnovsky, a
Slovakian, and Lilja, a Swede, are symbols of the Kings' philosophy
to build through the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure they can contribute right away, but I think
they are candidates,'' said second-year coach Andy Murray, who
played Visnovsky and Lilja together in the afternoon workout.
``It's a process and evaluation right now. We believe the potential
is there. I think they are good players, but are they good enough
to play at the NHL level? That's what we need to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also part of Murray's evaluation process on defense: Phillipe
Boucher, who missed all but one game last year after foot surgery,
and Jaroslav Modry, a part-time player in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Visnovsky, 24, and Lilja, 25, are not kids. Both are older than
Aki Berg, who has played parts of four seasons with the Kings even
though he turned just 23 at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   But Berg was erratic last season, playing well at times but
getting scratched for the first two games of the playoffs against
Detroit. Like Jere Karalahti, the Finnish native who stepped right
in last year as a rookie, Visnovsky and Lilja have considerable
international experience. The Kings are hopeful for an easy
transition to the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Lilja, molded in the same defense-first style as countryman
Mattias Norstrom, played for Malmo last season in the Swedish Elite
League. Like Berg, Lilja has size (6-foot-3, 220) and impressed the
Kings' top European scout Vaclav Nedomansky at the the World Hockey
Championships. He was taken with the 54th overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   Visnovsky is a quick-skating, pesky sort who had 21 goals and 45
points in 54 games for Bratislava of the Slovak League. He was
selected in the fourth round, 118th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Galley and O'Donnell represented the Kings' second defensive
unit behind Blake and Norstrom and both saw playing time on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tried to keep O'Donnell by offering draft picks before
the expansion draft, but Minnesota turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Galley, 37, made $1.8 million last season and had one of the
best years of his career. He wanted similar money, but the Kings
were worried about his age. Galley has not caught on with another
team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Kings general manager Dave Taylor spoke to holdout
center Jozef Stumpel by phone Friday and the two will talk again
today. The club is anxious to get him into camp for conditioning
reasons, as he's missed 43 games the past two years due to groin
and knee injuries. Stumpel, who is represented by Phoenix-based
Benji Robbins, remains at home in Slovakia.

SCIOSCIA SAYS ANGELS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Manager Mike Scioscia conceded Friday night
for the first time ``we're probably going to have to get help'' if
his Anaheim Angels are to make it into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough head-to-head games (with Seattle and
Oakland),'' he said. ``But, as the games narrow, we might not be in
a position to do it all ourselves. And that's not a comfortable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Of their remaining 21 games, the Angels have three left with
American League West leader Seattle and four with second-place
Oakland, all in the final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's a key week,'' Scioscia acknowledged, ``and
we want to get ourselves into a position to take advantage of those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping it loose: Scioscia has had the luxury of being in a
number of pennant races during his playing career with th ``I don't
buy that 'playing tight' stuff, or other teams (out of the race)
being loose,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to live or die with the same style you have in the
spring . . . the same aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to hit 500-foot home runs or strike everybody
out if that's not their game. The important thing is to stay the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've talked about that (with the club).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some games are more meaningful as far as the standings
go,'' he went on. ``I'm not wearing blinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``we're not changing our approach. We want to
get to the point those (season-ending) games are meaningful. Bei
race doesn't happen often. It's a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said, laughing, ``who knows? We might be six games
up by then.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quicker hook? One thing Scioscia said he might alter slightly
is how long he stays with his starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as essential as it is in May, June or July for the
starter to get deep into games,'' Scioscia said. ``Now, as the
(season) gets shorter, it's more with how he's pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the starter's going well, he's out there
regardless of the pitch count. And if he isn't going so well, he's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an 11-man bullpen,'' Scioscia pointed out. ``If we
struggle with an 11-man bullpen, we're in trouble.''

DONALD GALLUP, 87, LITERARY BIBLIOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Gallup, the Yale literary bibliographer who in
1968 confirmed the discovery of the long-lost manuscript of T.S.
Eliot's ``Waste Land,'' died in Branford, Conn., on Wednesday. He
was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup spent more than 30 years as a curator in the Yale
Collection of American Literature.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia C. Willis, the current curator of the Yale Collection
of American Literature, said she considered Gallup, who retired in
1980, ''the premier bibliographer for both Eliot and Ezra Pound,
specializing in finding the first appearances of their work and
documenting their creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Pound,'' Willis said, ``Mr. Gallup found 1,989
works by the poet published in magazines and newspapers from 1902
until his death in 1972.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of literary bibliography is to discover and provide
all useful information about a writer's publications, including
size, binding, book jacket, date, price, print run, contents and so
forth. All this may deepen understanding of the work.
</P>
<P>
   As a literary bibliographer, Gallup provided wide-ranging
scholarly service to literature. The Eliot manuscript was
discovered by curators in the New York Public Library, but it was
Gallup whose analysis made the identification definitive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assembling bibliographies of the work of Eliot
and Pound, Gallup edited writings by Pound's friends Gertrude
Stein, Alice B. Toklas and Thornton Wilder, and has been celebrated
for his work on Eugene O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   As a young graduate student at Yale, Gallup used money from odd
jobs and work in the Yale library to collect early writings by
Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   His first Eliot checklist was published in 1937, and was
expanded into a book in 1952. Delighted with the book, a writer for
The Times Literary Supplement in London said it was for Eliot ``a
compliment rarer, in mathematical terms, than the Nobel Prize or
the Order of Merit,'' both of which Eliot already possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot was ambivalent about that review. He is said to have
mischievously hidden one or two items so Gallup's work would not be
complete, and then written to the author, saying it made him ``feel
proud, but almost unworthy to be the occasion for such a
masterpiece of contemporary bibliography.''
</P>
<P>
   But the manuscript for ``The Waste Land'' seemed to have
disappeared. Then, in 1968, the New York Public Library called a
news conference to announce the opening of the archive of John
Quinn, a collector who had donated his Eliot bibliographic holdings
to the library. The archive included manuscripts, notebooks and
other items.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rabbit pulled out of a hat, the manuscript for ``The
Waste Land'' was removed from a sealed envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing of the discovery, The Times Literary Supplement
immediately engaged Gallup to study the contents of the Quinn
collection and write a report. It required only a week of study for
Gallup to analyze and confirm the manuscript for ``The Waste
Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gallup donated a major part of his Eliot collection
to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Clifford Gallup was born on May 12, 1913, in Sterling,
Conn. His father was a lumber worker. After graduating from Yale in
1934, he taught English at Southern Methodist University in Dallas
until 1941, when the United States entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, he was stationed for two years in England, where
he purchased first editions of English poetry and 19th-century
classics.
</P>
<P>
   One such acquisition was a copy of a William Butler Yeats poem
presented to Pound. When his unit moved to Paris after the
liberation, Gallup purchased letters and other materials relating
to Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Yale in 1946, Gallup was employed as a librarian and
then as a curator.
</P>
<P>
   Information about survivors was not immediately available.

HACKER DISRUPTS AUCTION SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUJUNGA, Calif. _ A hacker working through servers in Europe has
cost an online auctioneer hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost
business in the past two days, the Tujunga-based company said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack affects not only BidBay.com, the country's
eighth-largest online auction site, but sites run by the Ralphs
supermarket chain, commodities dealer Monex and other clients of
BidBay's Web host. Though the culprit, who has jammed BidBay's
site, has been traced to servers in Bulgaria and Austria, officials
said they believe the point of origin might be Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like nuking them,'' said BidBay Chief Executive Officer
George Tannous of his company's attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Tannous estimated the sabotage cost BidBay $600,000 in lost
business 36 hours after the first disruption. Programmers at the
company estimate it could take the weekend to stop the hacker and
restore service. Tannous is offering a $25,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of the hacker.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it is reminiscent of similar assaults in February
on major Internet sites like Yahoo and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prevents people from getting onto BidBay's site by
continually flooding the Web site's computers with useless data,
like a crank caller with speed-dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have set up computers to send trash data to a single
computer,'' said BidBay spokesman Tim Allison. ``Our computer has
to analyze that data before it determines it's garbage. It can't
get real data in.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed the agency is looking into
the matter but could not say whether it has begun a formal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new crime problem, and we're seeing more of it with
more companies doing business online,'' said bureau spokeswoman
Laura Bosley.
</P>
<P>
   According to Internet rating agency Media Metrix Inc., BidBay
ranked eighth among Internet auction sites in July with 785,000
unique user visits. In comparison, the top auction Web site, eBay,
registered 12 million hits.
</P>
<P>
   BidBay launched in January and employs 30 people, Tannous said.
</P>
<P>
   The sabotage also affects West Coast Internet, the Web host for
BidBay, and, indirectly, thousands of other companies whose Web
space is provided and administered by West Coast Internet
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ralphs could not be reached for comment Friday.
Monex Vice President William Nelles said his company had received
no complaints of disrupted service.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quaranto, owner of Capistrano Beach-based West Coast
Internet, said he believes the attack is not random but is being
done possibly by someone currently or formerly affiliated with the
company. Visitors to any of its other clients' sites should
experience no worse than slower connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely think it's a former employee or someone who
has something against George (Tannous),'' said Quaranto, who calls
such Internet attacks ``the terrorist act of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, two months after major sites such as eBay, CNN and
Yahoo reported similar floodings, police traced some of the attacks
to a Montreal teen-ager who went by the screen name ``Mafiaboy.''

   ``It isn't one person or one part of the team or whatever. You
can pick parts of this season, and it's offense, pitching. You can
go with individuals. Nobody's excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown is immune to this
funk.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who's making $15 million for this and the next five
seasons, fell to 12-6 after allowing five runs on nine hits in six
innings. Though Brown's 2.72 ERA is second in the National League,
he's in jeopardy of not even winning 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who missed 11 games with a viral infection, homered
for the first time since Aug. 19. His blast leading off the fourth
inning moved him past Mike Piazza and atop the Los Angeles home run
list. Mike Piazza hit 40 homers in 1997. Sheffield is two home runs
shy of tying Duke Snider's club mark of 43.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, Hansen's leadoff pinch-hit homer was his
sixth this season, tying him with Brooklyn's Johnny Frederick
(1932) for most in one season. However, it only pulled the Dodgers
within 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, real tough,'' Hansen said. ``We expect a lot out
of ourselves. It's not like we're not trying, it's just not
happening. It's hard to handle. You have stay professional. You
have to stay positive. We're the Dodgers, a professional
organization, and it demands it. And we will.'' &QL;

ANGELS WIN; ORTIZ BACK ON TRACK

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With wide-open arms the Anaheim Angels warmly
greeted the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The sub-.500, down-and-out, wait'll '01, where'd-you-go-Boog
Powell Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in more than a month the Angels faced
someone other than a contender, a welcome breath of fresh air, and
they . . . well, they didn't exactly bury the Birds, but they won
2-1 before a crowd of 30,480.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil's sixth-inning homer snapped a 1-1 tie and Ramon
Ortiz, Mike Holtz and Troy Percival combined on a three-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third win in a row since their season-high
six-game losing streak _ the first time in two months, since July
6-9, they've won three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It was a timely win, too. Seattle and Oakland lost Friday night,
and so did Cleveland and Boston, thus the Angels gained valuable
ground in the American League West and the A.L. wild-card races.
</P>
<P>
   There's still some climbing to do _ the Angels are five games
out in the A.L. West, 5 back in the wild card _ but as manager Mike
Scioscia noted afterward, ``We still have our eye on the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   The postseason became that much more of a possibility thanks to
the remarkable turnabout by Ortiz, the Pedro Martinez lookalike
and, at times, pitch-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was impressive,'' Scioscia of Ortiz, who hurled 7 innings,
which were seven more than he lasted in his previous start Sunday
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good command of all my pitches, I didn't feel any
(pennant-race) pressure, I just treated like a normal game,'' Ortiz
said through translator Bobby Ramos, an Angels coach.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Fidel Castro of Cuba denounced the American
economic embargo on his country on Friday night and presented a
bleak vision of the world's future before thousands of cheering and
flag-waving supporters gathered in Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall be entering the 21st century, and that will happen in
extremely hard conditions for the world,'' the Cuban leader said in
a hoarse voice to about 2,400 listeners. ``The world is undergoing
a catastrophic situation. Don't believe the experts who feign
optimism and ignore the cruel realities of the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro called the United States' economic sanctions against Cuba
a ``criminal embargo'' and ``a violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader arrived shortly after 9 p.m., an hour later
than scheduled. Dressed in his signature olive military uniform, he
strode confidently to the lectern, surrounded by guards in dark
suits. Cheers and screams rose to the dark heights of the church,
and hundreds of arms fervently waved Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers called the event ``an evening of solidarity with
the Cuban people.'' Friday night, those political sympathies were
worn on sleeves, collars and T-shirts, as pins of the Cuban flag
and of Che Guevara, the guerrilla leader who became a symbol of the
communist revolution, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who attended, including Rep. Jose E. Serrano,
D.-N.Y., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., denounced U.S. policies
toward Cuba. The United States imposed the economic embargo shortly
after Castro took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people view Cuba very differently from its
government,'' Serrano told a group of reporters in Spanish. He said
he and those present only wanted Cuba to be ``treated equally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cuba discovered oil tomorrow, my country would be its
greatest ally,'' he said. ``If Cuba had, and I don't want it to
have, military arms that could create terror in the world, we would
be allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was invited to Riverside Church by the New York Welcoming
Committee for the Cuban Delegation for the Millennium. People
wanting to attend were asked to fax requests to the group, which
chose about 2,400 spectators. Friday night, about 2,100 of them sat
in the main chamber, while 300 sat in a side room watching the
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, made up of various grassroots groups, asked
Riverside if they could use the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against the embargo, and that is why we are holding
this reception,'' said Aleeka Wade, a spokeswoman for the group.
``We hope to show tonight how many people there are who oppose the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Wilson, the executive minister at Riverside,
said before the event that the church was pleased to play host for
the visit. ``Riverside has always been on the cutting edge of what
is happening in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was in New York this week to attend the United Nations
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the United Nations, he criticized the power
that industrialized countries have over the developing world,
saying wealthy nations have ``only served to make us poorer, more
exploited and more dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a reform of the United Nations, to transform it
``into a true representative body of all the interests of all the
peoples on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, as she was waiting for Castro to arrive at the
church, Ellen P. Bernstein reflected on the Cuban leader's role in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. people need to hear that he is not a devil, not the
devil he is said to be,'' she said. ``They need to hear he has
important ideas for the same goals we all aspire to: world peace
and security and the proper treatment of the power.''

MAYOR HOPES VERDICT PUNISHING ATTACKERS HELPS IMPROVE TOWN'S
REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Steve Judy was all of 28 years old, and
less than a month into his job as mayor of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,
when he had his first brush with the Aryan Nations, a white
supremacist group that he and countless other people in this
northern Idaho city describe as a thorn in the side of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The group wanted a permit for a parade down the town's main
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 31 now, though some days I feel 70,'' Judy said. ``It's
going to be a great book someday, I keep telling people. `So You
Want to Be a Mayor?' That's going to be the title.''
</P>
<P>
   If he ever does write a book, Judy says, then Sept. 7, will mark
a jubilant chapter: a state court jury delivered a $6.3 million
verdict against the Aryan Nations, a civil damage award that
lawyers for two victims of a 1998 attack by members of the group,
which the lawyers said they hope will bankrupt the organization and
drive it out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors made clear in interviews Friday that the question in
their 10 hours of deliberations was never really whether to punish
Richard Butler, the self-styled pastor of the group, and his
deputy, but rather by how much to punish them: Some jurors held out
for a judgment of as much as $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the mayor said Friday, the community sent a
message with the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the message we've always tried to give out: This is a
place that cares about human rights,'' he said. ``Maybe now we'll
be known as the place that got the verdict against the Aryan
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Coeur d'Alene seem palpably frustrated that northern
Idaho has acquired a reputation as a haven for violent racists like
the 82-year-old Butler, a retired aeronautics engineer who moved to
property 20 miles north of here in the 1970s to escape what he once
called the ``alien scum'' in Southern California. He has described
the property as the ``international headquarters of the white
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy says he contends with the region's image wherever he goes.
``It's up there with the floating green'' _ a signature hole on a
golf course in this resort town _ ``and the beauty of the place as
a whole,'' he said. ``Tons of people know how beautiful Coeur
d'Alene is. But you also hear, `Oh, is that where those skinheads
or the Aryans are from?'''
</P>
<P>
   What is less reported by the national media, he says, is the
community's response to the fringe groups.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Judy says, there is the revulsion that most people
feel for them. There is also the human-rights education fund set up
with local donations, establishing a curriculum to teach
schoolchildren, the mayor said, about ``dignity, tolerance and
respect.'' There are also the various honors given the town,
including the Raoul Wallenberg Award, usually given to an
individual but presented to the entire community in 1987 for its
efforts to counteract the Aryan Nations' message.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 80 people gathered here in July 1998 for a march
sponsored by Aryan Nations, Judy said he felt some frustration that
the community's response, a ``Lemons to Lemonade'' campaign, was
less well reported. Thousands of people attended a counter-rally,
and some devised a pledge program for human rights that raised more
than $1,000 a minute for every one of the 32 minutes the extremists
marched.
</P>
<P>
   Judy, citing the loss of business and the added security costs
created by such circumstances, says the Aryan Nations has committed
``economic terrorism'' against his city. Police security for the
1998 march, which ended without violence, cost the city more than
$100,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer in the Constitution,'' the mayor said,
sitting in his office at City Hall, which has a magnificent view of
Lake Coeur d'Alene. ``I studied constitutional law'' at Gonzaga
University in Spokane, Washington, and ``the community's rights are
really second place to any organization's right to free speech.''
But, he said, ``it just seems to fly in the face of this Republic
we have that those folks can come and portray a message here that
hurts people, that hurts our community, that hurts a lot of people
economically. What are the community's rights in this? It just
doesn't seem fair. But constitutional law is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the jury's award will help change perceptions
remains a unknown. A leader of the Jewish Defense League from Los
Angeles recently criticized the city for what he called its
``placid'' response to the Aryan Nations over the years. And even
if the group's members leave, northern Idaho will remain one of the
least ethnically diverse places in the nation: the black population
is 0.2 percent, according to census figures, and the Hispanic
population about 2.5 percent.

ANGELS GIVE BIG CHECK TO SIGN BOOTCHECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels and first-round draft pick
Chris Bootcheck ended their prolonged negotiations Friday by
agreeing to terms on a contract with a bonus believed to be about
$1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck, a right-handed pitcher from Auburn University, was
the Angels' second pick in the first round of last June's
free-agent amateur draft and the 20th player selected overall.
Reportedly, Bootcheck, who was advised by player agent Scott Boras,
had originally sought a signing bonus of $2.1 million. The Angels'
first offer of $1.5 million was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' earlier first-round pick, left-hander Joe Torres,
the 10th player taken overall, received a $2.08 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to like about Chris Bootcheck,'' Angels scouting
director Donny Rowland said. ``He has a high ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the Angels, Bootcheck, who was 25-10 in
his three-year career at Auburn, said: ``I'm happy to be a member
of the Anaheim Angels organization. I'm looking forward to working
toward my ultimate goal of pitching in the major leagues and being
a productive member of the Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck will join the Angels' instructional-league team in
Arizona Sept. 17.

<P>
   Patriotic Americans can relax and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who has so cleverly endeared the United States to the
rest of humanity by proclaiming America the world's one ``essential
nation,'' should be proud.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, the United States will win 97 of the 888 medals awarded,
more than any other nation, once again demonstrating America's
physical and moral superiority over the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sweaty nationalists in Germany, Russia, China and Australia will
also have ample reason to cheer; each of those countries' athletes
will win from 49 to 63 medals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there will be much weeping, gnashing of teeth
and public soul-searching in Japan and the United Kingdom, which
will win fewer than 20 medals each.
</P>
<P>
   Since the quadrennial jockfest doesn't begin for another five
days, one might reasonably ask how anyone could read the future in
this way.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple: Two professors figured it out. In a study
released on Aug. 28, Andrew Bernard, of the Tuck School of Business
at Dartmouth College, and Meghan R. Busse, of the Yale School of
Management, examined Summer Olympics medal counts for the last 40
years to see what factors determine how many medals each nation
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so annoyed when people said we did well or didn't do
well _ I didn't have anything to compare it to,'' Bernard said,
explaining the statisticians' zeal to reduce romance to numbers
that lies behind this esoteric research project.
</P>
<P>
   But now he does, and so do the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many paradigm-shifting breakthroughs, the formula
discovered by Bernard and Busse is beautiful in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Just two factors account for 95 percent of a nation's predicted
medal count: the number of medals it won at a previous Olympics,
and the overall size of its economy. (Bigger is better.)
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita income is irrelevant, Bernard said. A large, poor
country will win as many medals as a small, wealthy country,
assuming they have the same overall national income.
</P>
<P>
   The income-to-medal ratio is not linear, Bernard said. Because
of limits on the number of athletes they can send to the Olympics,
the largest, richest nations win a smaller share of medals than
their share of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United States would have a good chance of
sweeping the gold, silver, and bronze medals in women's and men's
basketball if it were allowed to send three teams instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, increased training opportunities for athletes from
poor nations have narrowed the gap between rich and poor over the
last generation.
</P>
<P>
   African runners regularly work out in the United States and
Europe, and the International Olympic Committee sends some of the
cash from the Games to Olympic committees in poor nations, which
use the money to finance their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of still greater importance than the size of a country's gross
national product is its long-term record at the Games, Bernard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has the world's second-largest economy, but
in 1996 it won just 14 medals, fewer than Hungary, the Netherlands
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bernard expects Japan to win 19 medals, far fewer
than it should take home given its size. On the other hand,
Australia consistently outperforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have done well in the past, that's going to persist,''
Bernard said. ``Once you develop infrastructure and training and
facilities, and once you develop athletes, they do last for a
couple of Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   That must be reassuring, especially for the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' model has generally been successful when
backtested against previous Olympic results. Used retrospectively
on the 1996 Games, the formula showed that the United States should
have won 101 medals, hitting America's total exactly.
</P>
<P>
   It overestimated Germany's medal count, coming up with 77 medals
for Germany, which actually won 65, but was dead on with China's
count of 50 medals and nearly nailed Russia's 63-medal haul.
</P>
<P>
   Still, do not expect the model to put to rest the only Olympic
sport in which every nation excels.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the post-Games handwringing over medal counts.
Even the Australians, who won 41 medals in Atlanta, were upset that
they had won only three golds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find something to complain about,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   So, now that the results are known: Let the Games begin!

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warm and humid weather will dominate much of the East on Sunday
as high pressure along the New England coast circulates tropical
air up the Atlantic Seaboard. Onshore winds and residual clouds
will keep readings near seasonal levels in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of a tropical depression will merge with a slow
moving cool front in the Ohio Valley. This will produce very heavy
showers in parts of Kentucky, southern Indiana and Illinois.
Thunderstorms will form in the sultry air over Ohio and West
Virginia on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A refreshingly cool air mass will push from the northern Plains
into the western Great Lakes. Along the fringe of the cooler air, a
few strong thunderstorms may erupt in Missouri and eastern
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest and northern Rockies will be dull and cooler, but
the Southwest will stay warm with thundershowers in the southern
Rockies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SYMPTOMS GONE
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For the first time this month, almost the entire state of
Texas stayed below 100 degrees and Dallas failed to reach 90 on
Friday. While the symptom, of Texas's severe drought _ the heat
wave _ has temporarily ended, the cause remains. It has not rained
in Dallas since late June, but showers returned to southeast Texas
late last week. There is a small chance that a stray thunderstorm
will reach the Dallas area Sunday, but no genuine break in the
drought is expected and hotter weather may resume later this week. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ When the Clinton administration began planning its
first major military campaign, the 1994 U.S. invasion of Haiti, the
CIA was left out until the last minute, when administration
officials suddenly asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA complied, quickly printing up leaflets calling on
Haitians to remain calm and not resist, and using voodoo symbols to
help get the message across. When a senior administration official
saw the leaflets, he objected, saying that the Clinton White House
could not show support for one religion over another.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA destroyed the leaflets, but agency officials shuddered
over the notion of a politically correct covert action.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, CIA analysts were admonished to avoid any
intelligence surprises during the presidential campaign. The
lecture came from their boss, John McLaughlin, who later explained
that he just wanted to make sure there were no embarrassing gaffes
at a sensitive time.
</P>
<P>
   While a lecture to steer clear of election-year controversy
might make sense at the Bureau of Land Management, the CIA's job is
to look for trouble, in order to warn the president and Congress
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was kind of insulting to the analysts,'' said one
CIA veteran. ``We are in the business of surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The spy agency has been struggling for its footing since the end
of the Cold War robbed it of its core mission. But the two
incidents demonstrate how, under the Clinton administration, the
CIA has suffered from two worsening trends: a skittishness about
politically sensitive intelligence and an aversion to risky
espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers who have left the agency in recent years say it is
dominated by play-it-safe bureaucrats and has become a diminished
force within the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intelligence agency, and it is supposed to do
serious things,'' said a senior CIA officer who resigned during the
Clinton administration. ``We should not be worried about image and
bureaucracy. We are not selling soap.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior intelligence officials say the CIA has regained much of
its strength under George Tenet, who became its director in July
1997. Still, its most glaring recent failure came in 1998, when it
was surprised by India's test of a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the story begins with the fall of the Berlin Wall and
the implosion of the Soviet Union. Lacking a clear mission, the CIA
became a target for budget cutting. The agency's espionage arm
shrank, and overseas stations in Africa and Latin America were
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was further traumatized in 1994 with the revelation that
Aldrich Ames, a longtime case officer, had been a Russian mole for
nine years. Reprimands in the case prompted a mass exodus of bitter
senior managers. By the mid-1990s, the generation that had run the
CIA during the Cold War was largely gone, and with them went much
of the agency's institutional memory on managing spy operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's handling of intelligence has deepened
the agency's woes. President Clinton's lack of interest in
intelligence policy early in his term doomed his first director of
central intelligence, R. James Woolsey. Woolsey likes to say that
when a light plane crashed onto the White House lawn in 1993, White
House staffers joked that it must have been Woolsey, trying to get
a meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti was hardly the Clinton administration's only half-hearted
covert action. The most spectacular failure was in Iraq. CIA
officers involved in two failed operations against Baghdad say the
Clinton administration wasted resources _ and Iraqi lives _ in
efforts the agency knew were pointless.
</P>
<P>
   One action, in northern Iraq, relied on the dissident Iraqi
National Congress and Kurdish ethnic groups. It was simply overrun
by the Iraqi Army. The other, based in Jordan, called for sabotage
and other minor acts of rebellion from the Iraqi National Accord,
which was made up mostly of former Iraqi military officers. But
Iraqi double agents penetrated the operation, and about 100 of its
members were arrested and executed.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of John Deutch to succeed Woolsey in 1995
initially seemed likely to strengthen the agency, but Deutch soon
began angling to become secretary of defense. In perhaps the most
significant restructuring in the nation's intelligence community in
the last decade, he arranged a transfer of spy satellite operations
from the CIA to the Defense Department. Even White House officials
acknowledge that the shift has been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pentagon has first call on the satellites, tactical,
short-range military targets have top priority, while longer-range
analytical problems _ like monitoring the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction _ get shorter shrift. Many insiders believe
that the CIA's failure to predict India's 1998 test of a nuclear
weapon was caused by the satellite shift.

   Senior intelligence officials insisted, however, that they had
never changed an analytical report because of such pressures.

   Many insiders say there are concrete signs that the tide has
begun to turn under Tenet. They credit him with bringing back Jack
Downing, a Cold War legend, who helped rebuild the agency's spy
service before going back into retirement last year, and winning
budget increases that have enabled the CIA to begin recruiting a
new generation of case officers. Some closed stations in Africa
have been reopened, aiding in the agency's increasingly successful
penetrations of terrorist groups. And senior officials say the
agency's risk-taking spirit is beginning to return.

   ``If the people who left a few years ago came back today and saw
what we were doing, I think they would be impressed,'' one senior

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ _ Democracy is about choice, but in the
Yugoslav version, which is now playing itself out with Slobodan
Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, changed the constitution to
make his office subject to direct election, and he has now called a
vote nine months earlier than he had to. So on Sept. 24, Yugoslavs
will vote for a federal president, Parliament and municipal
officials in an election that will appear like most others, with
voters getting to choose between the incumbent and his party, and
an array of challengers.
</P>
<P>
   But as election day approaches, a strong opposition candidate is
doing better than Milosevic in the opinion polls, and this points
up the uniqueness of Yugoslavia's system. Milosevic also gets to
make a choice: whether to accept the choice of the people if it
goes against him, or to manipulate the totals and declare victory
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   And then the people will have another chance to choose, but not
in the voting booths: will they accept Milosevic's choice, or will
they come out onto the streets to defend their own choices,
possibly against the arrayed power of the police and even the army.
</P>
<P>
   This is a political netherworld, in which the forms and
substance of both democracy and authoritarianism are clearly
visible. In an instructive way, they live side by side here, and
both have their limits, depending on the stakes. But with
Milosevic's own hat in the ring in a system he has manipulated like
a master for 12 years, the real hopes of long-divided opposition
leaders are coming up hard against the cynicism of those same
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of authoritarianism that needs a form of
democratic legitimation from time to time,'' said Vojislav Zanetic,
a marketing consultant, playwright and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pseudo-democracy, in which the opposition is
complicit,'' he said. ``It's a kind of society that must fall apart
slowly _ it can't be ripped apart in one day, in one election. We
don't have a political crisis here or even an economic one _ we
have a systemic crisis, a crisis of society and political will.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a form of parallel political universe. There is a
campaign, with speeches and tours and open meetings. There are
billboards and opinion polls and marketing experts. There are
monitors ready to examine the voting and counting procedures, and
Web sites devoted to the election and the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the state media, especially television, are
thoroughly and aggressively in the hands of Milosevic, there is a
lively independent press, including local television and radio,
that is both outspoken and combative in the face of government
pressure and derision. In general it has lined up dutifully in
support of Milosevic's main rival, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among these opponents there is also a resigned conviction
that Milosevic will steal as many votes as he needs to ensure not
only victory, but victory in the  &QC; first round _ since he needs an
unquestionable victory to achieve his aims of re-legitimation.
</P>
<P>
   And that adds a new quality of edge and risk to the options
facing Milosevic. ``For Milosevic, this election has turned into
Russian roulette,'' one opposition leader said. ``But for him to
allow a second round would be suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the people of Serbia; wouldn't they come out into
the streets to defend the opposition or their own choice? Among the
opposition, there are deep concerns that the Serbs, atomized and
impoverished, will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly I'm not so optimistic,'' said Vuk Draskovic, the head
of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who is living in Montenegro after
two attacks on his life. ``All of us together are fighting a battle
we cannot win. I'm quite sure Milosevic has right now in his pocket
the result of the elections. What will happen after 24 September,
when the opposition people will face the crackdown on their
hopes?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kostunica says that ``people are fatalistic about the way
they see these elections.'' Many of his own supporters in the
polls, he said, ``believe that Milosevic will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica plans to declare victory the night of the election, as
his aides presume Milosevic will. In the case of massive election
fraud, he hopes people will come out into the streets the way they
did for months after Milosevic refused to acknowledge opposition
victories in the 1996 local elections. But even Kostunica is not
sure that they will.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Foundation here
and a critic of Milosevic and Serb actions in Kosovo, said that
Milosevic won't freely cede power even if everyone voted against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen, I don't know,'' she said. ``It is, however,
important that we do not sit at home on Sept. 24, but go outside
and defend our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kandic is facing troubles of her own, with the Yugoslav army
threatening to bring her to court over articles she wrote
criticizing the behavior of Serbian forces in Kosovo. (She has also
criticized Albanian attacks on Serbs after the war ended.) These
threats to her are part of a skillful effort by the government to
intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters, including the
student movement, Otpor, or Resistance. The message that the
opposition hears is that the government will react with force, if
necessary, against any revolution in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, in addition, mysterious events that create a chill,
like the kidnapping two weeks ago of former Serbian President Ivan
Stambolic, who was Milosevic's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift party coup, Milosevic ousted him in 1987. Although
there have been rumors _ which his wife denies _ that Stambolic was
considering a run for the presidency, Milosevic and the government
forcefully deny any role in the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   These events create an undercurrent of tension quite apart from
Milosevic's political campaign against the opposition, in which he
stresses its support for and ties to the United States and the NATO
countries who bombed Yugoslavia last year. The other night, for
example, a news program on the state television cut from a meeting
between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and opposition
leaders to a close-up of Kostunica, who had not attended, then back
to the meeting, giving the false impression that he, too, had been
at the feet of Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Zanetic, the marketing expert, thinks the government is better
than the opposition at propaganda and political marketing,
understanding that most Serbs get their information from
television. ``In politics here, it doesn't matter if you tell the
truth or lie _ you must be clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, if Milosevic claims victory, he is likely to also
declare a landslide. And then one may better see where the new
balance lies between democracy and authoritarianism.

   It is a form of parallel political universe. There is a
campaign, with speeches and tours and open meetings. There are
billboards and opinion polls and marketing experts. There are
monitors ready to examine the voting and counting procedures, and
Web sites devoted to the election and the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the state media, especially television, are
thoroughly and aggressively in the hands of Milosevic, there is a
lively independent press, including local television and radio,
that is both outspoken and combative in the face of government
pressure and derision. In general it has lined up dutifully in
support of Milosevic's main rival, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among these opponents there is also a resigned conviction
that Milosevic will steal as many votes as he needs to ensure not
only victory, but victory in the  &QC; first round _ since he needs an
unquestionable victory to achieve his aims of re-legitimation.
</P>
<P>
   And that adds a new quality of edge and risk to the options
facing Milosevic. ``For Milosevic, this election has turned into
Russian roulette,'' one opposition leader said. ``But for him to
allow a second round would be suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the people of Serbia; wouldn't they come out into
the streets to defend the opposition or their own choice? Among the
opposition, there are deep concerns that the Serbs, atomized and
impoverished, will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly I'm not so optimistic,'' said Vuk Draskovic, the head
of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who is living in Montenegro after
two attacks on his life. ``All of us together are fighting a battle
we cannot win. I'm quite sure Milosevic has right now in his pocket
the result of the elections. What will happen after 24 September,
when the opposition people will face the crackdown on their
hopes?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kostunica says that ``people are fatalistic about the way
they see these elections.'' Many of his own supporters in the
polls, he said, ``believe that Milosevic will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica plans to declare victory the night of the election, as
his aides presume Milosevic will. In the case of massive election
fraud, he hopes people will come out into the streets the way they
did for months after Milosevic refused to acknowledge opposition
victories in the 1996 local elections. But even Kostunica is not
sure that they will.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Foundation here
and a critic of Milosevic and Serb actions in Kosovo, said that
Milosevic won't freely cede power even if everyone voted against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen, I don't know,'' she said. ``It is, however,
important that we do not sit at home on Sept. 24, but go outside
and defend our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kandic is facing troubles of her own, with the Yugoslav army
threatening to bring her to court over articles she wrote
criticizing the behavior of Serbian forces in Kosovo. (She has also
criticized Albanian attacks on Serbs after the war ended.) These
threats to her are part of a skillful effort by the government to
intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters, including the
student movement, Otpor, or Resistance. The message that the
opposition hears is that the government will react with force, if
necessary, against any revolution in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, in addition, mysterious events that create a chill,
like the kidnapping two weeks ago of former Serbian President Ivan
Stambolic, who was Milosevic's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift party coup, Milosevic ousted him in 1987. Although
there have been rumors _ which his wife denies _ that Stambolic was
considering a run for the presidency, Milosevic and the government
forcefully deny any role in the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   These events create an undercurrent of tension quite apart from
Milosevic's political campaign against the opposition, in which he
stresses its support for and ties to the United States and the NATO
countries who bombed Yugoslavia last year. The other night, for
example, a news program on the state television cut from a meeting
between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and opposition
leaders to a close-up of Kostunica, who had not attended, then back
to the meeting, giving the false impression that he, too, had been
at the feet of Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Zanetic, the marketing expert, thinks the government is better
than the opposition at propaganda and political marketing,
understanding that most Serbs get their information from
television. ``In politics here, it doesn't matter if you tell the
truth or lie _ you must be clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, if Milosevic claims victory, he is likely to also
declare a landslide. And then one may better see where the new
balance lies between democracy and authoritarianism.

   Josephina Finamore, an 18-year-old sophomore from Wilmington,
Del., thinks she has done a good job of making her small dormitory
room at the University of Maryland in College Park feel like home.
When the family's metallic gold Plymouth Voyager was unpacked two
weeks ago, she and her parents unloaded, among other things: a
computer, two suitcases of clothes, a box of sweaters, a plastic
storage bin full of running clothes and a trash bag full of shoes.
She also brought items for the kitchen and bathroom, a CD player,
photo albums, framed pictures and a light brown teddy bear that
sits atop her blue, pink, yellow and green plaid sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore and her roommates share, with others in a suite of
rooms, several televisions, a microwave, a toaster, a large
refrigerator for food and a smaller one reserved for beer. Then
there's the Mardi Gras beads, the book of drinking games and the
cup full of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The days when students would show up at the end of summer with a
trunk, a suitcase or two and a tennis racquet are long gone, say
college administrators. Today, students have become hermit crabs
and simply take everything with them when they move into dorms. The
ideal seems to be as much stuff as it is possible to cram into
their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, college housing administrators say it has become
an increasing challenge to accommodate the computers, bean bag
chairs, stereo systems and futons that students are trying to pack
into dorm rooms that were often built to hold two suitcases and a
trunk. Meanwhile, from Pearson Hall at the University of Miami to
the Oxford House at the University of Michigan, parents say they
will need time to recover from helping their children move in.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys by the Association of College and
University Housing Officers International, based in Columbus, Ohio,
students are bringing more than ever to campus. In many cases, they
are trying to pack a U-Haul's worth of effects into half of a
12-by-15 room.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, administrators say, students began bringing
electric typewriters to school. Later in the decade, small
television sets and stereo systems began to appear. These days, as
consumer electronics are increasingly seen by students as academic
and social necessities, everything from CD players, bubble jet
printers and computers to portable DVDs, large-screen televisions
and electronic keyboards are finding their way into dorms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the introduction of computers into classrooms and
Ethernet network connections in dorm rooms have made personal
computers (and 24-hour access to e-mail and AOL Instant Messenger)
the norm in college dorms, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Michael DeMayo, a sophomore at the University of Miami, brought
so much stuff this year that he uses a loft bed, which allows him
to sleep up high and store lots of stuff under his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people who have made their dorm rooms into
mini-nightclubs,'' he said. ``They brought Christmas lights to put
around their windows, strobe lights, black lights, disco balls,
lava lamps.'' One person, he said, brought at 20-gallon fish tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the other stuff, it's sometimes hard to remember to
bring notebooks for class,'' acknowledged one of Finamore's
roommates, Emily Dammeyer, who brought an equally impressive
collection of items to school with her.
</P>
<P>
   Allan J. Levy, an assistant housing director at the University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which has not built a new dorm since
1968, says the fact that students are loading more into their rooms
has caused a ``storage nightmare'' and that the vogue for
electronics has created a significantly increased risk of fire.
Moving in or out, which might have taken half an hour 25 years ago,
can now take hours, he said. So great has the increase in baggage
volume been over the years that the university has been forced to
raise the number of days it allots for student moving to five. It
was two in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, said Levy, who attended the university from
1970 to 1974, while technology may have created this problem, it
seems to be solving it. ``I guess the saving grace is that certain
parts of electronics are getting smaller rather than larger.''

THE MINISKIRT AS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

   They have been under siege for quite some time. This summer in
Swaziland, they were identified as a reason for the spread of AIDS
and banned from schools. In the past, they have been eliminated
from government offices by the likes of former Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin of Russia, who saw them as signs of Western
influence, and purged by Idi Amin in Uganda. In 1967, the legendary
designer Edith Head, who felt they lacked elegance, banned them
from the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   They are miniskirts, and they are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so dangerous that Congo's president, Laurent Kabila,
made it his first act to get rid of miniskirts when he overthrew
the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Why do politicians turn their attention away from the oppressed
and focus instead on the underdressed? And how does a brief bit of
fabric cause so much consternation?
</P>
<P>
   The scapegoating of the miniskirt serves as a reminder that when
fashion rules, actual rulers get nervous. The idea that the right
uniform can convey a world view or allegiance has always inspired
social snobs, awards show consultants and armies. But the notion
that the enemy can be identified by his clothes is an especially
comforting one in the realm of politics, since it's a lot easier to
get people to change their clothes than to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   In the political world, costumes get taken quite literally, as
if life were a Victorian melodrama in which villains wear black and
heroes wear white, with no attempts at disguise. And everyday
clothing poses an even greater danger than theatrical or military
costume. Political leaders see fashion as a second language that
can be spoken by just about anyone. So they try to crack its codes,
monitor its messages and cultivate its secrets for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the political spectrum from the mini, the
most widely persecuted piece of cloth these days is the Islamic
head scarf. For some, covered hair can be as scandalous as naked
legs. Last year, the Turkish Parliament shocked many Westerners by
ejecting a legislator for wearing a traditional hijab to her
swearing-in ceremony. To outsiders, the scarf seemed like a bid for
religious freedom. But to the fiercely secular Turks, the scarf
spoke to a history of oppression, and wearing it to work in
Parliament would probably be like showing up in the U.S. Senate in
Confederate flag earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Regimes that scapegoat clothing give new meaning to the concept
of the fashion victim. In 1994, 20 Muslim girls were expelled from
schools in France for wearing head scarves.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan this July, a visiting group of Pakistani soccer
players had their heads shaved in public as punishment for wearing
shorts instead of long pants.
</P>
<P>
   In Swaziland, it was not only the skirts but the schoolgirls in
them who were blamed for behaving seductively around their
teachers. The Swaziland government had first attempted to get rid
of miniskirts in 1969, but had trouble enforcing the law. Now, AIDS
has been used to justify the directive. So it is that a tiny
African nation can blame a tiny skirt for an international health
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since fashion itself can seem unscientific, those who would
create or reform fashions often deploy science. Even Oscar Wilde,
often thought of as a whimsical dresser, argued that fashion ought
to be grounded in serious, objective principles. ``The right laws
of dress,'' Wilde wrote in support of Victorian dress reform, ``are
dictated . . . by science and not by fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reformers who recently persuaded the Iranian
government that girls should be permitted to wear pastels in
addition to dark colors had to give reasons relating to the girls'
physical and mental health. They cited, for example, the threat of
osteoporosis from Vitamin D deficiencies caused by
sunlight-blocking black chadors.
</P>
<P>
   And in France, hygiene is given as the reason for an intriguing
swimming-pool dress code: men must wear skin-tight Speedos rather
than baggy swimming trunks to swim in most public pools. While this
may seem like a Continental fashion preference, like bathing
topless, or possibly the result of some chic French bureaucrat's
disdain for American-style boxers, it is explained as an issue of
cleanliness. The logic goes: longer bathing suits can pass for
shorts, may be worn in potentially unclean public areas and so
could be trailing dirt or germs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone shocked by the arbitrary, dictatorial bans of skirts that
are too short or bathing suits that are too long must consider the
alternative _ legislating the leg. What if knees were subjected to
a democratic vote? This summer, the Bermuda Parliament voted itself
the right to come to work in Bermuda shorts. Luckily the shorts are
a symbol of national pride and so avoided getting vetoed in the
backlash against casual Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent poll, the number of U.S. companies that
allow casual dress, which had risen steadily to 97 percent in 1998,
declined this year for the first time since 1992, to 87 percent.
Anyone made too lazy by casual dress codes can now look forward to
``Dress Up Thursdays,'' a plot to sell men's suits.
</P>
<P>
   Even in America, where dressing outrageously seems a natural
right, there are those who believe you are what you wear _ notably
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, known both for writing that
provocative dressing may lead to sexual harassment (Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson) and for adding four stripes of gold braid to the
arms of his robe for a more magisterial look.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, the politics of fashion have
gotten ugly. First, Vice President Al Gore's critics accused him of
getting a fashion makeover. The vice president had a problem. It
looked as if Gov. George W. Bush would easily outdress him. Even
Bush's clothes have presidential lineage: not only does W. look
great in custom-made suits, he uses the same tailor who dressed
Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Gore slipped up and wore a single earth tone,
commentators would say he wasn't his own man, which is a shame
because earth tones are some of the vice president's best colors.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Democratic convention, the fashion crisis was
averted. In the opening-night video, world leaders kept extolling
President Clinton, while Clinton kept wearing a tuxedo, radiating
elegance and national prosperity. Then Gore showed up, dressed in
red, white and blue. Dressing like a flag has always been a key to
winning national elections. And saying you're your own man while
wrapped in the colors of the flag _ it doesn't get much better than
that.

topless, or possibly the result of some chic French bureaucrat's
disdain for American-style boxers, it is explained as an issue of
cleanliness. The logic goes: longer bathing suits can pass for
shorts, may be worn in potentially unclean public areas and so
could be trailing dirt or germs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone shocked by the arbitrary, dictatorial bans of skirts that
are too short or bathing suits that are too long must consider the
alternative _ legislating the leg. What if knees were subjected to
a democratic vote? This summer, the Bermuda Parliament voted itself
the right to come to work in Bermuda shorts. Luckily the shorts are
a symbol of national pride and so avoided getting vetoed in the
backlash against casual Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent poll, the number of U.S. companies that
allow casual dress, which had risen steadily to 97 percent in 1998,
declined this year for the first time since 1992, to 87 percent.
Anyone made too lazy by casual dress codes can now look forward to
``Dress Up Thursdays,'' a plot to sell men's suits.
</P>
<P>
   Even in America, where dressing outrageously seems a natural
right, there are those who believe you are what you wear _ notably
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, known both for writing that
provocative dressing may lead to sexual harassment (Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson) and for adding four stripes of gold braid to the
arms of his robe for a more magisterial look.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, the politics of fashion have
gotten ugly. First, Vice President Al Gore's critics accused him of
getting a fashion makeover. The vice president had a problem. It
looked as if Gov. George W. Bush would easily outdress him. Even
Bush's clothes have presidential lineage: not only does W. look
great in custom-made suits, he uses the same tailor who dressed
Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Gore slipped up and wore a single earth tone,
commentators would say he wasn't his own man, which is a shame
because earth tones are some of the vice president's best colors.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Democratic convention, the fashion crisis was
averted. In the opening-night video, world leaders kept extolling
President Clinton, while Clinton kept wearing a tuxedo, radiating
elegance and national prosperity. Then Gore showed up, dressed in
red, white and blue. Dressing like a flag has always been a key to
winning national elections. And saying you're your own man while
wrapped in the colors of the flag _ it doesn't get much better than
that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been writing newspaper articles for four decades.
Broadcasting has never tempted me, except for bit parts on such
sober outlets as C-SPAN. So what was I doing with an invitation to
appear on the ``Late Show With David Letterman''? And seriously
thinking about doing it, before saying, ``no, thanks''?
</P>
<P>
   I am used to being around big news. Checking out the posters in
Red Square when Nikita Khrushchev was ousted. Sitting with Lyndon
B. Johnson (and his dogs) when he congratulated Sen. Mike Mansfield
on the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Standing on the White House lawn
when Richard M. Nixon quit. Elections, trials, Supreme Court
confirmations.
</P>
<P>
   But being the story is different from observing it. And last
week, I seemed to be the story.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gov. George W. Bush spotted me at a rally in
Naperville, Ill. Not realizing the microphones were working, he
told his running mate, Dick Cheney, that I was a ``major-league
((expletive)).''
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the first time I have been attacked, though it
was the first time the attack accorded me ``major league'' status.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that I never made the Nixon enemies list; a deputy
press secretary to whom I complained said all that proved was that
he had nothing to do with compiling it.
</P>
<P>
   But after Vietnamese and Chinese students beat me up in Moscow
to cap a demonstration against the U.S. bombing of Vietnam, the
Soviet government expelled me as a ``hooligan.'' A deputy of
Sheriff Jim Clark in Selma, Ala., once slugged me (because of an
embarrassing article that Jack Nelson of The Los Angeles Times had
written; I hardly resemble Nelson, but maybe all newspaper
reporters look alike to racists). The Washington Times has called
me unpatriotic, and some people at The Weekly Standard have
attacked me in print, too.
</P>
<P>
   But those attacks all came from the ideological fringes, and
nobody took them seriously. Maybe Bush is entitled to more
credence. After all, I sometimes vote for his party's candidates,
as I sometimes vote for Democrats. He cares about education and
wants his party to attract African-Americans and Hispanics. Sure,
he is not as centrist as he tries to portray himself, but then what
politician is? (The pre-nomination Joseph Lieberman, maybe.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Bush is no right-wing nut, so shrugging his remark
off as the sound of an extremist was hardly the proper response.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there was only a moment to think of a response when a
pack of reporters descended. One smart-aleck answer occurred to me.
Since we were not too far from Wrigley Field, I thought of saying
something like, ``At least I didn't trade Sammy Sosa,'' a riposte
that would have dealt with Bush's own major-league experience as
boss of the Texas Rangers. But I rejected that and said simply, ``I
was disappointed with the governor's language.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked what he had against me, I suggested they
ask him. He was not saying anything, except, ``I regret that a
private comment I made to the vice-presidential candidate made it
to the public airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, I tried to fade into the background, which is how
newspaper reporters try to work, as much as you can around a
presidential campaign that has dozens of photographers and
television cameramen following every move. I was in Illinois to
cover Cheney, and when we walked to an El entrance where he would
be photographed taking a train, the lenses were on me, not him.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly my voice mail at the office was full. It was Labor Day,
and I seemed to be the news flavor of the day. Radio stations in
Phoenix and Scotland, Seattle and Australia, the BBC and a sports
network said they needed me to fulfill their commitments to
informing their listeners and viewers. Among those calling were
``Good Morning America,'' CBS's ``Early Show'' and CNN's ``Larry
King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   I had plenty of time to listen to the messages because Cheney,
anxious to avoid the storm Bush had stirred up, did not want to
talk on the record to the reporters traveling with him. So I could
not ask the question I had traveled to ask, about why he gave only
1 percent of his income to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the phone calls were either invitations to speak,
which I ducked, or encouraging, even envious, messages from
friends. ``Can I have your autograph?'' asked one New York Times
colleague. ``We're so proud of you,'' said a Democratic friend in
Austin, Texas. Republican friends chimed in, too, to insist that
their party was no monolith on the subject of Adam Clymer. But
e-mail was a different matter. A right-wing Web site posted my
e-mail address and urged its army to charge, so about 300 hostile
messages flooded in and choked the system.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I went back out with Cheney, and he discussed and
defended his contributions. On a flight to Allentown, Pa., he said
he should be given credit not just for direct donations but also
for corporate matching gifts and speaking without charge to
nonprofit groups. Television viewers might have expected glares,
and at least some reference to the events they were being shown
over and over, which included his loyal agreement with Bush.
Instead I asked questions, some of which he seemed to dislike, and
he answered them as he chose. Not buddy-buddy, but strictly
professional.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney entourage caught up with Bush, so his
vice-presidential candidate could introduce him in Allentown,
Bethlehem and Scranton. Every time we stopped near a television
set, some cable channel was showing the clip of Bush muttering
about me to Cheney and then pondering its impact on his campaign
and the future of Western civilization.

   By Wednesday the e-mail flood was drying up, although I was
asked to endorse a T-shirt memorializing his comment, and someone
else sent a message saying that an Internet site for my fans was
being created.
</P>
<P>
   I was back in the office, and colleagues asked if Bush had
apologized to me. I had not heard from him, or from his aides, who
were busy telling reporters I had been mean to him when I reported
in April that ``Texas has had one of the nation's worst public
health records for decades,'' and that Bush had not made much of an
effort to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   I was actually proud of that article _ which got immensely
renewed readership last week as people tried to figure out what
exactly was bugging the governor. But if Bush did not like it, hey,
it's a free country. After all, if newspaper reporters wanted to be
loved by their customers, we could drive Good Humor trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reporters aren't immune from talking into an open
mike, either. About 18 months ago, I was editing an article
describing how hard Bush was working to study national issues. With
feeble gallows humor, I suggested that perhaps he needed the
tutorials more than others. But while my comparable slurs of
President Clinton, to cite one prominent example, stayed private, a
spectacular typesetting blunder got my wisecrack printed. Through
an Editors' Note, The New York Times apologized, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Now maybe Vice President Al Gore, whose aides seem delighted by
this business, could do me a favor and make some comparable
stumble. Then I could get back to covering the campaign instead of
being part of it.

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK-EURO (Vejle, Denmark) _ With its fat cows and flaky
pastries, its neat streets and nice queen, this pampered little
land seems as foreign to angst as any country could be. But
appearances deceive, for Denmark has an acute case of the identity
crisis now afflicting several European states. The disquiet has
been brought on by a referendum on Sept. 28, when Danes will be
asked whether they wish to preserve the krone or follow 12 other
states of the 15-member European Union in abandoning their money
for a shared currency, the euro. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-REFUGEES (Cartagena, Colombia) _ An estimated 2 million
Colombians have been uprooted in recent years. That is more than
were sent fleeing by the war in Kosovo last year. In fact, of all
the countries of the world suffering from the miseries of war, only
Sudan and Angola have more displaced people. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-KOSHER-CONTROVERSY (Jerusalem) _ Rabbi Shlomo Shmulevitz
is director of the commandments related to the Land of Israel for
the Jerusalem rabbinate. This is not a good time to ask him how he
is doing. ``Oy vey,'' he said. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-JUSTICE (Chengde, China) _ Their voices cracking with
outrage, the parents chronicled four years of fear and frustration
as they battle to keep their four sons from being executed for the
alleged robbery and killing of two taxi drivers six years ago. It
is a tale that illustrates the pitfalls of China's criminal justice
system and highlights the sometimes capricious imposition of the
death sentence. These particular defendants have so far escaped
execution only because their families _ all farmers and workers _
were willing to bear official persecution and severe financial
strains to mount repeated legal appeals. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINE-KIDNAP (Bangkok, Thailand) _ More than four months
after 21 people were seized in their beach clothes from a remote
diving resort, the last four Westerners were freed Saturday from
the jungle by Muslim rebel kidnappers. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NICARAGUA-LAND (Nagarote, Nicaragua) _ More than a decade after
the elections that removed the Sandinistas from power, thousands of
Nicaraguans _ as well as about 900 American citizens _ are
grappling with the legacy of the Sandinista Revolution: confiscated
land, homes and businesses that were distributed to peasants and
party loyalists. While few people expected to get back all they
owned, even skeptics decried what they described as convoluted,
lengthy administrative and legal processes that too often result in
paltry settlements paid in low-value government bonds. By David
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ (Caracas, Venezuela) _ With his control of the
Venezuelan government assured in a landslide election five weeks
ago, President Hugo Chavez is now moving to replace independent
civic and labor groups with equivalents under the control of the
``revolutionary'' movement he leads. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-TERRORISM (Pretoria, South Africa) _ South Africa's
minister of justice, incensed by the assassination this week of a
judge who has presided over an important terrorism trial in Cape
Town, has said he will ban the organization suspected in the
slaying if the group continues what authorities say is a two-year
campaign of bombings and terror. By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-FAMILIES (Undated) _ When Vice President Al Gore
incorporated ``working families'' into his rhetoric last month and
``hard-working middle-class families'' this month as pivotal
campaign phrases, he pointed a finger at a central fact of American
life: most of the nation's 72 million families feel they cannot
make ends meet. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-SCHOOLS (Philadelphia) _ This city's deeply troubled
public schools reopened in a state of uncertainty as the teachers
union authorized a strike in the face of a powerful new
bargaining-table coalition of state and city political leaders
determined to overhaul the system. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PA-SWING-STATE (Scranton, Pa.) _ Pennsylvania is one of the
handful of states where the presidential race of 2000 will be
decided. It casts 23 electoral votes, more than any other closely
contested state. So when public and private polls suggested the
start of a slide toward Al Gore, George W. Bush stormed in to try
to halt the slide, and the vice president arrived to try to keep
the momentum going. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ADS-STRATEGY (Washington) _ A fundamental predicament is
facing the Bush organization as it heads into an intense eight
weeks of advertising. Campaign officials have concluded that they
have no choice but to run advertisements attacking Al Gore. But how
do they go negative without making the commercials appear too
harsh? It is more of a challenge for George W. Bush than for Gore
because the Texas governor had vowed to run a campaign on a
positive note. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MINN-SENATE-RACE (St. Paul, Minn.) _ When the Democratic Party
looked for congressional seats it could pick up in the November
elections, the one held by Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota was high on
the list. But the Democrats have been unable to unify around any of
their four major candidates. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   ALA-SELMA-ELECTION (Selma, Ala.) _ After 35 years, Mayor Joseph
T. Smitherman's high-wire act above the city's churning racial
politics had begun to settle into routine. Every four years, he
would hold barbecues in black neighborhoods, boasting about the
number of black department heads he had appointed, while reminding
white voters that he would be ``the last white mayor of Selma,''
hinting that the racial deluge was around the corner. But this
year, Smitherman has found himself in the fight of his life, forced
for the first time into a runoff election _ on Tuesday _ against a
black candidate, and the hints have become a bit less subtle. By
David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Arizona GOP race rife with dirty
tricks; Prayers are answered if only symbolically; The same old
song with a different beat; Nasty divorce battle finds home in
politics; A Nader supporter voices second thoughts. By B. Drummond
Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ Cushioned by a burgeoning surplus,
Congress is poised to approve large increases in spending by
federal agencies, pushing the national budget to record levels. By
Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   FTC-VIOLENCE-REPORT (Washington) _ The Federal Trade Commission
plans to release a report on Monday that harshly criticizes the
film, recording and video game industries for marketing violent,
adult-rated entertainment to young people, said several officials
familiar with the report. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;  (Moving in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Shelton, Conn.) _ Cheney MIA on W. vote. By Maureen
Dowd.
</P>

   One Debate Down. Three to Go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over. Let the debates begin.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the week, the Bush and Gore campaigns sparred over
where and how _ or even whether _ the presidential debates would
occur this year. The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates,
which has been running the forums since 1988, had issued
invitations to Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to
three debates on college campuses in October.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, Bush issued a debate plan of his own that
included only one 90-minute commission debate and added 60-minute
showdowns on ``Meet the Press'' and ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, with Democrats accusing Bush of wanting to
duck the wider television audiences commanded by the commission
debates _ and Republicans increasingly worried that voters might be
seeing it that way, too _ Bush withdrew his plan. This week, aides
to both candidates are to meet in Washington with the commission to
negotiate a final deal that guarantees a series of forums.
</P>
<P>
   All the talk about talking was the dominant story of the first
week of campaigning after Labor Day, traditionally the kickoff of
the final leg of the election. It easily overshadowed the
governor's announcement of the details of his prescription drug
proposal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $198 billion overhaul of Medicare would encourage the
elderly to pick subsidized private insurance plans that had
prescription drug coverage. Gore, who previously unveiled his own
$253 billion plan, said Bush's subsidies were not sufficient for
older people.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore still in the throes of a post-convention surge, Bush's
advisers unveiled a retooled strategy and message, focused on a new
theme: ``Real plans for real people.'' The idea is to get Bush
mixing more with ``real people'' at town hall meetings and in
workplace chats.
</P>
<P>
   If It Moves, Impale It &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is struggling with all sorts of technological
challenges _ from designing a national missile defense that works
to perfecting new aircraft like the F-22. But its most embarrassing
technological failure these days is popping up right outside its
front door.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a heavy steel security barricade misfired, striking
a car carrying Germany's defense minister, Rudolf Scharping,
moments before a full-dress honors ceremony on the Pentagon's
steps.
</P>
<P>
   The freak accident wrecked the car, slightly injured Scharping,
the German defense attache and a U.S. security guard, and left
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who rushed to Scharping's aid,
fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Only it was no freak accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the same barricade sprang up beneath the car of
Japan's defense minister, Fukushiro Nukaga, injuring him and five
others. In 1995, another gate struck a car carrying then-Defense
Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the system, built in the early 1990s to keep
terrorists out, has a sentry's worst nightmare built in. It has
difficulty distinguishing between friend and foe.
</P>
<P>
   What made last week's accident even more infuriating was that
the Pentagon believed it had fixed the problem by replacing manual
switches with electronic controls meant to keep the barricades open
long enough for motorcades to pass through. (The redesigned
barricade struck a car carrying Chinese military officers last
January, but officials blamed tailgating and insisted the system
worked.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon vowed to conduct a new investigation into what is
being called ``Gategate.'' Asked if human error, not technology,
was to blame, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said
simply, ``I don't think we fully understand yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gigantic Gathering Of World Leaders
</P>
<P>
   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called it ``a
remarkable convergence of views.'' When about 150 government
leaders representing a large majority of the world's nations ended
their first no-frills working summit on Friday night, there was not
much disagreement over the lopsided effects of the global economy.
That was the easy part. Now, what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders made lofty pledges in a declaration. That and three
days of speeches won't solve the problem, but behind the scenes,
there was an innovation. Leaders broke into groups that mixed rich
and poor, North and South, East and West, to thrash out ideas. The
White House said there was even a moment when President Clinton and
Fidel Castro exchanged a handshake and innocuous chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, who led one
millennial roundtable, called it the organization's first
``interactive dialogue among leaders'' and suggested that the
United Nations not wait a thousand years to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's Tough Week
</P>
<P>
   Even as it confronted lawsuits, congressional hearings and
public anger over its defective tires, Bridgestone/Firestone got
one piece of good news. The Japanese-owned tire maker reached a
settlement with the United Steelworkers of America, avoiding a
strike by 8,000 workers. Eager to avert a strike during its current
crisis, Bridgestone gave most workers raises of at least 15 percent
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still the crisis built, as hearings on Capitol Hill led to a
release of documents indicating that the tire company and perhaps
Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was
announced in August, and statistics from a widely used federal
database showed that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were
almost three times as likely to be tire-related as fatal crashes
involving other sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, Firestone and federal safety regulators said they had not
recognized such a pattern in the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Glacial School Improvement
</P>
<P>
   A study showed that if American eighth-graders continued to
improve their basic math skills at the pace they have since 1973,
it would take 125 years for them to catch up with their peers in
Singapore _ assuming those students don't raise their own scores.
The study, by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the
standardized tests known as the nation's report card), showed that
while scores on a new test emphasizing problem-solving and geometry
have risen steadily throughout the 1990s, performance on a test
stressing arithmetic has improved only slightly, and reading scores
have been practically flat since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   An Upset in Lebanon  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's government, handpicked by Syria's new leader, Bashar  &QL; 
Assad, took a trouncing as a former prime minister, the billionaire
builder Rafik Hariri, swept to an overwhelming victory in
parliamentary elections. It was a bitter blow for President Emile
Lahoud, whom Assad, son of Syria's late ruler, Hafez Assad, put in
power in 1988 during his apprenticeship.

   Fish Weds Bicycle
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it seems, a fish really does need a bicycle. The
feminist Gloria Steinem, 66, and David Bale, 61, a businessman and
political activist, were married in Oklahoma. It was the first time
for her, the third for him and was a spontaneous decision taken
while the two were at a spiritual retreat. ``Honestly, she is as
stunned as we all are,'' Suzanne Braun Levine, a former writer for
Ms. magazine, said.

<P>
   A Rebuke for Haiti
</P>
<P>
   Rather than revive Haiti's political fortunes and unblock
hundreds of millions of dollars in desperately needed foreign aid,
the swearing-in of a new Parliament has accomplished the opposite:
the United States announced it will scrutinize any further foreign
aid and withhold millions of dollars in assistance for November's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acted because they and other international donors
could not persuade the Haitian government to recalculate the
results of the May 21 legislative elections, in which international
observers said 10 of the 18 senate seats won by the party of former
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide should have gone to a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   A New Concorde Clue
</P>
<P>
   Could the culprit behind the fiery crash of the Air France
Concorde in July be a slender 17-inch-long piece of metal that fell
off a Continental Airlines DC-10? French investigators said a metal
strip they found among the debris from the Concorde appeared to
match the description of a piece missing from a DC-10 that had
taken off only minutes before on the same runway. Investigators
believe the strip gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge
chunks of rubber to smash through the Concorde's fuel tanks and
triggering a fire.
</P>
<P>
   A Gambler Loses
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans who play slot machines understand that if
you keep playing you will eventually lose. The machines are
programmed that way. In a case decided in U.S. Tax Court, the IRS
stipulated that William T. Praytor of Fairhope, Ala., was in the
``trade or profession'' of slot machine gambler even though the tax
returns that Praytor and his wife filed bore out the inexorable
mathematics of one-armed bandits: Praytor had won $318,750 from
1994 through 1996 and lost $392,763. But when he tried to deduct
his $74,000 in losses plus $23,000 in interest on gambling markers,
he lost again. Judge Lewis R. Carluzzo ruled that professional
gamblers can deduct losses and gambling expenses only until their
winnings reach zero. He ordered the Praytors to pay $25,000.

<P>
   A Tragedy Is Remembered
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting a World War II tragedy, 70 relatives and friends
gathered on the Black Sea to honor 778 people who died when a
Russian submarine, for reasons unknown, sank a defenseless steamer
carrying Jews fleeing Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners recited prayers and cast flowers on the spot where
divers think the Struma was sunk on Feb. 24, 1942. The ship's
engine failed early in the voyage and its passengers spent 70 days
on the ship in Istanbul while Turkish authorities tried to persuade
the British, who controlled Palestine, to let them continue to
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain refused, the ship was set adrift on the Black Sea,
where it was sunk for unexplained reasons.

<P>
   When Michael Robertson emerged last week from a New York court,
pale beneath his California tan, the chief executive of the MP3.com
online music service told reporters that consumers want to be able
to listen to their music from wherever they are. That MP3.com's
technology allows them to do that. And that the law shouldn't get
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Robertson, a federal judge had just ruled that
his San Diego-based start-up must pay Universal Music Group up to
$250 million for infringing its copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large legal irony here. MP3.com may be thoroughly
punished (the company is appealing the ruling), even though it has
tried to ensure that people pay for copies of the music they want
to listen to, said Pamela Samuelson, co-director of the University
of California's Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. By
contrast, Napster, another high-profile Internet music company
being sued by the major record labels, has so far eluded any legal
sanction for its activities, even though it exists to give people
free access to the same music.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3.com verdict seems to underscore a mismatch between the
intentions of traditional copyright law _ to strike a balance
between the rights of owners and the interests of users _ and its
effect in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   As books and movies follow music from the physical to the
digital realm, some legal experts argue that a new balance must be
struck between copyright holders and the users of their works if
copyright is to continue to drive economic and creative
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these cases and others like them get sorted out, we will
learn to what extent copyright law is being interpreted to give the
owners of content an indirect monopoly over the development of
useful consumer information technologies,'' said Peter Jaszi, a law
professor at American University. ``That's really the stake in both
of these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   For those just tuning into the digital music drama, Napster is a
San Mateo, Calif.-based company whose software allows users to
quickly find music files on the Internet and copy them to their own
digital collection, without regard to copyright. Millions use the
service daily.
</P>
<P>
   My.MP3.com, the MP3.com service at issue in the company's court
battle with Universal, took a very different approach, one that
Judge Jed S. Rakoff commended in contrast to what he called, in an
apparent reference to Napster, ``the kind of lawless piracy
seemingly characteristic of some others operating in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   My.MP3.com lets people listen to music they already own, but
without carrying their CDs with them. All they need to do is log
onto MP3.com's Web site from any Internet-connected device.
</P>
<P>
   The service works by verifying ownership of every music CD a
user inserts into the CD-ROM drive of his computer. A copy is then
made from MP3.com's database of CDs and deposited into the user's
online locker. A user could also buy a CD from an online retailer,
which records the transaction with MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff found, however, that it was illegal for the company to
copy tens of thousands of CDs into its database, and most legal
experts agree that, under the letter of the law, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a recent federal judge's order that would also have
shut down Napster was stayed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, and some legal analysts, Samuelson and Jaszi among them,
think Napster has a better chance of winning its battle with the
major record labels than MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Napster argues that, since users of the service aren't buying or
selling the music they listen to, no one is infringing anyone's
copyright. Therefore the company cannot be liable. In its appeals
brief, the company cites the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act, which
the same appeals court found in a previous case protects all
noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog music
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The brief states: ``The line Congress drew was between
commercial and noncommercial copying. If Plaintiffs have a quarrel
with that line given the scale of noncommercial sharing that the
Internet now facilitates, they must address those concerns to
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts and business executives suggest that the
eventual outcome of the two cases may well provoke Congress to
adjust the law to fit the realities of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, the current system is seen as an obstacle by
Internet music entrepreneurs. Doug Camplejohn, the chief executive
of Myplay, a competitor of MP3.com, said the license terms now
being offered by the record companies are not economically viable
without charging consumers a subscription fee to get access to
music they already own. For that reason, Myplay's 2 million users
will continue to laboriously copy and upload their own CD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole set of services that will grow the entire
record industry as well as make opportunities for companies like
ours that we are not able to do today because the law prevents
us,'' Camplejohn said. ``The consumers are ultimately the ones who
end up suffering.''

   When Michael Robertson emerged last week from a New York court,
pale beneath his California tan, the chief executive of the MP3.com
online music service told reporters that consumers want to be able
to listen to their music from wherever they are. That MP3.com's
technology allows them to do that. And that the law shouldn't get
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Robertson, a federal judge had just ruled that
his San Diego-based start-up must pay Universal Music Group up to
$250 million for infringing its copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large legal irony here. MP3.com may be thoroughly
punished (the company is appealing the ruling), even though it has
tried to ensure that people pay for copies of the music they want
to listen to, said Pamela Samuelson, co-director of the University
of California's Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. By
contrast, Napster, another high-profile Internet music company
being sued by the major record labels, has so far eluded any legal
sanction for its activities, even though it exists to give people
free access to the same music.

   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore outlined his economic
vision for America in a speech in Cleveland last week, he did not
even mention health policy. That was quite a change from 1992, when
controlling health costs and providing health insurance for all
Americans was one of the driving forces of the Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the prevailing view was that the rising cost of health
care and the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance
posed a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement
over how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and
should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, in an era of unrivaled prosperity, when
Americans express complete confidence in their ability to handle
most economic concerns, the authorities and the public have begun
to doubt whether costs for the best medical care can ever be
contained, or whether a practical way exists to provide insurance
for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, health costs have risen much faster than the
overall rate of inflation or workers' wages. And the only main
economic indicator that has actually worsened during the Clinton
years is the number of Americans without medical insurance. A study
last spring by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 44
million people, or 18.4 percent of the population, had no insurance
in 1998, the last year for which figures were available, up from 38
million people, or 17.5 percent, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The case seems to be that what is economically rational is
politically unacceptable. And what is politically possible does not
fit with economic realities. People demand the finest doctors,
state-of-the-art technology and expensive drugs, no strings
attached. But neither they nor their political representatives are
willing to pay the price this would entail.
</P>
<P>
   For a time it was thought that health maintenance organizations
were the silver bullet. But the public rebelled against the
restrictions they imposed. And once the cost of premiums began to
rise, companies began dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The political turning point, of course, was the collapse of the
mammoth health plan President Clinton offered in 1994. The plan,
grounded in large part on HMOs, was too complicated and ambitious,
and fell victim to opposition from the insurance industry and
Republicans. It was the worst legislative defeat of the Clinton
presidency, and it contributed to the Democrats' loss of control of
Congress in the 1994 elections. ``The political fallout from this
debacle was staggering,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the
Brookings Institution who has advised Democratic politicians on
health policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is obviously gun-shy from that defeat. The book-length
manifesto he put out with his policy speech in Cleveland last week
addresses his health proposals in passing on Page 118 _ including
an ambitious and expensive promise to guarantee all children health
insurance by 2005. But this was not one of the vice president's top
10 goals _ like encouraging home-ownership or expanding access to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would just as soon skip the issue
of health care and avoid further scrutiny of the record in Texas.
Thirty-seven percent of low-income children there are uninsured
(only Arizona does worse), and a federal judge ruled last month
that the state had failed to abide by a 1996 court order to provide
appropriate health care for more than 1.5 million children eligible
for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion on health policy has clearly changed, as well.
``In the last eight years,'' said Robert J. Blendon, an authority
at Harvard on health and public opinion, ``people got scared away
from big solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Blendon said, most people said they would accept a big
tax increase in order to guarantee health insurance for all. Now,
he said, two-thirds of Americans tell pollsters they would like a
government program to make sure people have insurance, but fewer
than 40 percent favor a sweeping measure that would require higher
taxes. And many people, Blendon said, are afraid that the
government might make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   The one health issue that has been joined in the campaign,
prescription drug coverage for the elderly, was hardly discussed
eight years ago. Since then, however, drug prices have risen by as
much as 15 percent a year. Last week, Bush laid out his plan for
subsidies that he said would allow the elderly to buy private
insurance to cover drugs. Gore would give the elderly drug coverage
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, health maintenance organizations seemed to offer a
solution to the health care dilemma. Companies would pay a flat fee
per employee; workers could see only the doctors in their
particular plan; and primary-care physicians decided what treatment
was permitted. In turn, they were rewarded for holding down costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Supreme Court decision in June upholding a health plan's
right to give doctors a financial incentive to hold down costs,
Justice David H. Souter used blunt words to describe the
fundamental principle behind HMOs: ``treatment rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs seemed to work for a time. The rise in health costs slowed.
But the public began to complain about all the rules limiting the
services they could receive _ about the rationing. Eventually,
those complaints grew so widespread that politicians began debating
what they called a patients' bill of rights.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the costs began to rise again. Last week, the Kaiser
Foundation reported that between the spring of 1999 and the spring
of 2000, monthly premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance
rose by 8.3 percent, a full 5 percentage points more than the
overall national inflation rate and 4 points more than the rise in
workers' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in increasing numbers, companies are abandoning HMOs for
preferred provider organizations _ doctor networks that agree to
reduced rates for their services. They don't have the expensive
approval-referral bureaucracy of HMOs, and they offer a wider range
of doctors and relaxed rules about the availability of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no particular reason to believe that over the long
run PPOs can offer people the care they want at an acceptable cost.
``Don't be surprised if this bubble pops too,'' said Robert D.
Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, who is one of the
foremost authorities in Washington on government health policy.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem with controlling health care costs is that
conventional economic principles do not fully apply. Employers want
to keep the cost of insurance down to protect their profits.
Doctors and hospitals will not perform services at a loss. Drug and
insurance companies want the largest profits possible for their
shareholders. The less money people pay out of pocket, the more
expensive treatments they demand.
</P>
<P>
   But market forces do not apply to other aspects. Because most
bills are picked up by insurance, people pay little attention to
the cost of treatment, and they have no way to assess the quality
of medical services they receive. Beyond that, for most people,
good health is priceless; they are willing to pay whatever it takes
for themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the conundrum for politicians. Their constituents
will not accept the rationing of their medical treatment. People do
not want to be told that good health has a price. On the other
hand, neither the politicians nor their constituents want to pay
the higher taxes or higher insurance premiums required for
unlimited health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some day this may be sorted out. But not in this election. The
best guess is that matters will get worse sooner rather than later.
With the tight job market, many employers are simply swallowing the
cost of higher insurance premiums because they cannot risk losing
workers. But when the economy turns the slightest bit sour,
employers will surely force workers to pay more or even cancel
insurance altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What this means politically is uncertain. But for now, the
policy experts and politicians agree, if changes are made, they
will be incremental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely in a transition period,'' said Dr. David A.
Kessler, dean of the Yale Medical School. ``But no one knows where
we are headed.''

hand, neither the politicians nor their constituents want to pay
the higher taxes or higher insurance premiums required for
unlimited health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some day this may be sorted out. But not in this election. The
best guess is that matters will get worse sooner rather than later.
With the tight job market, many employers are simply swallowing the
cost of higher insurance premiums because they cannot risk losing
workers. But when the economy turns the slightest bit sour,
employers will surely force workers to pay more or even cancel
insurance altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What this means politically is uncertain. But for now, the
policy experts and politicians agree, if changes are made, they
will be incremental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely in a transition period,'' said Dr. David A.
Kessler, dean of the Yale Medical School. ``But no one knows where
we are headed.''

<P>
   When several eminent scientists returned recently from a tourist
cruise to the North Pole aboard a Russian icebreaker and reported
finding water, not ice, at the top of the world, the image
resonated far and wide, providing a call to arms for scientists and
environmentalists who for years had been trying to convince
politicians and the public that heat-trapping gases from tail
pipes, power plants, even methane-belching cattle, could disrupt
the climate.
</P>
<P>
   But on second look, things were not nearly so simple. Although
arctic experts said there were many signs of warming, including a
thinning and shrinking of the polar ice cap, there was no way to
link a patch of sun-dappled water at the pole to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of what is happening to climate _ and whether
people or natural forces are to blame _ returned to the realm of
nuanced, statistical fuzziness, where it has been for nearly 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   What a moment to lose potential clarion calls. Hundreds of
negotiators from industrialized countries are to convene this week
in Lyon, France, and again in late November in The Hague to try to
firm up ways to cut emissions of greenhouse gases under a 1997
climate treaty called the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was signed by
the United States and 84 other countries but is in danger of
falling apart because of disagreements over how to make and measure
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Most climate experts are certain that global warming is real and
that it threatens ecology and human prosperity, and a growing
number say it is well under way. But policy-makers, always eager
for black and white, have once again found science offering shades
of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, global warming is a classic example of the persistent
mismatch between the language of science and the needs of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Science operates by steadily chipping away at ideas through
experiments or observations, eventually revealing truths, but often
obliquely _ by eliminating what is not true. The bigger the idea,
the harder it often is to verify with precision. The result is
persistent debate, whether the issue is how to manage forests to
reduce wildfires, how to set limits for chemicals in food to
prevent cancer, or _ in this case _ how to figure out whether
people are dangerously fiddling with the global thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   But before policy-makers can try to sell potentially costly or
difficult solutions, say, taxing fossil fuels, they need to build a
clear and compelling case that strong action is called for.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all of this, according to climate scientists _
some of whom think humanity is already in big trouble _ is that no
one should expect some alarm bell to start ringing to summon
societies to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is subtle and complex, and probably will be so for
a long time to come, said Jerry D. Mahlman, who is retiring as
director of the federal Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in
Princeton, N.J. ``This is going to be incremental forever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those increments continue to add up, he and other climate
experts said. Past climate ups and downs mostly mesh well with
natural variations in the brightness of the sun or the cooling
effect of parasol-like plumes of particles spewed by big volcanoes.
But the recent warming, according to several recent studies, only
correlates well with one thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide,
methane and the other greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Hints that warming is being caused by emissions from industry
and other human activities have been extracted from air bubbles
trapped in ancient ice, from variations in tree rings, from the
quick retreat of alpine glaciers. Thermometers dropped deep in the
ocean and in holes bored in permafrost show warming patterns that
do not match up with natural influences like changes in the sun's
brightness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the subtleties have allowed warming skeptics ample
opportunity to challenge the idea. Some, like Dr. Richard S.
Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, have built durable counterarguments, saying the links
connecting the earth's oceans, air and ``cryosphere,'' its frozen
places, are impossible to elucidate with sufficient confidence to
predict much beyond next week's weather.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lindzen acknowledged the arctic warming trend
and slight global warming measured in the last century, but said it
all is well within the realm of natural variation or measurement
error _ and not yet within our power to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a field that was in a primitive state when it assumed
a policy importance a few years ago,'' Lindzen said. ``Suddenly
we've declared thousands of people in a primitive field as world
experts, and they're trying to have their day.'' And reports last
week that boats had traversed the normally frozen Northwest Passage
and northern rivers and lakes were freezing later and thawing
earlier were countered with the response that this seeming meltdown
could still be ascribed to natural wiggles in temperature or ocean
currents.
</P>
<P>
   But most scientists, including some who work with Lindzen at
MIT, say the balance of data has shifted firmly toward a conclusion
that people, through their impact on the atmosphere, are
influencing climate now and will have even more impact in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, many experts say, if the threat is to be countered,
societies will have to figure out a way to act in the face of gray
uncertainty, to deal aggressively with a problem that lacks the
attributes of a crisis. That is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlman has pretty much given up on that hope, saying that many
countries, including the United States, have essentially decided
that the focus is going to be on painless, low-cost fixes like
growing trees to sop up the most common greenhouse gas, carbon
dioxide, and on adapting to coming warming instead of countering
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to face up to it,'' he said, adding that
people do not want to change their lifestyle or the economy ``for
the sake of avoiding future costs.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others stress that the real challenge with global warming
and similar issues is that, by the time the impact becomes too
clear to debate, it will be far too late to do anything about it.

GOD AND POLITICS: NOTHING NEW UNDER THE AMERICAN SUN

<P>
   The polite disagreement over the proper place of religion in
politics summons us once again to the works of those ever-useful
observers of American life, Alexis de Tocqueville of France and
James Bryce of Britain. Both of their classic studies,
Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' (1835) and Bryce's ``The
American Commonwealth'' (1888) attend the matter in a spirit that
should elicit an amen from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has stirred
the issue anew with his avowal that religious faith supports a
moral foundation for public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The America that the two well-disposed European visitors
described more than a century ago was not quite the idyll of
diversity celebrated today by politicians on all sides. When
Tocqueville reported that the first thing that struck him on his
arrival in the United States was the religious atmosphere, he was
referring strictly to Christianity. This practicing Catholic made a
debatable case that Catholic immigrants were bringing their own
democratic spirit to the religious constellation, concluding _ as
some on the Christian Right still do _ that for Americans ``the
ideas of Christianity and liberty are so completely mingled that it
is almost impossible to get them to conceive of the one without the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce took pains to sort out the differences among mainstream
Protestant denominations, yet emphasized their basic similarity of
beliefs and manners, which he found to be by and large inimitably
American. Although the prospect of a Jewish vice president (or a
Catholic president) did not figure largely in 19th-century
calculations, with just a little adjustment the visitors' religious
inclinations would have had less difficulty in accommodating those
of an observant Jew than those of a cracker-barrel atheist. Today,
Lieberman, who has run into criticism from the nondenominational
Anti-Defamation League, finds himself praised by Christian
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring though both men were of the course of American
democracy, they had their misgivings about unfettered freedom. Both
evinced a concern that the young nation's cherished political
liberty, with its tendencies toward license or excessive
individualism or just plain moral indifference, required some
constraints, some protection of values different from and perhaps
higher than those that seemed to generate a vigorous democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bryce's eloquent admonition: ``All that need be here
said is that a people with comparatively little around it in the
way of historic memories and associations to touch its emotion, a
people whose energy is chiefly absorbed in commerce and the
development of the material resources of its territory, a people
consumed by a feverish activity that gives little opportunity for
reflection or for the contemplation of nature, seems most of all to
need to have its horizon widened, its sense of awe and mystery
touched, by whatever calls it away from the busy world of sight and
sound into the stillness of faith and meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville had already made the point a half century earlier
when he asked how a society could escape destruction if, when
political ties are relaxed by the give and get of democracy, moral
ties are not strengthened. As he put it, what could be done with a
people that is master of itself if it is not subject to God? This
good believer cautioned that ``while the law allows the American
people to do everything, there are things which religion prevents
them from imagining and forbids them to dare.'' On that account, he
praised American-style religion, which he credited with never
intervening directly in the government, as being ``the first of the
nation's political institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville discerned a shakiness in the nature of American
democracy, with its constant change of leaders and legislators and
its openness to political innovation, which demanded the placement
of religion beyond the reach of ``the ebb and flow of human
opinions.'' He treasured religion for its conservative aspects,
standing as it does above mundane secular struggles, and his
forceful warning against an inclination of some believers to ally
themselves with political power might these days be called into
service by the American Civil Liberties Union. But his concern was
as much for the well-being of religion as for the freedom of the
state. Religion, he preached, does not need the secular power to
live, but in serving that power, it may die.
</P>
<P>
   So Tocqueville and Bryce, reverent democrats, took their stand
both as defenders of religion against the vagaries of the mob and
as defenders of freedom against the presumptions of the clergy. In
answer to the question of whether the citizenry would able, without
a moral code, to ``hold in check the violence of masses and the
self-indulgent impulses of the individual,'' Bryce directed his
readers to history, where he found support for what seems to be
Lieberman's discovery too, that ``hitherto civilized society has
rested on religion, and that free government has prospered best
among religious peoples.''

   DENMARK-EURO (Vejle, Denmark) _ With its fat cows and flaky
pastries, its neat streets and nice queen, this pampered little
land seems as foreign to angst as any country could be. But
appearances deceive, for Denmark has an acute case of the identity
crisis now afflicting several European states. The disquiet has
been brought on by a referendum on Sept. 28, when Danes will be
asked whether they wish to preserve the krone or follow 12 other
states of the 15-member European Union in abandoning their money
for a shared currency, the euro. By Roger Cohen.

   ACTIVIST-PRIESTS (New York) _ In the era of Vatican II, many

decentralization, built housing for the poor, and spoke out on
everything from nuclear disarmament to the Vietnam War. But today,
as the priests who first embraced Vatican II prepare for
retirement, they move with self-doubt and a measure of
disillusionment. While the evidence of their labors is everywhere
evident, their social values have by and large been abandoned by
many newer, more conservative priests. By Diana Jean Schemo.

land, homes and businesses that were distributed to peasants and

lengthy administrative and legal processes that too often result in
paltry settlements paid in low-value government bonds. By David

COMMENTARY: THE TAO OF DICK
</HEADLINE>
 By MAUREEN DOWD 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. _ Gertrude Kovak, who says she is ``89 and a
half,'' sat in her wheelchair at the Methodist seniors home here,
up in the front row where she could get a good gander at Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   So, I asked after the Republican's talk on prescription drugs,
how did she like what he had to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wel-l-l,'' she replied, hesitating. ``You can't tell. A lot of
people didn't hear a thing. He speaks so softly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters, who have been having trouble capturing Cheney's low
monotone on tape, said they were buying bigger microphones for
their tape recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was in Connecticut to chant the Bush campaign's newest
populist slogan, ``Real plans for real people.'' Of course, the
Halliburton gazillionaire may not be the best medium for the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Belittling Al Gore's criticisms of W.'s Medicare drug plan,
Cheney said, ``Apparently, the vice president has trouble
understanding the concept of options.'' Perhaps it would be best if
the king of stock windfalls avoided the ``O'' word.
</P>
<P>
   There is much gnashing and grinding in GOP circles over the vice
presidential contest. There's a thrilled Joe Lieberman, praising
the Lord and making the Democrats _ the immoral, skirt-chasing
party _ look a little more kosher.
</P>
<P>
   And there's ``Big Time'' Dick Cheney, still learning how to make
hand motions when he talks.
</P>
<P>
   A new ABC-Washington Post poll shows that Lieberman's
favorability ratings have nearly doubled, while Cheney's
unfavorability ratings have nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend a lot of time worrying about my favorables or
unfavorables,'' Big Time told reporters on Friday. ``It's not a
personality contest ...'' Can someone explain to him that the whole
rationale for W.'s candidacy was that he was supposed to be the
likable one.
</P>
<P>
   The two veep contenders invaded each other's home turf on
Friday. Holy Joe went to Houston to berate W. for his poor record
on health care for Texas children. And Big Time, who has an
undeniable talent for turning political influence into quick bucks,
went to Greenwich to crowbar some big bucks out of the lockjaw set.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are three lessons to draw from the Cheney debacle:
</P>
<P>
   1. Never choose a back-room guy you think would be good at
governing, because if he's lousy at politicking, he may never get
to the governing part.
</P>
<P>
   2. Even if you pick a loyal family retainer, vet him.
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't select somebody just to please Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the most humiliating day in vice-presidential
politics since we lost Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the open-mike flub and questions about his mingy
charitable contributions, Cheney was pinching those pinched lips
again. He was pestered about a Dallas Morning News report that he
had skipped voting in 14 of 16 elections since he registered in
Dallas County nearly five years ago _ including W.'s March
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled a great deal,'' Big Time explained, adding, ``My
focus was on global concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm? Too busy with Halliburton's state of affairs to vote for
the candidate he was tutoring in the affairs of state. Hasn't
Cheney ever heard of absentee ballots?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Big Time lesson No. 4: If you want votes,
cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton is becoming a House of Horrors.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's Larry Margasak reported on Friday that the company has
a segregated restroom policy, keeping separate restrooms overseas
for its American and foreign employees. Halliburton said the policy
was ``no different than Eastern countries that often designate
facilities for use by Westerners.''
</P>
<P>
   Come again?
</P>
<P>
   As a final fillip to an embarrassing day, Cheney pointedly
ignored Mark Nielsen, the local Republican congressional candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the debut of Nielsen's campaign ad that showed
pictures of former President George Bush, John McCain and Joe
Lieberman, while the announcer intones, ``Today, when America wants
leaders of honesty and integrity. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Little Bush and Big Time were conspicuously missing.
</P>
<P>
   The eager GOP candidate had made a decision about where to look
for coattails _ and it wasn't on his own party's ticket.

COMMENTARY: GORE'S TAX PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news about the detailed economic plan the Gore-Lieberman
campaign released last week is that it does contain some smoke and
mirrors. The good news is that the smoke and mirrors are there not
to conceal the true cost of extravagant promises, but to make a
modest, not particularly exciting plan sound like something more.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those 192 pages of good intentions. There are really
only two important components to the plan: an extension of
Medicare, mainly to provide prescription drug coverage; and
``targeted tax cuts,'' tax breaks that reward families for all
sorts of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The extension of Medicare coverage is actually a conservative
measure, in the fundamental sense of the word. America decided 35
years ago to guarantee health care to older citizens, and while
some politicians may dream of turning back the clock, they won't
say so in public. But pharmacology has come to play an ever more
important role in modern medicine; health insurance that does not
pay for prescription drugs looks less and less like the universal
coverage most people support. So there's nothing radical about
trying to plug that gap. Indeed, at this point Gov. George W. Bush
has grudgingly accepted the principle that Medicare should provide
drug coverage; he's just haggling over the price, and trying to
keep the insurance companies in the game.
</P>
<P>
   If you want something to complain about in Gore's program, it's
those tax cuts. For one thing, each cut gets touted twice _ once as
a tax break, then again as part of a program to promote truth,
justice and the American way.
</P>
<P>
   And it is an understatement to say that the tax breaks are
complicated. As best I can figure, they are targeted on a
middle-income widow with many children, all about to enter college,
who does not receive health insurance from her employer, is
enrolled in a training program, drives a fuel-efficient car and is
about to inherit a farm.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not sure I got it right. Actually, I find Republican
claims that Gore has understated the cost of his plan bizarre; it's
far more likely that his plan won't actually cost as much as he
says because many people who are entitled to claim tax credits will
never figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Why so complicated?
</P>
<P>
   One answer involves political philosophy. Although you would
never know it from the other side's rhetoric, New Democrats like
Gore have clearly renounced the party's old big-government,
big-spending tendencies. But they apparently retain a lingering
taste for penny-ante activism, handing out a few baby carrots here
and there to people who do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The more important explanation of Gore's intricate tax plan,
however, is that this is what happens when you try to play
mine-is-bigger-than-yours with a shameless rival. Bush is proposing
huge, budget-busting tax cuts, mainly benefiting the top 3 or 4
percent of taxpayers; Gore wanted to counter with a smaller, far
more prudent tax cut that nonetheless showed bigger numbers for
middle-income families. The trouble is that because the income tax
is mainly paid by high-income families, it's hard to cut it without
mainly helping those families (although Bush made a gratuitous
further tilt toward the rich by slashing marginal rates mainly at
the top, while leaving the marginal rate on most middle-income
taxpayers unchanged). Gore's economists have tried to pull it off,
but the strain shows.
</P>
<P>
   But why is Gore in such a hurry to cut taxes anyway? After
decades of deficits, the federal government has now run an
``on-budget'' surplus for precisely one year. Can't we wait a
couple of years to see if it lasts?
</P>
<P>
   And if and when we do feel that tax cuts are in order, who said
that it must be the  &UR; income &LR;  tax that is cut? A much easier way to
target working families would be to cut other taxes: two-thirds of
American taxpayers _ the bottom two-thirds _ actually pay more in
other federal taxes than they do on their 1040s.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not happy about Gore's tax proposals: instead of clearly
distancing himself from Bush's truly bad idea, Gore has tried to
meet it partway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's tax plan is grossly irresponsible, while Gore's is
merely uninspiring. And this is a case where less than half a loaf
is better than one.

   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The consensus of
politicians, economists and the public generally on health policy
has shifted since the 1992 election. Then, the prevailing view was
that the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance posed
a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement over
how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and should
be addressed. Now, the politicians and economists have come to
believe _ and the public has become convinced _ that the problem is
simply too difficult to solve in one giant stroke. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-INSULT-REVIEW (Undated) _ I am used to being around big
news. But observing the story is different than being it. And last
week I seemed to be the story. Gov. George W. Bush spotted me at a
rally in Naperville, Ill. Not realizing the microphones were
working, he told his running mate, Dick Cheney, that I was a
``major league (expletive).'' This was hardly the first time I have
been attacked, though it was the first time the attack accorded me
``major league'' status. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside:
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-WARMING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Past climate ups and downs
mostly mesh well with simultaneous natural variations in the
brightness of the sun or the cooling effect of parasol-like plumes
of particles spewed by big volcanoes. But the recent warming,
according to several recent studies, only correlates well with one
thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide, methane, and the other
greenhouse gases. The lesson in all of this, according to many
climate scientists, is that no one should expect some alarm bell to
start ringing _ some disquieting image of a melted pole, say _ to
conveniently summon societies to take action to forestall a
hot-house future. By Andrea C. Revkin.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The disagreement over the
proper place of religion in politics summons us once again to the
works of those ever-useful observers of American life, Alexis de
Tocqueville of France and James Bryce of Britain. Both of their
classic studies, Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' (1835) and
Bryce's ``The American Commonwealth'' (1888), attend the matter in
a spirit that should elicit an amen from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who
has rekindled the issue by saying that religion supports a moral
foundation for public policy. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   NAPSTER-MP3COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems ironic that MP3.com
is being punished even though it was the online music service that
was trying to ensure that people have legitimate copies of the
works _ properly paid for _ before letting people listen to the
music, says Pamela Samuelson, co-director of the UC-Berkeley Center
for Law and Technology. By contrast, Napster, another high-profile
Internet music company being sued by the major record labels, has
so far eluded any legal backlash, though that it aims to help
people copy and share music without paying for it. Yet Samuelson
predicts ``Napster has a much better chance on appeal than
MP3.com.'' By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   BANNED-APPAREL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why do politicians focus on
certain types of clothing. And how does a brief bit of fabric cause
so much consternation? Several nations have banned or actively
discouraged miniskirts. France requires male bathers to wear
skintight Speedos rather than trunks, on the ground that trunks
could pass for shorts and be worn in potentially unsanitary areas.
And in America, Chief Justice William Rehnquist has suggested that
women in provocative clothing may be inadvertently inviting sexual
harassment. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   CIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The CIA has been struggling
for its footing since the end of the Cold War robbed it of a raison
d'etre. But under the Clinton administration, it has suffered from
two worsening trends: a skittishness about politically sensitive
intelligence and an aversion to risky espionage operations. This
spring CIA analysts were ordered that there were to be no surprises
and no intelligence fiascos that could cause headaches in November.
By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   DORMS-BELONGINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The days when students would
show up at the end of summer with a trunk and a suitcase are long
gone, say college administrators. Today, students have become
hermit crabs and simply take everything with them when they move
into the dorms. The ideal seems to be as much stuff as it is
possible to cram into their rooms. By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC-FORECAST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Two business school
professors have developed a formula they say enables them to
predict exactly how many gold medals each country will win at the
Sydney Olympics. The formula posits that just two factors account
for 95 percent of a nation's predicted medal count: the number of
medals it won at a previous Olympics, and the size of its economy.
By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ELECTION-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Democracy is about choice, but
in the Yugoslav version, now playing itself out with Slobodan
Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices
than usual. But with a strong opposition candidate doing better
than Milosevic in the opinion polls, Milosevic also gets to make a
choice: whether to accept the choice of the people _ if it goes
against him _ or to manipulate the totals and declare victory
regardless. By Steven Erlanger. (Moved in `i' category)

CONGRESS IS PREPARED TO APPROVE BIG INCREASES IN SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cushioned by a burgeoning surplus, Congress is
poised to approve large increases in spending by federal agencies,
pushing the national budget to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranking Republicans predict that the perennial year-end
wrangling between Congress and the White House will result in a
federal budget for the 2001 fiscal year that allocates at least
$614 billion, and probably quite a bit more, for discretionary
spending.
</P>
<P>
   That figure would represent a 5 percent increase over the $586
billion Congress approved last year after a heated debate with the
Clinton administration that delayed final approval of the last
spending bills until Nov. 19, seven weeks after the beginning of
the fiscal year on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The figure would also exceed the nearly $600 billion that
Congress set in April as a ceiling for discretionary spending for
the coming fiscal year. Discretionary spending includes everything
in the budget except the automatic payments for items like Social
Security benefits and interest payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone recognizes that we're going to have to lift
the budget caps,'' as the limits on discretionary spending are
known, said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread view among congressional Republicans that federal
spending will rise significantly in the next budget is causing
disquiet among the party's more conservative fiscal hawks. Some of
them console themselves by pointing out that the increases are
taking place during a time of federal budget surpluses rather than
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in spending is brought on not only by the
anticipated surplus, but also by pressures from the White House to
agree to some of its priorities as a condition for letting members
of Congress leave town for the campaign, and by the demands of
individual lawmakers on their leaders for some fiscal bacon to take
home to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   A $288 billion measure for the military that includes a 3.7
percent pay raise for U.S. soldiers, sailors and aviators has
already been approved by Congress and signed by President Clinton,
putting Congress well along the path to exceeding the $600 billion
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Those bills that are left would pay for foreign aid and
domestic, nonmilitary items _ everything from the federal courts,
air traffic control radars and interstate highways, to schools, the
Head Start program, veterans' hospitals, water treatment plants,
national parks and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 these items
have prompted down-to-the wire fights between Congress and the
administration, and, in 1995, the brief shutdown of the government,
an action that inflicted grave political wounds on congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many Republicans are supporting expanded federal
spending illustrates how the blossoming surplus and the desire to
maintain the fragile majority in Congress has eroded the
Republicans' traditional fiscal restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of relative fiscal conservatism that the Reagan folks
tried to implement is over,'' said Stanley E. Collender, a managing
director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at
Fleischman-Hillard, a public relations company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress approved a budget that technically was
within spending ceilings mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of
1997. But the lawmakers were able to stay under the ceilings only
by declaring $24 billion in spending for items like the financing
of the 2000 Census to be emergencies and not subject to the law's
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Congress appears to be ready to dispense
with such gimmicks and unabashedly approve large spending
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caps are irrelevant,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
who is chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of the Senate
Appropriations Committee. ``Nobody pays any attention to them
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's tussle will focus on a few major spending bills and
the battles will be as much over how the money is spent as how much
is allocated. Also, some of the fights will be over legislative
language known as riders that are attached to spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most notable battles will be fought over the
following bills.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Labor-Health and Human Services bill: Always one of the
most contentious of the spending measures, this year's version will
involve a major fight over Clinton's proposal to provide $1.3
billion for school repairs and $1.8 billion for the president's
seven-year program to hire 100,000 teachers. Congress wants to
spend less money on both initiatives and give local school boards
the option of spending the money for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Interior bill: Versions passed by the Senate and the House
are at least $1 billion less than Clinton requested. Also the House
version provides only $184 million _ far less than the $600 million
Clinton wants _ for the president's ``Lands Legacy'' program, which
allows the federal government to purchase and protect
environmentally sensitive land.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Foreign Operations bill: This $13.3 billion foreign aid
bill will feature the perennial fight over whether the government
can finance international family planning organizations that use
their own money to perform abortions in foreign countries or lobby
foreign governments on abortion policy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats needing to pick up only seven seats to gain
control of the House and with a sense that even their majority in
the Senate is threatened, Republicans are also eager to reach quick
agreement with President Clinton over the spending bills so that
they can return to campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure could well bring congressional leaders to accept
spending increases in negotiations with the White House, some
Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Clinton's going to want more money,'' said Rep. Ray
LaHood, R-Ill. ``It's just a matter of what's the amount. I don't
even know if we're going to ask him how he's going to spend it.
It's, `How much do you want?'''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Friday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert told his
Republican colleagues that they should be prepared to loosen the
purse strings when it comes to the 11 spending bills Congress still
must approve to keep the government functioning, said several
people who attended the session.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the meeting, however, Hastert was noncommittal over
how much spending Republicans would be willing to support, or if
they would support any increase at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made that decision yet,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions between White House and congressional staffers on
the spending bills will begin on Monday, said a senior
administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The official stressed that the two sides would merely ``catalog the
list of things that needed to be addressed,'' and would not engage
in substantive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As they enter into the discussions Republicans are deeply
worried that they will be drawn into protracted debates with the
White House. Since the government shutdown in 1995, many say that
the White House has gained political leverage and could keep upping
the ante as the talks progressed.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders worry that if they give in to the higher
levels of spending that are requested by the White House, they will
be deluged by requests from many of their own members _ especially
those locked in tight re-election races _ to finance their pet
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get handed letters every day with more and requests from
members,'' said Rep. C.W. Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee. The longer the process is played out,
Young added, the more requests he will get.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of further demands for increases from the White
House and other members of Congress leads some Republicans to
predict that the final budget for discretionary spending will even
exceed what the administration originally sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wanted $621 billion,'' said Rep. John E. Porter,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee that provides money for the Labor, Health
and Human Services and Education departments. ``It will be much
higher than that.''

MINNESOTA DEMOCRATS' DIVISIONS COULD KEEP THEM FROM REGAINING
SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ When the Democratic Party looked for
congressional seats it could pick up in the November elections, the
one held by Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota was high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Grams, a conservative Republican in a state with a large liberal
bent, has made few legislative splashes in his one term in the
Senate, and his approval rating has been notably low.
</P>
<P>
   Grams also hit several personal speed bumps that took the steam
out of his family-values message. He was divorced, then apparently
became involved in a relationship with a senior aide that led to
the resignation or dismissal of several other staff members. And
last year, sheriff's deputies found marijuana in a truck that
Grams' 21-year-old son was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had been all but counting that Grams, who won the 1994
election with 49 percent of the vote, would make it easy for them
to recapture the Senate seat. But now things look less certain.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have been unable to unify around any of their four
major candidates: an heir to a department store fortune; a trial
lawyer who led the state's lawsuit against the tobacco industry; a
state senator who owns a bar in northern Minnesota; and a
businesswoman who ran a Minneapolis housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   And, faced with a primary on Tuesday, unusually late in the
political season, the candidates have been forced to spend campaign
resources battling one another instead of Grams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grams is ripe for the taking, but so far nobody has really
jumped out as somebody who has a really good chance of taking
him,'' said Chris Gilbert, a political science professor at
Gustavus Aldophus College in St. Peter. ``Even if somebody emerges
with a comfortable victory in the primary, there just isn't much
time left.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four major candidates for Senate are millionaires,
and the primary for Minnesota's Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, as
the Democratic Party is known here, has emerged as the most
expensive in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dayton, a former state auditor, is heir to the Dayton
Hudson department store fortune and has spent $4.6 million, most of
it his own money. Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer who orchestrated the
state's $6.6 billion settlement from tobacco companies, has spent
about $3.4 million, financing more than half of it himself. And
Rebecca Yanisch, a construction company executive who also led the
Minneapolis Community Development Agency in the 1990s, a housing
agency, has spent about $1.5 million, a third of it from her own
pocket and some of the rest from Emily's List, which raises money
for Democratic women who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate who has raised so little money that he could
afford only one last-minute television advertisement is the
candidate who has the party's official endorsement, state Sen.
Jerry Janezich, who owns Tom and Jerry's Lounge in Minnesota's Iron
Range. He has spent about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the endorsed candidate and the only one who's been in
legislative office before,'' said a spokesman for Janezich, Troy
Matson. ``We're going to try and get the message out that he is the
only candidate who is like average Minnesotans.''
</P>
<P>
   Janezich's difficulty in raising money is partly due to his
humble style, political experts say. But it is also a sign of the
weakness of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party. Its endorsement has
helped Janezich get labor support, but has otherwise made little
difference in fund-raising or the polls. Perhaps the most publicity
Janezich has received came when Jay Leno made him the subject of a
crude joke after he crawled under a table to thank union
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, Minnesota prided itself on having a strong
party system, on raising to the highest levels people who came up
through the party with distinguished careers in public service,''
said Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at
Carleton College in Northfield. ``This is money buys ads, produces
votes. That's what's going on in the nation and it's coming to
Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who is well-known here, in part from previous
unsuccessful bids for governor and senator, has pulled ahead in
recent polls. But those polls, taken before last-minute campaign
blitzes by all four candidates, also indicate that a quarter of
voters are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming nothing,'' said Dayton, whose campaign has
included setting up a ``help line'' to assist people in resolving
problems with their health maintenance organizations, and taking
busloads of older people to Canada so they can buy cheaper
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates, who agree more often than not, talk about
helping the elderly and farmers, and making health care more
affordable. Dayton favors immediate universal health insurance,
while Ciresi and Yanisch want to proceed more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Ciresi, second in the polls, favors normalized trade relations
with China. Janezich, third in recent polls, has a record of
supporting labor, the environment and other liberal causes.
Yanisch, who talks about her early life as a struggling single
mother and her brother's suicide stemming from depression over farm
crop failures, has positioned herself as the most moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any big issues in Minnesota,'' Schier
said. ``Minnesota is a hotbed of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the primary will have no trouble distinguishing
himself or herself from Grams, whose causes include a conservative
plan to privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Grams, whose biggest legislative accomplishment has been the
$500-per-child tax credit, is still not in great political shape.
He has spent all but $1 million of the $5.6 million he has raised,
and a recent poll had his favorable rating dropping 9 points since
June, to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for charisma, Schier said: ``Our politics are dominated by
two showboats,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, and Gov. Jesse
Ventura, an independent. ``This guy isn't even a canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Grams, Kurt Zellers, said the senator was aware
that political commentators had predicted his vulnerability, but
``he says it's awfully hard to feel vulnerable when you're out
there campaigning and people come up and say, `Thanks, Rod.'''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, no one in Minnesota thinks a Grams defeat is a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever the Democrat is, is still going to have a very
tough time beating Rod Grams,'' said Blois Olson, a former
Democratic consultant who now edits a Web site on Minnesota
politics. ``Rod Grams, whatever he's done or said, has run and
positioned himself among senior and rural voters as this American
champion for tax cuts, health care benefits and apple pie. And I
think people are beginning to think that he's being picked on or
targeted.''

AFTER SLAYING OF JUDGE, SOUTH AFRICA WARNS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ South Africa's minister of justice,
incensed by the assassination last week of a judge who has presided
over an important terrorism trial in Cape Town, has said he will
ban the organization suspected in the slaying if the group
continues what authorities say is a two-year campaign of bombings
and terror.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Penuell Maduna, told reporters that the slaying of
Magistrate Pieter Theron marked a steep escalation of the conflict
with a Muslim group known as People Against Gangsterism and Drugs,
or Pagad, and would meet with a stern response.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-terrorism bill that would permit the banning of
suspected terrorist organizations was presented last month for
public comment and, if passed, would provide the government with a
powerful but controversial tool in combating acts like last week's
assassination and the string of 20 bombings in the Cape Town area
since June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed law includes safeguards unknown in the
apartheid era, any move to outlaw the group would carry
considerable historical import in a country where the current
governing party, the African National Congress, was a banned
organization for years during the rule of the white-minority
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Pagad has evolved from a sometimes violent
vigilante operation with thugs and drug dealers as its targets into
a group harboring a cell of terrorists intent on destabilizing a
government that group leaders see as hostile to some of their
Islamic tenets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed Pagad leaves this country with no alternative but to
have the executive impose a ban upon them, we will do so,'' Maduna
said. ``I think we owe the public an obligation to ensure their
safety and security, and the measures we might have to take against
Pagad might indeed entail banning them.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization is suspected of orchestrating as many as 20
bombings in and around Cape Town, including eight this year. In the
deadliest attack, three people were killed in an August 1998 blast
at the Planet Hollywood restaurant. Last month, the owners of the
restaurant announced that it was for sale, saying that since the
bombing, business has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's assassination, carried out in broad daylight, was by
far the boldest attack since the Planet Hollywood bombing. Theron
was arriving home in the Plumstead suburb late Thursday afternoon
when he was ambushed by a passing car. The occupants opened fire,
striking the 50-year-old judge in the head and torso, killing him
instantly, police said.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has blamed People Against Gangsterism, the
group itself has strongly denied any involvement. Abidah Roberts,
national secretary of the group, said in an interview on Friday
evening that her organization was not involved in the slaying and
that by jumping to conclusions, the government was undermining its
own investigation. ``We are not involved in bombings or killings,''
she said. ``Our focus is to eradicate crime, gangsterism and drugs
from our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Theron had recently convicted a member of the group in a
firearms case and was hearing another case in which two members
were charged in connection with a pipe-bomb explosion outside a
police station, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying stunned the country. Cape Town, in many ways the
crown jewel of South Africa's cities and a popular tourist
destination, has found its reputation sullied and now faces the
reality that not even the justice system and the people who serve
it are safe. The minister of safety and security, Steve Tshwete,
announced Saturday that police and security services are stepping
up protection for judges and prosecutors involved in cases against
members of People Against Gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   Tshwete said that in at least one such case, government lawyers
were taunted with threats of ``one prosecutor, one bullet,'' a
sinister play on the old ``one settler, one bullet'' mantra of
radicals battling apartheid. And just last month, Tshwete said,
authorities arrested four people at the center of a reported plot
to kill another judge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are also considering moving some of the trials out of
Cape Town and holding others in jails in an effort to limit the
opportunities for attacks and intimidation and to allow the cases
to proceed. ``This barbaric incident will not deter us from
continuing with the investigations and the prosecution of those
responsible for violence and urban terror in Cape Town,'' Tshwete
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maduna, the justice minister, said on Friday that police may
have been alerted by intelligence services of a possible plot to
kill a Cape Town judge last week, but failed to act upon the tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that that is true, then indeed we have to deal
with the people who handled it,'' Maduna said. ``If we were given
information, we ought to have acted.''

IDENTITY CRISIS FOR DANES AS EURO VOTE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VEJLE, Denmark _ ``For Krone and Fatherland'' scream the giant
posters at the annual congress of the nationalist Danish People's
Party, exhorting Danes to defend their currency and their very
nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark at risk? With its fat cows and flaky pastries, its neat
streets and nice queen, this pampered little land seems as foreign
to angst as any country could be. But appearances deceive, for
Denmark has an acute case of the identity crisis now afflicting
several European states.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate threat to Denmark, as perceived by Pia
Kjaersgaard, the successful leader of the People's Party, is a
referendum on Sept. 28 when Danes will be asked whether they wish
to preserve the krone or follow 12 other states of the 15-member
European Union in abandoning their money for a shared currency, the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essential issue is the preservation of our sovereignty,''
said Kjaersgaard, who founded her party in 1995 and has seen its
support grow to more than 10 percent of the electorate. ``The euro
will erode our national authority and identity at a time when
Denmark is already becoming more and more multiethnic and
globalized.''
</P>
<P>
   To lump the euro with the arrival of foreigners and the effects
of global competition and conjure a three-pronged menace may seem
bizarre. But not necessarily in today's Europe, where concern about
the dilution of nationhood through European integration and
mounting immigration is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kjaersgaard's message has struck a chord. Opinion
polls suggest a virtual dead heat, with 48 percent of Danes for the
euro, 46 percent against and 6 percent undecided. ``I still hope we
will get the euro,'' said Marianne Jelved, the economics minister.
``But I cannot say I am confident, because the risk is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only to Denmark. This is a country of just 5.3 million
inhabitants, ``a mere tail to the German bulldog,'' in the words of
Ole Krarup, a law professor. But it has a special capacity for
clarifying the continent's mood because it is the only country that
votes regularly on how far Europe should integrate. A ``No'' vote
could snowball.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it would further undermine the euro, whose
value against the dollar has plunged 25 percent in a year; delay
any possibility of Britain and Sweden joining the common currency,
and turn Kjaersgaard into a sort of Nordic version of Austria's
Joerg Haider, with an invigorated anti-European and anti-immigrant
message.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It might also expose the seemingly undemocratic nature of the
mainly German and French drive to create a federation resembling a
United States of Europe. Germans, for one, have never voted on such
an idea, or on the euro itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that rejection of the euro would give
Kjaersgaard an added hubris,'' said Jorn Thulstrup, a pollster and
political analyst. ``She'd be wheeled out across the continent to
say more European Union equals more control of small countries by
big ones and more open borders to allow the immigrant hordes in.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, identity politics are resurgent. Nationalist,
anti-immigrant parties thrive in Belgium and Austria. In Athens,
Greek identity is said by the Orthodox Church to be under threat
from a government plan to remove mention of religious affiliation
from identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Guenter Verheugen, one of the country's top
officials at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels,
denounces the way the euro was introduced ``over the heads of the
people'' and demands a referendum on expansion of the the union
because of German fears of an influx of Poles and Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the immigrants washing up from Albania and elsewhere
on the country's southern shores feed the patriotic salvos of
Silvio Berlusconi, whose New Right politics are once again on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   As for Denmark, its Hamlet syndrome _ a recurrent hesitancy over
whether something is rotten in the state of Europe _ has reached a
new pitch, fed by fears that Peter Skaarup, a People's Party member
of Parliament, summed up as ``the growing anxiety that we won't be
masters in our own house anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This Danish house has shrunk a lot over the centuries; it is
more of a bungalow today. Territory was lost in various wars
against Sweden and Germany, turning a regional power into a
powerless realm. Like other Europeans steeped in tradition and past
glories, yet aware of the demands of modernity, the Danes are
sensitive about what they have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken refuge in a sort of small-is-best,
if-you-can't-join-them-beat-them mentality,'' explained Jakob
Busti, the transport minister and a leading member of the governing
Social Democratic Party, which is campaigning for the euro.
</P>
<P>
   After 28 years in the European Union, Denmark is rich. It has a
low unemployment rate of 5 percent, sends 66 percent of its exports
to the other states of the union, has no security concerns and
would be less vulnerable to currency fluctuations and financial
speculators inside Euroland than out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take too many Salomon Brothers to empty the Danish
National Bank,'' noted Thulstrup, the political analyst. But nor,
it seems, does it take too many Danes to generate a broad
resistance to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union, only to accept it a year later with slight modifications.
Now, there is a possibility that Denmark will reject the euro _ and
by extension Europe's political integration _ as an alliance of the
far right and far left backs the ``No'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On the right of this coalition sits Kjaersgaard, 53,
blonde-haired, blue-eyed, immaculate in a pale-lilac suit, diamond
bracelet glittering on one wrist, dripping disapproval and distaste
for what she sees as the dismantling of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to lose control of our lives with more and more
decisions made by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt or in
Brussels?'' she asked. ``Do we want this multiculturalism, this
multiethnicity, about which the country was never consulted? I say
we don't want either.''
</P>
<P>
   On the anti-euro alliance's left wing sit the likes of Krarup,
the law professor at the University of Copenhagen, a rumpled and
thoughtful socialist, distressed by what he sees as the erosion of
democracy in the ``crazy push'' for a European superstate.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Danes, Krarup was alarmed by the European Union's
imposition of sanctions on another small country _ Austria _ in
response to the inclusion of Haider's rightist Freedom Party in
government. Because the sanctions were widely seen as an
infringement of democracy and sovereignty, their imposition has
bolstered Danish opponents of the euro. (Other European states may
actually lift the sanctions before the Danish vote, after a report
on Friday by a panel of experts that said the sanctions are
counterproductive.)
</P>
<P>
   But ought a man of the left to share a platform with
Kjaersgaard? It is very awkward, Krarup confided. But then, this is
a time of collapsing certainties, of ``exponential change,'' so
such odd shifts of political ground could occur.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Denmark's newspapers suggest a time of transition.
They carry reports of immigrant crime and schools disrupted by
``second-generation immigrants'' _ the children of the Turks,
Pakistanis and others who came to work here in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In political circles, the immigrants causing such trouble are
now politely referred to as Ny Danskere _ New Danes. But the term
is problematic. Are the light-skinned then ``Old Danes?'' What
distinguishes the two? ``People often say `New Danes' because they
don't want to say `Not Danes,''' joked Buksti, the transport
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, Denmark, like other European states, has gotten
itself in a tangle over immigration, and because both foreigners
and the euro are seen by many to subtract from Denmark, both are in
the snarl.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, in the charitable spirit of its traditional
Social Democratic outlook, Denmark welcomed foreigners; it handed
them a lot of welfare. The number of immigrants _ with papers or
awaiting them _ has risen steadily to 7.1 percent of the
population, from 6.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a kind of giant, philanthropic buffet table,
inviting immigrants to come and help themselves,'' said Lene
Espersen, a conservative politician who backs the euro but fears
that ``the nightmare of a takeover'' is playing into the hands of
the anti-euro campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lusin Canacki, 33, a social worker in the port of Arhus,
dark-eyed, olive-skinned, a Danish-speaking Turk, is alarmed by the
way the country has changed. She has been in Denmark since she was
6, has two children who are Danish citizens and is applying for
citizenship herself. But the country she would make hers is
becoming hostile, she feels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she believes, Denmark is divided into ``us'' and
``them.'' ``We are told to get an education, learn the language,
learn Danish habits,'' she said. ``But when we do, we are still one
of `them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Canacki continued: ``People I know come up to me and say, `It's
not people like you, Lusin, that are a problem, it's all the
others.' But politicians and newspapers don't say `Except Lusin.'
We're all lumped together.''
</P>
<P>
   So strong has the Danish reaction against immigration been that
the government of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen recently
enacted legislation that may make Denmark less attractive to
foreigners. Among the laws was one barring any immigrants under age
25 from bringing a foreign spouse to Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was presented as an attempt to foster
integration _ by hindering arranged marriages between young Turkish
men or women in Denmark and people in Turkey, where the government
says about 90 percent of Danish Turks find their partner.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures made some welfare dependent on learning Danish
and put new pressure on immigrants to place young children in
kindergartens that charge fees. ``Our priority was to prevent the
spread of immigrant ghettos, the source of these immigrant gangs,''
said Pernille Blach Hansen, a Social Demorat.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not how Suhail Ibrahim, a 37-year-old Dane born in
Lebanon, saw the laws. After more than a decade as a Social
Democrat _ he arrived in Denmark from Beirut in 1986 _ Ibrahim quit
the party this year, saying that it was ``on the way to becoming a
racist party.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, a Palestinian refugee, got his first passport from
Denmark, in 1994. But he said he no longer feels Danish, despite
having a Danish wife and two Danish children. ``Danes talk of
integration and then devise new forms of pressure,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   So, in June, Ibrahim founded Denmark's first immigrant party, to
wage a battle for the rights of foreigners. Canacki sees the idea
as a disaster, ``the beginning of war, and more and more
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   The two immigrants do not agree about the euro either. Ibrahim
opposes it as a first step toward possibly severe pan-European
legislation on immigration. Canacki favors the euro, because ``we
foreigners cannot afford a little Denmark, closing to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danish government agrees with Canacki; it wants the euro
badly. The Economics Ministry has rushed out a publication showing
that Queen Margarethe, much beloved, will appear on one side of
Danish euro coins (the coins are to have differing national
symbols; all euro notes will be the same). ``The sight of the queen
on the coin,'' said Jelved, the economics minister, ``helps calm
fears about loss of identity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Rabbi Shlomo Shmulevitz is director of the
commandments related to the Land of Israel for the Jerusalem
rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a good week to ask him how he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy vey,'' he said in Yiddish, then continued in Hebrew-spliced
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so tired with all this shmita business. Shmita, shmita,
shmita. Headlines about shmita! Talk radio about shmita! Who would
have ever imagined?''
</P>
<P>
   Who, indeed? Even in Israel, shmita, pronounced shmee-TA, is an
arcane subject. According to the Torah, shmita is the sabbatical
year when the land of Israel is supposed to lie fallow. It occurs
every seven years, and a new shmita is scheduled to begin at the
end of September on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   For a century, the start of shmita was not a matter of general
concern. A longstanding social agreement allowed Israeli farmers to
continue working their land provided that they nominally ``sell''
it to a non-Jew and get a deed of sale from the chief rabbinate.
The rabbinate, in fact, arranged the transaction. The average
cucumber consumer never knew the difference; everything was kosher.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the cucumber cart was overturned by strictly
Orthodox rabbis who did not think the Torah bypass, originally
justified by the survival needs of the Zionist pioneers, could be
justified any longer.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Hasidic sage ruled that this year the deed of sale
would be invalid. This led the state-financed Jerusalem religious
council to announce that Israeli fruits and vegetables would not be
considered kosher during the shmita year, and that establishments _
grocery stores, restaurants, hotels _ selling them would risk
losing their vital kosher certificates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, shmita exploded into a national controversy.
Incredibly, it managed to touch a panoply of raw nerves: the
religious-secular conflict, the Israeli-Arab conflict (the non-Jew
who ``buys'' the land of Israel is usually Palestinian), the
conflict between the new high-tech economy and the old agricultural
economy and the conflict between authorities within the Orthodox
world.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, one of Israel's two chief rabbis, Eliyahu
Bakshi-Doron, nearly resigned after he was threatened with being
``ostracized'' by part of the strictly Orthodox world for his
lenient position upholding the validity of the deed of sale. ``I
fear becoming a social outcast,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak intervened on his way to New York last
week, President Moshe Katsav summoned religious leaders to his
residence, a special rabbinical conference on shmita was hastily
assembled and a compromise was reached. The compromise included a
promise by Bakshi-Doron that next year he personally would eat only
fruits and vegetables grown outside the Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That would include produce cultivated in the Golan Heights,
which, despite the right wing's protests to the contrary during the
short-lived Israeli-Syrian peace talks, technically doesn't belong
to the Land of Israel, according to Jewish law. It also includes
produce cultivated inside the Land of Israel that is grown in pots
of Golan Heights soil or on elevated platforms that do not
technically touch Israeli soil.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Orthodox, who are religious Zionists, have always
accepted the compromises on shmita, as put forth in a 24-page
booklet issued by their community's highest authorities _ the
country''s chief rabbis. It is a kind of, ``Everything you always
wanted to know about shmita but were afraid to ask,'' and contains
coping tips, such as computerizing sprinklers for home gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But the strictly Orthodox community is not Zionist and doesn't
recognize the authority of the state's rabbis, obeying instead the
rulings of their own sages. And for many years, those sages have
looked askance at the symbolic sale of the land during the shmita
year. Its economy diversified, Israel no longer depended on
agriculture to survive and, in the rabbis' opinion, the Torah's
commandments should only be skirted if survival was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the rabbis believed that the deed of sale was a sham;
Israel was not really sanctioning the wholesale transfer of its
agricultural lands to the Palestinians whose names were on the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   So religious farmers began letting their fields go fallow, and
strictly Orthodox communities shopped only at their own very kosher
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Strict shmita observance, like not watching television, became
one of the things that separated the strictly Orthodox from the
modern.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, a leading authority in
the strictly Orthodox world, changed his recommendation of strict
compliance with the shmita laws to an order.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what makes this shmita any different, Shmulevitz said: ``I
have no idea, and I would never ask. I am not on the great rabbi's
level.'' He added that he assumed it was a logical progression.
</P>
<P>
   Shmulevitz also said that the sage was misunderstood by the
secular public; he had proposed a moderate position, by allowing
produce planted before the shmita year started to be harvested and
sold during the sabbatical and by sanctioning the use of elevated
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mea Shearim,'' Shmulevitz said, referring to a strictly
Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem, ``they are calling him a
Zionist! And in Tel Aviv, they are calling him a religious
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem religious council translated his order into a
practice that would affect secular farmers and consumers and, in
the eyes of many Israelis, impose the views of a very few on the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a farming collective northeast of Ashkelon, Binyamin Elbaz,
52, a vegetable grower, stood in his hothouse and expressed his
suspicions. ``The only explanation is that the strictly Orthodox
are going to make a pile of money off the food they import from
Jordan,'' he said. An Orthodox import cartel is indeed what many
farmers suspect lies behind the move _ a suggestion which
Shmulevitz described as absurd. ``I look like I'm getting rich off
cauliflowers?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Elbaz said, he did what he usually does and
authorized rabbinical officials to ``sell'' the land from which he
harvests 30 tons of cucumbers and 150 tons of peppers a year. He
said he has no idea ``what individual Arab supposedly owns my
land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a crock,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise reached by the rabbinical assembly is murky. The
chief rabbi backed down from an initial threat to dismiss some
Jerusalem rabbis and to impose on the Jerusalem rabbinate his
ruling that the deeds of sale should be respected in their
territory. He also agreed that local rabbinates could adopt
stricter positions than his, but they apparently accepted that they
would not be allowed to force shopkeepers to abide by their
stringency.
</P>
<P>
   The growers' associations say that if need be, they will market
their goods directly to the consumers, avoiding the markets that
depend on the rabbis for certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers are confused. ``I've got to place my next order for
seeds,'' Elbaz said, ``and I don''t know what's going to develop
between now and the New Year. What do I tell my workers? Go back to
Thailand, the fields will be fallow this year?''
</P>
<P>
   The whole affair exacerbated the already growing tensions
between secular and religious here. Usually, it is the religious
who are urging Israel to leave alone the status quo that governs
the synagogue-state relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But, in proposing that shmita regulations be tightened, strictly
Orthodox rabbis were tampering with the status quo that they
usually guard so zealously. And that could backfire at a time when
Barak is proposing a ``civic revolution'' to curb the powers of the
religious parties. It could make the secular more avidly secular
and affect several ideas now on the table: the city of Herzliya is
preparing to open a new mall with Saturday hours, and the
transportation minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, is proposing that El
Al fly on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a cultural war is left,'' read a headline in the
liberal-left Haaretz newspaper earlier this week, atop a column
asserting that secular Israelis should now feel empowered to
challenge the terms ``dictated by the ultra-Orthodox in the best
tradition of the Wild West.''

LEADER MOVES TO DOMINATE CIVIC GROUPS IN VENEZUELA 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With his control of the Venezuelan
government assured in a landslide election five weeks ago,
President Hugo Chavez is now moving to replace independent civic
and labor groups with equivalents under the control of the
``revolutionary'' movement he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's immediate target is the country's main labor union
coalition, the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, or CTV. Accusing
the group's leaders of being ``an elite that has betrayed the
working class'' he warned last week that ``we are going to demolish
the CTV,'' which is sympathetic to the opposition Democratic Action
party and has organized numerous strikes and protests against
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the current labor union, Chavez, a former army
paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup, has proposed that
a referendum be held along with local elections in December to
establish a single government-dominated union. The country
currently has more than 9,000 unions, but Chavez has brushed aside
suggestions that he allow the labor movement to clean its own
house.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Ramirez Leon, president of the Workers' Confederation,
responded to the initiative by accusing Chavez of adopting ``a
policy of intimidation'' in violation of international treaties.
``The only war the president ought to win, and hasn't been able to,
is the war against unemployment, crime, hunger and misery,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chavez's government has sought to exclude
civic groups not affiliated with his movement from involvement in
``participatory democracy'' mechanisms established by the country's
new constitution, which was drawn up last year by a special
assembly in which Chavez's supporters held 90 percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Under the charter, civic groups are supposed to have a voice in
designating nominees for the Supreme Court, ombudsman and other
major posts. But the Supreme Court recently ruled that no
organization that accepts foreign donations can take part in the
process, thereby disqualifying several established human rights,
religious and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has a tendency to try to tailor civil society
to its own measure, financing groups it likes with the objective of
excluding the others from the process,'' said Liliana Ortega, a
leading human rights lawyer here and a member of Queremos Elegir _
which translates ``we want to choose'' or ``we want to vote,'' _ a
new, nonpartisan civic organization. ``The president thinks that he
alone is civil society and that the rest of us represent nothing,
and that worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling is also important because Chavez's government
has indicated that in order to ``decentralize'' power it intends to
funnel money for community development and other projects directly
to ``popular organizations'' instead of relying on state and
municipal governments, some of which continue in the hands of
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is directly involved in another dispute with Queremos
Elegir and other independent civic groups that he has criticized on
his weekly program broadcast by state radio, ``Hello President.''
Citing a provision in the new constitution that requires media
organizations to provide news in a ``timely and objective''
fashion, leaders of Queremos Elegir have demanded a right to reply
to him on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has invoked his right to reply on several occasions. But
in this case, he has refused to concede his space, with his chief
adviser, Luis Miquilena, arguing that the provision does not apply
to Chavez's radio program because ``it is a space that belongs to
the president, who is acting as president in accordance with the
hierarchy granted by the majesty of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy occurs at the same time as there are complaints
the Chavez camp has clandestinely altered the country's new
constitution, which voters approved last December. Comparing that
document with the version that was later published officially, Alan
Brewer Carias, a constitutional lawyer who was a member of the
assembly that drew up the charter, discovered 74 textual
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes are simply cosmetic. But some are
substantive and appear either to extend or undermine the meaning of
specific articles, including a phrase that deprives all Venezuelans
who have double nationality through their parents from running for
president, one of the Chavez team's pet causes.
</P>
<P>
   Facing opposition charges that ``when things are not convenient,
they just change them,'' the pro-Chavez National Assembly agreed
last week to have the text reviewed by the Supreme Court. But Chief
Justice Ivan Rincon, also a Chavez loyalist, has already said that
he sees ``no obstacle'' and considers the charter to be ``the most
democratic'' that Venezuela has ever had.

WORKING FAMILIES STRAIN TO LIVE MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore incorporated ``working families''
into his rhetoric last month and ``hard-working middle-class
families'' this month as pivotal campaign phrases, he pointed a
finger _ unintentionally perhaps _ at a central fact of American
life: Most of the nation's 72 million families feel they cannot
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters earn less than $75,000 a year and 45 percent of
all families earn $30,000 to $75,000, the range of middle-class
incomes in most of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that middle-income families cannot put food on the
table, pay the mortgage, own a car or two, take a modest vacation.
What stresses them, sociologists and economists say, are the other
outlays of middle-class life: new clothes, child care, lessons for
the children, restaurants, movies, home decoration, computers,
big-screen television sets, stereo systems, Christmas gifts, and
saving for college and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ```Working families' is a code phrase with a variety of
meanings, and one is middle-class people trying to live only on
wages, not earnings from investments,'' said Barrie Thorne, a
sociologist and the co-director of the Center for Working Families
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``They can't do it,
and they feel nonaffluent and not adequately compensated for the
number of hours they must work to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Tracey and Carrie Jones, who live with
their two sons in a ranch house in Madeira, Ohio, a Cincinnati
suburb. Tracey Jones' $45,000 salary as a designer of labeling
machines rose from $40,000 in 1996, when his company elevated him
to permanent employee, with health insurance, from temporary
status, thanks to the booming economy and the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   The family's credit-card debt is shrinking, partly because of
Tracey Jones' higher income, but also, Carrie Jones says, because
of her newly developed resistance to impulse buying, particularly
of clothing and toys.
</P>
<P>
   But unanticipated expenses force the Joneses to dip periodically
into $600 in cash savings, or to overcharge on credit cards. August
was such a month. A car alternator had to be replaced, for $143.
Carrie Jones, who is 38, decided, while shopping at a Sam's
Warehouse Club, to spend $250 to stockpile packaged snack food for
school lunches. The snacks were on sale. ``That purchase was a
mistake,'' she said. The semiannual $315 car-insurance premium came
due. And the credit-card bill somehow jumped to $450.
</P>
<P>
   So Carrie Jones, who already works two evenings a week for a
dentist, earning $4,500 a year, has taken a second job, washing
lunch dishes two days a week, four hours a day, at her sons'
elementary school, earning $41 a week. ``I had volunteered in the
cafeteria and I knew a lot of the women, and they asked me if I
wanted to work there,'' she said. ``It is hard work washing dishes,
and I am exhausted when I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his tax breaks and spending proposals would enrich
this broad swath of middle-income families whose incomes had
languished for over 20 years, through Democratic and Republican
administrations. Gov. George W. Bush's camp increasingly insists
that his tax proposals include significant cuts for this group,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of their various arguments, the emphasis has
clearly shifted. Until Gore made a point of helping ``working
families'' and then the relabeled ``hard-working middle class,''
the Clinton administration had pushed a different emphasis. The
president spoke repeatedly of the ``unprecedented prosperity'' that
Americans enjoyed from the economic expansion that gathered steam
in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And families are doing better. Incomes, adjusted for inflation,
had plunged in the early 1990s for all but the wealthiest 20
percent. Now the lost ground has been recovered, and then some.
Median family income _ half of the nation's 72 million families
earn more and half less _ is likely to pass $47,000 when the Census
Bureau announces the 1999 number late this month; it was $46,737 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The gain is small potatoes compared with the last high point,
$44,974 in 1989 _ the increase since that year is about $2,000 or
4.5 percent. But 1993 provides a more optimistic comparison. That
year was the low point for family income in the 1990s, only $41,691
adjusted for inflation, and the improvement since then is a much
more respectable $5,300 or 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-income families are definitely a few dollars ahead of
where they were, and they are happy to be there,'' said Jared
Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute and a
co-author of the institute's newly updated biennial analysis of
work in the United States. ``People are more likely today to hold
full-time jobs with health insurance than part-time or temporary
work, without benefits. But the stock-market boom has not reached
middle-income families in any important way, and while family
income is up, so is family debt and hours spent at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising hours, in fact, have done more than rising wages to push
up family income, and stress. From 1995 through 1998, the latest
year for which figures are available, members of middle-income
families added 70 hours a year on average to their work time, or
nearly 1.8 additional weeks. From 1989 through 1998, the increase
in work time was 3.4 weeks _ often run up by people like Carrie
Jones, supplementing a spouse's wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once read in the Reader's Digest that families can't make it
on one income, because we want so much,'' she said. ``I think that
is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The income from all the additional hours has lifted some
families beyond the $75,000 that pollsters find to be the minimum
that a family of four feels it must have to afford a middle-class
life.

   ``In the New York metropolitan area, you can have six-figure
family incomes and still feel like you are struggling,'' said
Geoffrey Garin, president of Peter Hart Research Associates, which
surveys public opinion. Still, families with earnings above $75,000
are the ones most likely to tell pollsters that they earn enough to
lead the life they want to lead, says Andrew Kohut, director of the
Pew Research Center.

   Vicki and James Stogdill in Des Moines, Iowa, are in the
above-$75,000 category, paying all their bills from their incomes
and saving money. They hope to build a larger house on a suburban
lot they have bought, now that they have paid off the mortgage on
their present three-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   But the $90,000 a year that they take home from Stogdill's TV
and Appliances, the family business on Franklin Avenue that they
now own and operate, comes at a price that Vicki Stogdill resents.
``If I could, I would get out in a heartbeat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But they cannot get out, they say. In the tight labor market,
they cannot find or afford the people to do all the tasks they do.
So they put in 110 hours a week, he from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. as the
general manager, running the sales and repair operations, and she
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. as the administrator, in charge of the
computer system, personnel and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   James Stogdill's father started the business in 1957, and
Stogdill, who is 43, remembers an easier pace in earlier days, when
his father would close the store periodically for a week or so of
vacation. The arrival of giant discounters, competing for sales,
put a stop to that leisurely practice.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the booming economy has increased the pressure on
the Stogdills to work long hours, and Vicki Stogdill, who is 35,
handles child care by taking the couple's only child to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan, now 15 months old, is growing up in a playpen in his
mother's crowded office and along the aisles among the television
sets, refrigerators, washing machines, stoves and other appliances.
``He does really well here,'' she said. ``Now if there is a second
child, that could be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of ``fulfillment in shaping my child'' is the reason
Vicki Stogdill keeps Jonathan with her. And the saving in child
care, a major cost for middle-income families, helps to keep the
Stogdills in the black. So does their frugality, which surprises
people aware of their income, Vicki Stogdill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosperity that I keep hearing about is not what keeps
money in my bank account and my bills paid every month; it is the
fact that we are spending carefully,'' she said. ``If I don't need
new shoes, I don't buy them. Most people do. We drive old cars. We
do spend $800 a month on takeout food and restaurants, because we
work so many hours. And we tithe at the church, $6,000 a year. But
we have not gone out and built the new house yet. Bankers are
trying to loan us the money. They tell us we are nuts, build it
now. But we want to wait until the loan for the lot is paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald and Rhoda Wright, in Bloomington, Ind., have grown
similarly cautious since she was laid off in 1998 from a job paying
$10.60 an hour _ $22,000 a year _ at a television assembly plant in
Bloomington. Thomson Consumer Electronics closed the plant and
moved the operation to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Most middle-income people have only a high school education or a
year or two of college, and the Joneses, Stogdills and Wrights fall
into this category. Still, the booming economy has generated plenty
of $7- and $8-an-hour jobs for people with this level of education,
and Rhoda Wright, who is 50, said she could have easily jumped into
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a livable wage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she used $13,000 in severance pay to reduce family debt
and enrolled in a two-year bookkeeping course. She collected $236 a
week in unemployment insurance for 18 months, which supplemented
her husband's $36,000 salary as a maintenance worker at Indiana
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a big shopper,'' she said, ``but I spent on
birthdays and Christmas for my two daughters and two grandchildren.
If we were out for a drive and I saw something I liked, I bought
it. Maybe patio furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduation with a bookkeeping degree came last spring and, still
resisting the $8-an-hour offers _ even $9 _ Wright finally started
last month at Hoosier Advertising Co. There she handles accounts
receivable and outgoing payments, at a salary of $26,000, the
equivalent of $12.50 an hour. ``I knew what I was worth with my
schooling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some renewed spending _ a $7,500 metal shed, for
example, to house her husband's tractor on their small spread. But
most of her income will be used to replenish the family's almost
depleted savings. ``We probably went from $30,000 to $1,700 to
support ourselves while she was in school,'' Ronald Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   At 55, he hopes to retire in two or three years, although
starting 18 months after he retires and until he qualifies for
Medicare at age 65, he will have to spend $800 of his
$1,200-a-month pension for health-insurance premiums. ``That is
highway robbery,'' he said, ``but I have worked at the university
for 34 years and I am not going to stay another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ptosha Ford, a 30-year-old nurse and instructor of nurses at
Memphis Hospital School of Nursing in Memphis, Tenn., earns $36,000
and is single. But the costs that squeeze middle-income families
squeeze her, too, she said, and for two years now, she has taught
nursing part time at a community college, adding $10,000 a year to
her hospital income.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that is still not enough,'' she said. Until last fall,
she had lived with her parents, an arrangement that she said
impinged on her independence. Rather than rent, Ford moved directly
into her own home, which she had built for $118,000 in a new
suburban development. A mortgage rate of only 5.27 percent keeps
her monthly house payments, including property taxes, at $850,
roughly the cost of renting an apartment in Memphis, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the other costs that get her: car insurance, a cell phone,
a beeper, cable television, beauty parlor and nail salon, gasoline,
groceries, dry cleaning, home security, Internet connection, 403
(b) pension contribution, health insurance. As a preacher's
daughter, she tithes $300 a month. And there are the credit-card
bills, which average $500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy little things,'' she said, ``like clothes and household
items or a piece of art, and I pay for vacations on credit cards. I
visited a friend in Houston this year, and I plan to go to Jamaica
in October for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are a sore point with Ford. ``I don't agree with high
income taxes,'' she said, ``and I feel like Social Security won't
exist when I retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that Bush might do more than Gore to lower her taxes
and to resolve the Social Security problem, but she is voting for
Gore. ``He is from my home state,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The voting preferences of the Wrights, the Stogdills and the
Joneses seem similarly disconnected from their experiences as
middle-income families. The Wrights, union members, normally vote
Democratic, and are leaning that way now. The Stogdills,
conservatives, are voting Republican. And the Joneses, who approve
of some of the middle-income relief that Gore proposes, make
abortion their priority issue. They are against it, and therefore
for Bush.

SELMA'S MAYOR FACES HIS MOST SERIOUS CHALLENGE IN DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ After 35 years, Mayor Joseph T. Smitherman's
high-wire act above the city's churning racial politics had begun
to settle into routine. Every four years, he would hold barbecues
in black neighborhoods, boasting about the number of black
department heads he had appointed, while reminding white voters
that he would be ``the last white mayor of Selma,'' hinting that
the racial deluge was around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Smitherman has found himself in the fight of his
life, forced for the first time into a runoff election _ on Tuesday
_ against a black candidate, and the hints have become a bit less
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the city that became the bloodstained symbol of the
fight for voting rights, the former segregationist is promoting
himself as the candidate of diversity, preventing city government
from being engulfed by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere that you've gone all black, the towns have gone
down,'' he said between cigarettes in his office, citing several
examples of black-run towns that have gone bankrupt. ``You need
white inclusion, you need diversity in the city government. Let's
face it, the whites have the money, the white business people. They
tend to pull back when it goes all black. So that's what I'm trying
to get across to the blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfiltered and raw, appealing even to black fear of a ruined
economy, this is hardly the velvety approach of the typical New
South white politician. But racial politics in Selma has always
been a few degrees more blunt than average. Many of the city's
white business leaders _ the ones supposedly heading for the door _
shake their heads at Smitherman's argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Smitherman can call up Armageddon as well as any Southern
preacher, and that's what he's doing,'' said Richard P. Morthland,
chairman and chief executive of Peoples Bank and Trust Co., the
city's largest locally owned bank. ``I don't know of any business
that would leave town just because we have a black mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the mayor's arguments have proved remarkably
effective over the years. Though he was mayor on that bloody Sunday
in March 1965 when sheriff's deputies and state troopers attacked
hundreds of people marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge for
voting rights, he argued persuasively that he and his police had
nothing to do with the beatings. He has made a career out of
renouncing his former support for segregation, making sure he
spread city services evenly in black and white neighborhoods. Now
70 years old, he has been re-elected nine times since 1964, despite
repeated efforts to unseat him by black candidates in a city of
21,000 that is now 65 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, James Perkins Jr., a former computer consultant,
came as close as anyone ever has to defeating him. Perkins won 43
percent of the vote, just 276 votes behind Smitherman at 46
percent. A second black candidate, City Councilman Yusuf
Abdus-Salaam, won 10 percent of the vote, forcing the two leading
candidates into a runoff on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, who leads the city's Muslim community, has accused
Perkins of ``religious bigotry'' and appears to be siding with the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, 47, who has run against Smitherman twice before,
contends this effort will turn out differently. While black voters
are increasingly put off by the mayor's condescension, he said,
white voters are also disenchanted by Smitherman's performance.
Last year, the city's former police chief and former city clerk,
along with Smitherman's nephew, pleaded guilty to embezzling more
than $700,000 from the city through fraudulent billings. The mayor
said he knew nothing about the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his job to know what's going on,'' Perkins said. ``And at
the same time, he's allowing a huge disparity in the quality of
life between black and white neighborhoods, and now he's trying to
divide the city by saying industry will leave if I'm elected. This
is obviously a mayor who's panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents say the mayor has not done enough to improve the
city's economy, which has suffered like much of the rural South
from a continuing drain of manufacturing jobs. (The county's
unemployment rate in July was 10.7 percent, compared with Alabama's
rate of 4.4 percent.) Racial tensions continued to bubble in Selma
long after the marches ended, particularly in 1990 when the city's
first black schools superintendent was dismissed and protests
closed the city schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although black officials now dominate the City Council and the
County Commission, there has long been an outspoken faction of
blacks, led by state Sen. Hank Sanders and his wife, Rose Sanders,
that has worked to remove Smitherman. The group has plastered the
city with posters saying ``Joe's Gotta Go,'' although the Sanderses
say they are not working directly for Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   But while Perkins and his supporters point to a few criticisms
of Smitherman's administration, their main argument against him is
that he has never really left his segregationist core. They liken
him to the late Gov. George C. Wallace as one who changed his
language to suit the times but could never escape his past.
</P>
<P>
   As often as he has heard it, this argument still infuriates the
mayor. Rummaging furiously through his office, he pulls out a
campaign flier showing that nine of 13 department heads are black,
and digs through drawers to unearth tributes he has received over
the years from black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm not the devil they say I am, but Selma's their
mecca,'' Smitherman said. ``They want Selma because this is where
it all happened, where people got the right to vote. What really
bothers them is that this place of all places has a white mayor,
but I still keep getting elected, don't I?''

EDITORIAL: BUMPY DAYS FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to tell whether Gov. George W. Bush's campaign
has simply hit a rough patch or is heading into a steep dive. He
was smart to listen to alarmed Republican elders and open talks
with the presidential debate commission about meeting Vice
President Al Gore. He also promised to be more spontaneous and hold
town meetings. But the larger problems faced by Bush's campaign may
be harder to solve, since they have to do with substantive issues
and electoral geography.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign has reached the stage when
state-by-state tallies are more meaningful than the numbers
nationwide. While the national polls have the candidates about
even, only a handful of big states are in play. These states may
also be among the least receptive to Bush's agenda of tax cuts and
restricted government.
</P>
<P>
   State polls show Gore ahead or suddenly competitive in two
places, Louisiana and Florida, that once looked safe for Bush. With
the three biggest states hardly in doubt _ Texas is solid for Bush,
and California and New York seem safe for Gore _ the emerging
battleground is turning out to be the industrial heartland of Ohio,
Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Since the era of Ronald Reagan, working-class Democrats in these
states could be tempted into voting Republican. In recent years,
they have gone for Republican governors like Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and John Engler of Michigan, who favor a strong
government role in health and education. But it is also true that
swing voters in these states have often voted Democratic and may be
ready to do so again this year. The polls suggest that the
anti-government conservatism so popular in Bush's Sun Belt base may
not play as well among the undecided voters in the hottest combat
zone of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An irony is that at the outset of his campaign, Bush promised to
be a ``compassionate conservative'' along the lines of Ridge and
Engler. But in recent weeks Bush has gotten off that message,
sidetracked by the squabble over debates and distracted by his own
indecision over how hard to hit the vice president in attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, partly because of adroit moves by Gore, Bush has been
pulled onto issues terrain. He is being asked to define proposals,
rather than depict them with broad strokes. One result last week
was that Bush wound up sounding more conservative than
compassionate, as when he unveiled his bifurcated Medicare drug
program. Social issues like gun control, the environment and
abortion rights are also strong for Democrats in the critical
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   It was significant that Bush's campaign on general themes of
personality and leadership was struggling just as Republicans in
Congress gave ground on specific issues in order to avoid a budget
confrontation with President Clinton. House Speaker Dennis Hastert
has signaled a willingness to accept a minimum wage bill and is
said to be looking for a compromise on the patient's bill of
rights. Republicans are even said to be willing to accept more
spending on school construction, foreign aid and other Democratic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a fight with the Democrats, the congressional
Republicans are saying, can only play into the enemy's hands. That
underscores the reasons that Bush has had a rough time since the
Democratic convention. Gore has succeeded for the time being in
making this a campaign season that is turning on specifics rather
than generalizations about values and governmental philosophy. And
the concentration on issues by his campaign seems especially
important in the cluster of contestable states expected to decide
the election.

 NEARING RETIREMENT, PRIESTS ACTIVE IN 1960s FEAR THEIR LEGACY HAS By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Msgr. Thomas Leonard remembers the moment in 1962
when, inspired and enthusiastic, he was first allowed to turn from
the altar to face the congregation as he celebrated Mass at a
retreat at Manhattan College. It was the era of Vatican II, when
the Roman Catholic Church loosened strictures of magisterial
authority, while outside church walls, a turbulent world was
remaking itself day by day.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he was allowed to look out at his parishioners, the
priest thought he saw a new church taking shape. He would no longer
be heading a spiritual army bound for salvation, but become part of
a congregation striving for holiness. In churches from the Bronx to
Buenos Aires, communion rails and other borders were vanishing, and
young priests were interpreting the Gospels as a call to social
action. They fought for integration and school decentralization,
built housing for the poor, and spoke out on everything from
nuclear disarmament to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as the priests who first embraced Vatican II prepare
for retirement, they fear replacement with a generation that does
not seem to share their values. The older generation moves with
self-doubt and a measure of disillusionment. While the evidence of
their activism still stands _ in working class apartments that dot
city neighborhoods, in youth centers and in revitalized urban
neighborhoods _ their social values no longer resonate as strongly
among many younger, more conservative priests. As the aging priests
turn to pass the torch to the next generation, many of the men who
are taking up the light seem like strangers to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, of our generation, there's a real sadness,'' said the
Rev. Peter Gavigan, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic
Church in the South Bronx, who was ordained in 1965. ``We're a
vanishing breed, and we're saying, `Wow.' We thought it would be a
golden age by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. John J. Powis of Brooklyn finds the change painful.
``There's even a feeling they're just waiting for us to go,'' said
Powis, whose life as a priest has included community organizing for
everything from subsidized housing to streetlights in Brownsville
and Bushwick. The dismay is not limited to New York, and does not
arise only from the return to traditionalism embraced by incoming
priests alone. Rather, older priests see their bedrock beliefs
doubted by the Vatican itself. While Pope John Paul II has spoken
out loudly and often in support of human rights, he has also
steadily held the line on innovations begun by the Second Vatican
Council, and selected cardinals from among his most conservative
priests.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasiness of the Vatican II-era priests grew in recent
weeks as the beatification of Pope Pius IX, who confined Jews to
Rome's ghetto and abducted a Jewish child to be raised as a
Catholic, advanced in step with that of John XXIII, father of the
Second Vatican Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which met from 1962 to 1965, ushered in a raft of
changes aimed at making the Catholic Church more accessible to the
faithful and more attuned to secular life. Its 16 documents gave
lay people a role in running parishes, replaced the Latin used at
Mass for local languages, and gave priests a voice in church
matters. Vatican II identified the promotion of human rights an
integral part of the church's mission, and reversed the church's
age-old insistence that Jews were responsible for the death of
Jesus. It said Catholicism did not represent the only path to
salvation _ a groundbreaking statement that the Vatican has begun
to reconsider in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1987 book, ``Dreaming About the Church'' (Sheed &AMP; Ward),
the Rev. Walbert Buehlmann, the former secretary-general of
Capuchin Missions in Rome, wrote that the Second Vatican Council
once seemed ``to trace out a whole new future for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hasn't the promise been kept?'' Buehlmann asked. ``Can we
ignore the current mood of disenchantment and resignation, or can
we come to terms with it?''
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential letter written in March, the archbishop of
Milwaukee, Rembert G. Weakland, prepared his 400 priests for the
conservative successor he expected after he retires. ``It seems
that we are now coming to a period of more uniformity, less
creativity, and less space for personal preferences,'' said the
archbishop, whose letter was obtained and published by the National
Catholic Reporter, a lay weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop suggested that the retrenchment answered the
yearnings of Catholics today. ``The younger generation needs more
structures, clarity and guidance,'' he wrote. ``For those who put
their heart and total energy into the implementation of Vatican
Council II, this new period might seem sterile and empty. I hope
and pray not.''
</P>
<P>
   According to periodic nationwide surveys of thousands of priests
by Dr. Dean R. Hoge, a professor at Catholic University in
Washington, and the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago,
since the 1980s priests have grown increasingly conservative on
theological questions like celibacy in the priesthood and the
ordination of women. Hoge's research shows that the youngest and
oldest priests share similar views, while the generation of Vatican
II stands isolated between them.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 article, Hoge predicted a professionalized priesthood
that would be ``smaller in numbers, more conservative in
ecclesiology, more pressured by leadership responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Katarina Schuth, a sociologist at St. Paul Seminary
School of Divinity in Minnesota who surveyed faculty and students
at 42 seminaries last year, found important differences between
today's seminarians and those of earlier years. Nearly half the
schools' 2,300 students had converted from another religion or
returned to Catholicism after leaving their faith. English was a
second language for one in four.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These factors contribute to the conservatism of many young
priests, Schuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, only about 10 percent of seminarians are
extremely conservative, but their influence far outweighs their
numbers, largely because they tend to have the support of bishops.
Schuth quoted one longtime priest who had told her, ``Only in these
past few years is the word of first-year theologian taken to be
more credible than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In their gloomiest moments, aging priests and nuns see Vatican
II not so much as the dawn of a more open, inclusive church, but as
an anomalous thunderbolt of progressivism sandwiched between a past
and future that recoil from change and unfettered debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Msgr. Harry J. Byrne, as chancellor of the New
York archdiocese and chairman of its Social Justice Task Force,
issued guidelines calling on priests to work for social change.
``Constructive activity in the secular community,'' the task force
said, ``is not an `extra' for priests in parishes, but an essential
part of their ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, priests trained in political activism toil largely behind
the scenes, counting themselves lucky for any support from their
bishops. Others work with immigrants or the poor, not so much
challenging systems as giving out sandwiches and finding other ways
to help people individually. As they discuss their disappointments
over the years, most express fear of appearing bitter or defiant in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, now retired, lives in an Upper East Side Manhattan
high-rise for working class New Yorkers that was built with federal
and local housing funds in the 1960s. Each Tuesday night, he dines
with a group of other retired priests, who share no illusions that
their values still hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newer priests don't want to work in the inner cities,''
Byrne said. ``They like nice clean white cuffs, pressed
surplices.'' He and his friends also worry about the small number
of young men who are joining the priesthood. In his day, dozens
completed seminary each spring. Now, annual ordinations for the New
York archdiocese can be counted on the fingers of one hand. (It is
the second largest archdiocese in the country, with 2.4 million
Catholics.)
</P>
<P>
   Because their numbers are so few, Msgr. Vincent Fullam, rector
of the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.,
considers men who choose the priesthood these days ``heroic, or the
next thing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of aging priests, like Msgr. Philip J. Murnion, wonder
what went wrong. In 1968, he wrote a daring report calling on the
New York archdiocese to open its financial books and to give
priests and lay Catholics a greater say in decision-making. Signed
by more than 500 priests, the report likened discontent in the
church to a revolution. But he now thinks his generation may have
moved too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our desire to extend the meaning of the sacred, did we end
up with a situation in which nothing is sacred?'' asked Murnion,
who heads the National Pastoral Life Center in New York. Today, he
said, redemption is what happens to food stamps, and Madonna is a
rock star.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By rejecting the traditional presidential debates,
George W. Bush is making the same strategic error that doomed his
father's 1992 campaign, experts say: talking too much about his
opponent, and not enough about the voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the final months of a presidential campaign, ``the message
from voters is, 'I want to hear about me. I don't want to hear
about (the candidates) any more,' `` said Celinda Lake, a noted
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   No event of the entire sprawling presidential campaign draws the
attention of voters like the face-to-face encounters sponsored by
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Three times as many voters watch these nationally televised
debates as the party conventions. In 1992, the viewership
approached 100 million people. And about 35 percent of the voters
make their candidate choice based on the debates, according to exit
polls from the 1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who skips the debates, or who tries to negotiate
substitute formats that lengthen the distance between candidate and
voter, is likely to pay a stiff political price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates are essentially the final job interview for
presidential candidates,'' said Diana Carlin, a University of
Kansas communications professor who serves on the debate
commission's advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time you have the candidates in the same place,
the only time you can really compare them side by side,'' added
Carlin. ``And if all they do are shows like 'Meet the Press' and
'Larry King Live,' a lot of people are going to say, 'Wait a minute
_ this was totally candidate-controlled, and there was no chance
for the public to have input.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's conclusion is based on a dozen years of research for
the debate commission created in 1987 by a coalition of Democratic
and Republican luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lake's assessment is cast in starker political terms: ``There's
no way someone is up to the job of president if he won't even
debate an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not try to avoid debates altogether. But he proposed a
substitute plan that not only eliminated two of the three 90-minute
debates proposed by the commission, but also favored friendlier
formats with a smaller viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also omitted the format preferred the most by
voters: the town hall meeting, in which voters themselves, rather
than a moderator or panel of journalists, do the bulk of the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush compounded his problem by promoting his plan in a way that
even his own campaign officials now acknowledge was a mistake.
Recalling Gore's vow to debate him ``any time, any place,'' Bush
argued that Gore's credibility was in tatters. He even taunted the
vice president in a TV interview: ``Let's get it on, Mr. Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ludicrous argument,'' an unidentified Bush adviser
acknowledged to the New York Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These problems in the Bush camp finally led to a breakthrough of
sorts: An offer to meet with the Bush handlers sometime this week
in a bid to strike a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore has long been regarded in political circles as a
gifted debater with a quick command of facts and a taste for the
jugular.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, despite his success in Republican primary debates
against the likes of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has yet to bury
the doubts about his intellect that were triggered by his woeful
handling of a TV reporter's pop quiz on the names of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has given the people the feeling that he's afraid to meet
Gore,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia. ``Bush doesn't want to be followed by a guy
in a chicken costume, which will happen soon if this isn't
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers dressed in chicken costumes and holding signs that read
``Chicken George'' started showing up at the rallies of President
Bush in 1992 in an effort to prod him into debates with Clinton,
the Democratic challenger, and Ross Perot, who ran as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor's father and namesake, eventually
agreed to meet Clinton and Perot in three debates. One of them
sheds light on his son's political problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush had built his general election strategy upon
questions about Clinton's patriotism and already tarnished
character, a tactic that had some success against the 1988
Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the second presidential debate of 1992, a town hall
meeting in Richmond, Va., audience member Kimberly Usry challenged
Bush to stop ``trashing'' his opponent's character and start
discussing ``the genuine complexity'' of the issues, especially the
economic recession that had cost her a job in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a defense of his attacks on Clinton's
character, insisting, ``it's fair to put it in focus.'' But when it
came time for Clinton to respond, the challenger agreed with Usry
and took credit for insisting on the town hall format that allowed
her to raise issues directly with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Carlin's post-1992 election research, David Wilhelm, who had
managed the 1992 Clinton campaign, observed: ``Bush kept trying to
make the campaign about Clinton, and the American people wanted the
campaign to be about them _ their problems, their hopes, their
dreams, their economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since accepting the Democratic presidential
nomination, Gore has taken up where Clinton left off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populist appeals to ``working families'' have filled the
policy void left by Bush's emphasis on his own character as a
political antidote to the personal disgraces of Clinton and, by
extension, Gore, his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush seems to have gotten the message well before his father
did in losing to Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After the worst three weeks of his candidacy, the governor is
retooling his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with
voters, talking more about issues and less about Gore's faults.
</P>
<P>
   The hasty restyling apparently includes a new willingness to
negotiate a compromise over the debate stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was vowing to be in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to
debate Gore in a prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press,'' even
though NBC officials said the show would not be broadcast without
both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   How far Bush will go toward a compromise is far from clear, even
though nearly everything in presidential debates is negotiable,
even under the plan already suggested by the commission: formats,
statement and rebuttal times, camera angles, set designs, lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Such negotiations are as old as the Lincoln-Douglas debates
about slavery before the Civil War. ``They had their own debate on
the debates,'' said Carlin, ``only it was by couriers on horseback
instead of on TV and in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin said it was politically astute for Bush to stake out a
debate position rather than simply accepting the commission's
recommendations outright. ``Every candidate wants a comfort
level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she argued that the approach most favored by voters _ three
90-minute debates of varying formats, each devoted to four of the
top 12 issues, with longer response times _ gives candidates a
greater opportunity to find that comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having just one debate raises the stakes, and it gives you no
opportunity to recover from a gaffe or to clarify something,'' she
said. ``Candidates are going to gain more if they're giving the
public something they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But too often, Carlin added, candidates are poorly served by
their more strategic-minded campaign handlers, who often
underestimate the candidate's abilities and inadvertently negotiate
away their comfort zones.
</P>
<P>
   She cited a 1996 town hall debate in San Diego. Dole strategists
worried about Clinton moving close to the audience, the way he did
in 1992 in Richmond. To prevent wandering, they demanded that the
area in front of the podiums be marked with tape.
</P>
<P>
   When Dole arrived to inspect the stage, he asked about the tape
in the shape of a baseball coaching box in front of the podium.
Informed that the candidates could not move beyond the tape, Dole
demanded, ``You mean I can't move around?'' He heatedly pointed out
that his political career began with town hall meetings in Russell,
Kansas. But his negotiators had, quite literally, boxed him in.

   SCRANTON, Pa. _ ``Battleground Scranton,'' said a banner
headline in The Tribune on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to seem as though they're running for president
of Pennsylvania,'' commented The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. Last week alone, Vice President Al Gore
campaigned in Philadelphia on Sunday, Pittsburgh on Monday and the
Scranton area on Thursday. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was in
Allentown and Scranton on Tuesday, Scranton on Wednesday and
Pittsburgh on Friday. Lest anyone's attention wander, Dick Cheney,
Bush's running mate, hit the Philadelphia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   By early last week, the Democrats and the Republicans had each
spent over $5 million in Pennsylvania, in soft money and hard, on
television advertising. By late last week, Bush had been to the
state 14 times and Gore had made no fewer than 17 campaign visits.
On the most recent one he pleased local chauvinists by commenting,
``I believe that this state is literally the Keystone State, and
I'm going to continue to spend an enormous amount of time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole aside, Pennsylvania is one of the handful of states _
six, eight, maybe 10, depending on who's counting _ where the
presidential race of 2000 will be decided. Even after decades of
population decline, it still casts 23 electoral votes, more than
any other closely contested state. So when public and private polls
suggested the start of a slide toward Gore, Bush stormed in to try
to halt the slide, and the vice president arrived to try to keep
the momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' Gov. Tom Ridge, a Bush confidant, said
in an interview. ``Gore got a huge bump out of his party's
convention. It was very surprising, an enigma to me. But I'll tell
you, we're not in such bad shape. Even or a few points behind,
running against the vice president when times are good, a strong
economy and no war _ sign me up, I'll take a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said he thought Bush needed to ``maximize voters' chances
to see him personally, because he's the more likable of the two
candidates, close up.'' Bush seems to be moving in that direction,
with his staff's promises on Thursday to hold town meetings like
the ones he held in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   What Ridge did not say, but virtually every other politician in
the state has been saying for weeks, is that Bush has been
handicapped by his vice presidential choice. Had he chosen Ridge,
the pros here say, he would have won the state with ease and gained
ground in other states that are witnessing hand-to-hand political
combat this fall, like Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of making that choice, said Joseph DiSarro, chairman
of the political science department at Washington and Jefferson
College, ``he chose Dick Cheney, who has been a dud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No excitement at all,'' DiSarro added. ``Two white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant males, which doesn't put much of a fresh face on the
Republican Party. Whereas the Democrats chose Lieberman, who's
perfect for Pennsylvania _ a very personable but unconventional and
socially conservative Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a somewhat unconventional state, politically speaking.
It has relatively few registered independents. It has almost half a
million more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, but
the Democrats are an unorthodox breed _ more conservative than most
in their party and much less supportive of ideas like abortion
rights and gun control. Bill Clinton carried the state easily in
1992 and 1996, but Republicans control the governorship, three of
the four other statewide offices and both Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, given the paucity of officially independent
voters, party-lining does not play well here. A candidate is
``better off here to be viewed as an independent,'' Ridge said,
``because up-and-down anything _ liberal, conservative _ is not
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's population of 12 million is older than that of
most states; many of its young people leave, and few come here from
elsewhere. Only 13 congressional districts have older populations
than Rep. Paul Kanjorski's district, centered on Wilkes-Barre, a
weary anthracite coal town a few miles southwest of here, and all
13 are in the retirement havens of Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, hardscrabble places with scores of
vacant and boarded-up buildings downtown, people count on
Washington for help. For decades they got it from their men in
Washington, Reps. Daniel Flood and Joseph McDade, but both left
office under clouds of scandal. Some local people still say of
them, ``If they stole, at least they stole for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So issues like Social Security, Medicare and especially
prescription drugs, important everywhere this fall, are critical in
this region and this state. Both candidates have shown commercials
about health care in Pennsylvania, and next month a group from
Scranton and elsewhere in the state is taking a bus trip to Canada
to buy drugs, because they are cheaper there.

<P>
   Kanjorski, a Democrat, recently held eight town meetings on
health issues and drew the largest crowds of his career _ more than
500 people in some cases, many of them recently left in the lurch
when two of the area's major managed-care plans, run by Blue Cross
and Geisinger, were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure for weeks to state a detailed position on
prescription drugs, Bush did so on his visits to Allentown and
Scranton, proposing a plan that would rely much more heavily than
Gore's on the states and on the big health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge had been among those pressing him in private
conversations, and he enthusiastically supported the new Bush plan.
Pennsylvania already has the largest state prescription-drug
program, paid for by state lottery money; it will cost $290 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the need to attract uncommitted voters, who here as
elsewhere tend to be turned off by excessive partisanship, Bush
repeatedly promised a bipartisan approach to the health-care
problem and mentioned Democratic senators with whom he said he
could work well, like John Breaux of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very critical week,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson,
dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania, which studies news coverage. ``The question is: Will
Bush get the traction he needs on this issue? The proposals are
complicated, but what emerges from the media is pretty simple: Both
have plans now; Gore would spend more money.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who lost coverage, Jacob Nykaza of Jermyn, near
Scranton, told The Tribune: ``We have to decide who has the better
program. Either one should be better than nothing.'' His
medications cost $35 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did something else here that could have a considerable
impact among the large numbers of Roman Catholic voters in Scranton
and Wilkes-Barre, most of whom strongly oppose abortion, as does
Bush. There are no abortion clinics in Lackawanna County (Scranton)
or Luzerne County (Wilkes-Barre). Although he said nothing publicly
about abortion, Bush paid a well-publicized 40-minute call on
Bishop James C. Timlin of Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, an outspoken opponent of abortion, said afterward
that the visit had nothing to do with politics. But it certainly
sent a message, especially since he had forbidden a planned
appearance earlier this year by Gore, an abortion rights supporter,
at the Catholic Mercy Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the church has given its tacit approval to Bush,''
said Steve Corbett, a columnist for The News-Leader in
Wilkes-Barre. ``That's how people will interpret it. You're in the
heart of anti-abortion country.''
</P>
<P>
   This area is not nearly as populous, of course, as Philadelphia
or Pittsburgh. But it is closely balanced in partisan terms. Rep.
Donald Sherwood, whose district is centered on Scranton, won by
only 515 votes in 1996, defeating Patrick Casey, a son of former
Gov. Robert Casey and a brother of the state auditor, Robert Casey
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, a Democrat, is running again, which should guarantee a
big turnout and a close presidential contest in a district that
President Clinton won in 1996 but lost to President George Bush in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is about two things,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a
professor at Millersville University. ``Can Gore hold onto the
socially conservative working-class Catholics in the hard-coal
country in the northeast and the soft-coal country in the
southwest, the ones you call Reagan Democrats and we call Casey
Democrats? And can Bush hold onto the weakly leaning Republicans,
fiscally conservative but not anti-government, in the suburban
counties around Philadelphia, especially the well-educated women?''
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh on Sept. 5 and 6 and
released on Thursday put Gore at 53 percent and Bush at 42 percent,
with 4 percent opting for other candidates and 1 percent undecided.
The survey questioned 800 likely voters, pushing them to state a
preference even if they were unsure; the margin of sampling error
was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, a pollster himself, said he thought Gore's lead was
more like 4 to 6 percentage points. He said that because he did not
believe the race had settled yet, he had delayed a new poll until
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   All the polls show big gender gaps. A poll taken for another
western Pennsylvania television station, WPXI, indicates that
Gore's entire margin comes from women. And they all show Bush
fading in the pivotal suburban counties that surround Philadelphia
_ Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware and Chester.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Oxman, a Democratic campaign consultant in Philadelphia,
said the Republican National Convention, held there, was the
catalyst. Polls that Oxman had taken for local and regional
candidates, he said, showed that both Bush and Gore have now
consolidated 92 percent to 93 percent of their bases, which yields
Gore a significant advantage, given the big Democratic registration
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was doing nicely, Oxman said, ``and then bam! this yawning
gender gap opens up, and you suddenly have Gore running strongly in
the Main Line, especially among the moderate and upscale women
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With that constituency, abortion is hurting Bush, Jamieson of
the Annenberg School said. Although he mentioned the subject only
briefly in his acceptance speech, she said, his position, the
platform position and that of Cheney were all discussed at length
in the local news media during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters here know just where he stands,'' she said.

   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Something terrible happened to Venecia
Barona Mosquera, something senseless but horribly common among the
people who have been displaced from the parts of Colombia
brutalized by war and who have sought uncertain refuge here in the
squalor of a shantytown named Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Barona left her village, Chicorodo, one morning in June to cut
sugar cane, and when she returned she said she found her father and
two brothers shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Her 10-year-old daughter, Judith, was lying half-conscious under
a mango tree, her skull partially crushed, probably by a rifle
butt.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-right paramilitaries had killed more than 20 people,
punishing the villagers for giving food to an insistent Marxist
guerrilla band who had been roaming the northern province of
Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
   So the 28-year-old Barona immediately packed up her belongings
and headed here to Cartagena, with her bleeding daughter bundled in
her arms, only for Judith to die a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never go back,'' she said, a tear tracing her cheek.
``But at least I can calm down here. Now I'm looking for a good man
to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Mandela, where 45,000 people live under rusty corrugated
roofs and sheets of plastic, may seem an unlikely place to seek
calm. But it is growing every day with people like Barona, one of
an estimated 150,000 Colombians driven from their homes this year
alone as they have been squeezed between leftist guerrillas and
rightist paramilitaries loosely linked to local military units.
</P>
<P>
   In all, an estimated 2 million Colombians have been uprooted in
recent years, according to the Consultancy for Human Rights and the
Displaced, a private research group based in Colombia. That is more
than the number that fleed the war in Kosovo last year. Of all the
countries of the world suffering from the miseries of war, only
Sudan and Angola have more displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the United States poised to deliver a new $1.3
billion aid package, most of it for the military, Colombia's
residents and officials fear that the war will intensify, and that
the number of people displaced will increase.
</P>
<P>
   Those being displaced live mostly in rural areas, though some
are middle class, who want only to live and work in peace and do
not care to choose a side in a war in which not choosing a side has
become an impossible luxury.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of people displaced are the victims of the
paramilitaries, which seek to drain towns of suspected guerrilla
sympathizers, but which sometimes simply do the dirty work for
large landowners who want to expand their holdings for cattle
raising, coca growing or mining.
</P>
<P>
   Those displaced bring few usable skills for surviving in the
already overburdened cities to which they have flocked _ places
like Cartagena, Bogota, Medellin and Cali. The urban squalor that
is gathering in these cities breeds despair, family violence and
crime, and the shantytowns increasingly serve as recruitment
centers for guerrilla and paramilitary groups, flush with drug
money to provide decent food and clothes to their fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't settle the war in Colombia without dealing with the
problem of the displaced,'' said Jorge Rojas, the director of the
Consultancy for Human Rights: ``It's central.''
</P>
<P>
   The displaced are part of an even larger phenomenon that
includes about 800,000 Colombians who have fled the country of 40
million people in the last four years. Many of those have sheltered
themselves across the borders with Panama and Venezuela, becoming
international refugees and an increasing burden for Colombia's
neighbors. Thousands more middle class and wealthy Colombians have
fled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Colombian officials acknowledge the problem of the
displaced, but say they must focus more effort on finding new
homes, jobs and alternative crops for coca growers and other people
who will see their livelihoods and homes affected by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $7.5 billion in the new ``Plan Colombia'' that was kicked
off when President Clinton visited Colombian President Andres
Pastrana in Cartagena recently, $500 million is allotted directly
to helping people displaced by the fighting and $1 billion to
develop crop alternatives to cocoa, from which cocaine is
processed. The primary aim of the plan is to reduce coca
cultivation by 50 percent in five years and to extend the reach of
the central government.
</P>
<P>
   In Nelson Mandela, where displaced people have squatted on tiny
plots of land without ownership titles, few have running water and
most steal their electricity from a public utility company that
looks the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Cartagena's mayor, Gina Benedetti de Velez, said she needs $50
million a year to take care of the housing, education and health
needs of the displaced population growing in shantytowns like
Nelson Mandela, but that would be nearly one-third of her entire
city budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't have the capacity to take care of these
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first displaced people who came here six years ago were
apparently full of faith in the future. The mostly black and
mulatto Colombians here named their new community after the South
Africa leader out of black pride, and they named their streets
Hope, Bethlehem and Victory.
</P>
<P>
   But today there is misery everywhere in Nelson Mandela _
barefoot children go to schools without notebooks, fathers bore
holes in industrial water pipes to give their families contaminated
water, mothers poke through garbage to salvage refuse to sell. But
what stands out most are the harrowing stories of brutality that
forced these people to leave their homes in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stories was that of Barona, whose family was killed
and who is now alone but determined to go on. With wood donated by
the Catholic Church, she is building a new shack for herself. She
borrowed 50 cents from one of her new neighbors to start a business
selling bags of fresh water, and now she is making a dollar a day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another story is that of Eloy Teran, 54, who with his wife and
nine children abandoned the town of San Onofre in Sucre province
four months ago after life simply became intolerable. Guerrillas
and paramilitaries, he said, started invading the town last
December on alternating weeks, killing the corn, banana and rice
farmers and their families, apparently at random.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you why they killed,'' he said, shrugging and
swinging his legs nervously from the side of a makeshift table.
``They killed our friends, our neighbors, and then the point came
when we decided we couldn't take it anymore, and we just decided to
leave.''
 &UR;  &LR; The Rev. Rafael Castillo, a Catholic priest who works in Nelson
Mandela, said, ``The people are stuck like pieces of cheese between
slices of bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of irregular war, you are forced to define
yourself on one side or the other, and the civilian population
suffers atrocities from both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Llorente, a 50-year-old cattle rancher who once lived
outside the town of Turbo, allowed a regular army patrol to sleep
in his house for two nights last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd have a problem,'' he recalled, since it's
a custom in Colombia to be hospitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day after the unit left, eight guerrillas of Colombia's
largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
came by the house and took away his 20-year-old son, Neilson Jose.
A few days later, Neilson Jose was found along a road with three
bullet holes in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Llorente immediately left for Cartagena with his wife, four
surviving children and five grandchildren. They were so scared, he
said, they left their 60 head of cattle behind, which Llorente said
the guerrillas have since stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about where I am
going to find food the next day,'' Llorente said, a man whose
clothes and mannerisms reflect a middle-class background. ``I was
never a rich man, but I wasn't poor, either. But now, I am a hungry
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, too, the war is bearing down on Nelson Mandela and
other barrios full of the displaced. Castillo said that, of the 15
people killed in the community this year, six were taken from their
homes in the middle of the night by unidentified men thought to be
either guerrillas or member of paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago a local rebel unit kidnapped an engineer working
to build two schools in Nelson Mandela and demanded $250,000 in
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew we had donation money to help the displaced,''
Castillo said, and a settlement was eventually worked out for a
$10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them: `Why are you destroying what you say you want
to construct for the poor,''' Rafael recalled. ``A comandante
answered, `I know we make mistakes, but you have to pay.'''

JUDICIAL CAPRICE IN CHINA: 4 FAMILIES SHARE STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENGDE, China _ Their voices cracking with outrage and
disbelief, the parents gathered in a village farmhouse, chronicling
four years of fear and frustration as they battle to keep their
four sons from being executed for the alleged robbery and killing
of two taxi drivers six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale that illustrates the pitfalls of China's criminal
justice system and highlights the sometimes capricious imposition
of the death sentence in a country that executes more prisoners
each year than the rest of the world combined.
</P>
<P>
   Three times since 1996, the same local court has convicted a son
from each of these four farming families of murder, and sentenced
all of them to death. All three times, those convictions by the
same three-judge panel were overturned on appeal. The Hebei
provincial high court cited credible evidence that the confessions
were extracted by torture, potential witnesses were threatened by
police, exonerating records were suppressed and key forensic tests
were crudely doctored.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the defendants _ two farmers, a truck driver and a factory
welder of ages ranging from 28 to 35 _ remain imprisoned in
Chengde, a onetime imperial playground that is today a major
tourist center. Some time this fall they are to be tried once more
on the same charges, by the same local court, possibly to face
another death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have so far escaped execution only because their
families _ all farmers and workers _ were willing to bear official
persecution and severe financial strains to mount repeated legal
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a family home in the village of Zhuangtouying in a hillside
tangle of vegetable gardens, chicken coops and simple brick houses,
the parents could scarcely contain their rage and tears. ``We four
families have protested and protested, but all we've ever met with
from officials is curses and humiliation,'' said Yang Shuxia, the
mother of 28-year-old defendant Zhu Yanqiang. ``Year after year,
every month, every week, every moment, this has hung over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xioqin, the mother of Chen Guoqing, 30, another defendant,
said, ``These boys aren't the culprits! The authorities just picked
on them because they think the common people won't fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chengde, the law enforcement officials just toy with common
people's lives,'' added Wang, 52, her worn farmers' clothing
smudged with mud.
</P>
<P>
   Violent or grossly unfair practices by police, prosecutors and
local courts are common in China, especially outside major cities.
Cases of torture and wrongful imprisonment are increasingly
reported in the controlled Chinese press, a sign that the central
leadership feels it must acknowledge and attack a problem that for
most Chinese is a more immediate human rights concern than any
grand issue of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The continued prosecution in Chengde is ``out of step with the
demands of a society under the rule of law,'' a prominent Beijing
attorney, Jiang Xiaoming, wrote in a Beijing newspaper last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the case in Chengde appears to be extreme, similar
ones are quite common in China, and I don't mean just a handful of
them,'' said Hu Yunteng, an authority on criminal procedure and the
death penalty with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in
Beijing as well as a practicing defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The number of executions in China is treated as a state secret,
but according to incomplete numbers gleaned by Amnesty
International from news accounts, close to 2,000 people have been
put to death annually in recent years, an unknown share of them
based on questionable convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Hu said that despite major improvements in the criminal
procedure code that took effect in 1997, important shortcomings
remain, such as a lack of protection from double jeopardy. More
common threats to fairness include a traditional, widely shared
assumption in China that ``if evidence points toward an individual,
he must be guilty,'' Hu said. And in many localities, legal experts
say, Communist Party officials, police and prosecutors hold sway
over the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public security organs can be very powerful,'' Hu said,
``and to their way of thinking, once they've expended so much time
and energy on a case, if a verdict of innocence comes in, they find
this very hard to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Torture of defendants is not rare, many lawyers say, and is
often overlooked by judges. In the Chengde case, interrogators
applied an electric prod to one man's genitals, inserted an
electrified wire into the anus of another and beat one of the men
to a pulp with an iron rod, according to relatives and defense
attorneys and the testimony of cell mates. Reached by telephone,
two different Chengde police officials refused to comment on the
torture charges.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual aspect of this case is the critical scrutiny it has
received in newspapers outside of Hebei province. The Aug. 10 issue
of Southern Weekend, a nationally circulated newspaper published in
Guangzhou, printed a detailed expose, including excerpts from the
appeals court's description of glaring inconsistencies in the
forensic evidence and of the alleged torture. Key tests of blood
samples used to tie defendants to the killing, for example, were
dated days before the men had even been detained, according to the
court record.
</P>
<P>
   But few residents of Chengde have heard any of this: Local media
have not reported on the legal reversals and charges of official
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the prosecutions, Miao Hongqing, an administrator of
the Chengde intermediate court, where the convictions occurred,
admitted to Southern Weekend that investigators had sometimes been
careless with evidence but that all the defendants had confessed,
and the circumstantial evidence and blood tests all matched up. He
accused the families of colluding to make up alibis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case can't be wrong,'' Miao said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started when the police accused Chen Guoqing of raping
a girl from a street stall,'' said his mother. ``They fined him $36
but he refused to pay, saying he was innocent. A few days later, he
was taken away and tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   In police hands, Chen not only confessed to a role in the
killings but implicated more than a dozen of his fellow villagers.
Some have fled the area and others were not prosecuted for unknown
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives insist that the men have strong alibis.
</P>
<P>
   His family swears that Chen Guoqing, for example, was on duty at
a local boiler plant during one of the killings. A defense attorney
said that factory records proving Chen's claim had been introduced
at trial, but ignored by the judges.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the nights he is accused of committing murder, Zhu
Yangqiang was at home in bed with an intravenous drip, on his
second day of recovery from a street fight, according to his mother
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Wanying said his son, defendant Yang Shiliang, 35, who is
married with an 11-year-old boy, had high earnings driving a 5-ton
truck that the extended family had bought with pooled resources.
His wife, father and father-in-law all had steady jobs with decent
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fu Yiru, the mother of the fourth defendant, 28-year-old He
Guoqiang, said that once they heard their son was a suspect they
urged him to turn himself in to clear his name, and he agreed.
``How we regret it now!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As it repeatedly overturned the convictions, the Hebei
provincial high court declared, ``The facts are unclear and the
evidence is insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, this should lead to a presumption of innocence and
the appeals court could have ordered the men released rather than
giving local officials the option of a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of ingrained assumptions about guilt, personal and
political ties between the courts and even concern about the lower
court's possible financial liability for wrongful imprisonment,
flawed cases are often sent back in this manner to the original
venue, said Hu, the legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of criminal cases like this one, going back and
forth like a Ping-Pong match,'' Hu said.

 &HT;    Record clear: Cheney votes were conservative as foes portray
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four hundred eight of 417 House members voted for a
proposal in March 1988 to allow federal employees to donate
vacation days to colleagues who faced a medical or family
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott and Dennis
Hastert were among the 165 Republicans who voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, then Wyoming's lone representative in the House,
was one of nine Republicans who voted no. That vote came during
Cheney's last full year in the House of Representatives. He would
become Secretary of Defense early in George Bush's administration
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush picked Cheney as
his running mate in July. Since then, his voting record has been
picked over in a haphazard fashion _ a vote here and there to
illustrate whatever point someone has wanted to make about the man.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Cheney's full voting record in 1988 brings
into even sharper focus where he stood in the House throughout his
10-plus years in Congress _ among its most conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on allowing federal workers to donate unused vacation
days to a colleague was one of dozens in which he voted against
even the overwhelming majority of fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 29 members, all but one Republican, to oppose
compiling hate-crime statistics for crimes committed on the basis
of race, religion, ethnicity or homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote that has already drawn a lot of attention, Cheney was
one of four Republicans to oppose banning handguns which lack a
sufficient amount of metal to be picked up by metal detectors in
airports and other settings
</P>
<P>
   He was among 51 members who voted against the banning of lawn
darts, which killed or seriously injured several children in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently sided with President Reagan, although he broke
with the administration at times, including a vote in which he was
one of 18 members to oppose financial aid for drought-stricken
farmers. He received a 100 percent rating from the American
Conservative Union in 1988. The Americans for Democratic Action
gave him a zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely is almost a Libertarian in the sense that he
doesn't want the federal government to be involved in almost
everything but national security and foreign policy,'' said James
Thurber, a political scientist at American University. ``Just
because someone gets hit in the head with a lawn dart, or several
people, he doesn't want the federal government dealing with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurber, who studies Congress, described Cheney as an
``ideologue,'' but one whose demeanor with his colleagues was
always pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Another political scientist, who once served as an intern in
Cheney's congressional office, rejected the characterization of
Cheney as an ideologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Dick Cheney is an extremist ideologue is
absurd,'' said William Connelly of Washington and Lee University in
Lexington, Va. But, ``there is no question he is a small-government
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100th Congress that finished its work in 1988 drew
widespread praise as the most productive in years.
</P>
<P>
   It capped costs for Medicare recipients who were struck by
catastrophic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It toughened welfare requirements and provided the first
significant federal money for AIDS programs and expanded assistance
for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   It banned plastic handguns and reversed a Supreme Court ruling
that weakened civil-rights laws to protect women, racial and
religious minorities and the disabled from discriminatory
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It forced employers to provide 60 days' notice before closing
plants and strengthened enforcement of the federal fair-housing
law.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney opposed all these measures, except the last two, which he
did not vote on, among the 98 recorded votes he missed in 1998
(more than a fifth of votes taken in the House), according to vote
tallies maintained by Congressional Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 12 years, Congress enacted the 13 major
appropriations bills to pay for government operations. And it
accomplished that task on time, avoiding the catch-all bills that
conservatives complain are often larded with pet projects and
wasteful spending. Cheney voted for only five of those bills.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Cheney at the
Bush-Cheney campaign headquarters in Austin, Tex., said that Cheney
routinely opposed spending bills in his time in Congress, an era of
deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   The drought-relief bill was ``too expensive,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Cheney's votes ``were cast in opposition to or protest
to the heavy-handed tactics of Democratic leaders at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Weiss cited the practice of bringing up bills for
consideration on the House floor ``under suspension of the rules.''
This procedure allows bills to bypass the legislative routine,
including being subject to amendment, and limits debate on the
House floor to a total of 40 minutes. It is most often used for
noncontroversial bills.
</P>
<P>
   She said Cheney's vote against donating vacation days could be
explained by his opposition to the suspension procedure. ``An issue
that important should not be considered with limited debate and no
opportunity for amendment,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.), the sponsor of the legislation,
recalled it differently: ``It was completely noncontroversial. We
thought that was a great humanitarian compassionate gesture and
really didn't cost the government anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, Cheney often voted for legislation that was
handled in similar fashion. Indeed, in 1988, Cheney voted 80 times
for legislation that was brought up under suspension of the rules.
Weiss said that in those cases, the legislation was either routine
_ naming of a building, for example _ or so vitally important that
it needed to be moved along quickly.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Election is too early to call
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Will Rogers said he wasn't a member of any
organized political party _ he was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   After this past week, you could say the same about being a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush couldn't seem to say anything right,
with the possible exception of his characterization of a New York
Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who went into the conventions looking
like a sacrificial lamb and came out a hooking bull, continued to
stay even or slightly ahead of Bush in the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Republicans have stopped thinking of Gore in the
past tense, which, as if they need reminding, is ``Gored.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, same as most everybody else, I would have bet money
on Bush as the next president. I don't know exactly where he went
wrong, but it was somewhere on the road leading out of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of Dick Cheney as a vice presidential running mate
didn't help. The man comes across as reserved to the point of
seeming arrogant, which is hard to imagine _ an arrogant
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Good ol' Joe Lieberman, the orthodox Jew who Gore tapped as his
vp sidekick, has managed to do what was even more difficult to
imagine _ cast the Democratic Party in a godly light.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Joe you can't help but think of Job.
</P>
<P>
   That must come as quite a shock for those righteous
right-wingers who equate the G.O.P. with G-O-D.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, something to always keep in mind: Not all Republicans
are of the same mind.
</P>
<P>
   There are two distinct varieties, prayerbook Republicans and
pocketbook Republicans, each easily identified.
</P>
<P>
   Prayerbook Republicans are fierce moralists, hard-core
pro-lifers, the party of the ``Thou Shall Nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbook Republicans are of the free market persuasion, devout
believers that the answer to peace and prosperity for everybody is
having more money in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Think of them as the ``Thou Shall Not Make Rules'' party. The
best way to make a lot of money, they say, is ot to have a lot of
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, for example, is as good a pocketbook
Republican as you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for the GOP nomination for president in 1996 and
being pressed on social issues, he put it this way: ``I'm running
for president, not preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Well said. Never mind that he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said as much, though with a prayerful nod to the
brethren. Asked by Barbara Walters whether he considered it a sin
to be gay, he said he was not going to define sin, that he was a
sinner himself.
</P>
<P>
   Well said. And keep in mind that he won _ leastwise, the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a great divide between prayerbook Republicans and
pocketbook Republicans. But overall, it's a conservative message,
which is what holds them together, especially when the only
alternative is the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with almost two months before election day, best that
you hold all bets on who will be our next president.

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    Leonard cranks out a winner _ again _ with `Pagan Babies'
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In an Elmore Leonard novel, there is only one
truism: Everybody's up to something.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, everybody includes Terry Dunn, a con man whose
latest gig has folks thinking he's a Roman Catholic priest _ which
lets him get away with a lot.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes Debbie Dewey, who did time for nailing her
conniving ex with the front bumper of her Buick. Because he
survived, she wants to get back the money he scammed from her,
which is what made her mad in the first place. Debbie wants Terry's
help and figures out he isn't a priest just in time to take him to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Randy is the ex, and he's trying to turn the restaurant he
bought with Debbie's stolen cash into Detroit's hottest nightspot.
He makes it so hot, in fact, that the mob shows up and tells him
not only will he start running their cal girls from his bar, but
he owes them eight large a week for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Mutt, the addlebrained ex-con to whom Randy
turns to settle a few scores. The Mutt welcomes the chance to start
a brand new career as a hitman. After all, this is Detroit, and
there'll always be work for one _ right?
</P>
<P>
   Right. As usual with Leonard, the characters and schemes and
money all crisscross and double back on themselves at a pace that
seems both breakneck and subtly unhurried. In short, he tells
stories like nobody else working and tells them in a way no other
writer can touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pagan Babies'' starts in Rwanda, of all places, where Dunn is
putting on the Father act for people who've survived that nation's
machete-swinging, genocidal civil war, and need somebody to confess
to. Dunn steps outside the normal channels of penance when a cold
killer goes a bit too far with his good graces, and skips to
Detroit until the air clears.
</P>
<P>
   While he's there, he bumps into Debbie. She bumps back, and
before you know it, they're up to their collars in mob deals,
threats and back stabbing that keep us guessing right up to the
very last page.
</P>
<P>
   After 37 books, Leonard is darn good at this stuff _ and so
beloved by critics and crime readers that the reviews of his work
seemed hackneyed for all the praise. A gazillion reviewers have
noted his knack for jaded, lone-wolf antiheros who manage one
last-minute act of heroism. A billion more have spoken in hushed
tones about the dead-on, perfect pitch of Leonard's dialogue, and
scads of lesser writers (OK, they're all lesser) have tried to ape
his style without even realizing that's what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard is so darn good, in fact, and gives the impression of
such effortlessness, that his artistry can be missed, taken for
granted. Setting his novels so often among the underworld rabble of
Miami, Detroit, Atlantic City, N.J., and LA may give the whiff of
sameness but pay it no mind. Plunge in and enjoy. Breathe deep the
aroma of gunpowder and laundered money, after-hour bars and
fear-sweat _ and don't mind that man behind the curtain. It's just
Elmore Leonard, once again manipulating people's basest motivations
for our grand entertainment, and getting away with murder.

 &HT;    WW II vet finds honor after 54 years of shame
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITMAN, Ga. _ A World War II veteran with a Purple Heart and
Bronze Star has finally gotten the white discharge papers that
eluded him for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When J. C. Slaughter, 78, left the Army in 1946, he was given
what he thought was a dishonorable discharge, printed on blue
paper. Honorable discharges are printed on white. Although
Slaughter had won medals, including the Combat Infantry Badge, to
him the blue paper _ which indicates a discharge under ``other than
honorable'' circumstances _ was the only memento of his military
service that counted.
</P>
<P>
   It was his blue badge of shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew anything about Daddy's military service,'' said
his only child, Viola Slaughter-Frazier of Lake Wales, Fla. ``He
never discussed that time.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, Slaughter finally told his daughter what had
happened. She began trying to right what she felt was a wrong done
to her father.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, an Army review board recommended Slaughter's
discharge be upgraded to honorable, making him eligible for
treatment in a veteran's hospital, a free headstone and burial in a
national cemetery, said W. W. Osborn, who reviewed Slaughter's case
for the Army's Review Boards in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter grew up in the tiny Pidcock community west of Quitman,
finishing the fifth grade before quitting school to help on the
family farm. He was 20 and married when the Army drafted him to
serve in the infantry in 1942. A month after being sent into combat
in Italy, he was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started firing at us and we got the order to withdraw,''
Slaughter said. ``But we couldn't so we started to dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   The first mortar shell fell three feet away but didn't go off,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second one went 'boom' and knocked the other guy right out
of the foxhole and killed him dead,'' Slaughter said. ``It blew a
big hole high up here on my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter spent three months in a Naples, Italy, hospital, then
returned to his unit though his leg hadn't healed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still raw and had stitches in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to a field kitchen. ``But another officer told
me to get up to the front lines. I told him I wasn't able to make
it, that my leg wouldn't hold up,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   He sustained ``multiple, moderately severe, penetrating shrapnel
wounds to his right thigh'' and was also suffering from mental
trauma, an Army report said.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter said he wasn't fit for combat. He believed he would
been killed because he couldn't move around well.
</P>
<P>
   Army authorities said it would serve no purpose to punish
Slaughter for disobeying the order because he was, one report said,
``a soldier whom the medical experts in effect say is not normal
under battle stimuli. This soldier had been wounded and this wound
was no doubt the cause of his unusual fear and nervousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army court martialed him, gave him a life sentence and sent
him to an Italian prison.
</P>
<P>
   During his two years in prison, Slaughter's wife divorced him,
sending Viola to live with his mother. Prison life was grim and
food was scarce.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his mother, asking her to send him a cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They read my letter and put me in the sweat box for 14 days,
just for asking for a cake,'' Slaughter said. Slaughter's life
sentence was reduced after another military psychiatrist examined
him in March 1946, and also found his punishment unreasonable.
Slaughter, he said, was ``rather inarticulate and reacts with naive
directness to most situations . . . if restoration (to the Army) is
not considered it is recommended that he be separated from the
military service with a white discharge on the basis of mental
deficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Slaughter, over 6 feet tall but weighing
just 135 pounds, was shipped to Texas, given his blue discharge and
told to go home.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a bus ticket to Birmingham, Ala. ``I had to get Mama
to wire me some money to make it the rest of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved in with his mother and Viola, then 4. He later married
a woman who helped him raise his only child. He farmed and did
construction work, eventually making $5 an hour. His wounded leg
always bothered him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept feeling something in there and I kept picking and
pulling and finally pulled some stitches out,'' he said. ``I still
have a shell fragment in my leg now. It bothers me whenever it
clouds up.'' Until he was 70, he'd never seen another doctor, his
daughter said. ``I finally made him go,'' she said. Slaughter's
sense of shame over his blue discharge bothered him most, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although his discharge was actually ``other than honorable,''
Slaughter always believed it was dishonorable.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Army has given him an honorable discharge, people
keep asking how much money he'll get. He doesn't know, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to build a six-room house for me and my wife,'' he
said. He and his wife, Bertha Mae, live in the cramped frame house
built 100 years ago by Slaughter's grandparents on flood-prone land
near a railroad track. Bertha Mae, now 74, does shift work at a
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter will receive no financial restitution, Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court martial was legal,'' Osborn said. ``We're not saying
anything wrong happened to him back then. We're saying the
situation is now unjust. I'm terribly sorry there's not a pot of
gold associated with this. The guy could have a Medal of Honor and
the Army wouldn't give him enough money to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Osborn said, Slaughter did disobey a direct order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of military discipline depends on people
doing what they're told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter's daughter doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did to my daddy was wrong and they knew it was
wrong,'' she said. ``I guess I'll just have to keep fighting until
they make it right.''

   Arizona GOP Race Rife With Dirty Tricks
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., is not running for re-election this
year in his state's 1st Congressional District. But the betting is
that the district will remain in Republican hands _ unless the
Republicans battling for their party's nomination in Tuesday's
primary self-destruct and the lightly regarded Democratic nominee,
David Mendoza, ekes out a victory come the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the five Republican hopefuls _ Susan Bitter Smith and Tom
Liddy _ have been accusing each other of engaging in convoluted
dirty tricks. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   Liddy, a lawyer and the son of G. Gordon Liddy (he of Watergate
dirty tricks infamy), says Bitter Smith, a cable television
executive, slipped him a file that contained personal information
about a third candidate, Jeff Flake, former executive director of
the Goldwater Institute. As Liddy tells it, Bitter Smith then urged
him to leak the file to reporters, something he says he refused to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter Smith contends she gave the file to Liddy only after he
requested it. She says she received the file only after one of her
campaign workers obtained it without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Flake has steered clear of all this, saying only that he has no
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, The Arizona Republic, the state's leading
newspaper, suggested that Liddy and Bitter Smith resolve their
differences by taking lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were given on Monday _ by different examiners, with
each candidate helping to word the questions.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   Both passed _ and immediately pledged to focus on issues in the
remaining days before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Prayers Are Answered If Only Symbolically
</P>
<P>
   Religion is back in the political news, this time in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy drought there has parched fields and forests that
usually are all but awash in water, killing crops and leaving piney
woodlands ready to explode in fire. So 10 days ago, Gov. Mike
Foster issued an official proclamation asking Louisianans to pray
for rain.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for Joe Cook of the Louisiana chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cook told The Advocate of Baton Rouge that the governor, a
Republican, had crossed the constitutional line that separates
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Foster countered that elected leaders all over the United States
often called for prayers in times of disaster and hardship. Cook,
he suggested, should ``get a life.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some sprinkles fell.
</P>
<P>
   Did the prayers work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rained today, didn't it?'' the governor replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Same Old Song With a Different Beat
</P>
<P>
   During the 1976 presidential campaign, when President Gerald
Ford was trying to fend off a challenge by Jimmy Carter, Ford's
White House chief of staff, Dick Cheney, helped draw up the defense
plan.
</P>
<P>
   So would that old plan provide some insight into what Cheney
might now be telling his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   The plan is not available, if it ever existed on paper. But
after the election, Cheney wrote a lengthy paper on how Ford ran
the race, and that paper is at the Ford presidential library in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Cheney was advocating 24 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   Erode Carter's support by portraying him as not experienced
enough to be president. Lure him into debates that leave him
appearing ``fuzzy and indecisive'' and out of his depth when asked
for ``specific views on major national issues.'' Exploit
perceptions by some voters that he is arrogant, lacks humility and
tries to be ``all things to all men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed,'' Cheney had said, ``that support was susceptible
of erosion once the public came to know him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Isn't that Al Gore's plan?
</P>
<P>
   Nasty Divorce Battle Finds Home in Politics
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Albert R. Wynn of Maryland's 4th Congressional District
almost certainly will win a fifth term this fall. He is a black
Democrat and his district, on the outskirts of Washington, is
mostly black and mostly Democratic. Further, his Republican
opponent, John Kimble, who is white, has failed in two earlier
challenges to draw more than 15 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kimble is no quitter. In his first run, he offered to
pose nude for Playgirl magazine in an effort to gain attention and
raise money. This time around he has recruited the congressman's
estranged wife, Jessie, to work in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And some work she is doing ...
</P>
<P>
   The Wynns are in a bitter divorce and child custody battle.
Jessie Wynn, who is black, has this to say in a 20-second message
that Kimble is circulating in the 4th District by random telephone
dialing:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, this is Jessie Wynn, wife of Congressman Albert Wynn.
Albert Wynn does not respect black women. He left me for a white
woman. Please send your donations to Kimble for Congress. Help us
defeat Albert Wynn.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Wynn also appears in a photo posted on Kimble's Web site.
She is standing next to a red banner that reads, ``Al Wynn left his
black wife and child for a white woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble acknowledges he is ``playing the race card'' with the
Jessie Wynn attacks. He says it's the only way to beat the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell hath no fury ...''
</P>
<P>
   A Nader Supporter Voices 2nd Thoughts
</P>
<P>
   The way Bert Garskof of Bethany, Conn., saw it during the 1996
presidential election, another Connecticut boy, Ralph Nader, was
the best man for the job. So Garskof, a psychology professor at
Quinnipiac University, working on the Internet, worked with Nader
supporters in a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. This is now _ and now Garskof has a problem. He
is married to the sister of Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that while Nader, now as in 1996, has no chance
of becoming president, he has enough support to steal some votes
from Al Gore in some states, no small thing in a close election. Or
as Garskof put it the other day, something he helped start now has
``a potential to hurt something I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   He has begun warning Nader supporters not to ``throw away''
their vote on a ``dream,'' arguing that Nader, for all the good
things he supports, like a cleaner environment, cannot win. Go with
someone who can win, he says, go with Al Gore and brother-in-law
Lieberman.

RUSSIA POISED TO CUT MILITARY BY ONE THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story is now a Page One reefer.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Late last month, President Vladimir Putin faced a room
full of angry Russians, the relatives of the 118 men who perished
on the nuclear submarine Kursk. He told them bluntly that Russia
``had to have a smaller army,'' one that was better equipped and
``technically perfect'' to protect soldiers and sailors from
disaster and defend national interests.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev appeared to
promise just such a force. While visiting a tank test range outside
Moscow, he was asked by reporters to comment on a report that the
armed forces would be reduced by 350,000 between 2001 and 2003, a
cut of about one-third, from 1.2 million members to about 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions to that effect have been made,'' he said, ``and
proposals on how to proceed are being drafted for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's almost offhand confirmation that Putin has approved
deep cuts in the military followed weeks of speculation in the
Russian news media and a marathon session between Putin and his
national security advisers Aug. 11 on the future of the military.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting occurred a day before the Kursk sank during
military maneuvers in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin later met with the families of the Kursk crew, he
hinted that profound decisions on the reconstruction of Russia's
armed forces had been made. He told them that ``one has to live
according to one's income'' and that Russia had ``wasted money''
trying to support the military structure that the Soviet Union had
maintained during the Cold War. What the country needed, he made
plain, was a smaller force.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions have been passed,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the secret session between Putin and his advisers
still have to emerge fully. But reports in the Russian press this
week said that Putin had decided to cut 400,000 members of Russia's
armed forces, including its many domestic security and intelligence
forces. Sergeyev's comments were in response to these reports.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials say the force-reduction plan will
reach Putin's desk in the coming days. It seems clear that the
Russian leader is undertaking one of the most difficult military
reorganizations since the heyday of the Soviet Union, when Moscow
supported 4.3 million troops in uniform, masses of tank divisions
facing Europe, a deep-water navy and a strategic nuclear arsenal
rivaling that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev did not give a detailed breakdown of the cuts
envisaged, but military officials have been quoted as saying that
ground forces are to be cut by 180,000, the navy by more than
50,000, the air force by about 40,000, interior ministry troops by
20,000, the Federal Security Service and Government Communications
Service by 25,000 and other security forces by 15,000 or more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Putin closeted himself with his senior advisers Saturday as
members of parliament and the military establishment weighed in on
the debate over military power.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Parliament's budget committee, Alexander
Zhukov, said the draft 2001 budget envisages a very large growth in
expenditure for the military, suggesting that Putin may be pursuing
a strategy of raising pay levels in the military as he slashes its
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   After years of contraction that have thrown millions of Russian
officers and soldiers into a depressed economy on meager pensions,
Putin now faces the politically wrenching task of cutting hundreds
of thousands more active-duty slots. Many of these people may be
ill-prepared to find work in a market economy that, while
improving, has contracted by nearly half over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Russia inherited a 2-million-member military establishment after
the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and President Boris Yeltsin
struggled unsuccessfully to cut it to 1.5 million during his first
term in office. After Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, he appointed
Sergeyev as defense minister and over the next four years was able
to reduce the level from 1.7 million to 1.2 million by attrition
and early retirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Kommersant newspaper reported Saturday that as many as
200,000 military personnel are currently near retirement and nearly
100,000 empty slots in the military are unfilled. But the newspaper
added that even if the problem can be partly solved through a
decrease in the number of conscripts, the upcoming reduction will
be the widest.
</P>
<P>
   The former deputy commander of Russian ground forces, Eduard A.
Vorobyov, now a member of parliament, said the sinking of the Kursk
has given Putin a political impetus to push forward quickly with
painful cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a certain impulse for everybody,'' he said,
``including the president as the supreme commander. No matter
whether we wanted to or not, we had to come to the decision made
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired general became famous for resigning his commission
rather than command the Russian assault on the rebellious republic
of Chechnya in December 1994. His endorsement of Putin's plan
indicated that there is significant political support among at
least some military leaders for a rational restructuring of the
armed forces, even if that means further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin met with his security advisers last month, he told
his commanders that the structure of the armed forces is hardly
optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted
in many units, pilots almost do not fly and sailors almost do not
put to sea?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he was after a ``balanced decision,'' one that his
advisers said would plan for rebuilding the military over 15 years
with a greater emphasis on conventional forces and a reduction in
the autonomy and prestige of the Strategic Rocket Forces, which
have been under separate command since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader did not specifically refer to the military's
performance in the past year in Chechnya. Military commanders there
have complained that they have been fighting with out-dated tanks,
helicopters and aircraft while Russia's military industries sell
their best products and technology abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And due to the unpopularity of military service, the army has
failed to meet its monthly conscript quotas in the face of
widespread draft avoidance.

AMONG UNPAID WAGES OF A REVOLUTION: COMPETING CLAIMS ON LAND IN
NICARAGUA

   NAGAROTE, Nicaragua _ Where Emilio Aguilar once raised cattle,
hundreds of families now raise their children.
</P>
<P>
   Small houses line bumpy dirt roads cut through what were the
pastures of Aguilar's 200-acre ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar fled to Honduras after the Sandinistas declared him a
counterrevolutionary in 1979, and since then mayors in this town
about 25 miles northwest of the capital of Managua have handed out
plots to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar returned to Nicaragua in 1991 to reclaim his land, or at
least get compensation. In 1993, the government offered him 15-year
bonds with a face value of $340,000, but he refused to settle
because the securities were denominated in Nicaraguan cordobas, a
currency that has lost about half its value since then.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Aguilar is intent on suing the mayors who gave away his
ranch. If that day ever comes, Exhibit A could be the site of the
courthouse itself, since it is in the middle of his old spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the courthouse here saying it was to impose justice,
but they did it on stolen land,'' said Aguilar, 65. ``I feel this
is all a joke. If there was justice, they would have gotten this
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after the elections that removed the
Sandinistas from power, thousands of Nicaraguans _ as well as about
900 American citizens and even the descendants of the country's
former dictator, Anastasio Somoza _ are grappling with the legacy
of the Sandinista revolution: confiscated land, homes and
businesses that were distributed to peasants and party loyalists
alike.
</P>
<P>
   While few people expected to get back all they owned, even
skeptics decried what they described as convoluted, lengthy
administrative and legal processes that too often result in paltry
settlements paid in low-value government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Untangling the property disputes has proved vexing for the
government, which has little cash and lots of concerns about the
social unrest that could result from dislodging thousands of people
who acquired land through urban development plans and agrarian
reform laws that were legitimate at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine having to say to someone, `You have to leave the land
you had for the last 15 years of your life,''' said the foreign
minister, Eduardo Montealegre, whose own family has yet to recoup
its confiscated properties. ``You either have to resolve it with
new land from the state or pay bonds to the old owners. It is not
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Nicaraguans said that resolving complex and competing
property claims is the biggest hurdle to attracting foreign
investment in the Western Hemisphere's second-poorest nation.
(Haiti is the poorest.) The task grows more complicated with time
because current property holders are selling the land to new buyers
_ including the president, Arnoldo Aleman, who purchased a farm
from an agricultural cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening in this country regarding property is
serious denial of rights,'' said Lino Hernandez, the president of
the Permanent Commission of Human Rights of Nicaragua. ``If there
is no solution to the property question, there will be no security
or investment in this country. Ten years have passed, and we feel
powerless that we cannot find a solution to this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 11 years in power, the Sandinista government confiscated
about 170,000 properties, including many that were seized right
before it relinquished power in 1990 to the administration of
democratically elected President Violeta Chamorro. Property claims
began soon after she took office, increasing under pressure from
American lawmakers who urged her government to settle claims of
Nicaraguans who became American citizens while in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Esteban Duque Estrada did not respond to
repeated requests for an interview, nor did the official in charge
of evaluating property claims. The Finance Ministry's Web site
indicates that more than 7,000 people have filed claims for 17,000
properties, with almost 6,800 claims pending resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Most claims that have been resolved were settled with 15-year
bonds that currently trade for about 20 cents on the dollar of
their face value. Not many more landowners are willing to wait 15
years for the bonds to mature and for the government to pay their
face value. There were expectations that the bonds would be
bolstered by profits from the sale of state-run industries, but
Aleman's administration scuttled those hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan had proceeded, it would have meant little to
the Willey family of Tampa, Fla. In 1951, John Willey, a
Californian who moved to Nicaragua to mine gold, set up an electric
company in Matagalpa. The company stayed in his family until the
Sandinistas nationalized it in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the power company had 6,000 customers. It has since
grown to about 32,000 customers, and on Tuesday the government is
scheduled to sell the company to private investors for anywhere
from $500 to $1,000 a customer. Willey's heirs have been waging an
unsuccessful battle to receive what they regard as a fair price for
their share of the company. While they estimate they could be
entitled to as much as $9 million, the Nicaraguan government in
1998 offered them bonds with a face value of 2.3 million cordobas,
then about $216,000, but which they could have sold immediately for
only $38,000 _ about half what they had been offered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did my grandfather give a lot to that country, but he
built it for his descendants, and I think the Nicaraguan government
should be fair,'' said Carrie Willey-Gagnon, Willey's
granddaughter. ``I don't know if we're ever going to get anything
at this rate. I do not believe the Nicaraguan government is willing
to give up a chunk of what they believe is their property.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite letters from U.S. diplomats and congressmen, the
Nicaraguan government has yet to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government could withhold foreign aid if it felt that
claims on confiscated properties were not being resolved, but it
issued a waiver earlier this month that kept the aid flowing. At
the same time, the U.S. government has urged Nicaragua to take
steps to increase the value of the bonds and make them a more
attractive option.
</P>
<P>
   But a bill recently introduced by Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
would require the U.S. president to submit to Congress the 50 most
pressing claims by U.S. citizens and prevent the president from
overriding a block on aid until the claims had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the Nicaraguan government has grown
complacent,'' said a congressional staff member. ``They think they
will automatically get the waiver and that they are somehow
entitled to it. But this cannot be business as usual. People are
very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Montealegre, the foreign minister, said that the Aleman
administration had resolved more than 1,300 property claims _ at
least four times the number managed under Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that one or two particular cases have not been
resolved does not mean others have not, and we are making an effort
to resolve all,'' he said. ``It is complicated. We have problems in
health, education and housing. We have much poverty the Sandinistas
left us with. It has set us back years. No country is giving us
foreign aid to pay for property. The majority of the people
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sandinistas, now in a strained alliance with the Aleman
party in the National Assembly, said they favored efforts to
compensate people whose property was given to others. But they also
said it was important that the country continue its current program
of granting land title to thousands of people who are occupying
small plots of land for homes and farms. Edwin Castro, a Sandinista
member of the National Assembly, said that land titling was as
important as reparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we legalize it, and if we want to talk about guarantees to
private property, then we should talk about guaranteeing the
property of all people,'' he said. ``But you cannot raise the flag
of private property to favor 500, 50, or 20 claimants to the
detriment of a half million people.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any failure in the revolution, Castro added, it was
not proceeding quickly enough with granting property titles to new
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people seeking to recover property are relatives of
the dictator dislodged by the Sandinistas. Led by Luis and
Alejandro Sevilla-Somoza, two U.S.-born nephews of the dictator
Anastasio Somoza, the Somoza family has so far had no luck, saying
their case is politically untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   The Somoza nephews insisted that the bulk of their properties,
from stock holdings to vast farms and estates, were obtained by
their grandfather legally. Like others who have been frustrated in
reclaiming their land, they have bought some of it on the open
market. They said they wanted their day in court, however, to begin
to clear the family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the last excuse of the revolution,'' said Luis, ``the
evil Somozas who raped the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, like others who have lost property, said Sandinista
officials benefited from the confiscations, including party leaders
who still live in luxury homes taken from exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, what have they done?'' said Alejandro.
``They transferred the wealth from one group to another group. And
who pays for it? The people of Nicaragua.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro dismissed the idea of returning property to the former
dictator's relatives or to his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask about returning the property of the National Guard
or the Somoza family,'' he said. ``That's why there was a
revolution. No one with a historical consciousness would accept
that Versailles should be given back to the French royalty. No one
would dare say that because it would be a historical absurdity.''
</P>

<P>
   ``For Sale'' signs are tacked to fence posts and telephone poles
along the road to El Volcan, a 257-acre farm that belonged to
Genaro Molina's family until the Sandinistas gave it to an
agricultural cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest business for the cooperative farm these days is
selling real estate, as members of the cooperative sell parcels to
people seeking to build houses. With developments being built to
accommodate a flood of people from the city, the region is rife
with speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who have bought from the cooperative are an
American citizen, the sister of a judge and the leader of a
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Molina and the government have yet to agree on how much he
should be compensated for the land, so last year Molina decided to
take back a tiny piece, where he built a guard house and put up a
sign warning potential buyers that the property is in litigation.
Since then he has been able to buy back some of the land from the
cooperative for about $5,700 an acre, less than half the $14,300 an
acre he thinks it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this part by force, so let them take me out,'' Molina
said. ``The Molina family is clear. We will take this to the end.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ When the Summer Games begin here on Friday,
Juan Antonio Samaranch will preside over his final Olympiad before
retiring next year, having transformed the modern Olympic movement
to where it has never been more successful, or more threatened.
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch, the former Spanish ambassador to the Soviet
Union, became president of the International Olympic Committee in
1980, the organization was nearly bankrupt and was caught in a
maelstrom of boycotts that continued through the 1984 Summer Games
in Los Angeles. Now, as Samaranch prepares to step down next July
at age 81, the IOC generates $900 million a year in revenues,
mostly from television and corporate sponsorship. NBC television
alone will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast the five Games between now
and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts are no longer a serious threat; cities are eagerly
bidding to play host to the Games; corporations are shelling out
$50 million apiece to become official Olympic sponsors; athletes
can build long, lucrative careers as professionals; and women are
involved in larger numbers than ever as administrators and
participants.
</P>
<P>
   During his presidency, Samaranch has increased the number of
female IOC members from zero to 13 and the percentage of female
Olympians from 21 percent to 42 percent. Athletes from 199 nations
will participate in Sydney, compared with 80 at the 1980 Summer
Games in Moscow, which more than 50 countries, including the United
States, boycotted.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who
founded the modern Games in 1896, Samaranch ``has been the most
significant leader in modern Olympic history,'' said John MacAloon,
an Olympic historian and professor of social sciences at the
University of Chicago. ``The greatest single accomplishment has
been a kind of political maturity, an ability to deal with
political elites, heads of state, industrial elites. That was
something the movement never really had.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the IOC, the Sydney Games will reach a record
audience, about 3.7 billion of the 3.9 billion people worldwide who
have access to television. Even David D'Alessandro, the president
and chief executive officer of John Hancock and Samaranch's most
vocal corporate critic in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal, has signed on for another four years of Olympic
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling in the end was that the Games were going to emerge
hurt, but not fatally wounded,'' D'Alessandro said. ``I'm
encouraged that what the Olympics stand for continues to grow. No
one really believes in the efficacy of professional sports. There
are an awful lot of clouds around college sports. The Olympics are
the last kind of major sport people can believe in the purity of.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Olympics have been devalued by scandal and
the pervasive use of performance-enhancing drugs, and they have
grown so big that they have become in some ways unmanageable for
the host cities. Sydney, which will welcome 700,000 visitors,
10,438 athletes and 21,046 media representatives, struggled with
its train service and airport baggage handling system even before
the crush of arrivals began. And the New South Wales state
government, which is underwriting the Games, had to issue bailouts
of $56.7 million in May and $84.8 million in June to organizers
because the cost of the Sydney Games had escalated to $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While almost no one believes the Olympics will end any time
soon, Olympic officials, sponsors and independent experts cautioned
that a failure to address these threats could affect the survival
of the Games in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will ever be again a golden age of the
Olympic movement as existed between the Games of Los Angeles in
1984 and Atlanta in '96,'' said John Krimsky, a former executive
director of the United States Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Donna de Varona, a gold medalist in swimming in 1964, has long
been an activist for women's sports and a prominent figure in the
fight against doping. She said she sees troubling similarities
between the current Games and the ancient ones, which had problems
with professionalism, corruption, cheating and bribery before
collapsing after a millennium in 393 A.D. It was 1,500 years before
the Games were revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on parallel tracks,'' de Varona said. ``I think
the Games are coming to an important crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption Uncovered  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corruption, drugs and the unwieldy size of the Games can be
attributed to two things, Samaranch's supporters and detractors
say. First, in his attempt to return the whole world to the
Olympics after crippling boycotts in the 1970s and 1980s, Samaranch
made a number of decisions based on strategy or expediency rather
than principle. Second, he seldom said no.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also made a habit of co-opting his enemies, saying,
``It is better to have them inside than outside.'' But sometimes
that strategy came back to embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic had been an anti-apartheid
activist who led the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in
Montreal. In 1986, Samaranch made him a member of the IOC, and
problems with African participation dissolved. But last year, Ganga
came to represent the most brazen example of the corrupted bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, an investigation revealed, accepted more than $300,000 in
cash payments, medical treatment, travel expenses and even
doorknobs and knee-replacement surgery for his mother-in-law while
Salt Lake City was trying to win the bidding for the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   How did Samaranch, a man of such political savvy, allow the
bidding process to become so corrupted, leading to the resignation
or dismissal of Ganga and nine other of the IOC's 113 members?
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons, say those who have studied the
Olympic movement or who know Samaranch. Samaranch is an imperial
man who likes to be pampered, said John Lucas, an Olympic historian
and retired professor at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ramsamy, an IOC member from South Africa, said Samaranch has
longed for a Nobel Peace Prize and perhaps in the final years of
his presidency he did not want to ``rock the boat'' and threaten
his legacy. Samaranch was a sports bureaucrat and a parliamentary
leader in Spain during Franco's dictatorship, D'Alessandro noted,
when a good deal of corruption was tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Samaranch had snapped his fingers, this wouldn't have
happened,'' Lucas said. ``He either was unaware, looked the other
way or thought it was harmless. What we need is an IOC that is
incorruptible, like Eliot Ness made the FBI. We need a group of
individuals wedded to the Olympic principles, nonpolitical
individuals who cannot be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said in a recent interview that he should probably
have retired after the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Yet
in 1995, he pushed through a rule change that raised the age limit
for president so that he could continue. It was also Samaranch,
having realized the seriousness of the Salt Lake City scandal, who
pushed through a number of reforms. The leader who in the past had
been secretive and autocratic threw open the IOC's books, pushed
through term limits and persuaded members to vote against visiting
the cities that are bidding on the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organization was hurt, but not the Olympic Games,''
Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Polling done by the IOC and the USOC shows that people have made
a separation between corrupt officials and the Games themselves.
Mitt Romney, the venture capitalist brought in to save the Salt
Lake City Games, said that the scandal, construction noise and
traffic problems had made him uncertain whether he would vote to
hold the 2002 Winter Games in Utah if he had to make the choice
now. But he also said that Salt Lake City was obligated to put on
the best Games possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the Olympics as the last great demonstration of peace in
the world,'' Romney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games carry some of the same tarnish as Salt Lake
City. Sydney won the 2000 Summer Games by two votes over Beijing;
the night before the vote, Sydney officials promised $35,000 apiece
to IOC members from Kenya and Uganda. And both Australian IOC
members were implicated during the recent scandal investigations,
one for excessive travel in the Salt Lake City case and for helping
to write dossiers about his fellow members; the other for giving
his daughter a preferred place in the Olympic torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City scandal also confirmed for a number of
athletes and their representatives what they had believed all
along, that they were a low priority with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics could end as far as I'm concerned,'' said Jos
Hermens, a distance runner for the Netherlands at the 1972 Munich
Games who is now a sports agent. ``They have no meaning. It's a
false dream. They build the illusion of brotherhood, but it's just
a commercial venture. It's a bunch of old people misusing
old-fashioned dreams for their own purposes. It's like a cult.
These people are addicted to power.''
</P>
<P>
   How the power shifts after Samaranch's retirement will be of
great interest to U.S. corporate sponsors, which account for about
70 percent of the IOC's commercial income. D'Alessandro, of John
Hancock, said that given the scrutiny of the Salt Lake City scandal
by the American sponsors, Congress and the media, anti-American
sentiment within the IOC has never been higher. If this sentiment
keeps the Games from returning to the United States soon, he said,
American sponsors will drop out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to be careful not to have the American public turn
on them,'' D'Alessandro said. ``When you enter a Faustian bargain
with sponsors, you better have people around who understand
Faustian bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug Problems  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At an IOC meeting in East Berlin in 1985, Samaranch presented
Erich Honecker, the East German president, with the highest honor
he could bestow, the Olympic Order. It was another pragmatic move
by Samaranch, who, a year after the Eastern bloc boycott of the
1984 Games in Los Angeles, was seeking to head off further boycotts
at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. It worked. East
Germany competed in Seoul the year before the Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   But awarding the Olympic Order to Honecker, an honor that had
also been bestowed on Manfred Ewald, who was president of the East
German Olympic Committee, was roundly criticized as giving at least
tacit approval to state-sponsored doping _ a system that was long
suspected and has since been revealed in courts and in released
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Ewald was convicted of masterminding the doping program
in East Germany and was given a 22-month suspended jail sentence.
In a country where sport was used to validate Communist ideology,
the doping system affected as many as 10,000 athletes, many without
their knowledge. A number of the athletes now have heart, kidney
and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to curb the East German doping program, which was an
open secret, ``is the Olympic movement's biggest failure,'' said
Rob Housman, an associate of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey in the White
House drug policy office. ``They knew this stuff was going on. For
years, it was willful blindness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only after the French police uncovered widespread doping at the
1998 Tour de France did an embarrassed IOC rededicate itself to the
problem of performance-enhancing drugs. For too long, the IOC
treated the issue as a public relations problem instead of a drug
problem, said Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion,
who will head an independent drug-testing agency in the United
States after the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 14-year-old kid knows that to be in strength and
endurance sports, if he wants to go on with his career, `I have to
go on these drugs,''' Shorter said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug use has become so pervasive that cheaters have been caught
recently even in table tennis, badminton and synchronized swimming.
Samaranch suggested last year that only drugs that are considered
harmful to an athlete's health should be banned. An uproar
followed, and he backed down. He created the World Anti-Doping
Agency, meant to be independent of the IOC, then decided he wanted
to head the agency. Governments around the world, however, rebuffed
his attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC did make one significant change for the Sydney Games,
approving a blood test for the endurance drug known by its initials
as EPO, which is believed to be widely used in distance running,
cycling and swimming. Independent monitors will also try to make
sure positive results are not covered up, which had been widely
suspected in the past. ``We've come a long way, but we've got a
long way to go,'' said McCaffrey, the White House drug policy
director.
</P>
<P>
   Drug tests will not be available in Sydney for human growth
hormone, insulin growth factor and products that serve as a kind of
artificial blood.
</P>
<P>
   Testing still remains so deficient that athletes cannot prove
their innocence, and athletes at the Sydney Olympics will have to
live with the suspicion that accompanies successful performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the IOC is scared about what could happen if a
large number of great athletes were caught,'' said Ian Thorpe, the
Australian teen-age swimming sensation and an anti-drug advocate.
``What would their image be? I think something has to be done in
the long term or the Olympics will be absolutely ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's resolve on the drug issue was again called into
question last month when the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, track and field's world governing body, cut in half the
two-year ban on Javier Sotomayor, the Cuban world record-holder and
1992 Olympic champion in the high jump. Sotomayor tested positive
for cocaine at the 1999 Pan American Games. Cocaine can serve as a
stimulant during competition. Samaranch kept quiet, allowing a
known drug user into the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been helpful to say, `I won't allow this athlete
into my Games,''' said de Varona, the 1964 swimming champion and a
member of the World Anti-Doping Agency's ethics committee.
``Instead, he turned his head and compromised himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Matters of Size
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has lobbied the presidents of North and South Korea to
march as one country during the opening ceremonies on Friday in
Sydney. Iran and Iraq, also mortal enemies, will file into the
stadium, one behind the other. More than any other moment in sport,
the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games demonstrate the
possibility of an international community. The growing size of the
Games, however, has threatened their ability to be well organized.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in Atlanta, bus drivers frequently got lost and
the IBM computer system could not deliver results in a timely
manner. Anita DeFrantz, an American IOC member, suggested that
Sydney residents avoid using the city's buses and trains for
non-Games activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, known as ``gigantism'' among Olympic officials, has
limited the number of cities that can afford to be host of the
Games and has become so acute that significant changes in the
organization of the Games are being proposed. Princess Anne, an IOC
member from Britain, has called for the removal of all team sports.
A number of people have suggested rotating the Games among a few
cities or establishing a permanent site.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch opened the Olympics to professionals after the 1988
Seoul Games as a way to bring the world's best athletes to the
Games. This ended what many believed was the hypocrisy of
amateurism and allowed athletes to build careers over several
Games. But it also made athletes less dependent on the Olympics;
they can now earn a living in their sports, which have yearly
competitions and world championships that offer prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Professionalism also has created tedium in some sports; in
basketball, for example, the American men's Dream Teams have gone
unchallenged. The end of the Cold War, too, has eliminated the
supercharged political drama that once accompanied competitions
between the United States and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the Dream Team there, the NHL players, I think the
Olympics has lost its purpose, perhaps,'' said Bruce Arena, coach
of the U.S. men's national soccer team, who was the Olympic coach
in 1996. ``When millionaires are winning gold medals all the time,
it takes away from the Olympics I remember 40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Olympics were growing so large and unmanageable, the
IOC separated the years in which the Winter and Summer Games took
place after 1992. Sponsors and various national Olympic committees
were finding it prohibitive to spend so much money in one year.
Now, there is a Winter or Summer Games every two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the increased frequency has cost the Olympics their novelty,
and they must compete for attention on crowded sports calendars.
This is especially true this month, when the Games coincide with
baseball's pennant races and football in the United States and
soccer in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost the symbolism that this is a powerful event, held
once and only once every four years, and an important connection
with a kind of Greek and calendar model in which people live their
lives in four-year increments,'' said MacAloon, the Olympic
historian.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, none of this will be Samaranch's problem. It
will be up to the next generation of leaders to combat the problems
of corruption, drugs and size. Relevancy could also become an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing one has to guard against is that over time,
professional events, or events that have commercialism, have run
their course,'' D'Alessandro, of John Hancock, said. ``We've seen
it happen in the NFL and the NBA. They wax and wane. The Olympics
have been on the rise. There's going to be a trough period where
there may not be as much interest. That's a challenge for the new
players.'' &QL;

FTC SAYS INAPPROPRIATE ENTERTAINMENT IS MARKETED TO YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission plans to release a
report on Monday that harshly criticizes the film, recording and
video game industries for marketing violent, adult-rated
entertainment to young people, said several officials familiar with
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that, despite voluntary rating and labeling
systems adopted over the years, all three industries have used
marketing strategies to entice young consumers to buy products that
the industries themselves deem inappropriate. They do this largely,
the report contends, by placing advertising in publications and
television broadcasts that appeal to youth.
</P>
<P>
   In its recommendations, the FTC does not call for legislative
remedies or tougher regulation, each of which could run afoul of
First Amendment protections of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the report does call on the entertainment industry to adopt
stringent policies _ including the threat of sanctions _ that would
prohibit the marketing of violent movies, recordings and video
games to children. The officials said the report encourages the
industry not to advertise on television programs that are popular
with children under 16 or in time slots when they are most likely
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls on producers and retailers to better educate the
public about their rating and labeling systems. Individual
retailers, it says, should enact rules, like those adopted recently
by Kmart, Wal-Mart and Toys ``R'' Us, that prohibit the sale of
mature-rated video games to anyone under 17. The report also
recommends that the industry not market to children any action
figure from R-rated movies or M-rated video games.
</P>
<P>
   While the report was tightly held this weekend, some on Capitol
Hill said they had been informed of its essential thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an ongoing, knowing, systematic marketing of
adult-rated products to an underage audience,'' said Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., who called for the investigation. ``It's along
the lines of how Joe Camel is marketed to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who has also been active on the
issue, said, ``They are going to find that there has been a
conscious targeting of children with violent media content.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton requested the review more than a year ago in
the aftermath of the massacre by two teen-agers at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., and after other school shootings where
the assailants were thought to be desensitized to violence.
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky will release the report and hold a
news conference on Monday morning. Clinton plans to comment on the
findings at an event in Westchester County, N.Y., later that day.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation, which is led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will
hold a hearing on the report. Among those scheduled to testify are
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the Democratic vice-presidential
nominee and a longtime crusader against the marketing of sex and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   A number of industry leaders are also expected to testify,
though many top film studio executives have thus far declined to
attend, according to committee aides. The entertainment industry
has been jockeying with Washington for years over violent content.
Some members of Congress, including Lieberman, have threatened
stricter regulation while industry leaders have argued that no
other business has so constrained its own sales by agreeing to
voluntary ratings and labeling.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who are familiar with the report said that much of
the most damning information came from the industry's own files.
The trade commission analyzed marketing plans for a number of
adult-rated products and found evidence that advertising strategies
were devised at least partly with youngsters in mind, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the R-rated movies that were studied, nearly two-thirds had
marketing plans that included children who are not supposed to see
the films without a parent, the officials said. Of the M-rated
video games studied, more than half had such plans. For recordings
with parental advisory labels, the figure was about a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also found that retailers _ whether movie theaters or
video game stores _ do not always pay much attention to ratings.
Mounting an undercover operation using youngsters under 17, the FTC
found that the children could obtain tickets to R-rated movies
about half of the time they tried. About 85 percent of the time,
the children were able to buy M-rated video games, which the
industry has determined are suitable only for those 17 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Eric London, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to confirm the
details of the report. But, he said, ``This report goes far beyond
percentages and the most interesting part is some of the evidence
based on the industry documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he had not read the report but resented the obvious
analogy to the government's treatment of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco kills people,'' he said. ``And tobacco is not
protected by the First Amendment. I don't want us grouped with
tobacco, and that's what these recommendations do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said that children have such pervasive access to
television that it would be difficult, and unfair, to restrict
advertising to times when youngsters would not see it. ``I have no
doubt that our companies have made mistakes in the past,'' he said,
``but to make the leap from a trampoline and say that it's the
policy of our companies is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association, said surveys show that most video game players are
over 18, and that 90 percent of those who buy video and computer
games are adults. Therefore, it is the responsibility of parents,
he said, to pay attention to the violence ratings the industry has
imposed on its members.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein said his group had recently formed an advertising
review council to monitor and police industry practices, and that
it does not condone the marketing of mature-rated videos to
underage consumers. But, he said, ``recommendations that put the
government in the position of regulating people's access to content
is something we would be deeply troubled by.''

FOUR HOSTAGES RELEASED BY PHILIPPINE REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ More than four months after 21 people were
seized in their beach clothes from a remote diving resort, the last
four Westerners were freed Saturday from the Philippine jungle by
Muslim rebel kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The ransom for the final French, German and Finnish hostages was
reported to be $1 million each, part of $25 million promised to the
kidnappers by Libya, which has acted as a go-between.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt and bearded, Marc Wallert of Germany raised his arms in
the air when he stepped off a helicopter after 140 days in
captivity. ``It feels great!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the hostage-taking is not over. The gunmen are still holding
two French television journalists who trekked into the mountains to
interview them in July and 12 Filipino evangelical Christians who
paid $3,000 plus 50 sacks of rice to be allowed into their camp to
pray.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the original 21 hostages _ the lone Filipino among
them _ also remained in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   A separate band of kidnappers from the same rebel group, Abu
Sayyaf, is holding an American, Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a Muslim
convert from California who went to visit them, apparently out of
curiosity, on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Over the months, the kidnappings have been marked by
incompetence, violence, secret payoffs and fitful releases
punctuated by dozens of new kidnappings. Promises have been made
and broken as the kidnappers have feuded and fought among
themselves over their spoils.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's release effort almost collapsed when two go-betweens,
accompanied by the chief kidnapper _ a man nicknamed Robot because
he can dance like Michael Jackson _ were ambushed by men with
automatic weapons and grenade launchers. Government negotiators
said one bodyguard was killed and eight others wounded, along with
a large number of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Philippine negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said the
attackers were a rival rebel faction. Though he refused to say so,
the go-betweens were believed to be carrying ransom money with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not sure at all of being released today,'' said one of
the freed hostages, Stephane Loisy of France. ``We heard the
shooting where we were located. And suddenly we were taken in a car
and we were actually freed.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining hostages face an uncertain future. The releases so
far have been slowed by demands for more and more money and by the
kidnappers' fears of a military offensive once their hostages are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The military has held back in response to the demands of the
Western governments whose citizens were being detained. With the
release of the last of those hostages, Vice President Gloria Arroyo
Macapagal said Friday, ``it's possible that we may change our
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan envoy, Rajab Azzarouq, said negotiators would now seek
the release of the two French journalists. According to local
reports, they were not released Saturday because the Libyans
declined to pay for them. Negotiations for the release of Schilling
may be even more difficult. He is being held by a faction that has
tortured and killed previous hostages and that is reported to be
angry at the American, who is said to have argued with them and
tried to break out of his holding pen.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has stated that as a matter of policy, it
would not pay ransom or make deals for his release. In response, a
spokesman for the kidnappers repeated a threat to kill him, telling
a local radio station this week, ``The United States may have a
policy, but we also have our own policy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the going rate for the hostages set at $1 million each, the
spokesman said earlier that he thought an American ought to be
worth 10 times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping for ransom is a well-established business in the
islands of the Sulu Sea, which have been home to pirates and
bandits for centuries. Abu Sayyaf, a tiny breakaway rebel band,
seized the vacationers, along with several local workers, from the

   The kidnappers received $5.5 million for their first 11 releases
of Malaysian and German hostages, the Philippine military said.
Libya paid another $6 million two weeks ago for six more Westerners

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a
peasant environmentalist and an Army colonel _ human rights group
believe are unjustly imprisoned now. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications

the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good.

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an
investment that reaps priceless returns. A growing number of that

largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CENSUS-ADJUST _ A federal lawsuit against the state of Virginia

results instead of statistically adjusted counts to redraw
legislative districts. A dozen major U.S. cities and counties have
joined the fight against a Virginia law passed this year by the
GOP-dominated legislature. Urban areas, with large minority

be that anti-trust regulators are shifting their efforts from

   TECH-CAMPUS _ SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ When Sun Microsystems Inc.

company trying to expand in crowded Silicon Valley. Developable
land is scarce. Real estate prices are among the highest in the
world. And in environmentally conscious California, getting
regulatory approval for new projects isn't usually easy. Sun's
approach, however, was anything but typical. When the state put an
abandoned 112-year-old former mental hospital, decrepit and choked

   LAW-SCHOOL _ WASHINGTON _ Wayne Reaud, a wealthy Texas trial
lawyer, tried to give Texas Tech University's law school $12.5
million. In the end, the university wouldn't take it _ and Reaud
thinks the reason is that Gov. George W. Bush or his supporters
couldn't stand the idea of the law school being named after one of
his ``enemies,'' a Democratic trial lawyer. But Chancellor John
Montford of Texas Tech, a former Democratic state senator, says it
was all a misunderstanding for which he was to blame, that his
intention all along was to name the law school building after
Reaud, not the school itself. The chairman of the university
regents, Jim Sowell of Dallas, said the university's policy is
clear: schools won't be named after someone for less than $25
million. (Hight, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   DAYTON END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues. The series
is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill Moyers called
``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from Sunday, Sept.
10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can stand alone. The
stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run date that
corresponds to the day the story is moving. Elements from the
series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING page for Tuesday,
Sept, 19. That page will be available on Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

But Gross declined to be treated or even tested for metastatic

training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

the Lord.'' And he's also grateful to the hospice and palliative
care program at the Dayton VA, which has provided his end-of-life

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _ Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millennium has
given millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer
world grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions
about ways to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James
Hansen, one of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global
warming 20 years ago, suggests that industrialized nations
struggling to implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
called for under the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing
the wrong villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner,

 &HT;    `Bach the man' is lost in 'Bach the musician'
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Christopher Wolff's biography of Johann
Sebastian Bach, published on the 250th anniversary of the
composer's death, is so dry it could absorb the Elbe, Oder and
Rhine rivers of his native Germany. That's an obvious exaggeration,
but it indicates the obstacles to enjoying this important
biographical achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, an eminent scholar and dean of Harvard University's
graduate school of arts and sciences, has written a thorough
examination of Bach's professional life. His detail-conscious
account relays musical programs for particular occasions, duties
and compensations for musicians as well as relations among patrons
and performers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he left out the Bach.
</P>
<P>
   We learn little about the man, who, admittedly led a circumspect
personal life (1685-1750) and who devoted his available energies to
playing, composing and teaching music. Although Wolff, through his
prodigious research, can tell us which days Bach skipped school and
the floor plan of his Leipzig apartment, he does not animate the
man whom many serious musicians consider history's greatest
composer.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of Bach's story: Born of a Thuringian family of
professional musicians, he excelled at school but did not attend
university. He lost his parents at a fairly young age and,
monitored by his older brother, forged into the family business. He
earned his way through a series of church, municipal and court
appointments. First known as a keyboard virtuoso, he gained renown
as a composer of instrumental and vocal music and finally as a
practical theorist, whose technical and stylistic innovations still
nourish our understanding of tone, harmony and structure.
</P>
<P>
   As the subtitle of his biography, ``The Learned Musician,''
suggests, Wolff wants to elevate Bach's stature as a practical
theorist, glorifying the author of ``The Art of the Fugue,'' ``The
Well-Tempered Clavier'' and other studies. Consequently, Wolff
devotes several pages to Bach's education in Latin schools and his
later relations with the faculty of the University of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff builds to a view of Bach as manifesting the perfectibility
of humans through harmony in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Characteristic of Bach's manner of composing,'' Wolff writes,
``is a way of elaborating the musical ideas so as to penetrate the
material deeply and exhaustively.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Wolff's approach is exhaustive, if not exactly harmonious.
He provides images of the cities where Bach lived and the churches
where he played, along with maps, calendars and innumerable
scholarly notes. Yet he fails to string a narrative continuity, and
his conditional phrases _ ``we can imagine,'' ``if anything can be
said for certain,'' ``quite conceivably'' _ madden.
</P>
<P>
   This biography belongs on the shelf of any serious musician as a
source of reputable reference material. Nevertheless, it would no
more interest the general reader than a 600-page list of goods sold
in the Leipzig market during the early 18th century.

GOING NEGATIVE WITH A LAVA LAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harold Kaplan, a Madison Avenue advertising
executive who is an unpaid consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's
campaign, said the ideal way to attack Vice President Al Gore
popped into his head in late August when he was reading the
obituary of the creator of the Lava Lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `Lava Lamp. Oh, my God! What a great visual!''' Kaplan
recalled. ``I thought a Lava Lamp was a very good metaphor for
Gore. It can be whatever you want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's script, which is part of the rhetorical ammunition that
the Bush campaign has stockpiled in Austin, Texas, opens with a
bubbling, oozing Lava Lamp, intended to conjure images of
debauchery in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The announcer says: ``Some politicians are like Lava Lamps,
constantly changing. Always saying what you want them to say. Take
Al Gore, for example. He says he's now for tax cuts. That's
enlightening. Over the last eight years, Al Gore voted to raise our
gas taxes. Kept the marriage tax on couples. Even raised Social
Security taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial was one of a series of suggested
scripts obtained by The New York Times from people not involved in
the campaign. The scripts were proposed by Madison Avenue
advertising executives who are advising Bush's media team. They are
nicknamed the ``Park Avenue Posse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lava Lamp advertisement has never been broadcast. And it
probably never will be.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon, Bush's top media adviser in Austin, was
unapologetically dismissive of the commercial, saying: ``That's not
nearly under consideration. I looked at it for about five seconds
before I realized it wasn't worthy of consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   But the discussions about the advertisement _ no matter how
fleeting _ underscore a fundamental predicament facing the Bush
organization as it heads into the most intense eight weeks of
advertising of the campaign. Campaign officials have concluded that
they have no choice but to run advertisements attacking Gore _ and
they have already started.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are facing the hard part: how to go negative without
making the commercials appear too harsh. It is more of a challenge
for Bush than for Gore, because the Texas governor had vowed to run
a campaign on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to even go negative has got to be a tough one for
him,'' said Jane Hall, who teaches politics and the media at
American University's school of communication. ``When he does, he
turns himself into the carping Washington politician that he said
he didn't want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall questioned the effectiveness of the Lava Lamp commercial,
saying, ``To do a negative commercial saying he keeps changing is
like fighting the last war. Gore has repackaged himself and seems
to have sold himself as his own man.'' Besides, she added, ``I'm
not sure people are even going to know what a Lava Lamp is. Isn't
that the '60s or '70s?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials and consultants, and officials at the Republican
National Committee, are wrestling with a variety of options, from a
commercial that shows Gore turning into a chameleon to one
questioning the validity of his budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has convened endless meetings and focus groups to
settle on how best to take on Gore. But the reality, according to
several people involved in the process, is that there is no
definitive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what we're going to run next,'' conceded one
Bush official in Austin. ``We have various things we're
considering.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon insisted that there was a carefully considered
strategy, saying, ``We have a very clear sense of direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that striking the right tone was a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a sense of what voters think is fair, and produce ads
accordingly,'' he said. ``You always want to try and produce
something that is relevant and credible with voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, a creative director at Young &AMP; Rubicam who met Bush
during the 1988 presidential campaign, spoke more bluntly about the
problem facing the campaign: ``The struggle is that a negative ad
can backfire on you. There's this harsh, mean tone that's wrong and
you just don't want to do that. The governor has set a very
positive tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican officials have criticized as too sarcastic a
Republican Party commercial _ sanctioned by the Bush campaign _
that ridicules Gore with humor and cites his fund-raising visit to
a Buddhist temple. But McKinnon defended the commercial and said,
in fact, that it might have helped Bush close the gaps in some
polls in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from research that that ad tests very well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican ad maker who was a strategist
for Sen. John McCain in the primaries, said it was difficult for
any campaign to sort through ideas and settle on the right tone of
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem you get in advertising is that much of the advice
you get is very bad,'' said Murphy, who is now a strategist for the
Senate candidacy of Rep. Rick Lazio of New York. ``The hard part is
being able to pick the very good from the overwhelmingly bad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has become something of a tradition for campaigns to look to
Madison Avenue for creative input. In May, the Bush campaign formed
the Park Avenue Posse, a group of advertising executives that has
volunteered to advise McKinnon and Stuart Stevens, his colleague in
Austin. The group is led by and was named for Jim Ferguson, the
president of Young &AMP; Rubicam, who lives on Park Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and Stevens are in frequent contact with members of the
group, and have often taken their advice in developing commercials,
particularly ones that ran early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very involved,'' McKinnon said. ``We have a political
way of looking at things, and they're in a different box. They have
fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those ideas, like the Lava Lamp commercial, may seem a
little too fresh for the Austin consultants.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon not only discarded that commercial but other scripts
from the posse.
</P>
<P>
   In one proposed advertisement, a chameleon flashes on the screen
and the announcer says: ``This is a chameleon. It takes on the
color of any place it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then an image of Gore, frozen, appears. The announcer says,
``This is a politician, which does the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, footage of Gore recalling his days farming tobacco. ``I've
shucked it, hucked it, sold it, smoked it,'' he says. Then the vice
president says, ``I will never support the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer then says, ``Chameleon. Politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Then back to Gore, who says, ``I helped invent the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer closes: ``Let's elect a leader this time. Not a
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that commercial, McKinnon said, ``It was something I
instantly recognized as not worthy of consideration.'' He would not
elaborate on why he objected to the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon also had little patience for suggested commercials that
tethered Gore to the Clinton administration's doomed health-care
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the health-care crisis in '93?'' the announcer says
in one proposed ad. ``Clinton and Gore promised a plan that would
put a national health care card in every wallet. Still waiting for
yours?'' Someone on the screen is shaking a wallet with no card in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his judgments, McKinnon said, ``I've got 150 scripts
lying around here.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kaplan, who has handled accounts for the Army and
Kentucky Fried Chicken, said he was ``just shocked'' that his and
other scripts had been leaked to the press. ``I've been so good
about guarding our secrets.'' And he was still hoping that the lava
spot would be produced and broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we may produce it,'' he said. ``But who knows?''

<HEADLINE>
THE CHILL ISN'T GONE BETWEEN BILLS' JOHNSON AND FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Johnson of the Buffalo Bills was taking a beating. By the
end of the third quarter in the brutal opener against a
hard-hitting Tennessee Titans defense, Johnson had a noticeable
limp and looked woozy. It got so bad that some of his teammates on
the sideline were saying to each other, ``Better get Flutie
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie, the 5-foot-9-inch miracle worker, is the backup
quarterback, but he is sidelined with a groin injury. There would
be no Flutie saving the day. During a timeout, Johnson slowly
wobbled toward the sideline. Waiting for him was Flutie, who patted
Johnson on the back, and then followed him, consulting, offering
advice. Johnson nodded, listening.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene repeated numerous times across the National
Football League _ a starter and a backup talking about strategy.
Except that, in the case of Johnson and Flutie, the scene betrayed
reality. The relationship between Johnson and Flutie is as cold as
a Buffalo winter. As one teammate put it: ``They tolerate each
other, but they don't like each other. They don't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The dislike is rooted in the competition between the two, which
has been going on for years. Flutie replaced Johnson as the starter
several years ago, and then Johnson recently replaced Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship chilled even more after Flutie made some
questionable _ and selfish _ comments to a Canadian sports network
in the weeks after the Bills' loss to the Titans in the playoffs
last season. ``I honestly believe that if I would have been
playing, we could have, would have, won,'' Flutie said.
</P>
<P>
   To say that he would have made the difference shows Flutie's
confidence, but it also demonstrates his self-centered tendency,
something Johnson pointed out in an interview with Penthouse
magazine. Asked to respond to Flutie's remarks, Johnson said, in
part: ``I think what Flutie said was more of an insult to the
entire team. That's just the type of guy Doug is. He's not much fun
to play with. You just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson-Flutie saga is just one of several awkward
situations between starting and backup quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, Kent Graham, the former Giant, is the starter,
but it is no secret that coach Bill Cowher will most likely start
Kordell Stewart at some point. The relationship between Graham and
Stewart, the starter last season, is cordial.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Jets, there is no controversy because Vinny
Testaverde is the entrenched starter, but the backup, Ray Lucas, is
extremely unhappy that the team drafted Chad Pennington, and Lucas
has made his unhappiness known.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Ryan Leaf and Jim Harbaugh have a good
relationship, but some Chargers believe it will only be a matter of
time before Harbaugh starts, especially since few of the players
like Leaf. In Cleveland, Tim Couch, the franchise's No. 1 pick, is
struggling, and could be replaced by his backup.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback situation in Washington is rife with potential
for ugliness, even though everyone in the Redskins' organization,
including the two throwers themselves, the starter, Brad Johnson,
and the backup Jeff George, say there is no acrimony between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how to avoid keeping things from getting tense,
Johnson said: ``It's just being relaxed. Knowing that when you come
into meeting rooms, no one is trying to stab each other in the
back. It's just being able to see a guy in the hallway and being
able to say hello without them trying to duck to the other corner.
That makes a big difference. You're not looking for friendship, but
it definitely helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is extremely competitive, but he also has one of the
most pleasant personalities of any player in the league, so that
will help the situation. However, Johnson's patience will be tested
because George is notorious for his unwillingness to sit on the
bench and be quiet. It is not a question of if George will complain
about being a backup, but when.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie can be equally politically incorrect. There has been
anti-Flutie talk in the Bills' locker room for more than a year,
which first became public when the former Bills wide receiver Andre
Reed criticized Flutie for being selfish on Reed's Web site before
Reed left the organization.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his comments to Penthouse, Johnson recently
backed down from his words that Flutie is not much fun as a
teammate. ``I said that week it wasn't much fun because he
obviously wasn't in a very good mood,'' Johnson said. ``He was
doing a lot of complaining, and it wasn't good for the team. That
week, I did say he wasn't very pleasant to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   About Flutie's comments being an insult to the team, Johnson
said, ``It was insulting to me personally, but as a team you have
to feel that there are 21 other guys out there making plays. We're
a unit. We're 53 guys. To say one guy would have made the
difference? That's what I meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently both players are making nice. But how long will that
last?
</P>
<P>
   Dayne Disputes Fine
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants running back Ron Dayne has been fined
$10,000 by the league for his unexcused absence at this year's
rookie symposium, an NFL official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne has appealed the fine, and a decision on the appeal is
pending, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne maintained that he missed the symposium because of an ear
infection that prevented him from traveling on an airplane. Dayne
did not provide the excuse in a timely manner, which led to the
fine. The NFL also does not believe Dayne's reason.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the appeal should come within the next few weeks.
</P>

<P>
   Two Grudge Matchups
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Akili Smith was passed over by the Cleveland
Browns in the 1999 draft in favor of Couch, he made it clear that
one day the Browns would regret the decision. In the 2000 draft,
Peter Warrick, the Florida State wide receiver, was passed over by
the Browns in favor of Courtney Brown, the Penn State defensive
lineman. Warrick was also unhappy about being passed over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smith and Warrick play on the same team, the Cincinnati
Bengals, and they meet the Browns on Sunday, which means they both
get a chance to prove just how wrong the Browns may have been. Both
tried to play down any bitterness, but what Warrick said earlier
this year cannot be erased.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick predicted the Bengals would be 1-0 after Sept. 10, and
since the Bengals had the unusual bye week in Week 1 and play the
Browns on Sunday, Warrick was obviously saying they would beat the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson in Motivation
</P>
<P>
   Following the 27-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts last week,
Kansas City Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham met with his team.
According to a coach who was present, an extremely emotional
Cunningham basically said that he was going to do everything he
could to make sure the team never had a loss like the one to the
Colts again. And he said that if he did not get the job done, he
would quit and make way for someone else who could.
</P>
<P>
   From those words came a Fox television report that Cunningham
had considered resigning but was dissuaded by his wife. Cunningham
said that the report took his words out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, from the high school level to the pros, say all the
time that if they are not getting the job done, they will quit. It
is a motivational tactic, a way to get players to fight for them.
In an interview with One-on-One Sports Radio Network on Friday, the
former Jets Coach Bill Parcells said to some of the teams he had
coached the same thing that Cunningham did.

PALESTINIANS MEET ON STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A Palestinian leadership body opened a two-day,
closed-door assembly in Gaza City on Saturday, at the end of which
they are expected to defer the declaration of Palestinian statehood
originally set for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Palestinian Central Council acknowledged that
they were prepared to give the peace negotiations an extended lease
on life.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging state is internationally acknowledged, but many
world leaders told Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, this
summer that they prefer to see it formally born through a process
of negotiations and not declared unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   Such a declaration would probably provoke an Israeli reaction,
such as an annexation of West Bank settlements, and jeopardize the
troubled peace effort. Arafat would also risk losing the
international financing that is bankrolling the formation of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders originally set Sept. 13 as the deadline by
which they would declare an independent state. That is when the
interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, already extended from
May 4, 1999, expires. It is unclear whether they will set a new
deadline in their assembly this weekend, or simply leave the matter
vague so that they would not be forced to announce and cancel
another proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat said the peace effort
would continue. ``As President Clinton has pointed out, and with
his good effort, this peace process will continue here in Palestine
and in the area, with the participation of the Americans and some
of our Arab brothers,'' he said.

CLINTON ANGRY AND DISPIRITED OVER POSSIBLE DISBARMENT, FRIEND SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his final months in office, President
Clinton will remain enmeshed in a battle over his Arkansas license
to practice law that friends and associates say has left him
especially angry and dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment trial will occur in Little Rock, Ark., possibly
this fall, and has several elements that friends said have deeply
troubled Clinton. One of the president's concerns, they said, is
that disbarment would be both a lifetime stigma and a definitive
verdict for history. It would also be the result of a proceeding
difficult to portray as a groundless and partisan vendetta, which
is how the president and his allies characterized the investigation
by Ken Starr, the independent counsel, and the Clinton's
impeachment by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the issue will be fought in Arkansas, his home
state, making it even more hurtful, the friends said.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime friend of the president said Clinton was ``livid,
off-the-wall angry'' about the disbarment proceedings. On more than
one occasion, the president would be ``in a terrific mood'' until
the disbarment issue came up, the friend said. ``His mood
immediately darkens,'' said the friend, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, this friend said, is especially concerned that if he is
disbarred, he will go down as the first president in American
history to lose his law license while in office, a punishment that
was not even visited upon Richard Nixon, who surrendered his
license after he left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime Washington associate of Clinton who spoke only
on the condition of anonymity said that the president's pointed
unhappiness over the disbarment case also reflected a kind of
weariness and annoyance that the Senate's failure to convict him
after his impeachment did not end the grind of formal legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought, well, we all thought, this thing was over with,''
this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Two associates said that President Clinton was so stunned on the
afternoon of May 22 when he learned that an Arkansas bar committee
formed by the state Supreme Court had recommended Clinton's
disbarment that he responded by likening the recommendation to the
imposition of the death sentence for a minor crime.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on how the president was reacting to the
disbarment case, the White House provided a statement from John
Podesta, the chief of staff, that said the president was ``focused
first on doing his job and what he can get done in the next several
months and on making sure the Democratic campaigns are successful
in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other matter he is leaving to his lawyers, where it
belongs,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear if Clinton will have to testify in his own
behalf or will want to do so. Either way, the proceedings of the
case, Neal v. Clinton, may be televised from the Pulaski County
Courthouse in Little Rock. And they will most likely occur while
Clinton is still in office, making it especially uncomfortable for
him, one of the friends said.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Skip Rutherford, Clinton's longtime friend from Little Rock who
is heading the committee that is soliciting money for and
overseeing the construction of the Clinton Library in the east end
of town, raised the possibility this summer that the president
might choose to move the library elsewhere out of disgust with what
is happening to him in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are asking, and we think he should be asking,
whether it's worth it to bring this project here,'' Rutherford had
said in an interview. Rutherford, who speaks often with Clinton,
said that it seemed awful to many of the president's supporters
that he was being treated this way in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said that the library could be built at Georgetown
University in Washington, where Clinton was an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rutherford's comments, it is highly unlikely that plans
to build the Clinton Library in Little Rock will change.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, during the Democratic National Convention, the
Clinton raised at least $10 million for the library at a Los
Angeles fund-raiser and he recently told interviewers that after he
left office he expected to spend about two days a week in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment proceedings might also influence whether the
president faces other legal problems after he leaves office. Some
legal analysts have said Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr as
independent counsel investigating Clinton's conduct, might be less
inclined to indict Clinton on perjury charges if he has already
been punished through disbarment or by having his law license
suspended. Ray has impaneled a new federal grand jury in Washington
to consider whether Clinton should be prosecuted for lying in the
Paula Jones case, which was also a subject of his impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two complaints triggered the Arkansas disbarment proceedings,
one filed by a conservative legal group and the other by Susan
Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over Jones' lawsuit
against Clinton alleging sexual misconduct. In a January 1998
deposition in that case, Clinton testified under oath in Wright's
presence that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Clinton acknowledged in a public statement that
he had an inappropriate intimate relationship with the intern but
maintained that he had told the truth in the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wright disagreed, fining him $90,000 for contempt and referring
the matter to the Arkansas bar.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended the disbarment, rejecting lesser
sanctions of a suspension of his license or a reprimand, a penalty
that Clinton had suggested he might have accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Among the legal issues that may come up in the hearing is
Clinton's decision not to contest Wright's sanction against him for
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton did not challenge the judgment, it is unclear
whether he is now prohibited from arguing that he did not lie under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Brill of the University of Arkansas Law School at
Fayetteville said that the judge hearing the case might rule that
Clinton, in essence, waived his right to repeat that argument
during disbarment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The other major issue in the case will be an argument over the
severity of the punishment. In papers filed in Arkansas on Aug. 29,
Clinton's lawyers said that even if what the bar committee had
accused him of was true, disbarment was far too harsh and was
disproportionate to the punishment the state had meted out to other
lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A sanction of disbarment would be excessively harsh,
impermissibly punitive and unprecedented in the circumstances of
this case,'' wrote the lawyers, David Kendall and Nicole Seligman
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also suggested in the filings that Clinton had not
waived his argument that he did not technically lie.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas bar committee disciplines about 100 lawyers each
year and disbarment is used almost solely in cases involving the
theft of client money. Although most of the legal precedents favors
the president, there are other considerations that could influence
the judge hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Using a recently revised judicial ethics code, the state Supreme
Court upheld the disbarment of a lawyer in 1998 who committed
insurance fraud, saying, ``There is simply no place in the law for
a man or woman who will not tell the truth even when his interest
is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another issue is whether lawyers who hold public office
like Clinton bear a greater ethical burden than lawyers who do not.
The commentaries to the code under which Clinton is charged hold
that ``lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities
going beyond those of other citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for disbarment will be argued by Marie-Bernarde Miller
before Arkansas Circuit Court Judge Leon Johnson, who agreed to
preside over the case after several other judges on the Circuit
Court disqualified themselves because they have been active in
Arkansas politics.

OUTDOORS: FLY-FISHING IN MONTANA MAKES INDELIBLE MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAY OTTULICH  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife's family reunion out West in Wolf Point was a great
excuse for a fishing trip back to Montana after a four-year
absence. Joan did not have to twist my arm. We left New York, where
I am a guide on the Fourth of July, and tag-teamed up for the
marathon drive to the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Joan and me, we had my daughter Cassi and her equally
horse-crazy friend Kylee Larabee, a dairy farmer's daughter who had
never been to the West. They both kept occupied for hours on end
commenting upon or photographing every lone horse or herd we
passed. We made a scenic jog, air heavy with the scent of sage, up
through Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota, a
colorful series of eroded badlands in the drainage of the Little
Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   We took a deliberate detour off the pavement and crossed the
Montana state line fittingly on a gravel track winding below clay
bluffs along the cottonwood bottomlands of the Missouri River. At
Bainville we hit U.S. 2, known in Montana as the ``high line,'' the
major east-west drag that has become the de facto Main Street of
every town below the Canadian border to Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   There is really no fluvial trout fishing on the high plains of
northeastern Montana. What trout to be found exist, few and far
between, in reservoirs and large stock ponds. So when we arrived in
Wolf Point, I was itching to wet a line and do as the natives do:
fish for northern pike. I teamed up with one of my former regular
fishing partners, Hugh Strait, an inventor of local note known as
Gizmo, and my brother-in-law, Ole Brown.
</P>
<P>
   We traveled down a gravel road through greasewood flats toward
the Missouri Breaks. Rain had fallen abundantly on this corner of
the state this year and the rolling hills were uncharacteristically
green. Unfortunately, the same rainfall had made our goal _ the
Redwater River _ difficult to fish.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the Redwater over a trapezoidal concrete ford
designed with three culverts embedded, to pass water through during
low water and sloped such as to allow water over the top during
floods. We left the gravel and bounced down a serpentine clay track
to the confluence of the Redwater and the Missouri. A small,
cryptic hand-lettered sign at the dead end greeted us stating, ``If
it rains you stay.'' Ole translated: rain on the clay gumbo made
traction, even with four-wheel drive, impossible, and you would not
be getting out until it dries. Oldtime family fishing camp-outs
always had a shift watcher who did double duty stoking the fire and
watching for thunderheads. At the sign of any ominous cloud the
whole camp would be awakened to strike tents and bug out.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching a 5-inch steel shock tippet to my fly line and keeping
an eye peeled for rattlers, we systematically worked the banks of
the Redwater for its storied 20-pound northerns. My favorite pike
fly, an 8-inch-long barred synthetic yellow hair contraption called
fittingly a ``Barbie Doll head'' proved fruitless. Conditions being
as they were with clarity nil, you would have had to hit the pike
right on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Family commitments over, and 560 miles farther west put me back
on ``home waters'' _ the glacial Kootenai River. I was a
professional driftboat guide there for a number of years. Rising
300 miles to the north on the Pacific slope of the Canadian
Rockies, the Kootenai runs south and makes a loop through Montana
and Idaho. We used to say that the Kootenai gave Montana a little
piece of British Columbia. The river, incidentally, also harbors
the only native strain of rainbow trout in the state. I watched the
quality of the fishing rise and fall directly as a result of the
unnatural and ecologically unfriendly operations of Libby Dam.
</P>
<P>
   The average size of a 3-year-old trout in 1996 was a pitiful 8
to 9 inches. After a long evening on the river I was delighted to
have caught and released an unusual number of fish between 12 and
15 inches. Dave Blackburn, an old friend, outfitter, fly shop
pioneer and fishing partner, attributes the rebounding of the
Kootenai to the relatively flat flows during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weed beds have developed and flourished in areas where there
was previously no habitat whatsoever,'' he said, explaining why,
``with the old water faucet approach to flow management.''
</P>
<P>
   During that regime, a high flow lasting six to eight weeks or
more at a time during peak power production would be abruptly shut
off, stranding millions of pioneering aquatic insects high and dry
in the dewatered areas. Ramping, the practice of gradually
decreasing flows, allows the benthic community to migrate back.
``We now have a special spring flow for endangered white
sturgeon,'' Blackburn said. This, in effect, mimics the natural
spring runoff of a free flowing river.
</P>
<P>
   On my last day, I drifted through the Riverside Riffle
downstream enough to clear the current seam and rowed back up on
the slack waterside to anchor. We hopped out and wet waded, casting
our flies out towards the pod of feeding fish. An absolutely
magnificent 18-inch cutthroat trout dashed up, struck the
tarantula, gave a spirited fight and was released unharmed, another
timeless memory.

PHILADELPHIA'S TROUBLED SCHOOLS OPEN AS STRIKE THREAT LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This city's deeply troubled public schools
reopened near cliff's edge this week as the teachers union
authorized a strike in the face of a powerful new bargaining-table
coalition of state and city political leaders determined to
overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   The 21,000-member union is fighting demands for contract
concessions, including the introduction of a pay-for-performance
teacher rating like those increasingly being invoked by politicians
across the nation to improve schools.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the School District of Philadelphia, acting
under crisis-driven changes in city and state law, is negotiating
with the explicit backing of Mayor John F. Street and Gov. Tom
Ridge. In the past, ranking elected officials played a sideline
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a big stick,'' said David L. Cohen, a chief
strategist of the city-state bargaining initiative, referring to a
new state law, Act 46, designed to shake up the balance of power of
traditional contract bargaining in the 210,000-student system.
</P>
<P>
   With the contract deadline past, an emergency court order has
kept the parties bargaining, but only on a day-to-day basis as the
city's anxieties mount. The order runs out on Monday night, with no
certainty that it will be extended. The union argues that Act 46
violates the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The act, designed to narrow the union's bargaining room,
prohibits the temporary extension of the old teacher contract
provisions and benefits. It empowers the governor to take over the
city system if necessary to keep the schools open and to pursue
reforms in the event of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted by the state Legislature in 1998, after a
school-aid fight with the city, in the name of improving plummeting
reading and math scores here and in 10 smaller districts in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers maintains that the
act was passed by the Republican legislature without fair public
debate to bust the power of the teachers union in this Democratic
city. Other city union leaders have expressed support for the
teachers, who last struck in 1981 for 51 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to strike; the picket signs are in the schools,''
said Ted Kirsch, the union president who heard thousands of members
roar approval for a strike rather than surrender prerogatives of
their old contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about survival of the union, sure, but also survival
of public education in this city,'' Kirsch said in an interview.
``A state takeover could mean the charterizing of schools and the
dismantling of the public system.''
</P>
<P>
   While fighting the Republican governor and Statehouse, the union
must also confront Street, a Democrat who won City Hall last
November after vowing to address the public's deep frustration with
the school system. At that time, voters also approved a city
charter change that gave the mayor far greater power over the
schools by allowing him to appoint the nine-member school board in
charge of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes down, Mayor Street takes the hit,'' Kirsch said
of the political responsibility for a strike and potential state
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the as yet unspecified performance-pay innovation, the
state, city and school district are also challenging current
seniority protections by allowing principals and supervisors a
stronger say in where teachers are assigned. The city also wants to
increase the teachers' work day by 1 hour and 15 minutes, to 7
hours and 45 minutes, while adding five work days to the 190 in the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   But the pay-for-performance proposal clearly upsets the union
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could settle a contract a lot more easily if that wasn't on
the table,'' said Jerry Jordan, the chief union negotiator. He
noted that the performance idea, while increasingly popular among
critics of public schools, is in only the experimental stage in a
few places like Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Colorado, and has no
track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not make our teachers guinea pigs,'' Jordan said. He
noted that the old contract permitted principals to deny raises to
teachers considered subpar.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the district, students began classes on Thursday even as
their teachers monitored contract talks that continued into the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Benjamin Franklin High School, Arlene Fields, a mother
of a student and a nonunion consultant on parent involvement in
school affairs, pointed to the building and said, ``Don't worry,
they're still teaching and learning in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields, a proud city native, said the heightened city and state
involvement ``makes this year's contract talks a pretty potent
mix,'' but a promising one, too. She praised Street for daring to
get involved in the complex issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everybody needs to give a little for this to work out for
the kids,'' she said as a student politely volunteered to carry her
briefcase into the busy school.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Olympic Summer Games begin Friday in Sydney,
Australia, the season in the Southern Hemisphere will still be
winter, fading into spring. In addition to being the first Olympics
in a new century _ a new millennium _ the Sydney Olympics will be
the last Games in the era of Juan Antonio Samaranch. Samaranch,
head of the International Olympic Committee since 1980, will step
down, belatedly, early next year.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Samaranch has transformed the Olympic Games
into a venue for professional athletes and into a marketing
juggernaut. Even as he put Olympics financing on a solid, if overly
commercial basis, he also allowed the IOC to attain a dismaying
level of corruption and insularity. His imperious management style
and insensitivity to ethical lapses will not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   The coming Games will also be one of the last Olympics, one
hopes, to be held in a city chosen by a crooked selection process
that has left the IOC and several of the cities that bid for the
Games, including Sydney and Salt Lake City, which will host the
2002 Winter Games, embarrassed. Overall, 1999 was a nightmare for
the IOC, whose cloak of secrecy was removed by the investigations
that resulted from Salt Lake City's flawed bid.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the IOC has created an ethics commission and
adopted other reforms. It committed itself to greater
representation from active athletes, and banned the site-selection
committee from visiting cities bidding for the Games to prevent
offers of free travel and other financial inducements from
municipal groups. Despite new drug-testing policies, however, the
IOC still struggles to keep pace with the bewildering proliferation
of performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   The coming Games, and the natural ebullience of the Australian
hosts, may do much to restore the luster of the Olympics. That is
the way it usually goes. Each Olympics sets off an explosion of
activity years in advance _ the sale of television and advertising
rights, the construction of arenas, housing and transportation
systems. These things should serve to embellish the athletic
contests. But recently it has worked the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   It has been up to the athletes and the quality of their contests
to redeem the blunders of the host cities, the broadcasting
networks, the advertisers, and the local and international Olympic
committees. It has been up to the athletes to remind us that the
real contest at the Olympics is not for television rights or
product placement or viewer share, or, for that matter, national
medal totals. What matters are the Games, which will give the world
a chance to see athletes competing at the limits of speed, agility
and grace.

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: METS ARE NOT HELPING TO KEEP HAMPTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it's time for Mike Hampton to decide where he
wants to pitch next season, he'll remember Friday night's
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Not for his temper tantrum sparked by surrendering a two-run
eighth-inning homer to Scott Rolen for the Mets' 2-0 loss to the
Phillies and, after a walk, his removal. Not for flinging his glove
into the dugout. Not for slamming the gum-holder. Not for leveling
a plastic water cooler with his right forearm. Not for flinging his
cap into the runway as he stalked to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   No, he'll remember the frustration of a cut fastball that didn't
cut and spoiled what could have been an important slump-snapping
victory if the Mets' hitters had provided just a few runs.
</P>
<P>
   Over Hampton's last three starts, the Mets have supported him
with a total of only 3 runs _ his 2-1 triumph over Arizona and his
2-1 loss in St. Louis before Friday night's frustration on the eve
of his 28th birthday. But he didn't regret his outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to please anybody, I don't try to look good for
anybody,'' he said later. ``I show emotion once in a while. This
was one of those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Hampton, whose Mets salary is $5.75 million, sifts
free-agent offers in the fall, he might prefer to join a team with
a more explosive batting order. Maybe the Braves or the Yankees, or
maybe he would just prefer to return to the Astros from whence he
came.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Hampton lost his first three Mets starts, he's had a
solid season. He's now 13-9 with a 3.19 earned run average, third
in the National League behind the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson and
the Dodgers' Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And Bobby Valentine, who said he didn't see all of Hampton's
outburst because he was on the phone to the bullpen, apparently did
not scold him. If the Mets hope to sign Hampton, it wouldn't be
wise to create a chasm between him and the manager, especially in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everything Mike Hampton does,'' the Mets manager said.
``I think he's hit enough watercoolers to know how to hit `em. I'm
not upset with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, not every pitcher is an athlete. Some are just
that, a pitcher who couldn't play any other position in the big
leagues. But you could put Hampton, say, at first base or in the
outfield, and while he wouldn't be Mark McGwire or Ken Griffey Jr.,
he wouldn't embarrass himself. Or his team.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of Crystal River (Fla.) High School as a two-time
all-state pitcher and defensive back, he spurned a a two-sport
offer from Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Just watching him pitch, you can see the athlete in him. In his
quick serious steps striding to the mound. In his compact windup.
In completing his follow-through with his glove in position to
field a grounder or line drive. In being ready to throw the next
pitch without any fuss.
</P>
<P>
   You can also see the athlete in him when he bats or runs the
bases. Some pitchers just wave the bat; he swings it with a
purpose. Some float around the bases; he sprints.
</P>
<P>
   But as a pitcher Hampton has proven to be even better than the
Mets thought when they acquired him to provide what they didn't
have a year ago: another ace in the marathon of the 162-game season
and then in the crucible of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is even better than I thought,'' Valentine said.
``His changeup is a power change because he throws it with a grip
on it. I knew his 86-, 87-mile-an-hour fastball moved a lot, but
he's shown a 92-, 93-mile-an- hour fastball when he needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach, sees something else in
Hampton that sets him apart from many pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's got that look,'' Wallace said. ``That look that defines
so many great players. When you talk to him, he looks you in the
eye. He's a no-excuse guy. And when he's not pitching, he's still
competing. He's a prankster; he's sarcastic in a fun way. And if
you come back at him, he welcomes it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a left-hander, Al Leiter understands Hampton's personality
better than others might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and I have that goofiness, that humor that only a
left-hander appreciates,'' Leiter said. ``There's a certain
lightheartedness among us left-handers on this team _ Mike, myself,
Johnny Franco, Glendon Rusch, Dennis Cook. It's a lightheartedness
that's goofy, geeky, whatever you want to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing lighthearted Friday night about Hampton's
reaction to Rolen's homer and being removed. ``He threw a great
game,'' Mike Piazza said, ``but obviously, one mistake killed us.
He made a bad pitch to a good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets had scored a few runs before that bad pitch, Hampton
would not have been so frustrated. And when it's time for him to
decide where he wants to pitch next season, he'll surely remember
those zeros on the scoreboard.

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a

believe are unjustly imprisoned now. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications

the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good.

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an

largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CENSUS-ADJUST _ A federal lawsuit against the state of Virginia

charged issue of whether states next year can use raw census
results instead of statistically adjusted counts to redraw
legislative districts. A dozen major U.S. cities and counties have
joined the fight against a Virginia law passed this year by the
GOP-dominated legislature. Urban areas, with large minority

be that anti-trust regulators are shifting their efforts from

land is scarce. Real estate prices are among the highest in the
world. And in environmentally conscious California, getting
regulatory approval for new projects isn't usually easy. Sun's
approach, however, was anything but typical. When the state put an
abandoned 112-year-old former mental hospital, decrepit and choked
by weeds, up for sale as surplus land, the computer giant bid on
the site and won. (Keefe, Cox News Service)

   LAW-SCHOOL _ WASHINGTON _ Wayne Reaud, a wealthy Texas trial

million. In the end, the university wouldn't take it _ and Reaud
thinks the reason is that Gov. George W. Bush or his supporters
couldn't stand the idea of the law school being named after one of
his ``enemies,'' a Democratic trial lawyer. But Chancellor John
Montford of Texas Tech, a former Democratic state senator, says it
was all a misunderstanding for which he was to blame, that his
intention all along was to name the law school building after
Reaud, not the school itself. The chairman of the university
regents, Jim Sowell of Dallas, said the university's policy is
clear: schools won't be named after someone for less than $25
million. (Hight, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   DAYTON END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues. The series
is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill Moyers called
``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from Sunday, Sept.
10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can stand alone. The
stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run date that
corresponds to the day the story is moving. Elements from the
series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING page for Tuesday,
Sept, 19. That page will be available on Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _ Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millennium has
given millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer
world grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions
about ways to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James
Hansen, one of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global
warming 20 years ago, suggests that industrialized nations
struggling to implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
called for under the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing
the wrong villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner,

   ARMY-JOURNALIST _ At a party for his Sunday school class, Jim
McLaughlin decided to play a trivia game, asking his two dozen
guests to jot down something the others didn't know about them. On
his own slip of paper, McLaughlin wrote: ``I did what Gore did in
Vietnam.'' The crowd was stumped. Now, with Al Gore's campaign
publicizing his Vietnam service, the group would probably be able
to guess what McLaughlin meant: He, like Gore, served as an
enlisted Army journalist. (Hendrick, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Freshman hit `West Wing' deserves honors
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The battle lines are drawn: It's the White House
vs. the mob, straight vs. gay.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will take home television's prized statuettes during
tonight's telecast of the 52nd annual prime-time Emmy Awards,
starting at 7 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In the best drama series category, NBC's freshman political
drama ``The West Wing'' is tied with HBO's mobster saga ``The
Sopranos'' for most nominations (18). Vying for best comedy series
are NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' which has 11 nominations, and HBO's
``Sex and the City,'' which racked up nine nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the Emmys kick off the new fall TV season, but
this year's late-arriving Summer Olympics has delayed premieres
until October. Bummer. At least tonight's show, hosted by acerbic
wacko Garry Shandling, will get us in the mood for the eventual
arrival of new shows and remind us why we spend so much time
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling, who won an Emmy for writing his ``Larry Sanders
Show,'' promises to be irreverent but not subversive and to keep
the lumbering, three-hour-plus program moving along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I empathize with all those people sitting there not caring
about the categories they're not in,'' he said in Los Angeles
recently. ``Actually, I hope they don't give out any awards. They
should just lock the doors and let me do three hours of stand-up.
The people in that audience would be the real `Survivors.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Voting by members of the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
usually ranges from whimsical to traditional. Safe bets such as
``Frasier'' and ``ER'' are frequent winners. There's no predicting
how the academy folks really voted, but here's how they should have
cast their ballots:
</P>
<P>
   BEST COMEDY SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (CBS), ``Frasier,''
``Friends,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (NBC); ``Sex and the City'' (HBO).
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Frasier'' is still fabulous, the buzz this year is on
the gay-themed chuckles of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and the hetero-horny
humor of ``Sex and the City.'' Between these two, ``Will &AMP; Grace''
wins hands down. It's smart and funny with lovable, quirky
characters and super-choreographed slapstick. The bed-hopping and
profanity on ``Sex and the City'' were funny at first but not so
much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DRAMA SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``The West Wing,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``ER'' (NBC);
``The Practice'' (ABC); ``The Sopranos'' (HBO).
</P>
<P>
   Creator Aaron Sorkin thought a TV show that debated policy
issues such as gun control and school vouchers would never fly, but
``West Wing'' soared last season. Touching, sophisticated and
witty, this one deserves to beat the freshman taboo and win the big
one.
</P>
<P>
   TV MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``Annie,'' ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' (ABC); ``If These
Walls Could Talk 2,'' ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' ``RKO
281'' (HBO).
</P>
<P>
   Not a sterling year for TV movies, but these nominees were
worthwhile. By a squeaker, ``Dorothy Dandridge'' gets the nod _ for
bringing this complicated woman to life with fine acting and lavish
production values.
</P>
<P>
   MINISERIES
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``Arabian Nights,'' ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family'' (ABC); ``Jesus'' (CBS); ``The Corner'' (HBO); ``P.T.
Barnum'' (A&AMP;E).
</P>
<P>
   As much as I loved the stories and special effects on ``Arabian
Nights,'' I have to give the nod to ``The Corner.'' An edgy drama
about life on the mean streets, it wasn't fun but it was definitely
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR, COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Michael J. Fox, ``Spin City''; Kelsey Grammer,
``Frasier''; John Lithgow, ``3rd Rock From the Sun''; Eric
McCormack, ``Will &AMP; Grace''; Ray Romano, ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental favorite here is Michael J. Fox, who left his
sitcom last season to battle Parkinson's disease and spend time
with his family. But equally deserving _ and a year overdue _ is
Eric McCormack. Perfect timing, perfect delivery, perfect
performance.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS, COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Jenna Elfman, ``Dharma &AMP; Greg''; Patricia Heaton,
``Everybody Loves Raymond''; Jane Kaczmarek, ``Malcolm in the
Middle''; Debra Messing, ``Will &AMP; Grace''; Sarah Jessica Parker,
``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm torn here because Jane Kaczmarek and Debra Messing are both
so good. There would be no Will without Grace, and Messing is the
closest thing we've seen to a classic clown since Lucille Ball. But
Kaczmarek has been around a long time and finally has a role worthy
of her talent. Malcolm's mom will go down in TV history as the
funniest anti-nurturer ever.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR, DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Dennis Franz, ``NYPD Blue''; James Gandolfini, ``The
Sopranos''; Jerry Orbach, ``Law &AMP; Order''; Sam Waterston, ``Law &AMP;
Order''; Martin Sheen, ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm morally opposed to this category because two of the best
dramatic actors on TV weren't nominated: Billy Campbell of ``Once
and Again'' and Rick Schroder of ``NYPD Blue.'' The two nominees
from ``Law &AMP; Order'' are fine fellows, but the series doesn't
require much acting. Dennis Franz has won a zillion times, so it's
between neurotic gangster James Gandolfini and complex commander in
chief Martin Sheen. Give the Emmy to Sheen. He's played lots of
politicians, none better than Josiah Bartlett, and he classes up
the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS, DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Lorraine Bracco, ``The Sopranos''; Edie Falco, ``The
Sopranos''; Amy Brenneman, ``Judging Amy''; Julianna Margulies,
``ER''; Sela Ward, ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, this category belongs to Sela Ward. Going for the
gut is risky business and can result in a display of off-putting
hysteria rather than bone-deep, raw emotions. Ward aims true and
nails it every time.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK PICKS FOR SUPPORTERS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Best Supporting Actor, Comedy _ Sean Hayes, a k a ``Just Jack''
on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' should win. Other nominees: Peter Boyle,
``Everybody Loves Raymond''; Brad Garrett, ``Everybody Loves
Raymond''; Peter MacNicol, ``Ally McBeal''; David Hyde Pierce,
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Supporting Actress, Comedy _ Megan Mullally, as the rich
lush on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' should win. Other nominees: Jennifer
Aniston, ``Friends''; Lisa Kudrow, ``Friends''; Kim Cattrall, ``Sex
and the City''; Doris Roberts, ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Supporting Actor, Drama _ Richard Schiff, Toby on ``The
West Wing,'' should win. If you saw the episode about the homeless
Vietnam vet, you know why. Other nominees: Michael Badalucco, ``The
Practice''; Steve Harris, ``The Practice''; John Spencer, ``The
West Wing''; Dominic Chianese, ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Best Supporting Actress, Drama _ Allison Janney, tough as nails
and soft as a pillow as C.J. on ``The West Wing,'' gets the nod.
Other nominees: Stockard Channing, ``The West Wing''; Nancy
Marchand, ``The Sopranos''; Tyne Daly, ``Judging Amy''; Holland
Taylor, ``The Practice.''

 &HT;    Two New York Times reporters go inside an Asia on the cusp of
change
 &HT;    By Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After winning a Pulitzer for their splendid
reporting on China during the Tiananmen Square uprising, the New
York Times husband-and-wife team of Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl
WuDunn moved to a new assignment in Tokyo in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Already fluent in Chinese, they force-fed themselves Japanese
and put their three little children in Japanese schools. Then they
set out to cover what looked like it might be the big story of the
decade: the rise of Superpower Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But then came 1997. The bubble popped. Japan and the rest of
Asia keeled over into a recession that even now hasn't fully ended.
And Kristof and WuDunn found themselves parachuting all over Asia,
trying to explain to puzzled New York Times readers not just why
Japan's juggernaut economy slammed into reverse but also why
Thailand's currency wilted under hedge fund pressure, and why
seemingly rock-solid Indonesia fragmented overnight into
pitchfork-wielding mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kristof and WuDunn have wrapped up their findings about the
Asian economic crisis in a deftly written journalistic explainer
called ``Thunder from the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone thinking about doing business or pleasure in the Orient
will find this illuminating _ and a bit scary. With its peripatetic
reach and its focus on the quirky socioeconomic underside of Asia,
the book strikes me as a fitting update for ``Inside Asia,'' the
1939 best seller by the late John Gunther, one of my favorite
journalistic storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the high point in ``Thunder from the East'' was its
lavish depiction of a 10-course meal at an insanely expensive
Japanese restaurant called Kiccho. Dinner cost the two
correspondents and their American businessman host $600 apiece, not
counting drinks, geisha, tax and tip. Talk about prime beef: The
steak cooked on the hibachi for course seven came from Japanese
farmers who massage the steers' backs to make the meat more tender.
</P>
<P>
   However close to absolute perfection the meal was, the authors
called restaurants like Kiccho ``an emblem of a rotten system''
that have helped pull Japan into economic crisis. The
``ridiculous'' meal checks are invariably picked up on corporate
expense accounts out of unregulated shareholders' money. That sort
of entrenched profligacy is part of why the authors believe that
``Japan is slowly fading'' as an economic, cultural and political
influence over Asia. So eager are Japanese companies to curry favor
with their best customers that they continue to present
``institutionalized bribes,'' often in the form of a beautifully
lacquered box containing a rare Yubari melon (a little like a
cantaloupe) that can cost up to $1,100 per melon.
</P>
<P>
   From the eccentricities of decadent, rich Tokyo, Kristof and
WuDunn lead us on a safari through some of Asia's sadder hellholes
_ like a village in northeastern Thailand where a ``no-nonsense
peasant'' is forced to sell her 15-year-old granddaughter to a
Bangkok brothel for $40 in order to collect food for the rest of
her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruthlessness of Asian capitalism sometimes offends me. . .
.'' writes Kristof. ``But in a strange way, I find something
impressive in the way people can face the most wretched choices
and, rather than remain paralyzed, can choose what they see as the
least-worst and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kristof and WuDunn are describing the people they met and
events they saw, they are fascinating. They carry us to the
suddenly impoverished countryside in Indonesia, where in town after
town the inhabitants turned into wandering lynch mobs, using
machetes to whack off the heads of neighbors suspected of being
sorcerers. And on again to a mud-brick village on China's Yellow
River, where dozens of children are physically stunted and mentally
retarded, evidently because of toxic effluents from the local
fertilizer factory.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest knock on ``Thunder from the East'' is its
heavy-handed title, along with its shaky premise that Asia is
inexorably gaining on the West.
</P>
<P>
   This is how they put it: ``We do believe that in myriad ways
Asia will be a more important place, and that it will gradually
displace the United States as the `center of the world.' '' They
also write, ``the next World War, if there is one, will almost
certainly begin in Asia'' and ``Asia is likely to wrench economic,
diplomatic, and military power from the West over the coming
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Here I think the authors may have fallen into a snare that has
too often bagged foreign correspondents (myself included).
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you have filled notebooks with pages of wonderful
color and great quotes about some bizarre place that you may have
risked your digestive tract (or maybe your life) to find.
</P>
<P>
   Now the problem is how to make your story appeal to the
multitudes of zoned-out readers in the United States. So what do
you do when you fire up your laptop? Too often you push too hard to
craft a catchy ``nut paragraph'' (journalists' lingo for a premise
or conclusion). Then you shout it at the top of your lungs in hopes
that someone out there will notice the color and quotes you
traveled so far to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If you just want to get a feel for how life really
is in Asia, you'll find this book a good read. But don't get hung
up on its cosmic predictions about what might happen in Asia in the
year 2040.

CLINTON CALLS FOR MORE SPENDING TO PREVENT WILDFIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After what he called ``one of the worst fire seasons in
memory,'' President Clinton said Saturday that he would seek to
more than double federal spending on wildfire programs in the year
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Congress for nearly $1.6 billion to aid affected
communities and to try to prevent future blazes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was in part an attempt to bounce back
politically after weeks in which Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
have come under sharp criticism from Republicans, including Gov.
George W. Bush, for what their critics say is a pro-environment
bias that has increased the fire risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even as cooler weather and rain have begun to dampen this year's
flames, concern about fires and their aftermath remains intense
across the West, in a season that has already burned more than 6
million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for more spending may have been aimed in
particular at voters in California, Washington and Oregon, which
are seen as important to Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving lives and property is, and will remain, Priority 1,''
Clinton said in his radio address on Saturday from New York City.
He said next year's wildfire budget should jump to $2.8 billion, up
from $1.2 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   About $700 million of the additional money would go to replenish
accounts depleted by the cost of fighting fires during a year
likely to have the most devastation from fires in half a century.
Other increases would extend relief to hard-hit communities and pay
for efforts to restore the worst of the fire-ravaged areas, and _
in what administration officials have portrayed as a hallmark of
the plan _ greatly increase programs aimed at reducing fire risks
by thinning overgrown forests of their smallest, most fire-prone
trees, while leaving the largest, most fire-resistant trees behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our administration has taken a new approach to protect
communities and reduce wildfire risks by getting rid of the forest
underbrush that has accumulated over the last century,'' Clinton
said. He added, ``We want to work with communities to expand these
efforts, in an environmentally sensitive way, particularly in those
areas at greatest risk of wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, described in a report submitted to the president by
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman, did not say how widespread the program expansion would
be. Current thinning efforts, which rely on prescribed thinning by
mechanical means and controlled fires, cover 2.4 million acres a
year, a fraction of the 40 million acres of public land that remain
at catastrophic risk of fire, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   An estimate by the General Accounting Office has put the total
cost of a thinning effort at $12 billion over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton conceded that this year's fires did in
part grow out of past policies, but he pointed the finger at the
nearly 100 years in which federal managers emphasized forest
suppression over forest health. The Clinton administration began to
move away from that approach five years ago, through policies that
have emphasized preventive fires and mechanical cutting. Some of
those fires started by government forestry officials in routine
maintenance blazed out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The president's critics have argued that the best way to make
forests healthier would be by permitting more timber sales on
public lands. But the White House made clear that it was rejecting
that approach, saying that the report from Babbitt and Glickman
favored alternatives that ``can successfully reduce fire risk
without relying on increased commercial logging.''
</P>
<P>
   A report late last month by the bipartisan Congressional
Research Service found no link between logging and fire risk, but
critics have questioned that conclusion, saying that the damage
from this year's fires could have been reduced if more timber
harvesting had been permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, commercial loggers harvested about 3 billion board
feet of timber from public land, a sharp decline from almost 13
billion board feet harvested in the late 1980s. One reason for the
decline was increased attention by the Clinton administration and
the federal courts to environmental concerns, such as the risk to
the habitat of the spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush has been among those saying that the
Clinton administration's policies were at least in part to blame
for the severity of this year's fires. Bush has vowed ``to put our
national forests back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over logging and fires is likely to become even more
prominent in the days ahead as Congress takes up the
administration's request. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who is
chairman of the Senate Forests and Public Lands Management
subcommittee, has already called for hearings to examine the
prospect of increased timber cutting on public land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, a spokesman for the timber industry, which has
close ties to Western Republicans, described the administration's
approach as a good first step toward recognizing the importance of
reducing fire risks. But the spokesman, Michael Klein of the
American Forest and Paper Association, said it would be a mistake
to shut his industry out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial logging is a dirty word for them, but it works
pretty well on our private lands, which provide jobs, healthy
forests and just as many fish and wildlife habitats as do public
lands,'' Klein said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for thinning forests has been shaped in large part by a
program under way in Flagstaff, Ariz., which has won support from
some business and environmental groups, but which is opposed by
other environmentalists on the grounds that it could pose dangers
to animal habitat.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other forestry expert, however, praised the
administration's stepped-up approach: ``They're talking about a
strong program for mechanical thinning and prescribed burning, and
that's exactly what these forests need,'' said Michael Goergen,
director of forest policy for the Society of American Foresters.

ROBERT KENNEDY'S '64 CAMPAIGN MAY HOLD LESSONS FOR MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He stepped out of the shadows of another political
era one morning last week, a familiar silhouette walking at the
side of Hillary Rodham Clinton along the Hudson River in the Upper
West Side neighborhood that had so rallied around his father,
Robert F. Kennedy, when he ran for senator 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of the 1964 Democratic candidate
for the Senate, had been recruited by Clinton's campaign to talk
about the environment, but it soon became clear that that was not
the only reason for this news conference. Without prompting,
Kennedy began reminiscing about his father's campaign and his
success in overcoming the accusations of carpetbagging and the
``hatred of my father'' that he had found in New York in the summer
of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene shimmering with history, and evocative of the
battle Clinton finds herself in today. Kennedy, like Clinton, was a
polarizing figure seeking to represent a state where he did not
live, a first-time candidate for public office whose last name,
more than anything else, accounted for the honor of his nomination
to run for senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters routinely offer up the election of Robert
Kennedy as the case study that demonstrates that she can overcome
the difficulties that have arisen in her campaign. The first lady
has spent hours studying newspaper clips from the 1964 campaign, an
aide said, and lessons drawn from the Kennedy candidacy have shaped
much of what she has done these past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the seeming symmetry between these two races, the
candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy is arguably more a tale of caution
than of comfort for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The characterizations of Kennedy as a carpetbagger emerged from
the moment he announced his candidacy at Gracie Mansion _
demonstrators carried signs that said ``Bobby Go Home'' _ and they
festered until the very end of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you represent a state where you cannot even vote?''
asked a full-page newspaper advertisement bought by Democrats
supporting the Republican in the race, Sen. Kenneth B. Keating. The
editorial pages of the state's major newspapers, in particular
those of The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune,
opposed Kennedy's march into New York every step of the way,
dismissing him, in the words of one Times editorial, for
``attempting to use New York and the senatorial office in a
relentless quest for greater political power.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robert Kennedy in 1964, and for Hillary Rodham Clinton
today, the label carpetbagger was really shorthand for a general
condemnation, expressed in startlingly similar terms: They were,
according to their critics, ambitious, opportunistic, ruthless (for
Kennedy) and untrustworthy (for Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kennedy won that race in 1964, but by 720,000 votes in a
year when President Lyndon B. Johnson carried New York by 2.5
million votes. In addition, Kennedy was running against a
64-year-old white-haired incumbent who, while respected and
popular, ran a clumsy campaign in the critical final week. Without
Johnson at the top of the ticket, Kennedy might very well have
lost, or have won by even fewer votes, largely because of the
attacks on his residency, according to his associates at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge thing,'' the younger Kennedy said in an
interview. ``As a 10-year-old, I knew what the word carpetbagger
meant, and where it came from. It was part of the conversation in
our house every day. I remember for my father's birthday, people
giving him carpetbags as presents. It was a constantly resounding
theme during that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Kennedy's Senate campaign, R. Peter Straus, said
he came to view Kennedy's Massachusetts residence as perhaps the
biggest obstacle to winning the election. ``It was a big issue,
this carpetbagging thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Straus sounded much like Clinton's advisers, though he would not
offer any direct comparisons with Clinton's situation, noting his
own particular relationship with the first family. (Straus is
married to Marcia Lewis, the mother of Monica Lewinsky.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats today, mindful of the lessons of Kennedy's 1964
victory, say they believe that the single most important factor in
determining Clinton's success in her race against Rep. Rick Lazio
will be how well Al Gore fares against George W. Bush in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While leaders in both parties say it is highly likely that Gore
will defeat Bush in the state, it seems improbable that he will
come close to matching Johnson's 2.5 million-vote cushion against
Sen. Barry Goldwater in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, it is doubtful that Gore can do for Clinton what
Johnson did for Kennedy. Voters these days are more independent,
and a vote for Gore may not necessarily guarantee a vote for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, although Clinton is the wife of a sitting
president popular in New York, Bobby Kennedy was the brother of a
martyred president, running for office less than one year after
John F. Kennedy was killed. The trauma of that assassination
shadowed Kennedy wherever he went in New York that fall. ``You
couldn't vote against Robert Kennedy without seeing the presence of
John Kennedy,'' said William J. vanden Heuvel, former deputy
representative of the United States to the United Nations, who was
deputy manager of the Kennedy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, it was the assassination of his brother
that led Robert Kennedy to examine his own future.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton today, Kennedy, who was the U.S. attorney general,
was approaching the end of his time in Washington, and at the age
of 38, he wanted to follow the path that his brothers had taken
into elective politics. Some upstate Democratic leaders began
floating Kennedy's name as a prospective opponent to Keating, who
stood as a difficult target for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's initial interest was not in running for the Senate,
but in maneuvering to become Johnson's vice-presidential nominee.
That June, in what was seen in Washington as a signal to Johnson,
Kennedy announced that he did not want to be considered for the New
York Senate nomination. But Johnson's dislike for the younger
Kennedy was deep and well known, and at the end of July, the
president announced that would not consider any sitting Cabinet
member as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was now the middle of the summer, and Kennedy had to move
fast. He could not realistically run for office in his home state,
Massachusetts, because its voters had already elected Edward M.
Kennedy senator. So Robert Kennedy flew to New York, met with Mayor
Robert F. Wagner and won his support to enter the race, instantly
eclipsing the Democrat who almost certainly would have won the
nomination, Rep. Samuel S. Stratton, from upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy found himself under immediate attack _ for much the same
reason that Clinton is criticized now. ``People have been standing
in line at the World's Fair longer than my opponent has been a
resident of New York,'' Keating declared.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy set out to address the problem, with a kind of road map
that Clinton seems to be following 36 years later. He began a
tireless schedule of travel across the state, seeking in 10 weeks
to become a familiar fixture in New York, as she did over 15
months. He established a residence, though with so little time, he
was forced to rent, rather than buy, a home on Long Island and a
hotel suite in Manhattan. He had begun so late that he could not
change his registration from Massachusetts to New York, so he could
not vote for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy confronted the carpetbagger issue directly when he
accepted the party's nomination, much the way Clinton did in
formally announcing her candidacy. ``For every citizen who is a New
Yorker by birth, there is one who is a New Yorker by choice, or
whose parents were,'' Kennedy said at the nominating convention.
``I am in the second of that category, and so was Thomas E.
Dewey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy had one critical advantage over Clinton: he had
spent many of his first 20 years growing up in New York: in
Riverdale, a Bronx neighborhood, and in Bronxville, in Westchester
County. One early campaign stop was a visit to what had been the
family home in Riverdale, with a young John F. Kennedy Jr. at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Clinton faced other difficulties as newcomers in New
York. Kennedy, like Clinton, was frustrated by his difficulty
capturing support from Jewish voters. That was a major reason, a
Kennedy adviser said, that Straus, who is Jewish, was made campaign
chairman, a highly visible job.
</P>
<P>
   Keating attacked Kennedy for not having a voting record, using
some of the same language Lazio has used to try to discredit
Clinton's credentials. Kennedy responded by rummaging through his
years at the Justice Department for accomplishments to cite, much
the way Clinton has engaged in a reclamation project from her years
as first lady, although without the advantage of having Cabinet
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates tried to undermine their opponents in nearly
identical ways: Clinton by tying Lazio to the conservative
Republican policies of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Kennedy
by linking Keating to the conservative policies of Barry Goldwater,
though Keating never endorsed Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   And Kennedy, like Clinton today, was a celebrity as much as he
was a candidate, attracting swarms of New Yorkers _ though,
Kennedy's aides would later acknowledge, not necessarily voters _
wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate, people turned out in the middle of the night, some
wearing pajamas, for a glimpse of Kennedy. At the nominating
convention, ``we had press tables perpendicular to the stage, and
we're writing our stories and fans start jumping on the stage,
running along this long table where all the press was, to get to
him,'' recalled Milton Hoffman, a veteran New York political
journalist and columnist who is a member of the editorial board at
The Journal News in White Plains. Hoffman compared the scene to the
night Judy Garland performed at the Westchester County Center.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Kennedy evoked the memory of what had happened
the year before in Dallas. ``He looks and sounds just enough like
his murdered brother to send a ghostly flutter through the New York
crowds,'' James Reston wrote in The Times. ``When he rode through
the bustling traffic of Manhattan today, people stopped on the
sidewalks as if they had suddenly seen an apparition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps the most striking _ and the most curious _
similarity is the deep hostility stirred by both candidates,
particularly among some voters who would presumably be their
obvious supporters. Robert Kennedy Jr. struggled at length with
that question in a telephone conversation, saying that Clinton's
difficulties in this race raised unresolved questions about the
animosity his father had found in so many parts of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusations against him are the same kind of accusations
about Hillary: that he was opportunistic, a carpetbagger, that he
is only running because he wants to run for president,'' Kennedy
said. ``The intensity of feeling with my father's race, and the
almost inexplicable intensity of feeling toward Hillary Clinton.
People who ought to like Hillary Clinton, but don't, and can't
really explain why, but just kind of have a visceral reaction to
her _ that's the same kind of thing that I remember from my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who should have liked him, but didn't,'' he continued.
``I remember reading The Village Voice when I was a kid and being
horrified. The cartoons and that kind of stuff, and how vicious the
attacks were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy sighed. ``You explain it to me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Politicians and mobsters are favorites for this year's Emmys
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Can a beefy mobster whack the president of
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   That's the juiciest question to be answered on tonight's 52nd
annual Emmy awards. Both ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's gritty mob series,
and ``The West Wing,'' NBC's intelligent political drama, are up
for 18 awards. Of course, we all know Tony Soprano could easily
whip Martin Sheen's President Bartlet in a back-alley brawl. But
this is the stodgy Emmys, for crying out loud! An awards show where
conventional wisdom _ and old-fashioned common sense _ are often
tossed aside like last week's People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question, though, is: Will anybody care? The ratings
for last year's Emmys were the lowest since 1990. Viewers, no
doubt, were fed up with seeing the same cast of characters winning.
Helen Hunt! Kristen Johnston! Dennis Franz! David Hyde Pierce! John
Lithgow!
</P>
<P>
   Ugh!
</P>
<P>
   After last year's critical backlash, the folks at the Academy of
Television Arts &AMP; Sciences ditched the blue-ribbon voting panels
that required judges to watch hours of tape over one weekend while
cooped up in a hotel. Now, judges can watch tapes wherever they
want.
</P>
<P>
   The result? More than 3,500 voting members participated this
year _ nearly three times as many as last year's total. But, more
important, there's a better crop of nominees. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' _
one of last year's major snubs _ received 11 nominations. Last year
it got only one. ``Sex and the City's'' nominations zoomed from two
to nine. And, thankfully ``NYPD Blue,'' a perennial best drama
candidate, was left off the ballot. Too bad the judges didn't do
the same for the woefully mediocre ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who's gonna win? As usual, it's a big crapshoot. But that
won't stop me: Here are my picks for who will win, who should win
and who got dissed.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``ER;'' ``Law &AMP; Order;'' ``The Practice;'' ``The
Sopranos;'' ``The West Wing''
</P>
<P>
   What will win: After feting David E. Kelley last year, ``The
Sopranos'' finally gets an award it can't refuse, even though it
was more deserving last season.
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``The West Wing'' for making me believe in our
political system again. Don't you wish Martin Sheen was really our
president?
</P>
<P>
   What was overlooked: No other drama moved me more than ``Once
and Again,'' a complex _ and achingly realistic _ ensemble drama.
And when will thick-headed voters stop driving a stake through
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' heart?
</P>
<P>
   BEST COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Everybody Loves Raymond;'' ``Frasier;''
``Friends;'' ``Sex and the City;'' ``Will &AMP; Grace''
</P>
<P>
   What will/should win: Toss a coin. All are top-notch and
laugh-out-loud funny. But ``Frasier'' was wildly inconsistent. So
was the raunchy ``Sex and the City.'' Academy judges still don't
seem inclined to give ``Raymond'' its due. That leaves ``Friends,''
which has been ignored far too long for the hilarious comedy
machine it is.
</P>
<P>
   What was overlooked: The zany ``Malcolm in the Middle `` almost
single-handedly revived the tired sitcom genre, with its
distinctive, delightfully off-center point of view.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR _ DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Dennis Franz (''NYPD Blue''); James Gandolfini
(''The Sopranos''); Jerry Orbach (''Law &AMP; Order''); Martin Sheen
(''The West Wing''); Sam Waterston (''Law &AMP; Order'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will/should win: Fuhgetaboudit . . . Gandolfini whacks the
competition. I dare you to take your eyes off him while he's on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS _ DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Lorraine Bracco (''The Sopranos''); Amy Brenneman
(''Judging Amy''); Edie Falco (''The Sopranos''); Julianna
Margulies (''ER''); Sela Ward (''Once and Again'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: The fabulous Falco gets the gold for the second
consecutive year. On a male-dominated show, she more than holds her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: As the wonderfully flawed Lily Manning, Ward
plays a rich, full-bodied character with style, grace and delicious
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Too bad no one takes Sarah Michelle Gellar's
stellar acting seriously on ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR _ COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Michael J. Fox (''Spin City''); Kelsey Grammer
(''Frasier''); John Lithgow (''3rd Rock from the Sun''); Eric
McCormack (''Will &AMP; Grace''); Ray Romano (''Everybody Loves
Raymond'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Not only will Fox nab the sentimental vote, he'll
also be treated to the night's longest standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Grammer remains a comic genius, even after a
spotty year.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Ryan Reynolds of ``Two Guys and a Girl'' . .
. OK, just making sure you're paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS _ COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Jenna Elfman (''Dharma &AMP; Greg''); Patricia Heaton
(''Everybody Loves Raymond''); Jane Kaczmarek (''Malcolm in the
Middle''); Debra Messing (''Will &AMP; Grace''); Sarah Jessica Parker
(''Sex and the City'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Kaczmarek's kooky mom character is a lovable
standout.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Heaton's quiet brilliance has made ``Raymond''
one of TV's best comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Nobody in what is a historically weak field.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR _
</P>
<P>
   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Michael Badalucco (''The Practice''); Dominic
Chianese (''The Sopranos''); Steve Harris (''The Practice'');
Richard Schiff (''The West Wing''); John Spencer (''The West
Wing'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: It's neck-and-neck between Chianese and Spencer.
And the winner is . . . Chianese by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: The mesmerizing Harris for getting snubbed the
last two years when the competition wasn't as steep.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Dennis Haysbert was smooth, menacing,
charismatic and a surprisingly pitch-perfect singer on CBS'
canceled ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS _ DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Stockard Channing (''The West Wing''); Tyne Daly
(''Judging Amy''); Allison Janney (''The West Wing''); Nancy
Marchand (''The Sopranos''); Holland Taylor (''The Practice'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will/should win: The late Marchand played a delightfully
scheming mom we all loved to hate. A quick question: Why in heck
was Channing nominated in the best supporting actress category when
her first lady character is only a recurring one?
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR _ COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Peter Boyle (''Everybody Loves Raymond''); Brad
Garrett (''Everybody Loves Raymond''); Sean Hayes (''Will &AMP;
Grace''); Peter MacNicol (''Ally McBeal''); David Hyde Pierce
(''Frasier'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will/should win: If Hayes doesn't dance away with that
16-inch statue, I'm launching an investigation. No one steals
scenes _ or does impromptu Cher impressions _ better.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: As Eric's grumpy dad on ``That '70s Show,''
Kurtwood Smith cracks me up whenever he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS _ Comedy
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Jennifer Aniston (''Friends''); Kim Cattrall
(''Sex and the City''); Lisa Kudrow (''Friends''); Megan Mullally
(''Will &AMP; Grace''); Doris Roberts (''Everybody Loves Raymond'')
</P>
<P>
   Who will/should win: Like Sean Hayes, Mullally knows how to take
over a scene by simply arching an eyebrow or shaking those
delicious hips of hers.
</P>
<P>
   Who was overlooked: Wendie Malick is the funniest character on
NBC's ``Just Shoot Me'' _ and that includes David Spade.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MINISERIES
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Arabian Nights;'' ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family;'' ``The Corner;'' ``Jesus;'' ``P.T. Barnum''
</P>
<P>
   What will/should win: ``The Corner'' was the most powerful,
gut-wrenching TV event of the season. Period.
</P>
<P>
   What was overlooked: Are you kidding? The academy had a hard
enough time finding four other worthy nominees.
</P>
<P>
   BEST TV MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Annie;'' ``If These Walls Could Talk 2;''
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge;'' ``Oprah Winfrey Presents:''
``Tuesdays With Morrie;'' ``RKO 281''
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``RKO 281.'' The judges' love affair with HBO
continues.
</P>
<P>
   What should win: Yes,''Tuesdays With Morrie ``was sappy and
predictable, but so what? Jack Lemmon _ America's grandfather _ was
magnificent as a dying college professor who bonded with his
one-time student.
</P>
<P>
   What was overlooked: Showtime's ``Strange Justice'' examined the
sordid Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill affair with dignity, intelligence
and raw power.

 &HT;    Meet the guy who counts Emmy votes
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only three people know tonight's Emmy
winners. All of them work for Ernst &AMP; Young, the Los Angeles
accounting firm that compiles and tabulates the votes. Jeff Rosen,
an Ernst &AMP; Young partner, is one of those three accountants. Of
course, we tried our best to get a tight-lipped Rosen to spill the
beans about tonight's winners.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm an inquisitive TV critic. I want a scoop. Give me the
name of one winner. I'll hook you up with Yasmine Bleeth. I can do
it, you know.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm sorry, I can't tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not even for Yasmine Bleeth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tabulating and compiling votes sounds like a pain in the
butt. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, how many accountants get to be on TV? But it's a very
detailed job because everything has to be triple checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's it like being on TV?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on the producer of the show. Sometimes it's a
quick Rose Bowl Parade wave. But last year (WWF wrestlers) Steve
Austin and The Rock interviewed us and ``TV Guide'' said it was one
of the most clever part of the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How was The Rock?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was a genuinely nice guy. At the rehearsal, a disabled boy
wanted to meet him. There were no press people there and he needed
to catch a plane and was running late, but the boy's mother came up
to him and asked him to meet her son. He got out of his limo and
walked a long way just to meet the kid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever scored with this line: ``Hey, babe, I'm an
accountant for Ernst &AMP; Young and I know all the Emmy winners?''
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) No, because I don't think that would work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever been bribed before?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. But some reporters who have been covering the Emmys for a
long time will jokingly say, ``Come on, if you tell me now, I can
start writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does Ernst &AMP; Young keep you from blabbing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a partner in the firm and we know that it's both an honor
and a responsibility to make sure everything is done perfectly. We
never even consider spilling the beans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You help tabulate the votes for TV's best shows, yet you
don't watch much TV. Don't you find that ironic?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is kind of funny. Often I have to ask people on the stage
who is the person I'm presenting the envelope to, even if they're
well known. Benjamin Bratt (''Law &AMP; Order'') is the nicest guy in
the world, but I had no idea who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The only other Ernst I know is Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the
James Bond movies. Do you ever tease Ernst about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, never. But he's long gone. This firm's been around for
over 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do people think all accountants are stuffy?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. They'd be surprised if they really knew. We're
more outgoing than people think.

 &HT;    Family gives Buford-Bailey winning inspiration
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The answer to a tearful, head-shaking,
luck-cussin' Olympic question could be found a couple of days ago
in the living room of a home in Huber Heights.
</P>
<P>
   On the couch was Georgianna Buford and in her wheelchair was
daughter, Crystal. They are two women who have had a lot to do with
the success of Tonja Buford-Bailey, the Dayton hurdler who is
headed to her third straight Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Tonja has admitted it herself. Her mom and her sister _ who, at
31, is a year older than she _ have given her the mettle to medal.
One has provided the backbone and other has given her the legs _ so
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   That inspiration was evident at the Olympic Time Trials in
Sacramento seven weeks ago. That's where Buford-Bailey put on a
performance many thought was not possible. Her performance prompted
an emotional question from a stunned, unexpectedly-beaten
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it went:
</P>
<P>
   While Buford-Bailey won the bronze medal in the 400 meter
hurdles at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, she then disappeared from
competition for two years as she nursed some injuries, then gave
birth to her son, VJ, who now is a couple weeks shy of 2.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally returned to the track in early 1999, her
hurdling form was a mess and the results were worse. After coming
into the Atlanta Olympic Games with the second fastest time in
history _ her 52.62 seconds was just 1/100th of a second off the
world record _ she ran a 60.8 in the 1999 Prefontaine Classic. When
she was 14, she had run faster.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better and early this year when she
turned in a disheartening 58.9 at her first big meet. It was around
that time that she made one of her frequent trips from her home in
Dallas back to Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had come back to train with her old coach at Illinois for
a while, but she was running terrible,'' Georgianna said. ``She was
turning in times she got back at Meadowdale (High) and she was
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were riding in the car on the way to the Fairfield Commons
Mall and I could see it in her face. Even though they think you
don't, a mother knows what's in their children's minds. She wanted
to quit. She could go back home with her husband (former pro
football player Victor Bailey) and her child and have a superb
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her 'OK, you want to quit. But let me ask you one
thing. When they line up to race in Sydney _ and they're running
times that you ran _ are you still going to be happy for them or
will you cry?' She said, 'I'll probably cry.' That's when I said,
'Then you can't quit. Not on those terms.'
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the Trials, she had begun to improve and that
finally got her into the eight-woman finals _ where only the top
three finishers would win a trip to Sydney. Coming off the eighth
hurdle in what was a 10-hurdle race, Buford-Bailey was sixth and
almost certainly out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I panicked,'' Buford-Bailey said, ``but then I just thought,
'Forget form. Go after them and catch one at a time.' ``
</P>
<P>
   By the last hurdle, she still was fifth. But with a final sprint
to the tape, she passed Michelle Johnson and then _ just a stride
from the finish _ Joanna Hayes to finish at 54.70. Sandra Glover
was first at 53.33, Kim Batten was second.
</P>
<P>
   Among those beaten was Yvonne Harrison, whose heritage,
Georgianna said, could have assured her a spot on the Jamaican
team. She chose the United States instead because the opportunities
are more lucrative here and she figured her chances of winning were
good since Buford-Bailey, especially, seemed to be a sitting duck.
</P>
<P>
   But the duck turned into a swan and afterward a disconsolate
Harrison tearfully wondered: ``How did that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was right there in Huber Heights. While Buford-Bailey
certainly is inspired by her son, her husband and her other
siblings, no one has given her more than Georgianna and Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Although she now has a decent paying job as a prison guard at
the Warren Correctional Institution in Lebanon, Georgianna said
early on, life was anything but decent. She had come from a
background of abuse and spent her first eight years in an
orphanage. By age 16, she'd quit school and had her first child.
After five more children, she was divorced in the mid 1980s. Six
months later, Crystal was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the children to work jobs, get good grades and delve
into sports, she eventually saw each child pursue a college degree.
At present, even Crystal _ who maneuvers her wheelchair into an RTA
bus each week day _ is just two courses away from a degree at
Sinclair Community College. Georgianna herself is completing a
degree as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids saw how hard it was for me, but we stressed one
thing,'' Georgianna said. ``It was that there's always something
better just ahead. And the way to get it was to draw strength from
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   And the font of that fortitude has been Crystal, who was
diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at 15 and relegated to a
wheelchair 18-months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Tonja are close,'' Georgianna said. ``There's a
special bond there. They talk on the phone a lot. I think Tonja
draws on the same thing I do. Crystal has a great attitude. She
lifts us all up out of the gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Tonja has talked about what her sister means to
her: ``Every race I run, every day I train _ I'm doing it with my
sister in mind. We're just a year apart and that could just as well
be me. She's a beautiful person and she taught me a lot. The way I
look at it, the strength taken from her has been given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal smiled at such assessment: ``Now she's got the legs for
both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Buford-Bailey qualified for the Olympics at the 1996
Trials, she ran into the stands and gave her sister her medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so sweet,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Crystal's condition has not improved. Her hands and
fingers curl inward, as do her feet. But rather than lament, she
shows off her long, ornately decorated fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real, too,'' she said proudly, with a gleam in her
beautiful eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same look that got her sister _ according to Mom _
voted one of the world's most beautiful athletes at a track meet in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonja called me last night from a meet in Europe,'' Crystal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mom shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah Crystal gets it all,'' Georgianna said. ``I haven't
gotten my medal yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgianna has gotten a lot of other things though. She told
stories of her first Olympic trip _ to Barcelona in 1992 _ when
Tonja was one of the youngest athletes on the American team. While
Tonja didn't make the final, mother and daughter had a good time
afterwards. Georgianna told of kibitzing with Dream Team basketball
stars Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing and of
being befriended by Jesse Owens' daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, she told of the ``unbelievable feeling'' that came
as she watched her daughter win an Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I'll be truthful. I wasn't sure if she was gonna
make it,'' Georgianna said. ``When I saw her way back there at the
Trials, I was worried that was it. But the old home girl pulled
through for us. In the end, I should have known she would have
something extra.''
</P>
<P>
   She did.
</P>
<P>
   A mother's backbone and a sister's legs.

AILING JACOBS WILL NOT BATTLE MASTERKOVA IN 1,500 METERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia _ Finally, Regina Jacobs would break the
cycle of brilliant Olympic trials and unsatisfying Olympic Games.
At 37, she was at the peak of her running career. Having won a pair
of silver medals in the 1,500 meters at the world championships,
she would challenge for gold in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   All those expectations dissolved Saturday when Jacobs announced
from her home in Oakland, Calif., that she was withdrawing from the
American Olympic team because of a viral infection in her lungs.
She could not breathe properly in training, she said, and an
insufficient oxygen supply gave her no chance of challenging the
defending champion in the metric mile, Svetlana Masterkova of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the U.S. track and
field federation, called the development ``a terrible loss for the
U.S. team and for her, given how hard she had worked to get to this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gold-medal favorite, the world-champion shot-putter C.J.
Hunter, remains questionable after undergoing orthoscopic knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major meet from which Jacobs has withdrawn.
She missed the 1995 world track and field championships in
Goeteborg, Sweden, with a foot problem. Now she is out of the
Olympics in the metric mile, having previously finished 10th at the
Atlanta Games and having failed to make the final in 1992 and 1988.
Shayne Culpepper, who finished fourth at the Olympic trials in
July, will replace Jacobs in Sydney, but she has no expectation of
winning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jacobs, winner of both the 1,500 and the 5,000 meters at
the Olympic trials, who seemed to have a real chance to bring the
American women their first Olympic gold medal in the 1,500 meters.
She had won silver medals at the 1997 and 1999 world championships,
overcoming an iron deficiency with supplements and a change in
diet. A more efficient stride encouraged her that she could finally
challenge Masterkova's blistering kick in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs set an American record of 14 minutes 45.35 seconds in the
5,000 meters on July 21. In hindsight, some track experts Saturday
questioned why Jacobs, who has a history of allergies and illness,
subjected her body to the stress of that 3.1-mile race at the
trials when she had no intention of running the event in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said her respiratory troubles began Aug. 11, three weeks
after the Olympic trials, where she finished 14th out of 16 runners
in a 3,000-meter race in Zurich, Switzerland. Her time of 8:50.12
was 24 seconds behind the winner, Gabriela Szabo of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   After a regimen of antibiotics, Jacobs appeared to have
recovered from the viral infection, according to her agent, Emanuel
Hudson. But on Tuesday she grew exhausted after two repetitions of
a planned workout of 9 x 500 meters, he said, and a doctor's
examination showed she was breathing at only 65 percent of
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to get it under control before Sydney, but we seem
to have run out of time,'' Jacobs said of her relapse. Hudson, her
agent, said: ``She told me, `My chances of medaling are zero and
none, and I don't want to waste a spot on the team.'''

   WASHINGTON _ By day, Al Gore will be talking about education. By
night, he will be raising money.
</P>
<P>
   This coming week, the vice president will campaign in the swing
states Illinois and Ohio to emphasize education, then comb the
Northeast corridor for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will appear on two television talk shows _ Oprah Winfrey on
Monday in Chicago and David Letterman on Thursday in New York. He
also has fund-raisers in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Boston on
Wednesday and New York on Thursday that should raise at least $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund raising comes as Democrats lag in the money chase. Gov.
George W. Bush has raised nearly $100 million, and the Bush
campaign has spent twice as much each week on television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official said that the party planned to step up its
anti-Gore commercials next week, a barrage that Gore told his
supporters they needed to counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the other side has pulled out all the stops and has
gone just way beyond what anybody ever thought would happen in the
post-Watergate reform era in not staying within the guidelines and
so forth,'' Gore said at a reception in Atlanta on Friday, where
250 people paid $1,000 each. ``So if you could help us just remain
in the same ball park, just close, then that's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Public Integrity, from January 1999
through May 31, 2000, Gore raised $47.7 million, spent $39 million
and had $8.2 million in cash. Bush raised $87.5 million, spent
$79.5 million and had $7.1 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months ending June 30, the Democratic National
Committee collected $118.6 million in unregulated, or soft-money,
donations, nearly erasing the traditional Republican advantage in
such contributions. The Republican National Committee reported $137
million in soft-money donations over the same period.

AFTER COMPLAINT OF ILLNESS, MAYOR DEFENDS SPRAY EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged on Saturday that
a woman had been treated at an emergency room on Monday after she
complained of being sprayed with a pesticide used to kill
mosquitoes that spread the West Nile virus. But the mayor said
there was ``obviously a discrepancy'' between the city's spraying
schedule and the woman's account of when she was sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose account was published on Saturday in the Daily
News, was quoted as saying she was drenched with the pesticide at
10:45 p.m. last Sunday as she stood on West 58th Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The News article, coming amid controversy over widespread
pesticide spraying that the city has undertaken to ward off an
outbreak of the West Nile virus, said the woman, an artist whom the
newspaper did not identify, had been sprayed at point-blank range
by a passing city truck. As a result, it said, she experienced
severe nausea and eye problems and feared more serious long-term
effects because she has a form of asthma that reacts to chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Saturday, the mayor was joined by Health
Department officials who shed little light on the incident other
than to say it was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know this person,'' said Dr. Benjamin Mojica, the deputy
health commissioner, although he also declined to identify her,
citing patient confidentiality. ``We intend to follow up with her
and see how she is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said the woman's version conflicted with city
records, which show that spraying in the area where the incident is
said to have occurred did not begin until shortly before midnight
last Sunday, at least an hour after the woman said she was sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody started spraying early, they shouldn't have, and
we don't think they did,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor also said that incidents like the one described in
the Daily News might be unavoidable because of how much spraying is
taking place. Health officials predict they will need to continue
spraying the pesticide, Anvil, across the city for at least another
month, or until mosquitoes that carry the virus are killed by
subfreezing temperatures. The mayor said it was the responsibility
of New Yorkers to ``pay attention to announcements, since the
spraying is not going to stop if you are standing there.''

CONGRESSIONAL RACES NOT JUST ABOUT POWER, BUT PERKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear party leaders and candidates tell it, the
Nov. 7 battle for control of the House of Representatives is all
about shaping the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also about personal power and perks, choice offices and
close-in parking.
</P>
<P>
   Seniority outranks partisanship in Congress, where members move
up in status and into better offices based on their years of
service. Those moves come at the expense of colleagues who've
retired, died in office or been defeated at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to move every two years,'' said Gene Smith, chief of
staff for Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills. ``We're always on
the lookout for more office space.''
</P>
<P>
   So whatever the outcome of the election, the Capitol's
furniture-moving crews will have their hands full between November
and January, when the new Congress convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who faces no GOP opposition for a 10th term, has offices
in the maze-like Rayburn Building, one of three marble-clad
complexes used by House members and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rayburn, built in 1965 with such conveniences as private baths,
tops the House office pecking order. Closest to the Capitol and the
site of most committee hearing rooms, it also sports an electric
subway that transports members to the House floor for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Longworth Building, completed in 1933, is the second-most
desirable office locale. The smallest complex, it is prized for its
architecture and reviled for its sketchy elevator service and lack
of windows with decent views. It is linked to the Capitol and other
offices by a pedestrian tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the barrel is the Cannon Building. Built in
1907 and much the worse for decades of wear, it stands the farthest
from the Capitol. It sports a poorly designed fifth-floor addition,
built in 1913 and known as ``The Gulag.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sechrist, a 20-year veteran House employee who works as
press aide to Rep. Joe Baca, D-Rialto, thinks a lot these days
about Cannon's fifth floor and its evoked images of Josef Stalin's
Siberian prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to be moving, but we're hoping for the
best and hoping we don't end up in Cannon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of seniority, Baca has been on borrowed time since
November, when he was elected to fill out the term of the late
George Brown, who had been in Congress since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   House rules allowed Baca to temporarily move into the
Capitol-view digs held by Brown, who died during his 18th term.
</P>
<P>
   But, come late November - should Baca win re-election - he and
every other House member with eyes on a better office will be
placed in lottery groups based on seniority. Veteran members will
draw numbers and choose first, with Baca's current office among the
prime pickings.
</P>
<P>
   Baca will be well down the list, in a lottery pool of
second-termers.
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected freshman members will get the dregs.
</P>
<P>
   The parking pecking order will also shift in November, with
senior members and staffers seeking indoor spaces closer to their
offices and junior aides to freshmen hoping they can park outdoors
within walking distance of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cautioned that even the best House offices pale in
comparison to corporate suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood depictions of Congress make it look like we live in
luxury,'' she said. ``In reality, these offices are very small,
plain and crowded with staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, competition for prime space is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has worked in Congress for 25 years, recalled her
days working for the late Rep. Gillis Long, D-La., who died in
office in 1985. ``We had people coming around to check out our
office the day after he passed away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury is the watchword for a handful of Capitol offices that
will change hands if the Democrats regain the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the odds-on favorite for speaker
under a new Democratic regime, would supplant GOP Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., in a spacious complex that includes a covered
outdoor porch.
</P>
<P>
   Also at risk is the ornate Capitol office, replete with a
fireplace, that is now occupied by Rep. David Dreier, R-Covina,
chairman of the House Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats are hoping there won't be a
replay of the acrimony that marked the GOP's 1995 takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and other GOP members took
out 40 years of frustration by sacking hundreds of Democratic
staffers and even removing the portraits of legendary Democratic
lawmakers from committee room walls.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 election guarantees a new
round of firings. The attorneys, policy analysts and other aides
who work for House committees are, for the most part, Republican
appointees and have no civil service job protections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, sees a more peaceful
scenario for the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a chastened Democratic Party when we take
over next year,'' Sherman said. ``We have spent four years
wandering in the wilderness and have learned some important
lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning party is going to have a razor-thin majority and
could easily face going back to the minority in coming elections,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days we had some Democrats who acted like they were
going to be in power forever. This time, we're not going to get
anything done unless we work with the other side in a bipartisan,
moderate and fiscally responsible manner.''

BUSBOY TAUGHT US ALL ABOUT LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH HILLS, Calif. _ He was the busboy, but no one over at
Weiler's Deli in North Hills ever really believed that. Not even
owner Gayle Mousis.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Plascencia-Ponce ran the place. For 17 years, he was the
deli's heart and soul, its backbone, she says.
</P>
<P>
   When he was run down and killed a week ago about 4 a.m. outside
a bagel bakery in Van Nuys, a big part of this family deli died
with him, the people who work here say.
</P>
<P>
   Because the busboy was really the boss.
</P>
<P>
   This small, frail 65-year-old immigrant from Jalisco, Mexico,
had taught them all that a smile beats a scowl every time, that
brashness and rudeness were no match for humility and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   His wisdom was incredible for a man who never had a day's formal
education, couldn't read or write, and never learned to speak
English. But it didn't matter to his co-workers or customers.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't need to hear the words. The truth was written all
over the busboy's face. And it was a good, honest face, full of
life's wisdom, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be having a bad day, and Jesus would walk up to your
table with a glass of water or a pot of coffee, smiling because he
was so glad to see you,'' said Clark Fogg, a Weiler's regular for
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, you found yourself smiling and laughing. He had
this tremendous power and ability to make people just feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many customers, Fogg has paused at the small memorial
set up for Jesus at the front deli counter, and stuck a $20 in the
bowl to help pay for his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The busboy never married or had any children of his own. He
didn't have a lot of money. For the past 25 years, he has lived
with the family of his best friend from Mexico, Guadalupe
Santivanez and his wife, Martha, in their small Reseda home.
</P>
<P>
   He was godfather to the couple's grandchildren, Emma and Eva.
They haven't stopped crying for a week, Martha said Friday. The
kids just can't understand how a man they loved so much could be
taken from them so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people can't. In one week, $4,000 has been stuck in
that bowl on the front counter at Weiler's, Mousis says.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful testament to the effect the busboy had on people -
making them smile and just feel better when they saw him walking to
their table with that glass of water or pot of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl on the deli counter was holding their last tip for
Jesus, and they were making it big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers have been coming in all week crying and bringing
flowers,'' Mousis said. ``Jesus touched all their lives, and he did
it with no words, just a smile and kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional $5,000 for burial costs has come from the city's
Victims Relief Fund, and the rest, whatever it takes, will come
from her, Mousis says.
</P>
<P>
   She knows how lucky she was to have this humble, proud man to
lean on for the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could look up at any time of the day, see him out there with
the customers, and know everything was OK,'' she said Friday, as a
few more customers stopped at the memorial to put $10 or $20 in the
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the backbone of this restaurant. He jump-started us
every day. I never had to think about what was happening here at 5
a.m. to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew,'' she said. ``Jesus was bringing the bagels.''
</P>
<P>
   It was bringing those bagels that got him killed a little after
4 a.m. Sept. 1, after walking out of Western Bagels bakery on
Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Marie E. West, 35, of Redondo Beach ran down Jesus with her car,
police say, and then moments later, went inside the bakery to buy
some bagels herself. Her attorney last week asked for a
postponement of her arraignment on murder and hate crime charges so
she could undergo psychological evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Police are treating Jesus' death as a hate crime because Western
Bagel employees say West commented, ``God, I hate Latinos,'' after
she ran down Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   West's husband told police she suffers from a manic-depressive
disorder that causes her to become confrontational at times. He
says it was the illness talking, not hate - that his wife is not a
racist, only sick.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's too late for the busboy. He's dead - a victim
of a woman's hate or illness.
</P>
<P>
   If it was hate, West could not have found a man more undeserving
of her venom and bigotry. There wasn't a hateful bone in the
busboy's body, the people at Weiler's say.
</P>
<P>
   If it was mental illness, what was this woman doing out there on
her own at 4 a.m. behind the steering wheel of a car?
</P>
<P>
   Mousis, her partner Dan Klisch, cashier Julie Shippley, all the
waitresses, cooks and other busboys at Weiler's have been beating
themselves up for a week trying to find the answer to that one.
</P>
<P>
   They have come up with one, the only one that helps them cope
and make some sense of the busboy's death.
</P>
<P>
   It was a loud cry to all of us, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his death was meant to awaken society and the relatives of
people with mental disorders that we have to take more
responsibility and care in making sure something tragic like this
is not allowed to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   That there should be no way a sick person like this can leave
their home, climb behind the steering wheel of a car, and use it as
a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only reason that makes any sense, Mousis says: Jesus
died to be a martyr for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone knows what the employees and customers of this deli
have known for the past 17 years - that there was something very
wise and special about the smiling, older man who brought them
water and coffee every day.
</P>
<P>
   That the busboy was really the boss - the heart and soul of the
place.

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING, OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Yankees stockpiled one new player after another this
season, their cash register kept ringing up higher and higher
numbers. Except this was the register that was paying out cash to
the players.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' payroll, which began the season at an already
record $92.5 million, was spiraling sky high, soaring to heights
unknown to baseball management. The game's first $100 million
payroll was a work in progress. Where it would end up nobody knew.
</P>
<P>
   As higher and higher numbers were published, the Yankees brass
became more and more uncomfortable. They protested that the numbers
did not reflect the actual dollars they were spending. They were
correct, but the annual salary reports produced by management and
the players association have never used actual dollars spent. They
have always attributed a player's entire salary to the team that
has him Aug. 31, even if he was traded to the team that day.
</P>
<P>
   With computers able to determine payrolls in any form desired,
both sides could change their systems, but they retain the way they
have always done things for that very reason _ that's the way they
have always done things. It has been the only way to compare
payrolls and average salaries of the 2000 season, say, with
previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Using the traditional, if outdated, method, the Yankees this
season have a payroll totaling an unheard of $112 million. That
figure is based on the 25 players who were on their major league
roster and the eight players who were on the disabled list Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of actual dollars spent, the Yankees are paying
their players $102.5 million this season. That's about $10 million
less than advertised, but it's not going to placate the critics
among baseball officials and other owners who complain that the
Yankees' salary expenditures are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The actual dollar figure is computed by determining how many
days of the 182-day season players have been with the Yankees and
what portion of their salaries that time represents.
</P>
<P>
   The total includes not just the salaries of Aug. 31 players but
those of everyone who has played for the team this season, from the
$12,357,143 for Bernie Williams and the $12 million for David Cone
to the $4,395.60 outfielder Luke Wilcox was paid for his four days
on the Yankees' roster in July and the $5,553.57 Ed Yarnall earned
in his five days with the team in April and July.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two totals comes primarily from the
salaries of the five major players the Yankees acquired in June and
July. David Justice, Denny Neagle, Jose Vizcaino, Jose Canseco and
Glenallen Hill have 2000 salaries totaling $19.75 million, but the
Yankees will pay them $9,210,164. In addition, they will pay Neagle
$250,000, under a provision in his contract, because he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added two other players in July and August who had
been released by their previous teams, so they are paying Dwight
Gooden and Luis Polonia prorated shares of the $200,000 minimum
salary. The team gets their services for a total of $160,439. They
are paying another newcomer, Luis Sojo, a mere $135,989, meaning
the 10 new players _ 40 percent of the roster _ will cost the
Yankees $9,756,592. Sounds like a bargain, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   And then, take the Minnesota Twins. Their payroll is less than
the combined salaries of the left side of the Yankees' infield,
Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius. Unlike other teams, the Twins did
not add minor leaguers to their September roster. They have 25
players on their roster and one on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 players have combined salaries of $14,887,500. Eighteen
of the 26 players have six-figure salaries that start with a two.
Eleven of those salaries range from the $200,000 minimum to
$207,500.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Calvin Griffith owned the Twins and the owners
first began discussing revenue sharing, George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' big spender, said he would be willing to share his revenue
if Griffith would allow him to aid in the operation of the Twins.
If Carl Pohlad, the present Twins owner, let Steinbrenner help him,
would the Twins have a $100 million payroll?

<P>
   STAYING ON TOP IS THE HARD PART
</P>
<P>
   Flash: Braves Won't Finish First Forever!
</P>
<P>
   That startling revelation emerged from the mouth of Tom Glavine,
the only active player who has been with Atlanta for every one of
its eight consecutive division championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win forever,'' the 34-year-old pitcher
said. ``We're not going to win our division for the rest of
baseball. Sometime we'll lose, but I hope it doesn't happen until
after I'm not playing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine offered that observation a few days after the Braves
reclaimed first place in the National League East from the Mets.
The Braves' second-place status on the last day of August and the
first day of September made them appear to be mortal. It even had
people raising the possibility of the Braves being a wild-card
entry in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it creeps in there,'' Glavine said, when asked if the
Braves ever think wild card and not first place. ``But your
ultimate thinking is you want to win your division, do whatever you
can to win your division. If you fall short, I guess you accept
wild card and try to get to the World Series from that position.''
</P>
<P>
   If there had been any reason for the Braves to let wild-card
thinking creep in, it seems to be gone now. The Mets just can't
seem to deal with the prosperity of first place or being an inch
away from first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets are a good ball club,'' said Glavine, a 19-game
winner, who could also win his third Cy Young Award. ``They've been
a good ball club. They've been a threat. They've done the same
thing as we have. They've gotten better over the years. They've
made changes before and after the trading deadline that improved
their depth.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge the Mets have mounted the last few seasons has
been good for the Braves, Glavine added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have somebody knocking on your door like that,'' he
said, ``it tends to keep you focused and pushing hard for where you
want to be, not to take things for granted. The closer the Mets
get, we find a way to play better and win. It's the competition
thing. It forces you to raise the level of your game so that you
can achieve what you want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Summertime Slides
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners had seemingly claimed first place in the
American League West for themselves. A month ago they increased
their lead to a season-high seven games. They had withstood
Oakland's challenge, and they simply had to gain their share of
victories the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was the Mariners' trouble. From that day to Saturday,
the Mariners won seven games but lost 18, helplessly watching their
lead dwindle to two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pulled a version of the Mariners' slide. From the day
they snatched first place from the Braves until Saturday, they
played seven games and lost six.
</P>
<P>
   After tumbling out of first place the last day of July, then
falling three games behind, the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied and,
with the aid of a seven-game winning streak, pulled within half a
game out Aug. 20. Since then? They won five, lost 11, falling as
far back as eight and a half games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds, one of the most disappointing teams this
season, seemed to be headed in the right direction, finally, when
they closed within four and a half games of first place. But after
standing that close to first Aug. 13, they won 12 and lost 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers, who lost 23 of their first 32 games, inched
past .500, finally, on Sept. 1. When they won the next day, they
were incredibly only four games behind in the wild-card race. Then
they lost four of their next six games and slipped six back.
</P>
<P>
   CHASING MILESTONES
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton of Colorado did not have a good week in his quest to
hit .400. He was down to .386 entering Saturday's game, meaning if
he goes to bat at the same ratio he has until now, he will have to
hit .488 (39 for 80) to finish at .400. A week ago he had to hit
only .449 the rest of the season to get there.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Darin Erstad of Anaheim had to average just under
two hits a game to break George Sisler's record of 257 hits in a
season (1920). He had a bad week, too. Now he has to average 2.25
hits a game to eclipse Sisler.
</P>
<P>
   NOOFFICIALINFORMATION.COM
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, whose Web site on the Internet has been
majorleaguebaseball.com, has gained the shorter version it had
desired from a law firm with the same initials, mlb.com. But that
does not mean its Internet policies will change with the name.
</P>
<P>
   When the site carries news articles about player contracts and
salaries, financial details are first expunged. Chipper Jones signs
a six-year extension with Atlanta for $90 million? Don't look for
those numbers at mlb.com.
</P>
<P>
   The reason given? Baseball does not officially divulge player
salary information, so even if it appears in, say, an Associated
Press article, mlb.com will not be responsible for anyone learning
the details on its Web site.  &QL;

STRIKE ENDS AT MUSEUM OF MODERN ART 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The union representing 250 striking workers at the
Museum of Modern Art voted Saturday to end its 134-day walkout,
just hours after reaching an agreement in which both sides made
significant concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's workers applauded the contract, which awards an 18
percent wage increase over five years and promises to give jobs
back to any union members furloughed when much of the museum is
closed during a five-year, $650 million expansion and renovation.
Some employees will be assigned to a temporary museum to be set up
in the Long Island City section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the museum granted the union's demand, aimed at
increasing the union's strength, to require all new professional
and administrative workers to join the union or pay union dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' said Michael Cinquina, a buyer for the museum's
bookstore and a member of the negotiating team for the union, Local
2110 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents 250
archivists, assistant curators, librarians, bookshop workers and
others at the museum. ``It's all that I hoped for. It made every
day we stayed out worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's chief negotiator, Robert Batterman, said the
agreement was a compromise. ``I think it's a fair settlement,'' he
said. ``There were no winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said the museum achieved its goal of having more
flexibility in overseeing a health plan for both management
employees and union members. He said that despite the union's
opposition, the museum obtained the right to unilaterally impose
changes in health coverage. One caveat is that any changes made to
union members' coverage would also apply to management employees.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached at 3 a.m. Saturday after a 15-hour
negotiating session, ends a bitter dispute in which half the
workers crossed the picket line and the museum was forced to cancel
numerous fund-raisers, concerts and screenings. Museum officials
said the strike did not hurt attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they pressured the museum into showing more
flexibility at the bargaining table by enlisting 150 prominent
artists to back the strikers, and by lining up City Council members
to delay, and perhaps block, a zoning variance that the museum
needed for its project.
</P>
<P>
   They also insisted that they emerged victorious in the
negotiations on health coverage, saying that management changed its
stance and finally acknowledged that the union had the right to
bargain collectively about changes in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said the union, and not management, was on the
defensive and had suddenly shown more flexibility. He said the
union was hurt by the decision of many construction unions to allow
workers to do demolition work for the museum's expansion despite
the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating session, which began at noon on Friday, was the
first face-to-face meeting of the two sides since the strike began
on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Wheeler, the director of the United Auto Workers in New
York, said that some strikers grew dispirited when many workers
crossed the picket line. But he said the strikers were helped
greatly by support from other unions.
</P>
<P>
   Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, said, ``I don't think
the museum anticipated that this group would stay out and be as
steadfast as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the museum was eager to have the strike settled in
September because several new exhibits are opening and it would be
harder to mount those exhibits with many employees not working.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said the museum was so frustrated by the deadlocked
talks that he took an unusual step: He asked a union official to
serve as a mediator, an idea welcomed by the museum workers union.
</P>
<P>
   That official, Bruce Raynor, secretary-treasurer of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, worked closely with
federal mediators on Friday to help settle the dispute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Batterman denied that the museum was affected by a letter in
which 150 prominent artists, including Robert Rauschenberg and
Steven Spielberg, voiced support for the strikers. He also insisted
that the museum was not worried that the City Council would block
the zoning variance it was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the museum's union, working with the New York City
Central Labor Council and the New York state AFL-CIO, had gotten a
majority of the City Council's Manhattan members to hold off on
recommending the variance. Typically, the full City Council does
not grant variances unless the members from the affected borough
recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   In its last proposal before the strike began, the museum offered
a 3 percent raise for each of three years. The union demand a 5
percent raise in the first year, and 4 percent for the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a 3 percent raise in the first year, and
4 percent or $1,100 in the second year, whichever is greater. In
the third, fourth and fifth years, there will be a 3.5 percent wage
increase. Workers' salaries range from $17,000 to over $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement leaves open the option that it will run longer
than five years if the expansion project takes longer than that.

HILLARY CLINTON REVELS IN UNIONS' ATTENTIONS DURING LABOR PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton was the belle of New York
City's somewhat belated Labor Day parade Saturday, just as union
leaders had planned.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of union members marched up Fifth Avenue,
to the accompaniment of salsa bands and bagpipes, many marchers and
union leaders hailed Clinton as a friend of working families.
</P>
<P>
   Along the parade route, though, Clinton received only mild
cheers and a few jeers from onlookers, who stood on the sidewalk
behind police barricades. After she walked the route, she returned
to the staging area, where thousands of workers were still waiting
to join the parade, and they enthusiastically chanted her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Hillary,'' said Manfred Spikereit, who was among a
group of 100 members of the electrical workers union who rode
motorcycles in the parade. ``She's pro-union. I like what she
stands for and I like how she loosened up in recent months.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the enthusiasm union leaders voiced for the
first lady throughout the day showed that they planned to mount a
full-scale campaign and get-out-the-vote effort for her this fall.
Several unions had placards printed, reading Labor for Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   The parade stretched from 44th to 72nd Street, and officials
with the New York City Central Labor Council, which sponsored the
parade, estimated that there were more than 200,000 marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In publicizing the parade, Randi Weingarten, its chairwoman and
the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said one of the
march's main themes, besides promoting Clinton, was that nearly
300,000 New York City municipal workers want a contract soon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers was a sea of teachers wearing bright red
T-shirts, while thousands of members of District Council 37, the
giant union of municipal workers, wore green T-shirts. The back of
all their shirts said, ``We all deserve respect and a fair raise.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Central Labor Council did not invite Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican, to the parade, even though mayors are
traditionally invited and walk at the front. Clinton walked in the
front line, sandwiched between John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, and Brian McLaughlin, president of the central labor
council.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the labor council has scheduled the parade for
the Saturday after Labor Day. Union leaders decided to stop holding
the parade on the traditional Monday holiday because so many union
members did not want their three-day weekends cut short for the
march. In addition, union leaders had voiced frustration that on
Labor Day, Manhattan's streets were largely empty, meaning there
were few onlookers to be impressed by labor's show of strength.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast for 300 labor leaders Saturday morning at
District Council 37's headquarters in downtown Manhattan,
McLaughlin praised the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Rodham Clinton has been an advocate of everything we
believe in for all of her adult and professional life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of the day beaming, seemingly delighted to be
the focus of so much enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after marching the parade route, Clinton went back
to 45th Street, climbed atop a flatbed truck and used a megaphone
to speak to hundreds of members of Local 3 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

WORKFARE VICTORY FOR RECOVERING ADDICT HOLDS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Meet Theresa Banchieri: At 36, she has been on
welfare her entire adult life, and for much of that time she has
also been a drug addict. Sometimes she worked as a stripper and
occasionally she stole to support a heroin habit.
</P>
<P>
   But when New York City's stringent new welfare rules forced her
to work 31 hours a week cleaning buildings for her $234 welfare
check every two weeks, Banchieri says, she saw it as an
opportunity. She hoped she would soon get a real job, and she told
everyone she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bragged about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then another, seemingly conflicting, city policy kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Banchieri was barred from participating in the Work Experience
Program _ as the workfare program is known _ with the city's
Department of Sanitation because, she was told, she was on
methadone, a synthetic opiate widely regarded as the most effective
way to curb the craving for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The news came from an agency official running the orientation
session for workfare participants one morning in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `No, I'm sorry, honey, you can't work for the
Department of Sanitation,''' Banchieri recalled. ``I started
crying. I actually started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that, she relapsed, for the first time in a year. She
sniffed heroin, smoked crack, popped pills and finally landed in
jail on a robbery charge. She was released on probation, including
mandatory drug treatment. ``It messed me up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One city agency was telling her to work for her welfare check.
Another was saying it would not have her. But though confused,
Banchieri was not completely without luck. She found a lawyer, and
with her help filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, charging discrimination on the basis of
disability _ in Banchieri's case, a history of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, victory was hers: The commission's district
director, Spencer H. Lewis Jr., ruled that the city had violated
the Americans With Disabilities Act, which considers people with a
history of drug or alcohol abuse to be a protected class under the
law. The commission rejected the Sanitation Department's argument
that Banchieri's schedule for methadone treatments would preclude
her working a regular shift.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet triumph went beyond this one instance. As a result of
the ruling, the Department of Sanitation reversed its ban on
methadone patients' participating in its workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly called the hard-to-employ, hardened addicts like
Banchieri are an increasingly important focus of welfare reform in
places like New York City. Under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's welfare
regulations, all welfare recipients _ unless they can prove that
their disability is so severe that they cannot work _ must work for
their benefits. And many of the more easily employable or
resourceful have either found work or simply been removed from the
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the city agencies that take on workfare clients will have
to contend with many more recovering addicts like Banchieri. That
is why her victory could have wider implications, argued Kate
O'Neill, a senior vice president and lawyer at the Legal Action
Center, a nonprofit group with a long history of representing
methadone patients in employment discrimination cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of that population needs are entry-level jobs and
entry-level jobs at state and local agencies,'' O'Neill said. ``To
the extent that there continue to be either blanket policies or
policies applied in a way to exclude persons on methadone, the
government is really shooting itself in the foot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Today, some 1,500 of the city's 29,400 workfare clients are on
methadone maintenance treatment alone, and many more are in
treatment for other kinds of addiction, according to a spokeswoman
for the city's Human Resources Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the mayor's widely publicized opposition to
methadone maintenance _ he proposed abolishing it altogether two
years ago, only to be persuaded otherwise by public health
officials _ there is no citywide ban against methadone patients'
participating in workfare. Each agency has its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for government employees who are methadone
patients to file _ and win _ employment discrimination cases. But
Banchieri's case may be the first such ruling with respect to
welfare recipients. Neither her lawyer, Corinne Carey of the Urban
Justice Center, a nonprofit group that advocates for the poor, nor
those with the Legal Action Center have heard of similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second federal ruling to find that welfare recipients
enrolled in city-mandated work programs are, in effect, workers,
and as such are protected by anti-discrimination laws. Last
October, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that the
Giuliani administration violated federal law when it turned away
women who complained of being sexually harassed while working for
their welfare benefits.

DEVELOPERS FACE TOUGHER BUILDING RESTRICTIONS ON NEW YORK CITY
WETLANDS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Thursday tougher
restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of
an acre, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess
counties, said Joseph Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for
any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a
region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a
Hudson River environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are critical little pieces,'' he said. ``There are lots
of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control.
They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's
near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking
water system.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have
been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around
the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal
regulations, adopted last spring _ and tougher than previous ones _
will continue to apply.

 &HT;    Triathlon, synchro diving among the new arrivals
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since the Olympics began 104 years ago with 43 events,
the Games continue to change with the times.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney will offer 300 events, including two new sports _
taekwondo and triathlon _ and various additions and wrinkles to
existing sports.
</P>
<P>
   Some new events waltzed into the Olympics, while others had to
muscle their way onto the schedule through intensive lobbying.
Contrary to some reports, ballroom dancing is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And once a sport is on the schedule, it doesn't mean it's good
to go forever. Whitewater slalom canoe/kayak had to fight tooth and
paddle to keep its place on the program.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the evolving Olympics is that more women will
participate in Sydney than in any other Games. Of the 10,000-plus
competitors, 38 percent will be female, an increase from 34 percent
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The following changes will take place in Sydney:
</P>
<P>
   _ Triathlon, which has gained in popularity since it was
invented a mere 26 years ago, will provide the first medals of the
2000 Games. The women's triathlon will be held Saturday, with the
men competing a day later. The triathlon consists of a
1.5-kilometer swim in the harbor, a 40K cycle and a 10K run.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taekwondo had been a demonstration sport in 1988 and 1992,
before all demonstration sports were eliminated. Its only hope for
further Olympic recognition was to become a medal sport, and it
finally succeeded. Four men's weight classes (under 58 kg., 68 kg.,
80 kg. and over 80 kg.) and four women's weight categories (under
49kg., 57kg., 67kg., over 67kg.) will be contested.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trampoline has been added under the gymnastics umbrella, with
both men's and women's events.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's weightlifting has been added, with seven weight
categories, while the men's classes have been reduced from 10 to
eight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's water polo will make its first Olympic appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's modern pentathlon will be contested for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cycling has changed some of its events on the track, with the
Olympic sprint, Madison and Keirin making their debuts in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   _ Synchronized diving, a television-friendly crowd-pleaser, has
been added in men's and women's 3-meter and platform events.
</P>
<P>
   _ In sailing, the 49er class (mixed) has replaced the Star
class.
</P>
<P>
   _ In track and field, the women's pole vault and hammer throw
have been added, and the women's 20K walk replaces the 10K walk.
</P>
<P>
   _ In shooting, women's trap and skeet have been added.
</P>
<P>
   _ In synchronized swimming, duet has been returned to the
schedule after it was dropped in 1996. The team event remains.
</P>
<P>
   Some sports had to take a hit to accommodate all of the new
events but still limit the number of competitors staying in the
Olympic Village to about 10,000. Boxing reduced the number of
competitors, forcing some winners at the U.S. trials to clinch
their spots in subsequent regional qualifying. Wrestling cut its
number of weight categories, from 10 to eight in both freestyle and
Greco-Roman.

LOCAL SCANDALS GOVERN HONG KONG VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Law Hing shifted restlessly from one foot to the
other as he listened to the candidates trade accusations in a
debate at a housing project here last week. ``These guys are
without integrity,'' he said, shaking his head at the litany of
supposed wrongdoing and chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   Well over a million people are expected to turn out for
legislative elections on Sunday, the second such vote since Hong
Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many, like Law, 73,
regard voting as a civic duty and a hard-won privilege. But even
though this is the largest exercise in multiparty politics under
Chinese rule, Beijing has barely a walk-on role.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seizing the election as an opportunity to stand up
to China, most people here regard it as a chance to register their
dissatisfaction with the local establishment. Hong Kong politics,
which in previous years throbbed with debates about freedom and
law, now revolve around seamier issues, like a party boss who
failed to disclose his business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beijing factor is no longer important,'' said Lau Siu-kai,
a professor at the Chinese University here. ``China is perceived as
having withdrawn from local politics. But there is still a lot of
voter discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   People here blame the government for failing to lift Hong Kong
out of the Asian economic crisis more quickly. They say it has
moved from scandal to scandal under the hapless leadership of Tung
Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate installed by Beijing as Hong Kong's
chief executive. The Legislature is seen as an ineffectual body
that carps about Tung but offers no solutions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tung's ties to Beijing, dissatisfaction with him has not
translated into unhappiness with China. In a new survey by Hong
Kong Baptist University, 63 percent of those polled approved of the
performance of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, while only 32
percent approved of Tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decline in optimism,'' said Michael DeGolyer, who
conducted the survey. ``But it seems to have more to do with how
Hong Kong's leaders are performing than with any supposed
interference from Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebbing of China as a hot issue has scrambled Hong Kong's
political landscape. In 1998, when fears about Beijing were still
running high, the Democratic Party scored a resounding victory,
winning nearly half the directly elected seats in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But in district elections last year, the Democrats lost ground
to the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong. Its emphasis on the economy was more
appealing to voters in recession-ravaged Hong Kong than appeals to
democracy or civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, analysts predict that the Democratic Party
will hold onto its position _ but only because the pro-Beijing
party has been tarred by a scandal involving one of its founders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The party may also be hurt because of its coziness with Tung's
government. Last week Tung was on the defensive again after an
investigation concluded that one of his advisers had met with
officials at Hong Kong University to suppress opinion surveys
critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this aggressively local election is a sign of
Hong Kong's political maturity. Left alone by Beijing, the former
British colony is behaving like any big city during campaign season
_ consumed by local disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But other commentators say the nasty tone reflects Hong Kong's
stunted political culture, where only 24 of the 60 members of the
Legislature are directly elected.

REAL ESTATE: CHICAGO TRIES TO UPGRADE A NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A new housing development rising on the city's North
Side is the first step in what city officials hope will be the
transformation of one of Chicago's most notorious public housing
projects into one that mixes the economic classes and makes the
area more like Old Town or Lincoln Park, two gentrified
neighborhoods that it borders.
</P>
<P>
   The public housing project is Cabrini-Green, which sits on a
70-acre parcel of land a stone's throw from tony areas like
Michigan Avenue and the Gold Coast, but which for years has served
as a symbol of urban blight and the failure of public housing
policy.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the new project, called North Town Village,
will be a model for other cities looking to redevelop blighted
public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're at a critical point where we can move ahead with
what is truly a great vision for redeveloping outdated public
housing,'' said Christopher R. Hill, Chicago's commissioner of
planning and development. ``If it works here, it will work in other
places. But this is the first.''
</P>
<P>
   The new project, which occupies seven acres that abut the
northwest corner of Cabrini-Green, is to consist of 261 residences
in a variety of low-rise buildings, mainly two- and three-story
town houses and condominiums, with a few larger buildings. Some of
the units will be for sale, and some for rent.
</P>
<P>
   The building materials are mainly brick and stone and the
architectural details in the Victorian or neoclassical style. The
architect is Todd Main, a principal with Bauhs, Dring &AMP; Main Ltd.
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Renderings show a design similar to a number of other housing
developments, public and private, that have been built downtown in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is the location and the prospective tenant
base. Although there are other new developments in Chicago
neighboring large tracts of public housing, North Town Village is
the largest, and the first to include three distinct components:
market-rate units, ``affordable'' homes with income ceilings for
tenants and public housing.
</P>
<P>
   The land, which is steps away from several of Cabrini-Green's
high-rise towers, was sold by the city to the developers, Holsten
Real Estate Development Corp. and Kenard Corp., at a reduced price
of about $5.5 million in exchange for their commitment to go along
with the city's plans for the area. That price is about half of the
market price of similar property.
</P>
<P>
   The development is designed to have 50 percent market-rate
units, 30 percent public housing units and 20 percent low-income
units. (The 40 low-income rental units are intended for families
that make no more than $40,000, or 60 percent of the city's median
income. The 12 low-income units for sale are intended for families
that make $81,000, or 120 percent of the median income.)
</P>
<P>
   In a change that reflects the city's new approach to public
housing, the Chicago Housing Authority will lease the public units
from the developers but not manage them. Instead, the project will
be managed by a private company. ``We're getting out of the
business of running and managing programs,'' said Terry Peterson,
the authority's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the 93 market-rate units that are for sale start at
$146,900 for a one-bedroom condominium and climb to almost $500,000
for a three-story town house. ``We have mixed all three income
groups completely throughout the development,'' said Peter Holsten,
president of Holsten Real Estate. ``Every building has all three
income groups in it. You'll have an expensive town house with a
public housing family next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Lichterman, president of Kenard, added: ``There's no
difference at all between the market rate and the affordable and
public units. If the market rate gets a fireplace, the public unit
gets a fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to cost about $65 million; about half of
the financing is being provided by grants and subsidies. ``It's a
very expensive project,'' Holsten said. ``We're really trying to
build a brand-new community here, and it's more than just bricks
and mortar. We're putting a lot of energy into the people part.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``people part'' includes an extensive screening program for
public housing families that includes drug testing, and a program
designed to ease their entry into the private housing market, with
neighbors from different economic classes. ``For many of them, this
will be their first private housing experience,'' Holsten said.
``The program will teach them how to take care of their unit and
what it's like to live in a private housing community.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on North Town Village began last spring, and the
project is expected to be completed in mid-2002. Some units will be
ready for occupancy by next spring.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from buyers of the market-rate units has been positive.
The sales office opened in mid-June and all but six of the 93
market-rate units have been snapped up. One of the early sales was
to Kevin and Jennifer Hardman, who currently live west of the
downtown Loop business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location is wonderful,'' said Kevin Hardman, a marketing
manager at a suburban manufacturing company. ``It's an area with a
lot of potential. We didn't jump into this for altruistic reasons.
It was a financial decision. We wanted the best home we could find
for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``We're excited to be a part of the
experiment. I'm a big believer in mixed-income communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The split among market-rate, public and low-income units is one
the city sees as key to its larger goal of redeveloping the area.
Cabrini-Green, built over 20 years beginning in 1942, has been a
major trouble spot on the North Side for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the complex is a series of 14 brick high-rises _
many of the ``open gallery'' variety, meaning that there are no
internal hallways _ along with several blocks of row houses and
smaller buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak occupancy, the complex housed as many as 15,000
low-income tenants and was a hub of gang and drug-trafficking
activity in the city. Things got so bad in the late '70s that Jane
Byrne, then the mayor, lived in the complex for about a month in
1981 in an effort to restore order. Eight years ago, Cabrini-Green
made national headlines when a 7-year-old boy who lived there was
shot and killed by a sniper on his way to school.
</P>
<P>
   Development in the area around the Cabrini-Green houses
stagnated in the '80s, but in the '90s, as the downtown housing
boom gathered force, developers began taking another look at the
blocks surrounding the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some of the best land in the entire city,'' said Harry
Huzenis, a principal with Jameson Realty Group, a residential
brokerage firm in the neighborhood. ``It's more affordable than Old
Town or Lincoln Park but it has a lot of the same advantages in
terms of location,'' he said _ about 10 blocks from the Loop.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point for many developers and prospective
homeowners, however, remains Cabrini-Green. In the mid-'90s, the
city unveiled a plan to redevelop the area that included
demolishing many of the largest high-rises and turning over some of
the land to private developers. It also moved ahead with an
aggressive public works program for the neighborhood that included
building a park at the intersection of Division and Orleans
Streets; two schools, including an elite, $35 million magnet
school; a library; and a police station.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-rises had already been torn down and several others had
been boarded up when work came to a halt in the wake of a lawsuit
filed by the Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council, a tenants'
group. The suit challenged the city's right to tear down the
buildings without first guaranteeing residents equivalent or better
housing in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was resolved with the signing of a consent decree
last month in which the city promised to build 700 units of public
housing, including those in North Town Village, in an area bounded
by North Avenue, Wells Street, Chicago Avenue and the Chicago River
in exchange for the right to demolish three more high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good settlement,'' said Cora Moore, 62, president of
the Local Advisory Council and a 40-year Cabrini-Green resident.
``We want to live right here on the same land we've been living on
all the time. We want a decent, sanitary place to live. Our goal
has been accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the units will be contained in
low-rise buildings similar to those of North Town Village. ``For
the last 30 to 40 years,'' said Peterson of the Chicago Housing
Authority, ``we've isolated public housing residents socially and
economically. But the residents are ready for a change. We want to
integrate them back into the fabric of the community.''

PALESTINIANS EXPECTED TO DELAY STATEHOOD DECLARATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The expected birth of a new Palestine is likely to
be delayed Sunday, with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat pushing a
new, compressed time frame for progress on Mideast peace before
declaring statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Central Council began meeting in Gaza Saturday
to consider Arafat's move to postpone Wednesday's self-imposed
deadline to announce statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the delay was expected Sunday, and the
government-controlled Palestinian media predicted the statehood
declaration would be put off until at least Nov. 15, providing a
narrow opening for the peace talks to get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The debate occurred on a day in which all sides tried to send
signals that the peace process _ stalled despite President
Clinton's separate meetings last week with Ararat and Israel's
prime minister, Ehud Barak _ was still proceeding. Clinton and
Barak met again in New York Saturday, following the United Nations
millennial conference.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told the Palestine council Saturday that low-level
negotiations with the Israelis would shift into high gear Sunday or
Monday and would last for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat also said statehood would be declared unilaterally if
those talks are not fruitful, an official at the closed-door
meeting said. Israel has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip if statehood is declared outside the peace
framework.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's moves left analysts wondering whether he is exercising
brinkmanship or losing a historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader arrived in Gaza Saturday morning from the
UN conference without a breakthrough _ and with a deadlock over the
sovereignty of Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians see
as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``For your information, we already have our state and we will
continue to do so,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza after a
welcoming ceremony with all the military trappings of a state.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the hearings of the 128-member Palestinian council,
commentators and officials portrayed the delay in the official
declaration as a near certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Votes are not yet in,'' Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil
Shaath told CNN. ``But the general tendency is to delay, to give
the peace process another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat did declare statehood Wednesday, a date that both
Arafat and Barak set last year for an overall peace agreement, he
would have to do so unilaterally, a move that many feared would
cause a regional conflagration to erupt. For this reason the
international community, at the UN conference and in other meetings
over the summer, has put intense pressure on Arafat not to
unilaterally declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   They have urged the 70-year-old Palestinian leader to continue
to try to find a framework for reaching a final peace agreement
that would include the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Israeli
settlements, the final drawing of borders, and a solution to the
Palestinian refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time Arafat has delayed a declaration
of statehood. Last year, he announced that May 4, 1999 was a
``sacred date'' that marked the end of the five-year ``interim
phase'' of the peace process and the point at which he would
declare a state. He pulled back from the brink then, as he is
expected to now.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a sense in many corners that time is running out
and that the events of this week will be critical in determining
the fate of the six-year-old peace process.
</P>
<P>
   If the deadline is postponed to Nov. 15 or plans are set for
perhaps a vague declaration of sometime before the end of the year,
the parties will have only a matter of weeks to reach a point where
they feel they have a peace deal that would be accepted by their
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made a tremendous personal and political
investment in the peace process throughout his two terms, has
little time left left in his presidency to shore up a deal and
present what will be a massive aid package to the US Congress
before it ends its session in October.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also feels the political clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israeli parliament reconvenes next month, Barak faces a
dramatic challenge to his power, and possibly the toppling of his
government, by the religious and conservative parties who feel he
has already compromised too much in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The player least squeezed by time and political pressure is
Arafat _ and in this sense the moment weighs heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is a ``master of tactics,'' said Mahdi Abdul Hadi,
director of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of
International Affairs in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week at the United Nations he showed he was on equal
footing with all of the world's leaders. And for the first time
ever, he has begun discussing the idea that there would be someone
after him who would carry on the fight,'' Hadi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that he can wait longer if he needs to to declare a
state,'' Hadi said. ``He wants the symbolism of statehood, but he
is going to play it out a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadi and other Palestinian observers point out that a unilateral
declaration of statehood would also have resulted in a potentially
disastrous scenario. Israel controls the electricity, the water,
the borders, and most of the jobs in the Palestinian sector and
could cripple an already struggling Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also vowed that Israel would reassert its military
control over areas of shared sovereignty in the West Bank if Arafat
unilaterally declared a state _ a prospect that both sides agree
would likely result in war.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Heller, chief researcher at Tel Aviv University's Jaffe
Center for Strategic Studies, said he is troubled by what appears
to be ``no long-term, coherent strategy'' on the part of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is simply improvising one day to the next and
postponing the hard decisions,'' Heller said. ``He is making a
calculation that over time the Israeli position will erode, but I
think that is a miscalculation that will end in a missed
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller also dismisses Barak and Clinton's assertions that the
time is ``now or never.'' He believes there is an inevitable
momentum toward the declaration of a Palestinian state and
ultimately toward a peace agreement that will end the 52 years of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has not failed, and it won't fail for a simple
reason: No one can give up,'' Heller said. ``No one can throw up
their hands and walk away. Our fates are too closely intertwined
for that to happen.''

MAFIOSI HAVEN BECOMES FASHIONISTA'S HEAVEN  
 STILL SEEKING PAYMENT FROM BERNARD GOETZ 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As SoHo seeps eastward and NoHo southward in Lower
Manhattan, Amy Chan, a women's accessories boutique at 247 Mulberry
Street, is typical of the chic shops and cafes that have been
moving into northern Little Italy, now promoted by real estate
marketers as NoLIta.
</P>
<P>
   But while most who enter the trendy turf of Amy Chan _ with its
python-patterned pocketbooks and fashionable belts _ simply see one
more attractive shop, some have their sights on the site's past,
said Candace Mohr, the store's manager. They ``ask me silly
questions, like `Did you find any bodies here?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Chan occupies the space previously known as the Ravenite
Social Club, a lair from which John Gotti, the Mafia leader,
masterminded murders, plotted rackets and was toadied to as the
Gambino crime family boss.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious mobster, dubbed the Dapper Don, reigned there from
the mid-1980s until his 1990 arrest. Convicted of murder and
racketeering, he is serving life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   But the storefront space has been paroled from its previous
role. The government confiscated the building, and two years ago
sold it to a group that sought a different kind of street-level
occupant.
</P>
<P>
   And so, gone is the bunkerlike brick facade that hid the Gambino
doings, replaced by glass that invites peering in. Gone are the bar
and card tables, in favor of handbags designed by Chan and
Chinese-themed lanterns and a reproduction of an Andy Warhol
portrait of Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr, who sports tattoos of snakes in a place where the past
talk was often of rats, told of ``the weird ones who come in and
take pictures of the floor,'' a cracked and patched expanse of tile
preserved from the Ravenite days.
</P>
<P>
   And she and Ashley McGovern, a sales clerk, recalled another
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us what went on here,'' McGovern said. ``He said the
bar was here, the card tables were there.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them his name was Joe the Hat.
</P>

   Still Seeking Payment From Bernard Goetz
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Cabey, who was awarded $43 million by a jury for his
injuries from being shot by Bernard H. Goetz in a Manhattan subway
train in 1984, has not received that money from Goetz. Cabey and
three others were shot by Goetz, an electrical engineer, while
riding the subway. Goetz, who used an unlicensed handgun, told the
police that he feared the young men were going to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   Cabey, the most seriously wounded, was paralyzed and suffered
brain damage. Goetz was acquitted of assault and attempted murder
in 1987 but was convicted on a weapons possession charge. In 1996 a
civil jury found the shooting unjustified and awarded Cabey $43
million. Goetz later filed for bankruptcy, but a judge said he
still had to pay his victim.
</P>
<P>
   Cabey's lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said that he has retained a law
firm that specializes in debt collection to pursue Goetz who, he
said, ``appears to be living in voluntary squalor, still on the
West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, Goetz declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cabey's mother, Shirley, had known all along that there was
little chance of getting money from Goetz, Kuby said. ``It was very
important to her, all those years, that people know that her son
never did anything wrong to Bernard Goetz, that Bernard Goetz was
the criminal,'' he explained. ``That's what the verdict
established, and it gave her a tremendous sense of well being.''

 BOB CUMMINS, 68, PRODUCER IN NEW YORK'S JAZZ SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Cummins, who ran the small jazz record label
India Navigation, which documented much of the avant-garde
loft-jazz scene that blossomed in Manhattan during the '70s and
'80s in underused buildings downtown, died on Aug. 17 at his home
in Manhattan. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   During his years as a record producer, Cummins never gave up his
profession as a corporate lawyer. He worked for Western Union, and
then set up his own corporate law firm. He also helped jazz
musicians who had legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a concert recording made in 1972 by the
Revolutionary Ensemble _ a trio consisting of the violinist Leroy
Jenkins, the bassist Sirone and the drummer and pianist Jerome
Cooper _ Cummins was devoted to recording the free, open-ended
music of young New York musicians. It was a time when major record
labels and jazz clubs were focusing on electric fusion or other
commercial possibilities in jazz; fans like Cummins gave their time
to create an influential underground scene virtually from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins supervised all the company's recordings, about 50 albums
at the time of his death. He preferred live recordings for their
spontaneity and set up recording equipment in long-gone, legendary
jazz spots, like the Ladies' Fort in the East Village and Ornette
Coleman's loft in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins built a number of his own studios through the years,
including one in the Western Union Building in TriBeCa and one in
an old water-bottling factory in the town of Grand View, which he
and his family also used as a home.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicians who made albums for India Navigation were
David Murray, whose first album, ``Flowers for Albert,'' was
recorded by Cummins at the Ladies' Fort; Hamiet Bluiett; Cecil
McBee; Chico Freeman; and Arthur Blythe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Cummins is survived by a daughter, Beth
Cummins of Princeton, N.J.; a son, Thomas, of Manhattan; and a
granddaughter.

WILLIAM LUBBERS, 75, LAWYER FOR U.S. LABOR RELATIONS BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Lubbers, the National Labor Relations Board's
general counsel from 1979 to 1984, died on Aug. 26. He was 75 and
lived in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm he suffered at his
home, his son Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lubbers was a lawyer with the labor board from 1952 until he
retired in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   As general counsel, he was involved in the resolution of one of
the longest union disputes in American history. The dispute began
after the Darlington Manufacturing Co. closed its mill in
Darlington, S.C., in 1956, after the workers voted to be
represented by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was owned by Deering-Milliken Inc. of New York. The
union contended that the closing was illegal and that it was at
least partly intended to discourage unionization of other textile
plants.
</P>
<P>
   After much litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld charges of
unfair labor practice. The union had sought $20 million in back pay
for the former Darlington workers. Lubbers proposed $5 million, and
he announced in 1980 that each side had agreed that the sum, to be
paid by Milliken &AMP; Co., formerly Deering-Milliken, would go to the
500 surviving former employees or the heirs of those who had died.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cedar Grove, Wis., Lubbers was an infantryman in
World War II. He received both his bachelor's and law degrees from
the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Jeffrey, of Takoma Park, Md., Lubbers is
survived by his wife, Val; another son, Kevin, of Bethesda; two
daughters, K. Darcy Lubbers of Santa Monica, Calif., and Sherry
Lubbers of Manhattan; four brothers; and three sisters.

METS STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF A LOSING STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The door to the Mets clubhouse stood locked as the
minutes ticked by after Friday night's loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies. But when the door finally opened, the Mets admitted that,
despite their struggles, it was not a tirade by Manager Bobby
Valentine that kept the door closed, but a simple and upbeat
message, advising his players to stop thinking and start playing.
</P>
<P>
   The September slump is familiar to Valentine, who has seen it in
each of the last two seasons. And the way out is not panic or
pressing, but simply playing. The message, delivered with far less
vitriol than Mike Hampton's exit from the mound in Friday's 2-0
loss, was easy to hear for the team, but still hard to live by.
Even moments after Valentine expressed his plea, players were still
wondering how they would escape the offensive doldrums that have
grounded a team that had slipped into first place just over a week
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some frustrated guys in here, I mean nobody more
than myself,'' Mike Piazza said. ``It's a frustrating game when you
get away from things that have been working for you. For a lack of
better term, you just start pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have gone into the abyss together. Batting .220 without
a home run or a run batted in in the team's seven games in
September, Edgardo Alfonzo is the hottest of the regulars. Piazza
is batting .200 over the span with one home run and one RBI. Robin
Ventura, mired in a season-long struggle, is 2 for 25 (.080).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby told us to just think that we are a pretty good team,''
Alfonzo said. ``We didn't win with one guy. We've got nine guys
playing, 25 guys in the room, and everybody is trying to be the
hero. Things are not working that way. We're trying to do too
much.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets self-destructed on Friday night, unable to get a timely
hit and stranding 11 runners in being shut out by 5 pitchers,
snapping the Phillies out of their eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Hampton as a stopper did little when he had one
hit in three times at bat, making him as dangerous a hitter as any
in the lineup. With each loss, the Mets hear more talk of the
September struggles of the past two years. The four-and-a-half game
lead on Arizona in the wild-card race suddenly does not seem so
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of learning experience you want to go
through,'' Piazza said of the team's experience the past two
seasons. ``I just think we're learning too much. That's the bottom
line. We're not feeling sorry for ourselves. We're not making
excuses. We just have to go back to playing good baseball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton showed his frustration on Friday with his outburst,
hurling his glove into the dugout as he stalked off the field,
slamming around the dugout as he dislodged a pair of water coolers
with a blow from his right forearm. But his frustration was only
the most visible among the players. If Valentine is maintaining a
cool demeanor, he might be the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike showed frustration when he left the field, as did I when
I popped up, as did other people,'' Todd Zeile said. ``Slamming
bats or helmets or whatever, that doesn't necessarily help anything
except alleviate some of the frustration. This team is not taking
this lying down by any means. This is a frustrating endeavor.'' &QL;

FOR INFORMATION, SAILORS NOW HAVE THE OPTION OF DOCKING ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
 By HERB McCORMICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last Around Alone _ the solo round-the-world boat race _
the winning skipper, Italy's Giovanni Soldini, showed his prowess
not only at the helm but also on his laptop computer. Soldini spent
hours poring over his favorite Internet weather Web sites, and his
ability to predict favorable systems and trends proved to be a
significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not only altering the way offshore racers like
Soldini play the game; it is also changing the way recreational
boaters pursue their pastime. With dozens of boating Web sites, it
is now possible to enjoy a satisfying maritime experience without
going anywhere near the water.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the sport's most ambitious entities _ Quokka.com,
SailNet.com and Boats.com _ have spent millions of dollars building
and staffing their respective sites. All three are seeking to
attract a wide-ranging audience, and business-sustaining revenue,
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka Sports, based in San Francisco, burst onto the sailing
scene in 1997 with innovative Internet coverage of the Whitbread
Round-the-World Race, which attracted nearly two million individual
visitors. Quokka has since gone on to cover other sports, as well
as yachting events like the America's Cup and the BT Global
Challenge (btchallenge.com), a race made up of amateur sailors who
pay to compete. Leg 1 of the BT race, bound for Boston, begins on
Sunday from Southampton, England.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka has demonstrated that, given the right content, Internet
users will log on to boating-related Web sites in significant
numbers. Essentially, the business plan behind SailNet.com and
Boats.com is to attract viewers with technical advice and
information, boat and product reviews, and features, and then to
entice them to buy equipment or services like boat financing or
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies differ somewhat in how they strive to fulfill
those orders. For customers of SailNet, which is based in Mount
Pleasant, S.C., the site is a full-service chandlery of marine
goods that includes its own in-house sail loft and rigging shop.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce is also central to the plans of Boats.com, which has
a 70-employee staff and is also centered in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marine industry is ready to benefit from an online
marketplace,'' said Rolando Esteverena, the company's chief
executive officer and Silicon Valley veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike SailNet, however, Boats.com _ which has a home page that
includes separate links for sailing, powerboating and fishing _
does not own a separate retail division. Instead, Boats.com views
itself as an online hub where yacht brokers, boat dealers, marinas,
sailmakers and other marine service businesses can participate in
an open marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Boats.com has received exclusive, and somewhat
controversial, endorsements from the National Marine Manufacturers
Association and the Marine Retailers Association of America.
Critics of the arrangement say that trade associations should
remain neutral, an allegation that Esteverena has dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing it with SailNet, Feuerstein wrote: ``Boats.com will
work on a referral model, earning small finder's fees for helping
consumers locate boats for sale and referral fees from third-party
marine product retailers. While Boats.com's margins are lower, it
will not incur the expense of owning and operating its own retail
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors like Giovanni Soldini do not trouble themselves with
these Web vagaries; the Internet thus far has simply been a place
to find worthwhile information. Companies like SailNet and
Boats.com are betting the house that, next time he needs a pair of
sailing shoes or anything else nautical, he will also come clicking
their way.

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a
peasant environmentalist and an Army colonel _ human rights group
believe are unjustly imprisoned now. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications

the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good.

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an
investment that reaps priceless returns. A growing number of that

largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   LAW-SCHOOL _ WASHINGTON _ Wayne Reaud, a wealthy Texas trial

couldn't stand the idea of the law school being named after one of
his ``enemies,'' a Democratic trial lawyer. But Chancellor John
Montford of Texas Tech, a former Democratic state senator, says it
was all a misunderstanding for which he was to blame, that his
intention all along was to name the law school building after
Reaud, not the school itself. The chairman of the university
regents, Jim Sowell of Dallas, said the university's policy is
clear: schools won't be named after someone for less than $25
million. (Hight, Cox News Service)

   DAYTON END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues. The series
is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill Moyers called
``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from Sunday, Sept.
10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can stand alone. The
stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run date that
corresponds to the day the story is moving. Elements from the
series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING page for Tuesday,
Sept, 19. That page will be available on Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _ Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millennium has
given millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer
world grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions
about ways to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James
Hansen, one of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global
warming 20 years ago, suggests that industrialized nations
struggling to implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
called for under the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing
the wrong villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner,

Vietnam.'' The crowd was stumped. Now, with Al Gore's campaign

CLINTON LIKELY TO SEEK MORE MILITARY AID FOR ISRAEL AFTER MEETING
WITH BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak held brief impromptu talks Saturday at Barak's hotel in New
York, rounding out a week of discussions on the Middle East peace
negotiations and the security relationship between the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials have made clear in the
last several days they face an uphill struggle to try and revive
the momentum of the Camp David summit six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects fading for a peace agreement between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, Clinton appears keen to bolster the position
of Barak in Israel, where he's likely to face a contentious
Parliament when it reconvenes in late October and falling support
in public-opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said Clinton, who was
leaving New York late Saturday, wanted to say goodbye before Barak
left on his return to Israel. Clinton spent about an hour with the
prime minister and his wife, Nava. In deference to the Jewish
Sabbath, Clinton went to Barak's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, left New York on Friday
to return to Gaza to attend the Palestinian Central Council, which
is meeting this weekend to consider delaying their declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has suggested that the council would delay the date, now
set for Sept. 13. A new date for the declaration may be set for
November.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference while he was in New York for last week's
United Nations summit, Barak said the delay would be a ``positive''
signal for the Middle East talks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Arafat, Nabil Abu Rdaniah, was quoted Saturday
by Reuters as saying Palestinian and Israeli negotiators would
resume mid-level talks this week. But senior Clinton administration
officials, while gratified that the process has not broken down
entirely, did not appear to have much confidence in the renewal of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major elements of the Israeli-American talks this
week in New York focused on an upgraded security relationship with
the United States. For Barak, that is a vital element in his
struggle to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   If new elections are held in Israel and there is no peace
agreement for Barak to run on, he must show that after making
tentative concessions to the Palestinians, he also won something
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister is under intense criticism from Israel's
rightist political parties, which say he made too many concessions
to the Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton has said he would like to reward the prime
minister for his courage and creativity at Camp David, and his
willingness to continue the peace effort now.
</P>
<P>
   If the security relationship is enhanced, it will probably be in
the form of increased financial military assistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This would have run into the billions of dollars if there had
been a peace settlement with the Palestinians, but is now likely to
be much less, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has proposed $250 million more this year, for
which it would seek approval from Congress before it recesses early
in October, officials said. The Israelis are saying they need
nearly $1 billion, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change in the formal security relationship would
probably also involve a shift in stated policy to characterize
Israel as a ``strategic, major non-NATO ally'' rather than just a
``major non-NATO ally,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would pledge to ensure that Israel keep its
qualitative edge in weapons over the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is anxious to nail down elements of the security package
because some Israeli military experts, including members of his
government, have criticized the proposal as being detrimental
rather than advantageous.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has arisen because the package stipulates that
Israel must inform the United States of its arms sales to India,
Pakistan, China and Russia, a safeguard that the administration has
insisted on as a way of controlling the spread of arms.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Camp David meeting, Barak canceled a planned
sale of a sophisticated radar system, known as Phalcon, to China, a
move intended to shore up Israel's support in Congress after
American criticism of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said this
past week that a formal notification requirement for weapon sales
to other countries was unfair and gave the United States a veto
over Israel's national interests.

BROSIUS AND PETTITTE POKE HOLE IN THE AURA OF MARTINEZ
</HEADLINE>
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Scott Brosius was one of the first Yankees to come out
for pregame stretching &UR;  &LR; on Saturday. The sun was out, Brosius' good
friend Andy Pettitte was getting ready to pitch against the Boston
superstar Pedro Martinez, and Brosius had an edgy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the Red Sox think that they're going to win because Pedro
is pitching,'' Brosius said, without any prompting. ``OK. We'll
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing his quiet determination, Brosius came to bat in the
seventh inning, after Martinez had shut out the Yankees for six and
two-thirds innings, and blasted a three-run homer into the screen
above the left field wall _ accounting for their first runs in a
5-3 victory. Pettitte pitched 8 innings, allowing six hits, picked
up his 18th victory and became the first pitcher to defeat Martinez
twice in the same season since the Mets' Bobby Jones in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He had to wait out a fidgety ninth, however, as Mariano Rivera,
pitching for the third straight day, gave up two two-out runs
before retiring the side. This made Jose Conseco's two-run homer in
the top of the ninth the winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the American League East would seem to be a matter of
time now for the Yankees, with their lead over Boston at eight
games and their magic number for clinching down to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (16-5) has more victories than any major league pitcher
since the start of the 1996 season, with 88 _ just one more than
Pettitte, who ranks second in that category. But Brosius'
conviction was probably based on the Yankees' success against
Martinez as much as Pettitte's recent outings. The Yankees have won
the last three games started by the Boston ace, the pattern in the
games generally the same: They force Martinez to throw a lot of
pitches early in the game, driving up his pitch count and tiring
him, and if they cannot beat Martinez, at least they could hope to
get him out of the game in the middle innings and then pound away
on the Red Sox' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte follows Roger Clemens in the rotation and Orlando
Hernandez follows Pettitte, and if the playoffs were to begin this
week in Yankee Stadium, that trio probably would start in that
order. They are all pitching exceptionally, they are all strong,
and it may not be a coincidence that all three have spent some
weeks on the disabled list this season, because of injuries that
have limited their innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 19 pitches Pettitte threw in the first inning
were fastballs, and he generally stifled the Red Sox' offense,
matching zeros with Martinez. If the Yankees are going to beat
Martinez, Joe Torre said before Saturday's game, they would have to
do so by getting a strong pitching performance and eking out a
couple of runs.  &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN DOGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  I moved to Brooklyn 15 years ago and have since spent several
mornings each week walking, running or just greeting the day in
Prospect Park. In recent years, these tranquil mornings have been
too often disrupted by snarling dogs who are permitted off their
leashes in the early morning during what the park system refers to
as ``courtesy hours.'' In the last year alone, I have been cornered
four times by ill-behaved dogs _ two of them pit bulls _ who were
clearly unfit to run loose in a public park.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The owners of such dogs rarely apologize and sometimes behave as
belligerently as their animals. The owner of a big, menacing boxer
promised to kill me when I told him I would mace the dog if it
charged me again. A few weeks later, the owner of a frothing German
shepherd declined to leash his dog _ essentially using it to corner
me, while he advised me to stay home during ``courtesy hours'' and
lectured me on the dog's right to be free.
</P>
<P>
   Dog groups in Brooklyn and elsewhere are fighting to head off
new dog regulations and to preserve the privileges they now enjoy
in the public parks. But those privileges will remain at risk
unless the owners can learn to balance the needs of their animals
with the needs of the human beings with whom they share New York
City's public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Animal welfare officials estimate that there are a million dogs
in the city _ or roughly one canine for every eight human beings.
The number of dogs will continue to grow, thanks to new federal
regulations that allow the 430,000 people who live in New York City
public housing to own dogs. In 1998, the chairman of the New York
City Housing Authority tried to block the measure, arguing that
public housing's dog problem was already out of control, even with
rules that limited dog ownership to the elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the number of dog bites reported to the
City Health Department has ranged from 6,000 to nearly 11,000 a
year. The number of biting dogs taken into custody by animal care
officials grew by nearly a third between 1996 and 1999, as more and
more New Yorkers who were ill prepared to train and handle such
dogs acquired them anyway. Testifying before the City Council last
year, the city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, concluded
that New York had ``failed to adequately protect the public from
biting dogs.'' Cohen supported a Giuliani administration bill that
would have required liability insurance for pit bulls _ which are
responsible for about a third of all bites in the city _ and made
it easier for the city to confiscate vicious and biting dogs
generally. Dog groups have blocked the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of allowing dogs to run free in city parks during
the early morning and late evening evolved informally during the
1970s and 80s, when the parks were suffering from neglect and dog
owners felt safer than other people about entering the overgrown,
crime-ridden spaces. The ``courtesy hours'' continued after the
parks were cleaned up and patrons returned. But the last few years
have seen considerable friction between dog owners and park
visitors who want to picnic, sunbathe or exercise without being set
upon by wayward animals.
</P>
<P>
   With too few park officers to cover all the boroughs, city park
authorities rely on loosely organized groups of dog owners who use
peer pressure to bring owners into line. Conscientious dog owners
routinely chase down others who break park rules and fail to clean
up after their dogs. But, fearing that poorly behaved dogs will be
euthanized, dog owners sometimes suppress news of even serious
maulings that should be reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Lowe was badly
bitten by a dog that was part pit bull and roaming off its leash in
Prospect Park. The dog clamped down so fiercely that it fractured
Lowe's wrist. After six months of physical therapy, Lowe may yet
require surgery to correct the damage.
</P>
<P>
   A dog that breaks the bones of an adult could kill a small
child. But instead of filing a police complaint right away, Lowe
says she negotiated with the dog's owner, who agreed to muzzle the
dog. Lowe waited two months before she reported the attack to the
police _ and said she did so only after finding that the dog had
bitten someone else and was still roaming the park unmuzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The dog that bit Lowe is listed in the police report as a pit
bull mix named Ozzie. But as recently as two weeks ago, I
encountered this dog bounding through the park playing fetch, as
wary walkers moved aside. A man walking his own dog warned: ``Keep
out of his way. That is one dangerous animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The police and the health department hold the ultimate
responsibility for controlling dogs proved to be vicious. But if
owners wish to keep their privileges in the parks, they will need
to show as much concern for public comfort and safety as for the
rights of their animals.  &QL;

 &HT;    Condo dispute ends in settlement

<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ It took more than two years and nearly a million
dollars, but a local condominium finally got rid of the resident
deemed too disruptive for condo life _ a boy with muscular
dystrophy, a motorized wheelchair and a disregard for the hot-tub
rule.

Commission on Human Relations and the Palm Beach County State
Attorney's Office to halt the eviction of the boy and his family
from the condo two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the boy's single mother, Marie-Clotilde ``Cloe''
Couturier Kallen, had been renting a unit at Oceancrest, where she
lived with her handicapped son, then 12, and her daughter,
Kassandre, then 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years the Kallens had been renters at Oceancrest,
some of the older residents had come to resent the handicapped boy
and his sister, who would invite other kids to play with them at
the condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think those children have any supervision,''
board member Gloria Rodkin would later testify in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The condo security staff began compiling complaints against the
boy: He was too loud in the communal TV room. He was heard using
the F-word. He and his friends tried building a fort in the condo
bushes. He would use his motorized wheelchair to tow boys on
skateboards in the condo lot. He was seen punching all the buttons
on the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   He was even written up for being seen on another floor of the
condo. In one complaint, a resident of the sixth floor said he
instructed the boy and his friends: ``They had no business being on
any floors other than where they live, unless they have a specific
reason, in this case, they had none.''
</P>
<P>
   The handicapped boy said he just went to the sixth floor to
enjoy the panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play there. I just go there . . . to look,'' he
testified. ``The neighborhood. The houses and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But what really drew attention were the complaints about the boy
that seemed directly related to his disability.
</P>
<P>
   NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   He was repeatedly cited for using the condo's hot tub, in
violation of the rule that made it off-limits to kids under 14.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had appealed to the condo board, saying the boy's
doctors said the warm water was therapeutic for his illness. But
the board took a no-exceptions line, or as one board member put it:
``We're not a health facility, we're a private home.''
</P>
<P>
   Others told the boy to ride the service elevator, he said, so he
wouldn't scratch the passenger elevator with his chair. Another
photographed the marks the boy's chair made on a lobby bathroom
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know if your wheelchair came into contact with the door
while you were trying to open it?'' the condo's lawyer asked the
boy in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I open doors,'' the boy explained.
</P>
<P>
   He was cited for riding his wheelchair over the grass and
suspected of intentionally tracking dog feces into the lobby from
his wheels. The security guards accused him of taunting them, by
ringing the lobby buzzer for admittance into the building, but then
leaving before they could get up from their desk to open the door
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he wasn't taunting, he just got tired of waiting
for the security guards who let the family know they were there for
surveillance, not to help the boy get in and out of the building _
a task he couldn't perform on his own due to the door configuration
and the weakness in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The boy testified that he was left stranded outside the building
about 20 times while the security guards failed to answer his
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of those times, did the guard see you there?'' the
condo's lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I rang the bell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the guard doing something, or anything, during those 20
times?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe sometimes reading the newspaper,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of waiting for the guard, he'd maneuver his
wheelchair through the parking garage entrance, where he would be
written up for creating a dangerous situation with the residents
trying to park their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ATTEMPT TO BUY CONDO BLOCKED BY BOARD
</P>
<P>
   The situation came to a head when the boy's mother tried to go
from a renter to a buyer at Oceancrest. Under the rules, the board
would have to approve the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board blocked it, citing the numerous complaints it
had compiled against her children. The board members, backed with
their secret file of complaints, thought they were on solid legal
ground.
</P>
<P>
   They had no idea what a mess, though, was about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the circus that would follow had nothing to
do with the boy or his disability.
</P>
<P>
   It had to do, some say, with the infamous lobby remodeling of
1997. A year before the attempted eviction of the handicapped boy,
the condo board passed an unpopular $456,000 special assessment for
remodeling. The assessment led to a recall petition of the condo
board, which nearly succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the hard feelings started here,'' said former
resident Bill Burgess, the husband of a former board member.
``After that, there were always two cliques here.''
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that the board was trying to oust the
handicapped boy, his most ardent supporters turned out to be the
same people who had a year earlier tried to oust the board over the
remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   So the board members looked at the fight over the handicapped
boy not as a question of accommodation of the disabled but as a
political ploy by their enemies to stir the pot of discontent at
the condo.
</P>
<P>
   The board dug in, taking a hard line against the boy, seeing him
as a proxy for its enemies in the building. An anonymous mailing
was sent to residents that referred to the boy's mother as the
``stooge'' of the anti-board faction in the condo.
</P>
<P>
   But the way it played to the rest of the country was far
different. The story of the condo's fight to kick out the boy was a
black eye for the 161-unit condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condo board tells sick boy to leave,'' was the headline of the
story in USA Today, which showed photos of the family.
</P>
<P>
   They received words of support from around the country, none
more bizarre than a radio disc jockey in Kansas City who sent a
representative to Oceancrest to sneak into the condo pool area and
defecate in the hot tub while reporting his actions via cellular
phone to the radio show's audience.
</P>
<P>
   Two condo residents discovered the results of the prankster's
deed as well as a bumper sticker for the radio station on the
bottom of the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   NEIGHBOR AGAINST NEIGHBOR
</P>
<P>
   The ugliest fighting, though, was neighbor-to-neighbor at
Oceancrest. Rita Malm, the wife of a former board president and the
reputed ringleader of the anti-board faction, got notes in her
mailbox calling her the Wicked Witch of Oceancrest.
</P>
<P>
   She complained to Jupiter police, who gave her plastic gloves so
she could preserve fingerprint evidence on the mail she received.
</P>
<P>
   A board member wrote a letter, threatening legal action to
anyone spreading the rumor that he has used the condo hot tub as a
place for having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Others warned the board to end their battle against the
handicapped boy and his family before it ended up in an expensive
legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this mess ends up in the courts, I want you to know I will
personally bring the board into the court and expose what you have
done to me personally and other residents with blatant lies to our
character,'' resident Sunny Newman wrote three board members.
</P>
<P>
   It did end up in court. Efforts to mediate a quick settlement
failed. The boy's mother completed the purchase of the condo at
Oceancrest, despite the board's wishes, and in December 1998, she
hired a lawyer, John Hart, who sued the condo in federal court for
discrimination by not allowing the boy in the hot tub or making the
front entrance accessible to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, it was a good healthy fight,'' the mother
said last week. ``But toward the end, it started deteriorating.
Some people had so much animosity toward us.''
</P>
<P>
   She said someone let the air out of her tires more than once.
Her license plate registration sticker was stolen. And her son
still got written up for using the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year and half ago, he had no curvature of his spine, by this
summer it was 56 degrees,'' she said. ``I know he needed the
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   SETTLEMENT REACHED
</P>
<P>
   So this spring, she agreed to a mediated settlement, taking the
money offered _ less than she thought she could get at trial but
enough to put her son in a house of his own with his own pool and a
hot tub she plans to add.
</P>
<P>
   The spinal surgery has left her son nearly immobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I won the lottery,'' she said. ``He needs to be
moved 12 to 15 times every night. I have to get up in the middle of
the night to move him. To pay somebody to do that would be about
$100 a night _ that's a lot of money to get to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But Couturier Kallen, who works a full-time job as a massage
therapist, isn't complaining. Especially about her new
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live on a cul-de-sac, and there are other teenagers on the
block,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at Oceancrest, the condo association now owns the
family's old condo. But residents haven't been told the terms of
the settlement or how it will be paid for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board hasn't given us anything,'' resident Betty Wienke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board president Jim Walden didn't respond to requests for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the combatants at Oceancrest have either
stepped down or moved away. Rita Malm and her husband, who refer to
their old home as ``Battlecrest,'' moved to another condo in
Jupiter last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the people here seem very pleasant,'' she said. ``But
that's the way it always starts.''

BOSTON COLLEGE TROUNCES ARMY, MATCHING BLACK KNIGHTS' WORST
DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Maybe Army should have reverted to the
wishbone against Boston College Saturday in the Black Knights' loss
at Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling in its home opener a new coach, Todd Berry, and the
one-back, three-wideout passing offense that replaced the
run-oriented wishbone, which Army had used for 16 years, the Black
Knights came out throwing from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chad Jenkins completed five of his first six passes,
and with Jenkins accounting for 47 yards on two passes, the Black
Knights drove 70 yards for the game's first touchdown on their
second possession. A reserve running back, Josh Holden, scored on a
slithering run along the right side.
</P>
<P>
   But that lead was short-lived as a Boston College backup
tailback, William Green, returned the ensuing kickoff 84 yards to
the Army 8-yard line. Then, Cedric Washington bolted up the middle
to score, and the Eagles were on their way to a 55-17 rout of the
Black Knights before a crowd of 37,544.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-point loss matched the worst home defeat ever for Army
(0-2), which was playing with only four days off after losing its
opener Monday at Cincinnati, 23-17. The Cadets were beaten, 45-7,
by Pittsburgh in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was close throughout the first half. Had it not
been for a pass interception at Army's 32 late in the first quarter
and an ill-advised onside kickoff, the Black Knights could have
kept it closer. But the interception led to the Eagles surging
ahead 14-7. And the onside kick _ following a 27-yard field goal by
Brendan Mullen that had trimmed the deficit to 14-10 _ set the
stage for a 60-yard Eagles' drive. Mike Sutphin hit his second
field goal, from 24 yards out, to provide a 17-10 lead as time
expired in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Those 3 points turned out to be the first of 17 scored by the
visitors over a span of 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Following the second-half kickoff, Boston College quarterback
Tim Hasselbeck connected with wide receiver Dedrick Dewalt on the
first play for a 75-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 20 seconds later, Curtis Bolden, a B.C. linebacker, picked
off a Jenkins pass on Army's first play of the half and raced down
the left sideline untouched for a 22-yard touchdown. The Eagles
scored four unanswered touchdowns in the third period to take a
48-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles added a final touchdown late in the fourth period, as
did Army. The Black Knights' second touchdown came with two seconds
left when Curtis Zervik, the third-string quarterback, passed 12
yards to Clinton Woody, a freshman wide receiver, to cap a 63-yard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played two different halves,'' Berry said. ``We should have
reacted better in the second half and we've got to make things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck, a senior, connected on 14 of 21 passes for 256 yards
and 3 touchdowns, 2 of them by Dewalt. Hasselbeck's backup, Brian
St. Pierre, was no less effective, hitting on 6 of 8 passes for 89
yards. That added up to 335 passing yards to 193 yards by Army. The
B.C. quarterbacks did not thrown an interception; Jenkins was
intercepted twice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The loss was crushing to Army in more ways than the final score.
The Black Knights had played fairly well in losing to Cincinnati,
23-17, last Saturday in a game that was not decided until the
Bearcats scored a touchdown with 6 minutes and 11 seconds remaining
in the game. But Saturday, Army made too many mistakes on defense,
particularly in failing to put pressure on Hasselbeck and enabling
his receivers to get wide open repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   And the Eagles, now 1-1, who amassed 252 yards rushing, never
fumbled either in a turnover-free performance while the Black
Knights fumbled once and ran for only 161 yards, more than 100
yards less than they averaged last season, the last for the
wishbone and its last coach, Bob Sutton, now a linebackers' coach
for the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   B.C.'s passing was well abetted by the running of Washington, a
first-team Big East selection last year, who gained only 31 yards
against West Virginia last Saturday but who carried 15 times for
100 yards and one touchdown this Saturday afternoon.

COULTHARD IS PATIENT AS HE CONTENDS FOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONZA, Italy _ A recent interview with David Coulthard,
Scotland's greatest hope for another Formula One driver's title,
was interrupted by a visit to the McLaren motor home of Jackie
Stewart, Scotland's last world champion.
</P>
<P>
   In a thicker Scottish brogue than he used before, Coulthard
said, ``Thaink ye for your kaind wairds,'' to Stewart, who that
week had predicted to the British news media that Coulthard was the
most likely driver to win the title this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just before the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks ago,
which Mika Hakkinen, Coulthard's teammate, won in one of his finest
races. Coulthard finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   At the Italian Grand Prix here on Sunday, Hakkinen and Michael
Schumacher, who are first and second in the point standing, will be
the center of attention. Schumacher, in a Ferrari, set the fastest
lap in 1 minute, 23.770 seconds around the 3.59 mile circuit in
Saturday's qualifying session. Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher's
teammate was second fastest, and Hakkinen was third fastest.
Coulthard set only the fifth best time, behind Jacques Villeneuve.
</P>
<P>
   But with four races left, Coulthard is only 13 points behind and
with 10 points awarded each victory, the Scot is still a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you are a gambling man,'' Stewart said, ``you would say
that there's a better chance for David to win than for Mika.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Stewart sees it, Hakkinen's effort to win a third title
in a row, which no one but Juan Manuel Fangio has ever done _ and
that in the 1950s _ puts the odds in Coulthard's favor. And he
thinks Schumacher's Ferrari is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard, for his part, is philosophical. Of course he wants to
win. But if he doesn't, at 29, he is still confident about his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the development of my career, my driving, and
feel that my best is still to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to disagree with him about his career: with
three victories this season, it is already his best year.
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard started in Formula One at the Williams team in 1994,
replacing Ayrton Senna after the Brazilian died in a crash in the
San Marino Grand Prix at Imola.
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard won his first race the following year at the
Portuguese Grand Prix. But in 1996 he joined McLaren, leaving the
top team for one that had been in the doldrums since Senna left it
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it would have been better to have stayed with
Williams,'' Coulthard said. ``I may have won a title had I stayed.
But I took a decision very early on to go with McLaren on the basis
that it may be a setback in the short term, but in the long term it
would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard earned the team's first victory since 1993, at the
season-opening Australian Grand Prix in 1997, and then at the
Italian Grand Prix at Monza. But while he was getting into a
groove, Hakkinen, who had been racing since 1991 with no victories,
was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   So in the last race of 1997, at the European Grand Prix at
Jerez, the team asked Coulthard to let Hakkinen pass him to win the
race, and he did. In the first race of the following season, the
Australian Grand Prix, Coulthard was again asked to pull aside to
let Hakkinen win. It had to do with a pre-race team agreement
stating that the driver who first passed the first corner was
allowed to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory was all Hakkinen needed for a mentally
liberating start to what would become his first of two consecutive
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if he'll ever give those back?'' Coulthard said
sharply in Spa two weeks ago. ``It would be nice if I had 11 wins
instead of nine.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was not bitter about Hakkinen's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at the right point in his career in terms of experience
and knowledge and support of the team to have himself a
psychological position to give himself an edge,'' he said. ``I've
been working to get myself in that same position.''

BOSTON RED SOX'S BRYCE FLORIE UNDERGOES SURGERY FOR EYE INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox pitcher Bryce Florie, hit in the face by a line
drive in the ninth inning of Friday's game with the Yankees,
underwent surgery Saturday morning and, according to the team,
there is extensive damage to his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox released a statement from Bill Morgan, their team
doctor, who said that Florie's right eyeball was severely injured.
``There is some retinal damage that will be further assessed over
the next 24 to 72 hours to determine whether or not surgery is
required to repair the retina,'' he said. ``He has some bleeding
behind the retina, but the retina is not detached. Prognosis for
reasonable vision is guarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also reported that Florie has three fractures around his
right eye socket that will require surgery, a nasal fracture, a
fracture of the medial wall and a fracture of the floor of the
socket.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Thompson, who hit the line drive, was shaken Saturday
morning, calling Manager Jimy Williams to check on Florie's
condition.

   Forget about global warming, it is global cooling that's changed
us all
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Latham
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ You hear a great deal about global warming
these days. Some people say it threatens life on Earth, others say
it is nothing but a myth. Me, I don't know anything about that
either way.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know about is global cooling. Now there is something
that has really changed our lives over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has warmed up a few degrees on the outside during that
time and, if so, that's a terrible thing. I know for sure, though,
that it has cooled down by 20 or 30 degrees on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has changed our lives more than air conditioning, I
don't know what it is. The term wasn't even invented when I was
born and now we cannot do without it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people my age remember not having it anywhere. We started
school around this time of year, which meant it was still blazing
hot for several weeks and we went until the beginning of June,
which gave us all of May during which to swelter.
</P>
<P>
   No air conditioning. No fans that I can remember. All we had
were open windows and the hope for a stiff breeze. What I remember
most about school in those days were the dozens of wasps that
buzzed along the ceiling and walls, just waiting for an
unsuspecting student.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, instead of learning multiplication, I was, like an
air traffic controller, dividing my time keeping track of all the
the wasps in the room. Forget plane geometry, I was plain scared.
Euclid never had to worry about this.
</P>
<P>
   The first air conditioner I remember at home was an oscillating
fan. I'm sure those fans were a remarkable invention but the most
remarkable feature about them is that they are blowing air
somewhere else almost all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And I still recall the day my dad installed the evaporative
cooler in the living room of our house. These contraptions weighed
about two tons and then you put water in them so that the air that
blew into the house was cool. Except it almost never was that cool,
especially if the sun happened to be beating down on the cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Evaporative coolers, which should never be used in areas with
more than 15 percent humidity, had two other significant features:
They grew a great fungus and they smelled like four-day old fish.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing you could about the fungus, but for the smell
we dumped a couple of gallons of Pine Sol a week into the water
tray. Everything smelled so strongly of pine in my house that we
really didn't have to take a bath for a week. It smelled like
Christmas in July.
</P>
<P>
   I was in high school before my family got its first window unit
that actually used Freon. My parents thought they were being smart
by installing it in their room, turned out they would always regret
it. Because from the instant the unit was installed, their bedroom
became the family room. They literally would have to drive us out
at night.
</P>
<P>
   And then a strange thing began to happen. After just a few weeks
of that wonderful air conditioning, it seemed to do nothing but get
hotter outside. Where once I could have worked or played outside
all day long, suddenly, the heat got to be too much for me.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in high school I was lucky enough to get a class in
the newly renovated _ and air conditioned _ part of the building.
Going there just before noon made every class afterwards
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but it hadn't been that hot before, had it?

   Global warming may not be as big a danger as global spoiling.
We've all become so accustomed to being comfortable all the time
that we can't stand it when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Besides , the two things might be tied together anyway. I'm
thinking global warming comes from the exhaust from all those air
conditioners.

OFFENSE GETS INK, BUT DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-WILLIAMS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   Defense still wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   In this new-age NFL, offense draws the headlines and offensive
players collect the awards. But it still comes down to how well a
team can defend.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe the old cliche still holds, consider how
the St. Louis Rams won the title last season.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner was the league MVP after throwing 41 touchdown
passes. Marshall Faulk was the NFL Offensive Player of the Year
after setting an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage. And
the Rams averaged 32.9 points per game in going 13-3 in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But at crunch time, it was the Rams' unheralded and
underappreciated defense that saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC Championship Game, the Rams scored only 11 points.
But their defense held the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV ended with Rams linebacker Mike Jones tackling
Tennessee Titans receiver Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line to give
St. Louis a 23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Offense got the Rams to the playoffs. Defense won them the
Lombardi Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have defense,'' Hall of Fame linebacker Sam Huff
said. ``Defense wins football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize that there are only two things an offense can
do? They can run, and they can pass. That's all they can do.
Coaches make this game complicated, but it's not a complicated
game. So if you're a defense, all you have to do is two things:
Shut down the run and shut down the pass, and then they've got to
punt. (Vince) Lombardi said if you control the ball, you control
the clock and then you control the game. He was as simple and basic
as you can get. It's rock-and-sock football, and that's what it's
all about. The team that does that the best, he always said, will
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the best defensive team in the NFL _ the
Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tampa Bay was the most dominating defense since the
1985 Chicago Bears. It carried a Bucs offense that scored a
touchdown or less in seven games, including four in which the
offense failed to reach the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come in and beat us, you've got to beat our defense,'' said
Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp, the NFL's Defensive Player of
the Year in 1999. ``That's the strength of our ballclub. We're
going to come put hats on them and see if they want to play with us
for four quarters.`
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs replaced two key starters from last season, opting for
potential over age. Middle linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who made the
NFC Pro Bowl team the past four years, left as a free agent for the
Jacksonville Jaguars when the Bucs decided it was time for
third-year veteran Jamie Duncan to have his chance. Defensive
tackle Brad Culpepper, who has 23.5 sacks over the past three
seasons, was released two weeks ago after Tampa Bay named former
first-round choice Anthony McFarland the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs beat the New England Patriots, 21-16, last week,
allowing only 88 rushing yards on 21 carries and sacking
quarterback Drew Bledsoe six times and knocking him down another
13. The last 27 times Tampa Bay has led going into the fourth
quarter, it has protected that lead 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year is a different year,'' said Bucs coach Tony Dungy,
a disciple of former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Chuck Noll.
``It would be easy to say we're just going to stay the status quo,
but we didn't win last year, so we felt like we had to get better.
You're always worried about chemistry, but we felt like this was
the best way to go, that this would make us a better defense.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the Bucs defense lacks is a nickname. The
``New York Times/ tabbed them ``The Brick Wall'' last week. In a
poll last year, the ``St. Petersburg Times/ offered several ideas
including ``Red Tide,'' the ``Warren Commission,'' ``Skull and
Crush Bones'' and the ``Pewter People Eaters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't need a nickname until we win a championship,''
weak-side linebacker Derrick Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   With their defense, the Bucs could have both by season's end.

<P>
   Q&AMP;A ... WITH MIKE VANDERJAGT
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt can't miss.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderjagt has made every field-goal attempt since the
Cincinnati Bengals blocked a 37-yarder on Oct. 24, 1999. Vanderjagt
hit from 23 and 40 yards in the season opener against the Kansas
City Chiefs, giving him a streak of 28 consecutive, not counting
the playoffs when he went 3-for-3 against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter where they put it down at this
point,'' Vanderjagt said. ``I'm fortunate enough to continue where
I left off last year, and I feel just as much in rhythm now as I
did then. I'm feeling real good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderjagt keeps count, and he knows who he is chasing. Gary
Anderson holds the NFL record with the 40 consecutive he hit in
1997-98 with the San Francisco 49ers and the Minnesota Vikings.
Minnesota's Fuad Reveiz (31) and San Diego's John Carney (29) are
the only other players in NFL history who have longer streaks.
Chris Boniol also had a streak of 28 consecutive field goals with
the Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-eight and counting,'' said Vanderjagt, a Canadian who
began his professional career in the CFL. ``I'd like to get up in
the 30s. Second place is 31, so I'd at least like to get to 32.
Forty is a stretch. But we'll play it one at a time and see how
long it takes me to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   What is one word that describes your kicking style? Unique.
</P>
<P>
   What one word would friends use to describe you? Original.
</P>
<P>
   If you were commissioner for a day, what would you change about
the NFL? I'd widen the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   If you weren't playing football, what would you be doing? I'd be
running the point for the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any superstitions? Oh, I have a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   What are they? As soon as I get to the stadium every Sunday, I
walk up one hash, touch the uprights, walk down the other hash,
touch the other uprights and go inside. There are a lot more, but
that's the biggest one.
</P>
<P>
   What is the last book you read? Oh, good Lord. ``Catcher in the
Rye/ in high school, I think.
</P>
<P>
   What is your all-time favorite movie? ``Shawshank Redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you see ``The Replacements''? I haven't seen it yet, but
I've seen the HBO previews for it. They've made the kicker look
wacky as all get out, which I guess is the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   If you were on ``Survivor'', what would your luxury item be? A
portable TV. I can't live without TV.
</P>
<P>
   If you could invite two people, dead or alive, to dinner, who
would they be? Michael Jordan and Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   What's the first thing you notice in a woman? Whether she has
cankles or not. Cankles are where your calves slide right down into
your ankles.
</P>
<P>
   What's the first thing you notice in a football player? If his
shoes match.
</P>
<P>
   Would you spend $50 to watch an NFL game? Yes ... now that I can
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore or Bush? I'm Canadian, so neither. Gore if I had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' or ``Gilligan's Island''? ``Survivor''.
</P>
<P>
   Boxers or briefs? Boxers.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS IN A RUSH
</P>
<P>
   Duce Staley had 201 of the Eagles' 306 rushing yards against the
Cowboys last weekend. With the game a blowout, he had only one
carry _ for 60 yards _ in the fourth quarter. He finished four
yards short of Steve Van Buren's team record and 74 behind Walter
Payton's NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   During a national conference call on Wednesday, Staley was asked
if he could have broken the NFL record if he had played the entire
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the record? I have no idea,'' Staley said.
</P>
<P>
   Told his hero, Payton, set the mark with 275 yards against the
Minnesota Vikings in 1977, Staley said: ``Oh, I don't know. I
probably would have passed out (before reaching 275).''
</P>
<P>
   The 109-degree, 26-carry day was no sweat for Staley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I only lost like 5 to 6 pounds, which was
surprising,'' Staley said. ``I thought maybe I lost a little more,
but I was able to get the water back in my system, and go get me a
massage (Tuesday) to try to bring my legs back around.''
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND
</P>
<P>
   The 3-4 defense has gone the way of the dinosaur in the NFL.
Only a handful of teams still use it. But the San Francisco 49ers,
whose base defense is a 4-3, experimented with three down linemen
during their 36-28 loss to the Atlanta Falcons last week.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:29 left in the second quarter, the 49ers moved veteran
linebackers Winfred Tubbs and Ken Norton inside and put pass
rushers Jeff Posey and top draft pick Julian Peterson at the
outside linebacker positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in it early and late, and we may or may not use it
again, in case (Carolina coach) George Seifert is watching,'' 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``We can't be so simple with our
defense. We want to disguise it. A new front, that really helps.''
QUARTERBACK CLASS
</P>
<P>
   The future of the NFL is in good hands. Five of the six
quarterbacks drafted in the first two rounds of the 1999 draft had
good opening days.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Cade McNown (102.7), Cleveland's Tim Couch (97.8),
Tampa Bay's Shaun King (86.6), Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb (81.0)
and Minnesota's Daunte Culpepper (65.5) combined for a 60.8
completion percentage, 937 yards, five touchdowns, three
interceptions and an 83.0 quarterback rating. They also rushed for
a combined 242 yards and five touchdowns on 34 carries. And only
McNown and Couch lost.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Akili Smith, the No. 3 choice last year, makes his
debut Sunday. GETTING THEIR KICKS
</P>
<P>
   The first regular-season game at Paul Brown Stadium takes place
Sunday when the Bengals play host to the rival Cleveland Browns.
After the two exhibitions played there, kickers complained that the
Bermuda grass surface was uneven in places.
</P>
<P>
   They made only 3 of 8 field goals at Paul Brown Stadium in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Lions' 21-13 victory against the Bengals on
Aug. 25, Detroit kicker Jason Hanson told Bengals kicker Neil
Rackers, ``Good luck kicking on this field.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING STOCK (UP ARROW)
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton. His NFL single-game record of 275 rushing yards
stands ... thanks only to the Philadelphia Eagles' defense, which
was so good that Duce Staley had but one carry in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Snyder's wallet. The Washington Redskins owner keeps
writing fat checks. Last week he gave $90 million to running back
Stephen Davis. Do you have change to spare, brother?
</P>
<P>
   (SIDEWAYS ARROW)
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Bengals. Hey, they didn't lose last week. Of course,
they didn't play either.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams uniforms. This is what you call winning ugly.
</P>
<P>
   (DOWN ARROW)
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Texans' logo. And you expect Aggies in this state to
support you? You might as well have Bevo on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Lambeau Field. What home-field advantage? The Packers were 39-3
there from 1993-98, including a streak of 25 consecutive victories.
Since then, they are 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball pennant races. Who cares? Football, America's real
pastime, is here.
</P>
<P>
   WEEK 2 AT A GLANCE THE BEST Jacksonville at Baltimore
</P>
<P>
   Noon
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens never have beaten the Jaguars, but that's about to
change. Baltimore's defense is good, and quarterback Tony Banks is
adequate. This could be the start of something great for the
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Ravens, 16-10
</P>
<P>
   N.Y. Giants at Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   Noon, CBS
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have won their past three games _ against New
England, St. Louis and the Cowboys _ by a combined score of 103-54.
Only an emotional letdown stands in the way of four in a row for
the playoff-bound Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Eagles, 24-14
</P>
<P>
   Washington at Detroit
</P>
<P>
   3:15 p.m., FOX
</P>
<P>
   The Lions defeated the Redskins, 33-17, last Dec. 5 for their
first victory against Washington since 1965. It's now nine months
and another loss to the Redskins later. The Lions will keep it
close, but they still will suffer their 17th loss to the Redskins
in their past 18 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Redskins, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Last week: 3-0 nn

FOUR MANAGERS SWEATING IT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No manager has been fired during the season, but once the season
ends there could be a run on guys being ousted.
</P>
<P>
   It's always ugly when things deteriorate, but now it's a race to
determine which National League team poised to whack its manager
deserves the distinction of being in the worst situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers aren't the only ones going through this
and they might not even be the ugliest. Arizona and Philadelphia
are going through similar ordeals. Diamondbacks skipper Buck
Showalter is likely to lose his job after the season, especially
given Arizona's collapse as the Giants run away with the National
League West.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies manager Terry Francona is also in loads of trouble and
much of that stems from the club's popularity falling off
dramatically. General manager Ed Wade and other members of the
front office have been traveling with the club to get a better read
on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing is as ugly as in Cincinnati, where Jack McKeon
has gone from manager of the year to being treated like garbage by
the organization. Reporters are learning about key personnel moves
before McKeon. However, Cincinnati's brass doesn't want to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the stock answer? At the appropriate time, we'll sit
down and evaluate this year,'' said chief operating officer John
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said, ``The ball's in their court. It's not in mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what's gone on there and you'll see how unfairly
McKeon's being treated. The Reds recalled Brooks Kieschnick and
Keith Glauber last week, but McKeon didn't know until after
reporters were told. Reporters were also told that Barry Larkin was
having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee before McKeon was made
aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the situation isn't bad in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Reports are that Diamondbacks CEO Jerry Colangelo, who stated
Showalter would remain with the club for the rest of the season,
talked with broadcaster Bob Brenly about becoming the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting involved in any response to speculative
stories about who I talked to or didn't talk to, period,''
Colangelo said. ``(I've tried) get the focus of our team on doing
the job that has to be done, and that's win baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused on this season. He's my manager and there's
nothing else to be said. I refuse to be brought into this circle of
responding to speculative stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter has two more years remaining on his contract, the same
amount of time Francona has on his deal in Philadelphia. In fact,
Francona's two-year, $1 million extension hasn't even begun, but
general manager Ed Wade might not care.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies (57-82) entered Saturday with the worst record in
major-league baseball and as one of two teams already
mathematically eliminated from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than anger in Philadelphia, a city known for its toughness
and often unfairness, is the malaise that's set in. When the team
was going well early in the 1990s, the season-ticket base was
20,000. Team officials fear it could dip below 10,000 next season.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also the well-chronicled watch of Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson and how management questioned his strategy and style
and then expected him to win games.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone raised questions about
Johnson's tactics, and managing general manager and CEO Bob Daly
said Johnson needed to put some fire into the players.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the season has been quiet when it comes to managers
being fired, but with nothing going on with player-personnel moves
between the end of the regular season and the opening of the
free-agent market in November, what's a person to do to get a
baseball fix?
</P>
<P>
   Watch the playoffs? Nah, just look to decide who the next
manager's going to be. And there will be some vacancies to fill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `I'm an &QL;
</P>
<P>
   easy out.' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   At times the talk was bothersome, at times a bit funny. But one
thing Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton didn't understand
was why everyone was making a big deal about him hitting .400 in
late July and into August.
</P>
<P>
   And Helton to some extent has proven his case. A recent slump
dropped his average to .384. He went 3 for 5 against the Dodgers on
Friday and stood at .386.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter until the season is over,'' Helton said.
``It's just the type of person I am. I don't think about those
things until they happen, and it doesn't happen until the season is
over. It's not like hitting 60 homers. You hit your 60, 70 homers,
you have them. They don't take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit there and say I can do it until I do
it,'' Helton added. ``I never said it wasn't possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of July, Helton has heard about becoming the first
player since Ted Williams in 1941 to bat .400. The talk died until
he went on a 26-for-43 tear during a recent 13-game stretch. Helton
was batting .400 after a sixth-inning base hit on Aug. 21. It was
the only time he's been at .400 since June 10.
</P>
<P>
   But in hitter-friendly Coors Field, Helton turned around and
went through an uncharacteristic 5-for-31 streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got me figured out,'' Helton said. ``Throw the ball
right down the middle. I'm an easy out. Or throw it inside, or
throw it high, or throw it outside or throw it at me and I'll
probably get myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Maddux Mr. Consistency: Is Atlanta right-hander Greg Maddux
heading for the Hall of Fame? Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone
thinks so, especially after Maddux became the third pitcher in
history to win 15 games in 13 consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux joins Cy Young (15 seasons) and Gaylord Perry (13).
</P>
<P>
   ``What that says to me is, he's a lock for the Hall of Fame,''
Mazzone said. ``He can make a pitching coach look real smart. And
the funny thing about it is, he's smarter than the pitching
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who is 16-8 with a 3.21 ERA, has passed Whitey Ford and
is 52nd on the all-time win list with 237.
</P>
<P>
   __ No quit in Padres? San Diego Padres third baseman Phil Nevin
didn't like what he saw in the locker room after a loss to
Pittsburgh last Sunday and he made sure to let his thoughts be
heard onthe last day.

   ``I checked the calendar,'' Nevin said. ``This is Labor Day, not
Oct. 1. But I just get the feeling in here that some people in this
room are ready to shut it down and ready for this thing to end. We
have a chance to make a move and finish where we should be. But we
came out unbelievably flat (last) Friday night. This was
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevin didn't single out names, but reports out of San Diego were
that Nevin was focusing squarely on center fielder Ruben Rivera.
Before Monday's win against Milwaukee, Nevin and Rivera got into a
shouting match, forcing manager Bruce Bochy to hold a closed-door
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something needed to be said and it escalated into
something that lasted longer than it should have,'' Nevin said.
``It's over and done with. We're a family in here and you are going
to have these things.''

SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMER'S JOURNEY INTO FREEDOM GAINS TRUE
INDEPENDENCE

<P>
   In a way, Anna Kozlova's Olympic odyssey began in a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. A gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to Italy with the Soviet Union's national junior
synchronized swimming team, the then-15-year-old Kozlova looked out
of the window of the bus and saw the twinkling, busy lights of Fiat
gas tanks being filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed so bright,'' Kozlova remembered. ``Russia is
so gray. But this all just really stood out. It was fascinating to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is 27 now, and Kozlova is about to join the growing
fraternity of athletes who have marched behind the Olympic flag of
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova tells a story about another trip, when she journeyed
with her Soviet teammates to the 1989 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching the American athletes,'' she said, ``and
it was so fascinating to me. I remember watching them, the way they
prepared, the way they acted toward each other. And our team was
nothing like that. I realized that it was something that was really
missing in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a year after she finished in fourth place of the
synchronized swimming's duet competition at the Barcelona Olympics,
Kozlova traveled to California to train _ and to leave her native
Russia behind.
</P>
<P>
   Naively, she thought that changing citizenships would be no more
difficult than changing library cards. But she soon discovered that
the wait at U.S. immigration can seem as long as the Russian bread
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I was too young and not smart enough to know that,''
Kozlova said. ``But then, I still never doubted my decision. It was
hard, but I knew it would happen someday.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1999, after the mandatory five-year wait, Anna
Kozlova became a U.S. citizen. As she recited the oath of
allegiance, tears streamed from her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The long wait had cost her a chance to compete in the 1996
Atlanta Olympics. It was frustrating, because Kozlova already was
recognized as the best synchronized swimmer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She had left her parents behind in Russia. Arvin Kozlov is a
professor at the Academy of Physical Education, while Natalia
Kozlova teaches university math.
</P>
<P>
   But both knew that with the political uncertainties at home,
Anna was making the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was very positive,'' Kozlova said. ``She was always
talking about western culture, always talking about England and
France, always encouraging me to learn the language because, I
think, instinctively she felt that would be a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad hoped I would come back. He would say, `You know, I'm
finishing our country house.' But he came here in October to visit,
and the first thing that came out of his mouth when we were driving
was, `I'm so glad you live here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old daughter that left St. Petersburg is now a
27-year-old woman. She lives in Santa Clara, Calif., where she
competes for Olympic coach Chris Carver as a member of the Santa
Clara Aquamaids, the Yankees of synchronized swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to basically become an adult in a different country, and
that was hard,'' Kozlova said. ``I had to get a job and work and
train, and I didn't have any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna found two angels in Lee and Paula Dyroen, the parents of
former world champion Becky Dyroen-Lancer. The Dyroens welcomed
Kozlova into their home, fed her, taught her to drive _ ``treated
me like I was their daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, when she could compete in open or invitational
competitions, Kozlova began winning every competition within reach.
At the U.S. Olympic trials, she placed first in both the individual
and duet events. Kozlova will team with Tuesday Middaugh in the
duet competition in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova left her former Olympic partner, Olga Sedakova, back in
Russia, but Kozlova said that she has experienced only a few cold
shoulders from her former countrymen at competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're angry at me for leaving, but I do think
there's some jealousy going on,'' she said. ``It's because I was
able to make it here, have a better life or something, and can
compete for such a huge, grand country like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've developed a lot, especially artistically. I've learned a
different style of swimming. American style is very different from
Russian. Team skills are a very big part of the sport here. In
Russia, it's more individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new country, Kozlova attests, is everything she dreamed it
would be. Now that she is a U.S. citizen, Kozlova said, she has
time to think a lot more about things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the freedom a lot,'' she said, ``and the people,
how they treat one another. And I guess I appreciate just you
getting up in the morning and knowing you're here, safe, free and
can be what you really want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And what Anna Kozlova really wants is to stand on the podium at
the Sydney Olympics and hear the ``Star-Spangled Banner''.
</P>
<P>
   She'll cry, she promises. It's been a long journey. nn

 &HT;    A global quandary

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Arctic sea ice is 40 percent thinner than it was 30
years ago. Winter temperatures there are an average of 11 degrees
warmer than they were 30 years ago. This summer there were
unusually large expanses of open water at the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. In
the Rockies, yellow-bellied marmots, the traditional harbingers of
spring, have been emerging from their burrows a month earlier than
they did 20 years ago. Across North America, from the fire-scorched
West to the drought-parched Southeast, it was a summer of
discontent. Even the seas _ to a depth of 1,000 feet _ have grown
warmer over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of a warmer world, now reflected in more than 400 climate
indicators _ from trees and coral reefs to ice cores and permafrost
_ grow more compelling every year. But even as evidence of global
warming builds, there are nagging new questions about how best to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, NASA physicist James Hansen was one of the first
scientists to link increasing carbon dioxide levels and other
so-called greenhouse gases to the threat of global warming. After
rancorous debate, in 1997 major industrialized nations acknowledged
the threat and signed the Kyoto Protocol, which committed them to
reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil and
gas by 5 percent by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate, which is due to resume in mid-November when 180
nations meet in the Netherlands to finalize the agreement, goes on
_ and Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies, has just added fuel to the fire. In a strategy for
controlling global warming proposed last month in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, he contends that industrial
nations, which have yet to implement the proposed reductions, may
be aiming at the wrong target.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen still believes that carbon dioxide is responsible for
about half of the global increase in temperatures. But he says more
efficient heat-trapping gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbons,
soot and ozone have been the chief man-made contributors to warming
in the past 30 years. And he says they are easier to control than
carbon dioxide, which can be reduced only by cutting the
consumption of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Man-made sources of methane include intensive agriculture, coal
mining and leaky gas pipelines. Chlorofluorocarbons, now being
phased out, have been widely used in air conditioners,
refrigerators and industrial applications. Soot and ozone are
produced by factories, power plants and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's analysis has been greeted by headlines charging that he
had ``backtracked'' and ``flip-flopped'' on global warming. With
each nation's greenhouse strategies still subject to debate, his
ideas have been quickly seized by critics as one more reason not to
ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Watson, chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, says any suggestion that carbon dioxide is not a
major force in global warming would be a ``horrible distortion'' of
Hansen's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Without discounting the role of carbon dioxide, Hansen says
global warming could be tamed without draconian cutbacks in the
consumption of fossil fuels. He says that two decades of sound
environmental policies are already making a dent in the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the growth rate of non-carbon dioxide
greenhouse gases has declined in the past decade,'' he says.
Chlorofluorocarbons, he points out, are already being eliminated
under another international treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sources of methane and tropospheric ozone were reduced in
the future, further changes in climate due to these gases in the
next 50 years could be near zero,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If those reductions were coupled with controls on soot and
industrial emissions of carbon _ and moderate cuts in carbon
dioxide _ Hansen says the rate of warming could be significantly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's analysis is not yet a major issue in the U.S. election,
but it could be. Democratic candidate Al Gore's reputation as an
environmentalist is closely tied to his support of the Kyoto
accord. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has said he thinks the treaty,
which would require increased energy conservation and the use of
alternative fuels, is unfair to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness is not limited to industrialized nations. Because
the only way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to reduce fossil
fuel consumption in automobiles, factories and power plants, many
developing nations fear the accord could limit their growth.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as the current target for reducing carbon dioxide
is, climate models suggest that it won't be enough to reduce the
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   British climate experts, in fact, say that even if everyone
complied with the treaty, it would take ``30 Kyotos'' to reduce
warming to an acceptable level.

WHILE hOUSTON LIVES, COWBOYS' FUTURE IS GONE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those sweaty people down in Houston always have wanted to be us.
Don't expect an admission on this, but their envy has been thicker
than their smog. It's mainly about football, but overall, it's the
jock kingdom in general. Houston never has been able to come close
to us.
</P>
<P>
   Except, at the moment, I'm picking up a faint radio signal from
outer space. There's a lot of static, but I recognize that voice.
It's our nationally famous football bidnessman. It's Jerry, and
he's giving an urgent may-day call:
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, we've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we ever. Don't spread this around, but Houston just got the
jump on us in football. Houston, with an NFL team that doesn't even
begin play until 2002, is currently situated exactly where Mr.
Jones would kill to be.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the newly-named Texans is Bob McNair, who could buy
and sell downtown Dallas if he so desired. But what Jerry would
like at the moment is a mere swap with Bob.
</P>
<P>
   It's a guarantee that right here, right now, Jones would trade
his 53 Cowboys, and throw in a Stephen to be named later, in
exchange for the Texans, a team with no players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the second Jerry made that proposal, McNair's laugh would be
heard all the way to Port Arthur. McNair ain't no fool. He knows
he's got exactly what Jerry wants, and exactly what Jerry might
never have up here:
</P>
<P>
   A new space-age stadium and a team with nary a salary cap
headache.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, we do have a problem. And ``problem'' is a tad mild.
What Jerry currently has, and privately he knows it, is a potential
football disaster. The Cowboys' salary cap, which seemed at least
under control, became an instant mushroom cloud hanging over Valley
Ranch after what happened in the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway was a cap-buster even in good health. His $13
million signing bonus last spring represented a large gamble for
Jones. Now the receiver expected to put the get-up-and-go back in
the offense is lost for the season with a wrecked knee. Even worse,
quarterback Troy Aikman's future is in doubt due to a mushy brain.
One more hit ...
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' cap has been structured around Aikman. If he
retires, the cap crumbles, 49ers-like. Second-guess the Jones
financial planning all you want, but Jerry played a very
high-stakes dice game here. Look closely _ are the bones now
showing a pair of snake-like eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an awful on-the-field performance against the Eagles,
and this week from hell has been unprecedented for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I'm checking my hole card more than anytime
since I've been involved,'' Jones said at mid-week. ``You go back
to '89 and '90, there was a lot of things stacked against us, but
the driving force for me in those hard times was the future. No
matter how bleak it got, I could look to our future, and that
carried me through dark days like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones didn't continue on that theme, but his point was obvious.
The future is gone. Jerry now lives in a football world of
what's-happening-right-now. Like Sunday in the Arizona desert where
two desperate teams meet. Look beyond right now, and Jones is
staring into football darkness. There's no wiggle room with the cap
and there's not even a first-round draft pick next June.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, Valley Ranch loyalists swear by and stand
by Jones. The bleaker the situation, they say, the stronger and
more supportive Jones becomes.
</P>
<P>
   In war, that's the sign of a good leader. In football, that's
the sign of a good owner. Outside of Valley Ranch walls, however,
there's been 12 years of local debate about whether Jones is
qualified to be called either.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a popularity contest among the masses, even a
``stuffed'' ballot box might not be enough to give Jones a 50-50
split. But if it's a crisis, please be advised that Jerry is the
first guy you'd probably want to call.
</P>
<P>
   Even a longtime critic can identify and respect the obvious.
Those who don't or won't, you can put them in the uninformed
category.
</P>
<P>
   But now what, Jerry?
</P>
<P>
   With past problems for the Cowboys, Jones has always attacked
with brain-power, elbow grease and money. He will rarely come up
short in any of those areas. But as of last Sunday at Texas
Stadium, Jones has also never come up against what he now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been left shaken,'' he said of the season's first week.
``It causes you to pull out your checklist and begin
second-guessing yourself on everything you've done. But I do know
there's a difference in being knocked down, and also being able to
deal with it. Our next step is to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, he could slip down to Houston and trick Bob
McNair into ...
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, and also deal with this:
</P>
<P>
   Houston is now better off in football. nn

WOODS IS OUT TO CONQUER ANOTHER COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario _ Tiger Woods made plenty of birdies Saturday,
but he had plenty of company on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   With an eight-under-par 64, including six birdies and an eagle,
Woods moved into a first-place tie with Grant Waite heading into
Sunday's final round of the Bell Canadian Open. Woods and Waite
were both 15 under par (201) for the tournament, a stroke ahead of
Stephen Ames and J.L. Lewis, who were tied for third at 14 under.
</P>
<P>
   But there were 20 players at nine under or better, meaning the
final round could be a wide-open shootout, particularly if
conditions remain near perfect for scoring. With the greens
softened by Friday's rain, and with many of the par-5 holes playing
downwind, players fired at the pins Saturday as if taking target
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ames shot a nine-under-par 63, nearly tying the course record of
62 at Glen Abbey Golf Club held by Leonard Thompson (1981), Andy
Bean (1983) and Greg Norman (1986). Thirty-five of the 73 players
broke 70, and if they were not making birdies, they were losing
ground, like Sergio Garcia, who shot 70 and was 10 under for the
tournament, or Davis Love III, who shot 71 playing with Woods,
leaving Love at eight under, seven strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   So with 18 holes left, it was difficult not to like Woods'
chances. He has won 19 consecutive PGA Tour events when he has held
or shared the lead after three rounds. He has won five of his last
seven starts, including three major championships.
</P>
<P>
   With eight victories this year, and with many of Woods' pursuers
unaccustomed to being in contention, Woods has an excellent chance
to join Lee Trevino (1971) as the only players to win the United
States Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same
year. It would be another milestone in an incredible year for
Woods. But after watching so many players shoot low scores today,
Woods was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those guys haven't won many tournaments, but you
never know,'' he said. ``If conditions remain the same, you're
going to have to make birdies to win.''

   Making birdies was not a problem for the leaders Saturday. Woods
started his day well, making birdies on two of the first three
holes, followed by another birdie at No. 8 that came in most
unusual fashion. Woods hit a wild tee shot into the gallery right
of the fairway. His ball bounced off the head of a spectator,
Michael Donley of Ontario, and ricocheted 40 feet left, back into
the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods walked over to check on Donley, who was not bleeding and
who told Woods that he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt bad for him,'' Woods said. ``When I first got over
there, he didn't seem like he was all there. That's
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods took advantage of the favorable head bounce, hitting
his approach shot 3 feet from the pin to set up an easy birdie.
After birdies on Nos.11 and 13, Woods reached his favorite stretch,
the final four holes. On Friday, Woods had a remarkable
birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle stretch from No. 15 through No.18.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was not as good, but it was not bad. Woods birdied the
par-3 No.15 again, making a 12-foot putt, then he made eagle again
at the par-5 No.16, reaching the green in two shots and sinking a
15-foot putt. But at the par-4 No.17, Woods settled for par, and he
also made par at the par-5 finishing hole. Woods' second shot at
No.18 went into a greenside bunker, then Woods made a mistake,
flubbing his next shot and leaving the ball in the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get too cute with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods then got up and down from the bunker for par, but he was
forced to share the lead with Waite, who started the day with a
one-stroke lead and who managed to shoot 68 Saturday despite
struggling on the front nine. A native of New Zealand, Waite has
not won on tour since 1993, and he has never played with Woods in
the final round of a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I played with Tiger was when he was 17 years
old, when I could beat him,'' Waite said. ``I can't hit the shots
he hits, but Bob May proved at the PGA that it doesn't matter who
you are, if you post a good score, he'll have to play well to beat
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ames said there were no hard feelings between himself
and Woods after an incident this spring. Ames was quoted as saying
that Woods thought he was bigger than the tour, but Ames said he
was misquoted, and he apologized to Woods months ago. ``I sent him
a letter and I apologized to him in Dallas,'' said Ames, who could
have tied the course record had he birdied No. 18. ``I don't think
we're going to have our boxing gloves on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had again accomplished what he wanted: putting himself
in position to win. Almost any player would be thrilled to win
three national Opens in a career. But Woods has a chance to win
three in one year.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore leads in tight race, poll shows
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from

<P>
   Democrat Al Gore was leading 49 percent to 41 percent over
Republican George W. Bush in a Newsweek poll of likely voters
released Saturday. Gore was supported by 85 percent of Democrats
and 18 percent of Republicans. Bush had the support of 75 percent
of Republicans and 8 percent of Democrats. Bush had a 43-34 edge
among independents. The poll of 595 likely voters taken late last
week has an error margin of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state polls show: the race was virtually deadlocked
in New Hampshire; Gore maintains a slim lead in Illinois, and Bush
still has a 23-point lead in Texas. The state-by-state battle for
electoral votes is crucial because the winning candidate has to win
enough states to collect 270 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his son's recent slide in the polls, former President
George Bush said the younger Bush shouldn't worry. ``I'm the living
expert on polls,'' the elder Bush said Friday at a Republican
National Committee luncheon in Norfolk, Va. ``They can go up and
they can go down. I don't think anybody had more of a roller
coaster ride than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE BACK ON THE BUS
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Al Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman will cross
Ohio in matching yellow school buses on Tuesday, pushing a
back-to-school campaign message amidst television appearances and
nearly $10 million in fund raising efforts in the swing state. On
Saturday, Cincinnati supporters painted signs for what the
Democrats are dubbing their ``On the Road to an A+ Education'' tour
that takes off from a suburban Dayton middle school and ends at a
Cincinnati community college.
</P>
<P>
   GORE IN THE MONEY RACE
</P>
<P>
   Gore might be talking about education by day, but he will be
raising money by night this week as he combs the Northeast corridor
for cash. Gore will appear on two television talk shows _ Oprah
Winfrey on Monday in Chicago and David Letterman on Thursday in New
York. He also has fund-raisers in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Boston
on Wednesday and New York on Thursday that should raise at least $6
million. The fund raising comes as Democrats lag in the money
chase. Gov. George W. Bush has raised nearly $100 million, and
spent a record $93 million through the end of July _ more than
double Gore's expenditures. According to the Center for Public
Integrity, from January 1999 through May 31, 2000, Gore raised
$47.7 million, spent $39 million and had $8.2 million in cash. Bush
raised $87.5 million, spent $79.5 million and had $7.1 million on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also will try to raise $1.5 million in a marathon of
four fund raisers on Monday in Bush's home state of Texas,
including a stop in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL PLEA SENT ON BEHALF OF YELLOW DOGS
</P>
<P>
   Fearing trouble raising a $1 million goal during Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's visit to Austin on Monday, John Thornton, general
partner at Austin Ventures and one of the hosts of a
$2,500-per-plate lunch with Lieberman, has blanketed the local
technology community with an e-mail asking for support. ``If you
are, shall we say, unsympathetic with the cause, have a good
chuckle at how hard we Yellow Dogs are having to paddle to stay in
the race with George W.'s Texas juggernaut,'' Thornton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN ENTERS BUDGET FRAY
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John McCain, recruited by GOP leaders for their
budget fight with the White House, asked Americans to vote out any
lawmaker who would undermine the nation's surplus with wasteful
spending. In the GOP's weekly radio address on Saturday, the former
presidential hopeful expressed suspicions that both parties might
share guilt by the time this year's budget is enacted. He had
especially harsh words for President Clinton. ``The president is a
charming fellow, and a heck of a salesman,'' McCain said. ``But I
wouldn't buy a used car from him if I were you.'' Such rhetoric is
what Republican leaders had in mind when they talked McCain into
taking a more visible role in the GOP budget campaign, exploiting
broad voter appeal McCain exhibited in the Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   NADER ADVOCATES LEGALIZING MARIJUANA
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader on Friday
advocated the legalization of marijuana as part of an overhaul of
the nation's ``self-defeating and antiquated drug laws.'' Nader
joined with New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, in
criticizing the nation's ``war on drugs'' as a failed policy for
fighting drug use. Nader supports lifting criminal sanctions for
marijuana possession. For other drugs, such as heroin, he advocated
further treatment and prevention programs. Bush and Gore have
opposed legalizing marijuana.

HOUSTON TEXANS, NOT DALLAS COWBOYS, LIVE IN THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
Houston Texans, not Dallas Cowboys, live in the future 
Those sweaty people down in Houston always have wanted to be us.
Don't expect an admission on this, but their envy has been thicker
than their smog. It's mainly about football, but overall, it's the
jock kingdom in general. Houston never has been able to come close
to us.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except, at the moment, I'm picking up a faint radio signal from
outer space. There's a lot of static, but I recognize that voice.
It's our nationally famous football bidnessman. It's Jerry, and
he's giving an urgent mayday call:
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, we've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we ever. Don't spread this around, but Houston just got the
jump on us in football. Houston, with an NFL team that doesn't even
begin play until 2002, is currently situated exactly where Mr.
Jones would kill to be.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the newly named Texans is Bob McNair, who could buy
and sell downtown Dallas if he so desired. But what Jerry would
like at the moment is a mere swap with Bob.
</P>
<P>
   It's a guarantee that right here, right now, Jones would trade
his 53 Cowboys, and throw in a Stephen to be named later, in
exchange for the Texans, a team with no players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the second Jerry made that proposal, McNair's laugh would be
heard all the way to Port Arthur. McNair ain't no fool. He knows
he's got exactly what Jerry wants, and exactly what Jerry might
never have up here:
</P>
<P>
   A new space-age stadium and a team with nary a salary cap
headache.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, we do have a problem. And ``problem'' is a tad mild.
What Jerry currently has, and privately he knows it, is a potential
football disaster. The Cowboys' salary cap, which seemed at least
under control, became an instant mushroom cloud hanging over Valley
Ranch after what happened in the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway was a cap-buster even in good health. His $13
million signing bonus last spring represented a large gamble for
Jones. Now the receiver expected to put the get-up-and-go back in
the offense is lost for the season with a wrecked knee. Even worse,
quarterback Troy Aikman's future is in doubt due to a mushy brain.
One more hit ...
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' cap has been structured around Aikman. If he
retires, the cap crumbles, 49ers-like. Second-guess the Jones
financial planning all you want, but Jerry played a very
high-stakes dice game here. Look closely _ are the bones now
showing a pair of snake-like eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an awful on-the-field performance against the Eagles,
and this week from hell has been unprecedented for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I'm checking my hole card more than anytime
since I've been involved,'' Jones said at mid-week. ``You go back
to '89 and '90, there was a lot of things stacked against us, but
the driving force for me in those hard times was the future. No
matter how bleak it got, I could look to our future, and that
carried me through dark days like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones didn't continue on that theme, but his point was obvious.
The future is gone. Jerry now lives in a football world of
what's-happening-right-now. Like today in the Arizona desert where
two desperate teams meet. Look beyond right now, and Jones is
staring into football darkness. There's no wiggle room with the cap
and there's not even a first-round draft pick next year.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, Valley Ranch loyalists swear by and stand
by Jones. The bleaker the situation, they say, the stronger and
more supportive Jones becomes.
</P>
<P>
   In war, that's the sign of a good leader. In football, that's
the sign of a good owner. Outside of Valley Ranch walls, however,
there's been 12 years of local debate about whether Jones is
qualified to be called either.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a popularity contest among the masses, even a
``stuffed'' ballot box might not be enough to give Jones a 50-50
split. But if it's a crisis, please be advised that Jerry is the
first guy you'd probably want to call.
</P>
<P>
   Even a longtime critic can identify and respect the obvious.
Those who don't or won't, you can put them in the uninformed
category.
</P>
<P>
   But now what, Jerry?
</P>
<P>
   With past problems for the Cowboys, Jones has always attacked
with brain-power, elbow grease and money. He will rarely come up
short in any of those areas. But as of last Sunday at Texas
Stadium, Jones has also never come up against what he now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been left shaken,'' he said of the season's first week.
``It causes you to pull out your checklist and begin
second-guessing yourself on everything you've done. But I do know
there's a difference in being knocked down, and also being able to
deal with it. Our next step is to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, he could slip down to Houston and trick Bob
McNair into ...
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, and also deal with this:
</P>
<P>
   Houston is now better off in football. nn

SAMPRAS AWAITS ANOTHER `YOUNG GUN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Ten years ago, a wide-eyed, 19-year-old
youngster beat some of the best veteran players of the day to win
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Pete Sampras made sure history wouldn't repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who won the first of his record 13 Grand Slam
tournaments in 1990, made sure 19-year-old Lleyton Hewitt wouldn't
win his first at this year's Open with a 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5)
victory in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras advanced to the final against another one of the tour's
young guns, Marat Safin, who defeated veteran Todd Martin, 6-3, 7-6
(4), 7-6 (1). The 20-year-old Russian advanced to the final of a
Grand Slam event for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be in the final, but something is missing,'' he
said. ``I want to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Hewitt, but he faced the same difficulty Safin will
experience Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The two youngsters are considered the future of the game, but
Sampras remains the best in the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-nine is still pretty young,'' Sampras said. ``Tennis
players historically are done at 29, 30, but I feel like I've got
the game that I can play for as long as I want because of my serve.
You can still do well in majors. It can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras not only still has considerable skills, but he also has
a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years I've been through a lot of wars out
there, a lot of battles, I've won a lot of big matches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was the difference against Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   The young Australian played Sampras to a virtual statistical
standstill, winning 116 points to his opponent's 126. But the 10
points that were the difference were the big points, and that is
where the veteran prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest point might have been in the first set tiebreaker.
Hewitt was up, 7-6, and serving for the set. He had Sampras on the
move and had an excellent chance to put him away with a forehand
winner, but instead he hit it wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've worked so hard for that set, and to have the point set
up and make an easy error, you feel frustrated,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations built when he was broken for a 4-3 lead in the
second set, and they spiked in the final tiebreaker when Sampras
won the final three points with a forehand volley, an overhead he
took out of the air from deep in the court, and a big forehand into
the corner that Hewitt couldn't get back over the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chances today and didn't capitalize, but Pete played
a great match,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Experience didn't help Martin against Safin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the big points better than me, and he played the
little points better than me,'' Martin said. ``I was fighting an
uphill battle all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin seemed oblivious to the fact that he was in the semifinals
of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time. He ignored the
pressure, and ignored the New York crowd that was solidly behind
Martin, so much so that they cheered the Russian's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive to me that somebody can ignore what the
environment is, what the situation is, so well,'' Martin said. ``He
plays the first point of the match as loose as the last point of
the match, break-points as loose as he plays 40-love points.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin intends to be just as loose Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have enough experience not to be very nervous in the
final,'' Safin said. ``I hope I will not be. But I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to put him under pressure from the first point, to
return his serve, run for the balls even if I can't get them, to
show the guy that I'm going to fight for it. I don't want to make
him Christmas presents. It's very important he knows that I'm going
to be there from the first point until the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin was able to do that last month in the quarterfinals of the
Canadian Open, when he defeated Sampras in a third-set tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hewitt discovered Saturday, Sampras is much tougher in
the final weekend of a Grand Slam event.

AT LAST, JONES ' GOLDEN MOMENT IS HERE 
(FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Marion Jones tells the story, she was an 8-year-old in
Southern California when the Olympics first entered her head like a
song that would not leave. Her family drove to see the Olympic
torch as the relay made its way to the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles. At home that same night, she went into her room and wrote
``I want to be an Olympic champion'' on a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia, Jones is attempting to become the first woman to win
five gold medals in track and field at the same Olympics. Fanny
Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands won four at the 1948 London Games.
Paavo Nurmi, the great Finn, won five golds in the men's
competition in the 1924 Paris Games, including the 1,500 and 5,000
meters within an hour, but three of his victories came in team and
cross-country events that have since been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games will run from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1, early
spring in the Southern Hemisphere. While swimming will dominate the
first week of competition, and the Australian teen-age sensation
Ian Thorpe is expected to become a huge international star, Jones'
quest to win five gold medals will play like a miniseries on NBC
during the second week of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her attempt will be as difficult as it is unprecedented. While
Jones has the fastest time in the world this year at 100 meters
(10.78 seconds) and 200 meters (21.94), she has only the
fourth-best long jump (23 feet { inch), a full 11 inches short of
her career best. Her form is awkward and her jumping has been
erratic. At a meet in Brussels against the top Olympic contenders
on Aug. 25, Jones finished fifth, failing to reach even 22 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And, with fierce international competition and the risk of baton
exchanges on the 400-meter and 1,600-meter relays, there is no
certainty that the Americans will win gold medals. Without Jones,
the United States finished fourth in the 400 relay at the 1999
world track and field championships and second in the 1,600-meter
relay, where Germany and Russia are considered the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has run only one 400-meter race this season _ her time of
49.59 seconds would have won the 1999 world championships _ but she
has not trained regularly for the event since May.
</P>
<P>
   The cold, windy weather that is expected in Sydney could also
play havoc with the results. Fatigue and injuries could be
disruptive through four rounds apiece of the 100 and the 200. A
year ago, Jones hurt her knee with a clumsy landing in the long
jump and later pulled up with back spasms during the semifinals of
the 200 meters at the world championships. Many track people
believe her faulty jumping technique may have contributed to the
back spasms, although Jones strongly disputes that the two were
related.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones has not lost a sprint final since Sept. 6, 1997,
and her charismatic, resourceful presence lends wondrous
possibility to her attempt to win five gold medals in Sydney. She
has assumed the mantle from the retired Jackie Joyner-Kersee as the
most versatile female athlete in the country. Like Joyner-Kersee,
Jones also excelled at basketball. As a freshman point guard, she
guided the University of North Carolina to a national collegiate
championship in 1994, leading the swiftest fast break in the
history of women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This Olympic season, Jones has been the focus of a corporate
full-court press that is unparalleled for a female athlete heading
into the Summer Games. Figure skaters almost always sparkle as the
brightest stars in the constellation of winter athletes. In the
summer, many women have emerged as the most compelling performers _
from Mildred ``Babe'' Didrickson to Blankers-Koen to Olga Korbut to
Nadia Comaneci _ but never has a female athlete provided the
dominant story line, or been so heavily promoted, in advance of the
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jones' appeal is that her husband, C.J. Hunter, is the
world champion in the shot put. They could become the first married
couple to win his and her gold medals at one Olympics since Emil
Zatopek won the 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and the marathon, and
Dana Zatopek won the javelin at the 1952 Helsinki Games. But
Hunter's participation is now in question after recent knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is Jones' unique attempt to win five golds, not her
gold wedding band, that has driven promotional campaigns by NBC,
Nike, Gatorade, Panasonic, General Motors, AT&AMP;T, TAG Heuer watches
and Kellogg's Frosted Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has already received more attention in terms of national
television advertising campaigns than any athlete in history, more
than Michael Jordan at one time,'' said Craig Masback, the chief
executive officer of the U.S. track and field federation, the
sport's national governing body. ``At least five national
television campaigns. NBC has said her story will be a nightly soap
opera. This is a real athletic challenge, not some sort of hype. To
achieve it would be an extremely meaningful athletic event, in the
way that Tiger Woods winning three straight majors is a real
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Star's Boundless Possibilities  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five gold medals would most likely give Jones the earning power
of Mia Hamm, the soccer star, but would not put her in the category
of the world's top female tennis players, said Bob Williams,
president of the Chicago-based Burns Sports, which matches athletes
with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is limited because track and field registers on the U.S.
public radar only once every four years during the Olympics,
Williams said. But, given the singularity of her potential
accomplishment, the universality of her sport and the potential
longevity of her Olympic career, Masback believes that Jones could
become the first female athlete to truly transcend sport
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24, and earning an estimated several million dollars a
year, Jones could compete in the Olympics through 2008, by which
time she could surpass Nurmi's 10 career gold medals and the nine
won by Carl Lewis. Sylvia Hatchell, who coaches women's basketball
at North Carolina, has said that Jones could compete in two
Olympics as a track athlete and a third in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has also mentioned the possibility of playing eventually
in the WNBA, which could put her in the same rarefied class as
Didrickson, who dominated track and field and the women's golf
circuit in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``There is no context to this, because no one has ever tried
it,'' Masback said of Jones. ``How many countries participated in
the 1,500 and 5,000 when Nurmi won? If it was more than 15 or 20,
I'd be surprised. There is a different level of competition now. If
there are fewer than 75 countries participating in the women's 100
meters, I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Tennis is an international sport, but how many
countries are serious contenders? Track and field is truly the
international sport for women. Sri Lanka wins medals. Kenya wins
medals. Arab women are winning Olympic titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing against Mia Hamm, she's a great athlete, but you can't
transcend your sport internationally if your sport isn't practiced
and respected internationally. Marion has got a unique opportunity
to transcend sport as Pele, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan have.
There's time to ultimately achieve that. But it's something you've
got to do over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last woman to receive this kind of feverish attention before
a Summer Games was Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948,
according to Bud Greenspan, the Olympic documentarian. But, he
said, journalists were writing about the Dutch star for entirely
different reasons, mortified that a mother of two would leave her
children at home to compete in something as sweaty as track and
field.

<P>
   ``I was 30 and people said I was too old, that it was not good
to be running if you had a baby, that you should do the
housekeeping rather than running in shorts in a stadium,''
Blankers-Koen, still spry at 82, said in an interview. ``But I was
not listening to them. I did what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At those London Games, Blankers-Koen won the 100, 200, 80-meter
hurdles and the 400-meter relay and leaped significant cultural
barriers. She could easily have won five gold medals, but she
skipped the long jump at which she held the world record, because
of scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets,'' Blankers-Koen said last month. She met
Jones for the first time last summer in Monte Carlo, Monaco, and
verbally passed the torch of Olympic achievement, saying, ``If you
stay fit, you can win five gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so fast, so good running in the last meters of a
race,'' Blankers-Koen said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Motivated by Doubters and Critics  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in this day, though, women are still facing skepticism from
those who would define their ambitions for them. Jones has
constantly fielded questions about why she has not dropped the long
jump, given her unreliable form.
</P>
<P>
   The mere announcement that she intended to win five gold medals
seemed too bold and off-putting to some who were threatened by, or
dismissive of, the accomplishments of female athletes. But Jones
has used the doubts and criticisms for motivation. Like
Blankers-Koen, she has a kind of necessary audaciousness to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do something that's never been done,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jones wants to be world renowned because she was
threatened with personal anonymity as a girl, having been ignored
by her father, who was divorced from her mother and was seldom in
her life, skipping her high school graduation and important moments
in her sports career.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no real desperation in her speed. She has been fast
for as long as she can remember, beating boys up and down the block
in Palmdale, Calif., catching them easily in games of tag. Her
brother Albert, five years older, always chose her for pick-up
games, Jones said, ``not because I was his little sister, but
because I could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched on television as the 1984 Summer Games unfolded
in nearby Los Angeles, Jones said, ``When I saw athletes cross the
finish line and, excitement cross their faces, I knew I wanted to
experience that.'' A year later, as a 9-year-old, she wrote in a
class paper, ``I like to run because I can beat almost everyone at
my school.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her senior year of high school, Jones qualified for the
1992 Olympic team on the 400-meter relay, having finished fourth at
the Olympic trials at 200 meters. She declined to participate in
the Barcelona Games, however. She said she wanted her first gold
medal to come in an individual event, ``something I sweated for and
earned.'' Her mother, Marion Toler, has said that she did not allow
Jones to compete because her grades had not been sufficient during
her junior year. Instead, Jones stayed home and took a math class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult as a 15- or 16-year-old, when you have a
chance to go to the Olympics and your friends are going to the
pool,'' Jones said. ``But I have no regrets. I know we made the
right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She never lost a high school race after her freshman year. Her
track career, however, was nearly undermined, perhaps forever,
during her senior year. Jones faced a four-year ban from
competition for failing to show up to take a mandatory urine test
for performance-enhancing drugs. Her mother hired the lawyer
Johnnie Cochran, who successfully argued to track officials that
Jones' coach had not received notification of the test until after
it had been scheduled. The ban was not enforced.
</P>
<P>
   She got an athletic scholarship to the University of North
Carolina, where her speed was most evident on the basketball court,
not the track. Jones had averaged 22.8 points a game as a high
school senior and was named the California player of the year. Her
first year in college, she waved the checkered flag as the Tar
Heels drag-raced to a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks thought I had thrown track out of the window,''
Jones said. ``I wanted to fulfill my dream playing ball. I had
enormous passion for the game. When I was 50 or 60, sitting on the
porch drinking lemonade, I didn't want to say, `Would have, could
have.' I'm glad I did it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Hatchell, the North Carolina basketball coach, said that Jones
was ``the most complete athlete I have ever coached.'' But
basketball also left Jones with a broken bone in her left foot,
ending any chance of sprinting and long-jumping at the 1996 Summer
Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tension also developed between Hatchell and Jones over the
direction of her career and her relationship with Hunter, who grew
up in Hyde Park, N.Y., and who became an assistant track coach at
North Carolina in 1995. Jones and Hunter, who was separated from
his wife and had two young children, began dating in early 1996, in
violation of university policy, which prohibited coaches from
dating athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The two tried to keep their relationship quiet, Jones said, but
it became public. She said that North Carolina's head track coach,
Dennis Craddock, called Hunter into a meeting and told him,
``Either you quit or we have to let you go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no decision for C.J.,'' Jones said. ``He quit the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter finished seventh in the shot-put at the Atlanta Olympics,
as Jones sat in the stands and watched. Her own Olympic hopes,
thwarted twice already, began to stir again. In the spring of 1997,
as she prepared to graduate from North Carolina, Jones decided to
become a professional track athlete, even though she had a year of
basketball eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that Hatchell tried to discourage her from resuming
her track career, while Hatchell has said that there was no
arm-twisting. In April 1997, the coach said, Jones told her, ``I
want to go out and be the fastest woman in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the middle of June, she was,'' Hatchell said. ``When Marion
tells you something, you can go ahead and put your money in the
bank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No Thanks to All the Advice  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After having been away from track for two years, Jones won the
100 meters at the 1997 world championships in Athens. A year later,
she long-jumped 23-11} and won 35 of the 36 sprint and jumping
competitions that she entered. That year, she ran the 100 in 10.65
and the 200 in 21.62. Only Florence Griffith-Joyner had run faster
in either event. The Sydney Olympics were still two years away, but
the chance of winning five gold medals became a tantalizing
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, it became apparent that the achievement would
be as arduous as it would be astonishing. Her long-jumping
suffered, and after she pulled up with an injured back at the 1999
world championships in Seville, Spain, Jones left without speaking
to anyone, not even to officials from USA Track &AMP; Field, to explain
what caused the injury. It seemed curious, considering that she has
a degree in communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is a gruff person who says, if it were up to him, he
would do no interviews, answer no questions, ``just go to meets and
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   His defensiveness contributed to Jones' silence about Seville
until this past spring. It was a huge public relations gaffe, and
evidence that the pressure to win five gold medals might have been
growing too burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the long jump, including the world record-holder,
Mike Powell, have also said that Hunter has rebuffed efforts from
those who would offer advice to Jones. She has said that she will
remain loyal to her coach, Trevor Graham, who, in turn, has accused
Powell and others of being publicity hounds. She has decided to
rely on her speed instead of refining her technique, but she has
struggled to transform that speed into consistent jumping.
</P>
<P>
   She fouls often, and her results have varied wildly from meet to
meet. Already Jones has lost four times in the event this season.
At the Olympic trials in July, she nearly failed to qualify for the
last three jumps of the competition, then won with her seasonal
best of 23-{. In contrast, Lewis needed only two of six allotted
jumps on his way to winning four gold medals at the 1984 Summer
Games, saving his body from the jolt of a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to watch,'' Powell said of Jones' jumping. ``She
should be jumping 24 feet consistently with her speed. Right now,
it's a crapshoot with her at the Games. She's talented enough to
jump 24 feet and win the gold. Carl didn't have to worry about the
long jump. He knew he could win with one jump. With Marion, it's
`Am I going to qualify for the finals or win the gold?'''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jones has been much more accessible, giving numerous
interviews, patiently answering the same questions again and again.
She is smart and engaging, and she scored points for her Nike
commercials, taking on such subjects as equal pay for women,
increased violence committed by athletes, and the disparity in
criticism of predominantly black athletes who leave school early to
play professional basketball and football and predominantly white
athletes who leave early to play baseball, hockey and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Even with serious questions about the long jump at the Olympics,
she has said repeatedly, she has no intention of taking home silver
or bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been many years since I dreamed about making my first
Olympic team, and I wrote on my chalkboard that I wanted to be an
Olympic champion,'' Jones said. ``Now that I am 24 and have the
chance to do it, I'm not going to let it slip through my fingers.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ARE THESE THE LAST SUMMER GAMES?  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This is an awesome task for the athletes.
They must save the Olympic movement. They must wrest the focus back
from the sleaze merchants who connived under the cover of the five
rings.
</P>
<P>
   They must leap over time zones, break down the artificiality of
the taped telecasts, get past the greed and the stuffiness of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dwell on the Australian big shot who foisted his own child
on the torch procession, just because he had the power to do it.
Try not to obsess on the committee that could not find one woman on
this planet to nominate for the next generation of IOC delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks belong to the athletes, now arriving in
Australia from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting any vestigial dignity of the Olympics is
particularly important back in the United States, which presumably
still exists through the numbing maze of international datelines
and jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dollarland are affluent sponsors who will watch
carefully to see if they are besmirched, plus the massive potential
television audience, 15 to 18 time zones behind Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes must be compelling enough to get Americans into
their easy chairs in prime time to watch events that were held
hours, days, maybe even weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Over here, the athletes will exist in real time. Cathy Freeman,
the Aboriginal runner, has so much weight on her shoulders, it will
be a miracle if she can push off at the start line. But she must.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's people will be demonstrating against two centuries of
overt racial discrimination. She can touch millions, remind them
there are always men of money and power who try to possess a people
or an event, but sometimes you have to take it back.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes must revalidate the Olympic movement. All over the
world, the Olympic Games are a biennial apparition, materializing
out of the mists like Brigadoon.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the world gathers in front of the ubiquitous
television to watch somebody scoring a goal every minute of every
day, and now basketball is the hot sport, Bulls shirts everywhere,
and cricket and Tiger madness and auto racing and hockey and
baseball _ big arenas, big cable, big Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics try to glom onto some of these big sports, inviting
them into the big tent, but even the imported superstars cannot
hide the odor of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lusting for a Nobel Prize, Juan Antonio Samaranch persistently
invokes the aura of ``the children of the world'' whenever he opens
and closes the Games. Now the children and the adults have seen the
spectacle of IOC delegates arriving in Utah with gunnysacks, and
businessmen from that smug little corner of the world instinctively
filling those sacks with goodies.
</P>
<P>
   The world has seen Australian Olympic officials instinctively
channel the best tickets to their pals, just the way the previous
bunch instinctively did in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot to ask of the athletes, but Popov, the swimmer man,
and Fernandez, the softball pitcher, must remind the world that
sport, when it is clean and honest, is one of the world's more
compelling sights.
</P>
<P>
   This is not like a World Cup of soccer or even our local
phenomenon, the Super Bowl of American football, where the majority
of fans know the inside stories.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics just drop in our laps, and suddenly we are being
asked to care about this stuff in a very short time. Now the
question must be asked: What if nobody cares anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the Games is still the athletes who train for
little money, who regard these Games as their highest athletic
calling. The Dream Teams and the tennis stars are imported window
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to television to convey not only the humanity but also
the urgency, to bring back the action to the Games. This is not an
easy task. In recent Olympic Games, even with time zones on their
side, the networks have resorted to the feature approach _ the
private glimpse, the families, the injuries, the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the soap operas and the sonorous narration, however, has
been the spontaneity of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The canned approach may not work anymore because television has
spewed forth an inordinate amount of personal stuff: Exhibitionists
bludgeoning each other on the Springer show, egomaniacs voting each
other off the island on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans who seem to enjoy the Olympics the most live near
the Canadian border. People in Buffalo and Detroit and Seattle rave
about the CBC coverage _ live events, a more worldly view.
</P>
<P>
   This year NBC will show 161{ hours on the main network, plus
another 276 hours on CNBC and MSNBC on cable _ none of it live,
mind you, but nevertheless whole swatches of field hockey and
kayaking and high jumping and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   NBC promises us the youth, the health, the skills, the spirit,
the zeal, the impromptu glory of live sport. (With any luck at all,
the chemical enhancement of blood and muscle will not overwhelm the
Games.)
</P>
<P>
   After observing the connivers and the freeloaders of the IOC,
the world may be ready for some athletic competition. Or maybe the
world is ready for soccer season and football season and the
baseball pennant races.
</P>
<P>
   If the athletes come across as arrogant and corrupt and drug
infested or even just insignificant, they fall to the level of the
Olympic leaders, and maybe the whole pretentious ship goes down.

DREAM OF TRAITHLON TURNS INTO REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Lee Barnathan  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Mark Allen remembers meeting Jack Caress and how
Caress _ a native Angeleno, lover of all things Los Angeles and all
things triathlon _ told of his dream for his city to host a
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I called him a nutty professor, that would be kind of
harsh,'' said Allen, a retired professional triathlete who will be
NBC's Olympic triathlon commentator. ``He's kind of a dreamer. He's
got big plans and big dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Caress, with excitement in his eyes, told of a day there would
not only be a triathlon here, it would take the participants on a
whirlwind tour of some of the city's famous spots _ as the City of
Los Angeles Marathon does.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year journey of love, frustration and caressing
the process through the political structure, Caress has brought the
first City of Los Angeles Triathlon into being. It goes off today
at 9 a.m. (6:30 start for amateurs) with a .9-mile swim at Venice
Beach, followed by a 24-mile bike ride across the Westside and
Hollywood to Downtown, and a 10-kilometer run through parts of
Downtown and Elysian Park.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a field some say is stronger than the Olympic
triathlon that goes off this week in Sydney. Australian Chris
McCormack, who didn't make his country's team because he objected
to some of the bicycle rules, is a favorite. So is two-time world
champion Spencer Smith of Great Britain and Belgian Luc Van Lierde,
who has won the holy grail of triathlons, the Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, American Barb Lindquist, who missed the
Olympics because of a bad day at the Trials, is the favorite. But
watch for Australia's Jackie Gallagher, the 1996 world champion;
Heather Fuhr of Canada, who won the 1997 Ironman, and Karen Smyers,
who has overcome cancer and is the only triathlete to win both the
world championship and the Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   Allen says the field also is a tribute to Caress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone has guts to go for it,'' Allen said. ``He must
have put magic dust on L.A., because it doesn't take this short of
time (to put on one).''
</P>
<P>
   Caress, born in South Central, happened on triathlons while at
UC Irvine on a golf scholarship. A friend claimed golfers aren't
real athletes, so Caress proved him wrong by competing in the most
extreme sport he could find. He entered a triathlon in Newport
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While racing in it, Caress fell in love with the camaraderie _
so many people rooted for complete strangers, and the winners
waited at the finish line for other finishers. Plus, he enjoyed
competing in three sports, knowing there's always some aspect to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   It was that love of triathlons that eventually landed Caress a
job putting on the Cleveland triathlon. Under Caress, Cleveland
hosted the World Championship in 1993. That got Caress thinking:
Why not in L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense not to have one,'' Caress said. ``The
biggest races are in Chicago and Cleveland, but most participants
are from the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired of people bagging on L.A. I don't think they
understand it,'' Caress said. ``I don't think they've seen it. It's
time it has a better reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Caress figured the best way to accomplish that was to plan a
course that passed numerous landmarks: Muscle Beach, Hollywood
Boulevard, the La Brea Tar Pits, Dodger Stadium and the Staples
Center are five.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wanted to highlight lesser-known points, such as the
Angels Point Trail in Elysian Park. On a clear day, a hiker gets a
panoramic view of the downtown skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about the course,'' he said, ``is to do a race in
Los Angeles, Los Angeles is so spread out, you can't have a race
that starts and finishes in the same spot. We wanted a race for
(out-of-state racers). You say, 'Venice Beach, Staples Center,
Hollywood Boulevard, Dodger Stadium,' people say, 'I want to see
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the first race, Caress knows the course is a
success. He recently took 30 people through the bike and running
portions, with two major results:
</P>
<P>
   First, he overheard one man telling another man, ``I felt like I
just went through 80 countries.'' To which Caress said, ``You
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, an attorney congratulated Caress on the course with
applause. Suddenly, 30 people clapped.
</P>
<P>
   For Caress, it was a dream come true.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: BASEBALL  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Olympic officials determined that professionals would be
allowed to play baseball at the Sydney Games, there was talk of an
U.S. dream team, with visions of Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire
swinging away. Wrong. September is for pennant races stateside.
</P>
<P>
   The next idea was for an older, less dreamy team of sorts _ Wade
Boggs, Tim Raines and Chili Davis swinging out of retirement. Wrong
again. When USA Baseball picked its team last month, the only
prominent name was the manager, Tommy Lasorda. The rest were
largely unknown minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, recognized professionalism will change the face of the
competition. The Americans, Australians, Japanese and Koreans will
now have strong clubs with lineups gleaned from their professional
leagues, teams good enough to challenge Cuba, the longtime
powerhouse. The open era in Olympic baseball may not have yielded a
dream team, but it may foster baseball's most competitive, truly
worldwide series.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The designated hitter is used. Aluminum bats are now prohibited.
There is a mercy rule: Any team up by 10 or more runs after seven
innings is declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Each of the eight teams plays every other team once. The top
four advance to the semifinals. Winners meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Think about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team with Lasorda as
coach Herb Brooks. That is the approach of the Americans, who, with
an average roster age of 25, have decided to combat the experience
of the dominant Cubans with youth.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   With every country, including Cuba, many of the biggest names
are not going to Sydney. In the case of the Cuban team, there have
been defections. Pat Borders, the former Toronto Blue Jays catcher,
is the best-known U.S. player. The Australians will be led by David
Nilsson, an All-Star catcher for the Milwaukee Brewers last season.
Japan is sending eight players from its major leagues. The Cuban
third-baseman Omar Linares, long considered the best ``amateur''
player in baseball, returns for another Olympics. He will probably
be the most-feared hitter here.

   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ He had absorbed knee-wobbling hits on nearly
every play as he led ground-pounding scoring drives that were as
painful to watch for Notre Dame fans as a dentist's drill is to
hear. He displayed his sprinter's speed and vanished 62 yards and
into the end zone. So everyone, an awful lot of them in Nebraska
red, in sold-out Notre Dame Stadium knew as overtime started
Saturday that the Cornhuskers were going to win or lose with their
quarterback, Eric Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Win the No.1-ranked Huskers did, 27-23, in overtime. Thanks to
Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish had just taken a 24-21 lead after an
improbable second-half comeback when Nick Setta kicked a 29-yard
field goal. Now the Huskers were in trouble on third and 9 on their
24-yard line. Crouch had attempted only 14 passes on the day,
completing seven of them. Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie believed that
Crouch, who had already gained 99 yards on the ground, would run.
Instead, Crouch passed _ to tight end Tracey Wistrom for the 9
yards and the first down. That was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big down and it was kind of weird,'' Crouch said. ``I
read Tracey's eyes as he went inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But what he thought next was better. Nebraska I-back Dan
Alexander banged 8 more yards to the Notre Dame 7. Now 80,232
people were on their feet, and Crouch knew it was time to call his
own number. He rolled left on the option, no back trailing him, and
sprinted to the corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was over, a game for once that matched the build-up as two
storied programs played on the grounds that spawned Rockne and the
Four Horsemen and a nation-topping eight victories over No.1-ranked
teams. But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was racing through my mind,'' Crouch said after a
game in which he gained 106 yards on the ground, threw for another
103 and scored two touchdowns. ``You want to get over the goal
line. I saw daylight, the crowd was going crazy, the only option
was for me to run, and we get out of this place with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Nebraska had visited South Bend since
1947, and at least 30,000 of their red-clad fans came with them.
Though just 4,000 tickets were allotted to Nebraska fans, the
ribbons of red that bled through the crowd of 80,232 at Notre
Stadium showed that most of them found tickets at prices ranging
from $600 to $2,000. The Big Red infiltration did not go unnoticed
by the new Notre Dame athletics director, Kevin White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was colorblind,'' White said. ``I'm very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really believed overtime was in the offing when, early in
the third quarter, Alexander thundered through the Irish line and
28 yards into the end zone for a touchdown to give Nebraska a 21-7
lead. At that point, the Cornhuskers had gained 200 yards on the
ground on their way to what on any other day would be an easy
victory producing 377 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But on the ensuing kickoff, Julius Jones stirred up the echoes
of the Irish mystique, the intangible responsible for big upsets
like the 1993 victory over No.1 Florida State. He had returned a
kick 45 yards that was a shoelace tackle away from a touchdown
earlier. This time, with the same return play on, no one touched
Jones as zipped 100 yards up the left sideline for a touchdown to
narrow the score to 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a couple of blocks and that's all it takes,'' said
Jones, who also rushed for 52 yards at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   After the Notre Dame defense stalled the Cornhusker offense on
two consecutive drives, it was another return specialist time to go
to work. With 12 minutes 48 seconds left in the game, Joey
Getherall gathered Dan Hadenfeldt's punt against his chest at his
17-yard line, bolted right past Nebraska's Justin Smith and looked
like he had a pretty good return. At midfield, he turned inside
looking for a few extra yards. He not only found them, but all that
stood in the way of him and the Nebraska end zone was the punter.
Getherall feigned left, Hadenfeldt fell right and the Irish had
their second return for a touchdown in less than 10 minutes, as
well as a tie score.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Nebraska's option offense was not rolling over the
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a stretch when were moving the ball on the ground,''
Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said. ``It came and went.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, meanwhile, drove the ball 48 yards to the Nebraska
30, where they faced fourth down and a yard to go. They decided to
go for it. Quarterback Arnaz Battle had completed just three passes
all afternoon, but instead of running, the Irish and Battle tried
to hit tight end Dan O'Leary in the middle of the field. Battle's
ball sailed over his head. ``We tried to go for it all,'' Davie
said. ``We thought it was the right decision at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   By overtime, the Nebraska decision was to put the ball in
Crouch's hands _ something Solich says he will do often this season
as his Cornhuskers try to persevere all the way to the national
title game. ``Eric never gets excited,'' Solich said. ``You can
count on him to make the big play. When you put the ball in Eric's
hand down the stretch, you got a better chance of getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   He got it done. &QL;

APPLEWHITE COMES OFF BENCH TO LEAD TEXAS' ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Major Applewhite put a swift and decisive stop
to Texas' ongoing quarterback quandary, at least for one day.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned from the bench to relieve starter Chris Simms and erase
a surprising first-quarter deficit, Applewhite responded by leading
the sixth-ranked Longhorns on seven consecutive scoring drives to
turn the momentum Saturday in a 52-10 rout of Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite took the field on Texas' third possession with the
Longhorns trailing, 10-0, before a stunned crowd of 80,007 at
Royal-Memorial Stadium. He left after throwing for 315 yards and
four touchdowns, including a stretch that included a school-record
nine consecutive completions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Applewhite handed the reins back to Simms with 10:09
remaining in the third quarter, Texas led, 45-10. The Longhorns'
offense enjoyed a 100 percent success rate under Applewhite (seven
drives, seven scores), allowing Texas to take control of the game
against a 45-point underdog coming off a 21-14 loss to Sam Houston
State, a Division I-AA school.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' dominance appeared in question during the opening quarter
as the Ragin' Cajuns moved 75 yards with the opening kickoff to
tally a field goal, then extended the lead to 10-0 when cornerback
Terrence Hunter intercepted a Simms pass and returned it 43 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The interception led to Simms' removal in favor of Applewhite, a
junior who underwent reconstructive knee surgery in January. At the
same time, Texas (1-0) shifted to a hurry-up offense with four wide
receivers that jump-started a stagnant offense and buried the
Cajuns (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum changed when we put Major in,'' said Texas coach
Mack Brown, who stressed that coaches still view their quarterback
position as a ``co-starter'' situation. ``I was surprised Major was
able to play as well as he did, coming off a knee operation. He
gave us a spark, but we also changed the offense when he came in.
That gave Major a better chance to spread people out and find more
open people.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite did that with ease, leading the Longhorns to 31
points in the second quarter. It marked Texas' most productive
quarter since the team scored 33 points in the second quarter
against Rice on Oct. 1, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By time he exited, Applewhite completed 18 of 26 passes for 315
yards. He threw two touchdown strikes to both Artie Ellis and
Brandon Healy. He watched freshman Roy Williams (six catches, 105
yards) make a spectacular, one-handed grab of a 40-yard toss during
his stretch of nine consecutive completions.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Applewhite flashed the same type of form he has shown
with regularity for the past two seasons while leading the
Longhorns to a 17-6 record as a starter. But the
Louisiana-Lafayette game marked the first time a healthy Applewhite
did not take Texas' initial snap from center since Sept. 12, 1998.
That made Saturday's performance special to Applewhite, who
experienced contact for the first time since suffering a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl on
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had goose bumps when I came out on the field,'' Applewhite
said. ``I felt my nose tingle like I was going to cry, but I
decided, `This is not the time.' I felt like I'd been away from the
game so long, it sparked a new passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite took his passion and made things happen. He drew
praise from Simms, who said he felt ``like punching a wall'' after
directing two scoring drives in mop-up duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major played great. I didn't get much going,'' said Simms, who
completed 7 of 14 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Simms did enough, in Brown's estimation, to keep alive the
quarterback rotation system for next week's game at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing two quarterbacks, everyone will have an
opinion each week and that opinion will change,'' Brown said.
``We're going to keep both of these guys going and upbeat. They
both played well enough to play (next week) at Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of changing starters against
Stanford, Brown sidestepped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might as well not ask,'' Brown said. ``I won't say
anything about next week, either. We feel like we've got two
starters and that's good enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if one starter was noticeably better than the other against
Louisiana-Lafayette.

Sampras tries for 14th Slam crown vs. Marat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By SCOTT KAISER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ There will be a latter-day Cold War meeting for the U.S.
Open men's singles title at Arthur Ashe Stadium today.
</P>
<P>
   American Pete Sampras and Russian Marat Safin earned berths in
the final with straight-sets wins Saturday. Sampras, a four-time
winner here, outlasted 19-year-old Lleyton Hewitt 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6
(5); Safin knocked off crowd-favorite Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6
(1).
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, seeded fourth, will be playing in his 16th Grand Slam
final and looking to extend his own record with a 14th title; the
20-year-old Safin, the sixth seed, is in his first Slam final. The
two have split a pair of matches, with Sampras winning here in the
fourth round in 1998 and Safin winning 7-6 in the third set of the
quarterfinals of the Canadian Open a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be an easy match,'' said Sampras. ``He
believes he can beat me, but this is a final of a major. That's why
I play the game, for moments like (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating Hewitt wasn't easy, either. The young Australian,
seeded ninth, hung with Sampras in each of the three sets and
should have won the first, but Sampras escaped that scare and then
used his championship experience to come up with big shots on key
points in the final two sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty lucky to get out of (the first set),'' Sampras
said. ``After I got the first set, my confidence grew and my
serving picked up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   After letting four set points escape late in the first set,
Sampras was down 7-6 in the tiebreaker. Hewitt hit a big serve
Sampras returned short, but an anxious Hewitt missed an easy
forehand. Sampras followed with a cross-court forehand for a
winner, then hit a service winner to take the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like I went for the right shot,'' said Hewitt of
his lost set point. ``I didn't play the percentages and didn't
allow myself a big margin of error on that point, but it's easy to
look back on it now and say, `Maybe I should have gone to his
backhand.' I had the point set up and made an easy error.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras broke Hewitt early in the second set, then lost only two
points on serve the rest of the way to take a commanding lead.
Hewitt showed his grit as he broke Sampras early in the third, but
Sampras returned the favor in the seventh. In the tiebreaker,
Sampras got a match point at 6-5 with a tremendous overhead from
just inside the baseline, then wrapped it up with a big inside-out
forehand to the corner that Hewitt couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   In the first semifinal, Safin continued to show poise beyond his
years in his elimination of the unseeded Martin. The 6-4 Russian
kept his game and emotions in check, and Martin _ coming off two
tough matches _ never looked like he was in the match despite the
close score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting an uphill battle the whole way,'' Martin said.
``He was better on the big points and better on the little
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin showed his usual power with 13 aces and 58 winners, but it
was his touch and shot selection that raised eyebrows. A number of
times he hit winning drop shots from the baseline, plus used an
effective topspin lob to negate Martin's serve-and-volley game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going for too much,'' Safin said. ``I don't know why,
but I was just putting the ball inside the court and building the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin, after an early break, closed out the opening set with a
sweet drop shot from behind the baseline and a big forehand winner.
Martin battled back from an early break in the second to get a set
point at 6-5, but Safin answered with a backhand passing shot and
eventually forced a tiebreaker. Safin got a set point of his own
there with a backhand winner after Martin's volley kicked up off
the tape, then Martin hit a service return long to put himself in a
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even up a set point in the second set, I still feel like he's
so on his game that it's tough to handle,'' Martin said. ``I was
pretty impressed with his discipline playing from the backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin showed his determination by forcing another tiebreaker,
but that was his last gasp. Safin raced out to a 5-0 lead and then
closed out the match with a 133-mph ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (Martin was tired),'' Safin said. ``I felt it because
he made some easy mistakes and was late going to the net. He just
didn't move very well.''

LIVE FROM SYDNEY, IT'S CBC. TAPED AND PACKAGED, IT'S NBC.
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic of television schedule for every day of Games on

or 888-346-9867.) 
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Olympic television terms, NBC is a tyranny, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will tape every minute of the Sydney Games and package the
best for a five-hour prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
   All of NBC's morning and late-night coverage will be taped, as
will everything broadcast on CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, NBC will show you what it believes you want to see.
</P>
<P>
   NBC even has minute-by-minute surveys that prove what you want,
and when you surf away when you're shown what you don't want. So if
you don't like what you see at 10:45 p.m., you must not be in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   CBC will carry everything live. So march northward, you purists
_ you viewers who want results now, not 10 or 12 or 15 hours later
_ to Buffalo, Seattle, Detroit or Minneapolis, anywhere close
enough to the Canadian border to grab a CBC signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS tried to block out the CBC feed coming from Vancouver
during Nagano,'' said Christian Haase, a spokesman for CBC,
referring to the 1998 Winter Olympics from Japan. ``People from the
U.S. write to thank us for showing the Olympics live.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in Buffalo, you can watch the opening ceremony from
Sydney at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. Or tune in to the women's
100-meter sprint final on Sept. 23 at 5:05 a.m. and the men's 100
meter final 15 minutes later. That men's 50-meter freestyle
swimming final you're looking for? That will be at 4:05 a.m. on
Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 1, with your body clock adjusted, watching the closing
ceremony at 4 a.m. should be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is the CBC way, and it is proud not to do it the NBC way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so much information available and the Internet, it's
important to show it live,'' Hasse said. ``People here are used to
watching men's Olympic hockey at 2 a.m. or the men's 100 meter
final at 5:20. It's 2 1/2 weeks of magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasse said that during the 1998 Winter Olympics from Nagano, CBC
attracted 2.3 million viewers for the Canada-Czech Republic
semifinal hockey game, from 12:40 to 3:30 a.m. By comparison, the
prime-time ``Hockey Night in Canada,'' attracts an average
viewership of 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBC will carry some taped highlights of wee-hour action during
its morning show, from 9 a.m. to noon. In its afternoon and
prime-time broadcasts, from 5 to 11 p.m., CBC will show 288 hours
of live coverage, augmented by more than 200 hours from TSN, a
second Canadian network.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that CBC is paying $20 million for the rights
to the Sydney Games, compared with NBC's fee of $705 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBC viewers have a great advantage: The network's relatively
modest investment doesn't require it to time-shift the prime stuff
to prime time in order to earn back a gigantic rights fee.
</P>
<P>
   And if viewers look forward to track and field in the wee hours,
that is their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are past time changes,'' Joel Darling, CBC's
Olympic executive producer, told The National Post, a Toronto
newspaper. ``If they want to see something, they want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is imperative for NBC to husband the best events for
maximum exposure and advertising rates for prime time. All those
NBC promotions urging viewers to watch marquee athletes like
Maurice Greene, Marion Jones, Lenny Krayzelburg, Ian Thorpe or
Stacy Dragila would be useless if the come-ons urged: ``Join us in
Sydney at 4 in the morning!'' You simply can't build a broad TV
viewership out of Joe Benigno's overnight listeners on WFAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``With virtually all of the finals of track and field, swimming,
diving and gymnastics taking place in the evening hours in
Sydney,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, ``the
decision was made early on with these Olympics that our most
important target was to reach the largest possible audience.''
</P>
<P>
   That audience exists in greatest numbers between 7 p.m. and
midnight Eastern time, not at 3 a.m. when an estimated 9 percent of
television sets in the United States are on.
</P>
<P>
   To alter that equation by carrying an Olympics from a site 15
hours away would be folly for NBC, as long as the network pays what
the International Olympic Committee wants. NBC, of course, made a
pre-emptive bid for the Sydney and 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympic
rights in 1995 for a combined $1.2 billion, then returned a few
months later with a $2.3 billion offer for the 2004, 2006 and 2008
rights. Had NBC not come forward, the IOC likely would have sought
more in competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC and the Olympic movement could live easily without the
CBC's money, but not NBC's.
</P>
<P>
   For Sydney, NBC's $705 million payment accounts for 52.9 percent
of the worldwide TV rights. CBC accounts for 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in Atlanta, NBC's $456 million payment provided
50.7 percent of the $898.3 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Much as NBC is certain that its taped strategy will work, it
will be challenged more than ever by the Internet, which is more
important and pervasive than even two years ago at the Nagano
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Various Web sites, including nbcolympics.com, will make results
instantly available, and photographs will be widely posted.
</P>
<P>
   NBC must hope that its bedrock philosophy _ that viewers are
more interested in the Games' video imagery and stories of athletic
sacrifice, triumph and failure than in who won or lost _ continues
to be viable.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: CANOEING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This sport involves men and women in two distinct disciplines:
sprint (flat- &QL; 
water) and slalom (whitewater). Two types of craft _ canoes and
kayaks _ are used in both. In the canoe, the athlete kneels and
uses a single-bladed paddle. In the kayak, the athlete sits and
uses a double-bladed paddle.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 events in sprints, four in slalom. Women compete
only in kayak. The fiberglass-like canoes and kayaks are as small
as 13 feet 1 inch for slalom, 17 feet for sprints.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   With repechage (second-chance) heats no longer used in Olympic
sprints, the competition consists of heats, semifinals and finals,
all at 500 or 1,000 meters. In slalom, competitors race one at a
time through gates and rapids over a course of 300 to 600 meters.
Time penalties are assessed for missing or touching a gate. Total
time for two runs decides each slalom round.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Once the slalom course is set, practice runs are barred, so the
athletes walk alongside the course to determine how to approach
each gate. If they err, they may still survive because they get two
runs the first day and the qualifiers get two more the next.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Medals choices are headed by Paul Ratcliffe of Britain and Mandy
Planert and Suzanne Hirt of Germany in slalom and Martin Doctor of
the Czech Republic in canoe sprints. The best Americans are Scott
Shipley of Poulsbo, Wash., and Rebecca Bennett-Giddens of Green
Bay, Wis., in kayak slalom and 41-year-old David Hearn of Bethesda,
Md., in canoe slalom.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although Texas coaches did not make public their
choice of a starting quarterback until game time, Chris Simms said
he was told before Saturday that he would take the first snap for
the Longhorns. He declined to elaborate, saying only that the word
came down earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite, who came off the bench to spark the Longhorns'
52-10 victory, said he was resolute when told he would be benched
for reasons other than ailing health for the first time since Sept.
12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I could say, `Fine,' accept it and go pout. Or I
could remember that things in college football can change like
``that,'','' Applewhite said, snapping his fingers for emphasis.
``The good news is that roles will change. And the bad news is that
roles will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Louisiana-Lafayette, Applewhite threw for 315 yards and
a career-high four touchdowns. Texas coach Mack Brown said the
performance will not necessarily trigger a change in the starting
lineup for next week's game at Stanford. Both quarterbacks, will
play, Brown said. WAITING HIS TURN
</P>
<P>
   Texas wide receiver Brandon Healy, a fifth-year senior, made his
first career start a memorable one. Healy grabbed four passes for
88 yards and two touchdowns. Heading into the game, Healy had
caught just eight passes for 77 yards and one touchdown since
enrolling at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious to get the season started the right way,'' said
Healy, who credits watching NFL-bound teammates Wane McGarity
(Cowboys) and Kwame Cavil (Buffalo Bills) with helping hone his
moves. ``I have been able to watch a lot of great players in my
time here, and I have tried to take something from each of them and
apply it to my game.'' EXTRA SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Special-teams breakdowns plagued the Longhorns in their 1999
season opener, with three blocked punts leading to a 23-20 loss to
North Carolina State. Not so against Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Brown praised Texas' special-team units for their ``best
performance'' in his three years at the school. Hodges Mitchell
averaged 8.6 yards on punt returns, 2.6 yards above the team's
average in 1999. Punter Kris Stockton averaged 48.0 yards per
attempt, with no blocks. Texas kickoff returners Victor Ike and
Ivan Williams combined to average 28.6 yards, more than nine yards
better than last year's mark (19.4). BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas coaches refer to their spread offense, which produced
eight consecutive scoring drives, as their ``one-minute'' tempo.
The formation is well named. Those eight scoring drives averaged
1:19 in length.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterback Jon Van Cleave, a freshman from Pantego Christian
Academy, completed 6 of 12 passes for 62 yards in his college debut
for Louisiana-Lafayette. ``You'll be seeing more of him,'' coach
Jerry Baldwin said. ``He looked pretty good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Longhorns' 98-yard touchdown drive was Texas' seventh
scoring drive of 90-plus yards in three seasons under coach Mack
Brown. nn

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: CYCLING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was to have been the perfect Hollywood ending for the
coming movie on the improbable life of Lance Armstrong. Brash young
Texan rides his bike to the world road-racing championship; then
miraculously survives testicular cancer that had spread to his
abdomen, lungs and brain; then makes an amazing comeback and wins
the Tour de France last year and again this year; then wins a gold
medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Only the last scene is yet to unfold, and it may not happen. Two
weeks ago, the 28-year-old Armstrong was on a training ride in the
hills near Nice, France, when a car went out of control on a curve
and hit Armstrong and a training partner, Tyler Hamilton. While
Hamilton escaped with a few bumps, Armstrong suffered a broken
vertebra in the neck. His training was interrupted, the pain did
not leave and he skipped two European one-day races. He will decide
this week whether he feels fit enough to ride in two Olympic races.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he seems to be leaning toward not riding. He does
not need the involvement because he has already raced in two
Olympics. In 1992, as a 20-year-old amateur, he finished 14th in
the road race. In 1996, as a pro and unknowingly racked with
cancer, he placed sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road
race.
</P>
<P>
   If he does ride, his best chance will be in the men's 29-mile
time trial, in which the riders race one at a time against the
clock. Armstrong won similar time trials in the last two Tours de
France. With or without Armstrong in the race, Hamilton, from
Marblehead, Mass., should be a medal contender.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the time trial is the 148-mile road race,
which will have such Tour de France rivals as Jan Ullrich of
Germany, Alex Zuelle of Switzerland and Mario Pantani of Italy.
Because the essentially flat course is more suited to a sprinter,
Armstrong has called that race a lottery. If he rides it, he will
be a quarterback on the course, ad-libbing the strategy for the
U.S. five-man team and probably trying to set up a victory for
George Hincapie of Greenville, S.C., or Fred Rodriguez of Piedmont,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There will be 18 cycling events: 12 on the track, four on the
road and two for mountain bikes. Eleven events are for men, seven
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Track events will be contested on a steeply banked 250-meter
indoor wooden track. The bikes will be flying perhaps 40 mph at the
end of the four-lap sprint, a tactical race that starts at a crawl,
and the eight-lap keirin, in which a motorcycle sets the pace until
the last 2 1/2 laps. The mountain-bike races are cross-country,
about 31 miles for men and 22 for women, with the average speed
maybe 12 mph. On the road, the women will cover 74.5 miles in the
road race, 19.5 miles in the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The strongest countries are Italy, the United States, Germany
and Canada on the road; France, Australia, Germany and the United
States on the track and France, Australia, Spain and Canada on
mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. medal contenders include Hamilton and Armstrong (if he
races) in the men's road time trial; Marty Nothstein of
Trexlertown, Pa., in the men's track sprint and keirin and Alison
Dunlap of Colorado Springs in the women's mountain-bike race.

LEHTINEN WITH PREGNANT WIFE, NOT WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he doesn't
anticipate winger Jere Lehtinen joining the team in training camp.
Lehtinen's wife, Jaana, is pregnant with twins and her water broke
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife is due right away, the next day or so,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He's just going to stay there until everything is clear and
gone. In two or three days, he could join us, but I expect he'll
join us back in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The twins came earlier than expected, but Lehtinen already had
been briefed on what to expect. His roommate on road trips,
defenseman Darryl Sydor, had twins last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I know what I'm getting in to,'' Lehtinen said last week.
``But it's going to be fun. I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of training camp isn't likely to hurt Lehtinen, who has
been skating since July 10 and who said the ankle injury that
caused him to miss all but 17 games last seasons feels good.
SYDOR'S GOOD NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars received some other good news on the ankle front.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sydor, who tore ligaments in his left ankle during Game 6
of the Stanley Cup Finals, said he plans to get on skates while in
Vail. Don't expect anything strenuous. It's just a ``see how he
feels'' skate, but it's progress compared with a week ago when
Sydor thought he might not be ready for the team's Oct. 4 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how that thing does,'' Ken Hitchcock said.
``Struggling, struggling, struggling and then boom. He's got the
toe drag going now. The discomfort left. This thing is coming fast
now. I don't have any doubt left that he'll be ready for the start
of the season.'' NO MODANO, HULL
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mike Modano nor Brett Hull scored in Saturday in a
scrimmage. Of course, neither of them played.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock doesn't plan to use eight of his veterans in any
of the training-camp scrimmages. Mike Keane, Richard Matvichuk,
Derian Hatcher, Sergei Zubov, Joe Nieuwendyk and Ed Belfour joined
Modano and Hull on the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to burn any of them out,'' Hitchcock said.
``When you play that long, if you can buy yourself two or three
weeks, why not? It had nothing to do with injuries. It had
everything to do with three years of June.'' STUNTED GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been made of the number of young guys in training camp
for the Stars, but young players don't necessarily equate to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said a lot of positions are open,''
Hitchcock said. ``There's not. We know where we're going and it's
just a matter of where we slot people.'' nn

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S SECURITY AGENCY NOW ALLOWED STEALTH MONITORING OF
INTERNET TRAFFIC
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 10 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got
Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month,
Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
is now allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on
cellular telephone and pager communications _ all without the
user's consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say
the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping
equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the
fledgling companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures,
known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a
return to Soviet-style political repression under current President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end to all E-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly
Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is
now only a click away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree
in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone
calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies _
the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st
century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the
measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
</P>
<P>
   The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their
networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed
fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency
to keep an eye on electronic transmissions _ from private e-mails
to e-commerce purchases _ in real-time and in total privacy.
Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say
cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000, will mean the loss of the
service provider's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications
Ministry, admits that the regulations _ the Orwellian-termed
``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' _ give the
government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security organs and special forces have the right, and now the
capability, to monitor private correspondence and telephone
conversations of individual citizens in the name of establishing
legal order,'' Rokotyan told Russian television in July. He
insisted, though, that SORM would be used only for ``monitoring
individual cases according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet surveillance has come under fire in many countries,
including the United States. In 1994, U.S. lawmakers authorized the
FBI to wiretap and eavesdrop on criminals conducting or discussing
crimes over the Internet. The measure was vehemently opposed, with
only limited success, in 1998 by civil liberties groups and telecom
businesses who viewed it as a threat to both profits and personal
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Russia say these same issues that
aroused opposition in the United States are magnified here because
there are virtually no checks-and-balances to prevent the FSB from
using their expansive powers to cross from law enforcement into
political blackmail and commercial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet (service) providers must render assistance in a criminal
case. But free access to the Internet gives the FSB great power
that would be easy to abuse,'' said Ina Zemskova, a lawyer with the
St. Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group. ``In
our country, no one monitors the eavesdroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the SORM regulations are fraught with
loopholes that allow the FSB to si

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: DIVING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once a body of water controlled by high-flying Americans, the
Olympic diving tank has belonged to the Chinese since Greg Louganis
made the perfect exit in 1988 after so many perfect entries. Since
then, the only American to win a gold medal has been Mark Lenzi, in
1992 on the springboard. In 1996, the Americans could muster only
two bronze medals; Sydney should not change their or the Chinese's
luck.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   After 80 years of continuity, in which men and women competed
individually on 3-meter springboard and 10-meter platform, the
sport added four events in the 2000 Games. All four are
synchronized events, in which two teammates attempt to perform
identical dives simultaneously. In springboard, they dive of
side-by-side boards. In platform, they dive off the same platform.
The result is quite telegenic, which helps explain why ``synchro''
is getting its Olympic moment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, 18 divers will advance to the semifinals in the
individual events. After five compulsory dives, 12 competitors will
then advance to the finals, where they will perform six dives of
their choice. The semifinal and final dives are then added together
to produce a diver's total score. There are seven judges, who award
scores of up to 10 points for each dive. Their scores are then
multiplied by a coefficient determined by the dive's degree of
difficulty, which range from the lowly 1.3 to the presumably
life-threatening 3.6. In synchro, there are only eight teams in
each event and no preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   There are five categories in springboard: inward, forward,
backward, reverse and twisting. In platform diving, there is an
additional category: the handstand. The key to success is being
able to juggle risk and perfection. A dive with a high degree of
difficulty with minor faults will outscore a simpler dive performed
flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   After retiring for the second time, China's Fu Mingxia, the most
successful diver of the 1990s, will attempt to become the first
diver to win five gold medals. Fu won her first gold medal in 1992
on platform at age 14 and then swept both women's events in 1996.
She will compete only on springboard in Sydney, and she is a
favorite in the synchronized event with Guo Jingjing. The Chinese
teen-ager Li Na is a rising (make that falling) star in the women's
platform, and her countryman Tian Ling will duel with the defending
Olympic champion, Dmitri Sautin of Russia, on the men's platform.
Sautin is also a favorite in springboard, along with the defending
Olympic champion Xiong Ni of China. Americans to watch include Mark
Ruiz on springboard and platform and Laura Wilkinson on women's
platform.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: JUDO  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like its fellow Olympic sports of wrestling and tae kwon do,
judo is one of the variations of hand-to-hand combat. It limits
mayhem, with no punching or kicking. Japan, which won eight of the
16 gold medals in the last world championships, should dominate.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   Direct-elimination competition will decide the seven weight
classes for men and the seven for women. Anyone who loses to a
finalist moves into a repechage (second-chance) competition for
bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   A men's match can last five minutes, a women's match four. A
match ends immediately with an ippon, in which a player throws an
opponent on his back or holds him on his back for 25 seconds or
applies a hold that evokes submission. Lesser throws earn fractions
of a point. About half the matches end on an ippon, the other half
on points.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to get an opponent off balance so he can be thrown
to the mat. Some players are skilled mainly on their feet and
others do better working on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The strongest teams are the Japanese, Korean, French and German
men and the Cuban women. The United States ranks about 10th among
the men, 12th to 15th among the women. Jimmy Pedro of Boston, the
world champion in the men's 73-kilogram (160.6-pound) class, is
favored to give the United States its first Olympic judo gold
medal. The two best players are Japanese _ Shinichi Shinohara
(men's heavyweight) and Ryoko Tamura (women's 48 kilograms, or
105.6 pounds).

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: SAILING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1996 U.S. team had high expectations in its home waters, but
managed only two bronze medals in Savannah, Ga. The U.S. squad
hopes to return to prominence in Sydney. In 1992, the team claimed
nine medals in 10 classes.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 11 classes compete in strict fleet-racing formats,
where the first boat to finish wins the race and scores one point.
Second place earns two points, and so on. Competition in each event
is based on an 11-race series, weather permitting, with the
exception of the 49er Class, which sails 16 races. The winner is
the boat with the lowest accumulated score at the end of the
series. After 10 races, each boat discards its worst two scores.
The Soling Class will run six fleet races and the top 12 boats will
advance to a boat-versus-boat match-racing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Early springtime weather conditions can present a variety of
conditions, from stiff offshore westerlies to light, shifty sea
breezes. With winds apt to bend unpredictably around the many
harbor headlands, and currents that in places can run up to a
knot-and-a-half, successful skippers will need to employ clean
starts and adapt quickly to the situations.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   In the Star Class, the American Mark Reynolds, the reigning
world champion skipper, will face stiff competition from Brazil's
Torben Grael and the hometown favorite, the Australian Colin
Beashel. In the Laser Class, Britain's Ben Ainslie; the Brazilian
Robert Scheidt; and another Aussie, Michael Blackburn, are expected
to wage an epic battle. In the 49er Class, the brothers Jonathan
and Charlie McKee should be strong medal contenders.

SMYERS TAKES BATTLES TO L.A. TRIATHLON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Karen Smyers always figured she'd catch up to
cyclist Lance Armstrong in Sydney's Olympic Village. She'd trade
cancer stories with him and talk about treatments and training.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers suspected she and Armstrong, who has won back-to-back
Tour de France titles since beating brain cancer, were kindred
spirits. He would understand why exercise was an essential part of
her fight against thyroid cancer; he wouldn't try to dissuade her
from continuing her triathlon career as a few of her doctors had in
so many words.
</P>
<P>
   And heaven knows Smyers would have been the perfect person to
talk Armstrong through his recovery from injuries he suffered last
month when he was hit head-on by a car while training in France; in
1998 she was struck by an 18-wheeler while riding her bike near her
home in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers, 38, never considered that her Sydney plans would fall
through and she would get only as far as L.A. A six-time national
pro champion and the 1999 U.S. Triathlete of the Year, she looked
to be as much of a lock for the Olympics as Michael Johnson in the
200 meters or Dan O'Brien in the decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   So when she failed to make the U.S. team, it was like getting
hit by an 18-wheeler all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers has recovered from the emotional trauma and the physical
ordeal of a subsequent five-hour operation related to her cancer.
Sydney's loss turned into L.A.'s gain when Smyers chose the city's
inaugural pro triathlon, to be held today, as the first competition
of the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   A ``litmus test,'' is how Smyers, no stranger to pop exams, is
looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm disappointed this season isn't going the way I had
hoped,'' she said. ``But at least I know I did everything I
possibly could given my circumstances to get to the starting line.
I have no regrets. I would have regretted not trying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' she added, ``is a matter of perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   If positive thinking, pluck and perseverance were the events in
the triathlon, Smyers would be the prohibitive gold-medal favorite.
In the past three years she has overcome a severed hamstring,
childbirth (daughter Jenna was born in May of 1998), the collision
with the semi-trailer truck, a broken collarbone and the cancer
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers underwent a six-hour surgery last December in which her
thyroid and cancerous lymph nodes were removed. She had to have
another surgery in July after doctors discovered more enlarged
lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time something happens, I go through a phase,'' Smyers
said. ``First it's disbelief, second is questioning whether I did
something wrong to cause it and third is accepting it and trying to
find the positive side of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sunny disposition disappeared briefly behind dark clouds in
July when she found out the reason she was having a hard time
breathing when she trained was a grape-sized lymph node was pushing
against her windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers couldn't shake the thought that her second surgery was
her payback for choosing to delay the radioactive iodine treatment
she would have had after the first surgery if she hadn't been so
hellbent on becoming an Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   She knows some people say she ought to be concentrating on
getting better, not faster. What some people don't understand is
that training and competing are potent drugs in her battle to get
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question for me that having athletic goals is
therapeutic,'' Smyers said. ``As soon as I didn't make the Olympic
team, I needed another goal to get me through this latest rehab.
Competing gives me the motivation to get better. It helps me to
stop dwelling on my woes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she won't get to meet Armstrong in Sydney, after all,
Smyers feels as though she knows him. She recently finished
Armstrong's best-selling autobiography. In many ways it was like
reading her own story. Smyers cried a little, but then, she's a
sucker for happy endings.

PARK CAN'T PULL DODGERS FROM MIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Los Angeles Dodgers death march has brought
solemnness to everything and even Kevin Brown and Chan Ho Park, two
of the few consistent performers in this now dreadful season, are
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Brown have lost before but only because the Dodgers
failed to score runs. But a day after Brown had trouble against
Colorado, Park yielded six runs in the first inning, which was too
much for the stumbling, bumbling Dodgers to overcome in a 7-6 loss
to the Rockies on Saturday at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, five games out of first place on Aug. 29, are 10
games out and in fourth place. The Rockies (73-68) moved ahead of
the Dodgers(73-69), who could end up in last place considering they
lead San Diego by 3 games and have six remaining against the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   How much worse can it get? Well, Curt Schilling against Luke
Prokopec could give some insight to that, but that's not until
Tuesday in Arizona. For now, the Dodgers must deal with their fifth
straight loss and figure out a way to turn a $98 million bust into
something respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just enthusiasm,'' Dodgers left fielder Gary
Sheffield said. ``I watched these guys doing real well on TV when I
was sick. It seemed like they had fire in their eyes, like the
enthusiasm was there. I always say that if guys in the lineup are
not showing enthusiasm, not doing their jobs, give those guys on
the bench a chance to do it because when those guys come off the
bench, they're anxious to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to bring that enthusiasm out there on the field
and it's going to rub off on the other players. You keep going with
the same guys thinking it's going to change, and if it hasn't
changed now, it's not going to. Guys feed off each other, and guys
look up to veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When veteran players are dragging and not playing with
enthusiasm, not playing with fire, the younger players see that and
they try harder and it makes them make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers came back from a 6-0 first-inning deficit to
pull within 7-6 on Chris Donnels' pinch-hit homer in the sixth, the
day was splashed with uninspired play and three errors, two by
shortstop Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for his career-high 16th win, Park (15-9) instead
allowed six hits and six runs as the Rockies sent 10 batters to the
plate in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth, who went 2 for 3
with a run scored and RBI for the Rockies, said he understands how
things could have gone south for his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to make up this ground and it can be disheartening,''
Hollandsworth said. ``You feel like you're treading water because
the team in front of you is doing the same thing.''

<P>
   The U.S. and Australia _ with its stars Ian Thorpe, Susie
O'Neill and Kieren Perkins _ will battle for the unofficial team
title for most gold medals, although there are no engaging
head-to-head matchups looming. Both countries are strongest in
events where the other is weakest, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech bodysuits have also revolutionized the sport, creating
a flurry of world records.
</P>
<P>
   THE WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   This sport, more than any other in the Olympics, has been
tarnished for three decades by the use of performance-enhancing
drugs. Smaller amounts of synthetic steroids have more effect in
women than in men. All 32 medals won by East German women from 1968
to 1988 have been discredited by revelations in court and in
documents of the former country's state-sponsored system of doping.
About three dozen Chinese athletes were caught using banned
substances in the 1990s. Michelle Smith of Ireland, who won three
gold medals at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, was banned last
year after testing positive for androstenedione, the steroid that
Mark McGwire used the year he broke the home-run record, and for
spiking a drug test with alcohol. Suspicion about possible drug use
will be high at the Sydney Games as well.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism attends two female swimmers: Inge de Bruijn of the
Netherlands, a respected but not previously great swimmer who set
world records in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter
butterfly this year, and the American Dara Torres, who qualified in
three sprints at the Olympic trials after being away from the sport
for seven years. Both swimmers have vehemently denied using illicit
drugs, and both attribute their success to maturity, rigorous
cross-training, better nutrition and the new bodysuits.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Torres is the first American to participate in four
Olympics. She has an entourage of a dozen specialists, including a
swim coach, a nutritionist, flexibility experts, a mental coach and
a specialist in massaging her lymph system.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are favored in only one event, the 800-meter
freestyle, where Brooke Bennett is seeking to repeat as Olympic
champion. Gold medals are possible in the sprints if Jenny Thompson
and Torres can overcome de Bruijn. Thompson is tied with the
speed-skater Bonnie Blair for most golds won by a U.S. woman _ five
_ but all of Thompson's victories have come in relays. She is
seeking individual titles in Sydney in the 100 freestyle and 100
butterfly. One of the most fascinating races of the Games will be
the 100-meter breaststroke, where Penny Heyns of South Africa will
attempt to hold off the 16-year-old Megan Quann of the United
States, who has said she will win and break the world record.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEN
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe will be a huge star if he wins, as expected, the 200- and
400-meter freestyle events. The 17-year-old Australian holds world
records in both. Kieren Perkins of Australia is also looking to win
his third consecutive Olympic title in the 1,500-meter freestyle. A
great rivalry will be renewed in the 50-meter freestyle between
Alexander Popov of Russia, the two-time Olympic champion, and Gary
Hall Jr., the iconoclastic American who finished second in Atlanta.
At the U.S. Olympic trials, Hall swam faster in the 50-meter
freestyle than Popov ever has in an eight-man race. A possible gold
medalist is Anthony Ervin of the United States, who is the first
swimmer of African-American descent to make the Olympic team. Popov
will also seek to win his third Olympic title in the 100 freestyle,
where Neil Walker of the United States and Hall will challenge for
gold medals. Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles, whose family
immigrated from the former Soviet Union when he was 13 in 1989, is
the world-record holder in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke, and
should win both events in Sydney. Tom Malchow, who is 6 feet 7
inches, owns the world record in the 200-meter butterfly. Tom Dolan
is back to defend his Olympic title in the 400-meter individual
medley.
</P>
<P>
   SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian women dominated the first four Olympic
competitions. Now the Russians, led by Maria Kisseleva, and the
Japanese are the favorites in the two events: the duet and the
team. Kisseleva may be distracted by a positive drug test for
ephedrine, which meant she had to give up her European duet crown.

SAMPRAS, SAFIN IN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One young gun down, one to go.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras ousted 19-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4,
7-6 (7-5), Saturday in a tough US Open semifinal. Sampras took care
of history at Wimbledon a couple of months ago with his record 13th
championship in a major tournament. Now he shoots for No. 14, a
fifth US Open title _ his first since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will face No. 6 seed Marat Safin, 20, in the final
Sunday at 4 p.m. Safin, looser than loose, had no problem handling
the hoopla of his first semifinal in a major tournament and beat
Todd Martin, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-1).
</P>
<P>
   Today's is a serving summit of the past, present, and future. A
showdown between the player who had an audience with the president
after his win, and a guy who said he's had to call several times a
day _ and spell his name each time _ to get a ride to the National
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at two young guys who are going to be around for
many, many years,'' Sampras said. ``Lleyton has a good future. He's
got the tools. Safin is someone that has got a much bigger game,
serves huge. He's also the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The future, Sampras hopes, can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras won his first title in a major at the US Open 10 years
ago at age 19.
</P>
<P>
   This final matches a pair of tiebreaker-tough opponents who were
long gone at this time last year. Safin lost in the second round to
Jiri Novak, and Sampras _ after hurting his back in practice _
withdrew and never made it to the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both have been fine finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is 7-0 in tiebreakers in this tournament. Safin is 5-1
and has won his last five.
</P>
<P>
   Something must give.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras beat Safin in straight sets here in the fourth round two
years ago. But the only other time they met, Safin beat Sampras in
a third-set tiebreaker in the Canadian Open early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras avenged one loss in the semifinals _ Hewitt had beaten
him the last time they met going into Wimbledon _ and will try to
avenge another Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt didn't go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, Hewitt was down, 4-5 and 15-40, on his serve
and held off three Sampras break points overall in the game. With
Hewitt serving at 5-6, Sampras again had a set point and again
couldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt had a couple of set points in the tiebreaker, the best
while serving at 7-6. He moved in on a forehand and blasted it down
the line. Just wide. Sampras followed with a cross-court forehand
and then a service winner for the set.
</P>
<P>
   One service break decided the second set. Sampras was broken in
the second game of the third set, but got that one back in the
seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   It was back to a tiebreaker in the third set. Hewitt was up,
5-4, when Sampras took over.
</P>
<P>
   He had a forehand volley and then, when Hewitt popped up a
return, got up for an overhead from deep in the court. Hewitt put a
backhand into the net and the Sampras-Safin final was set.
</P>
<P>
   As impressed as he was by Savin's return of serve and the way he
handled himself, Martin thinks the youngster should get more of a
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a greater propensity on his part to
overhit,'' Martin said. ``Today, that wasn't really there. He saw
molasses across the street, wasn't too worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin had it all over Martin, all match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the big points better than me and he played the
little points better than me,'' Martin said. ``You know, the score
is 3, 6, and 6, but I was fighting an uphill battle the whole way.
Even up a set point in the second point, I still feel like he's on
his game, that it's tough to handle. You know, I was coming in
every point I could, and it was purely out of defense. I had to
attack in order not to get smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin was serving and down, 5-6, in games when a Martin overhead
created the set point at the end of the middle set. A backhand
passing shot, a forehand volley, and then a nice lob that Martin
couldn't handle got Safin out of trouble and he won the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was broken early in the third set, but got it right back.
But Safin was way too good in that tiebreaker and finally finished
Martin off with a 133-mile-an-hour ace.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Safin didn't think he played that well. Then he
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was playing horrible today,'' he said. ``I
couldn't find my concentration. I played without any pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what impressed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That someone can ignore what the environment is, what the
situation is,'' he said. ``He plays the first point of the match as
loose as the last point of the match, break points as loose as he
plays 40-love points. . . . So many opportunities that I had, I
actually made good plays. It seemed as though he was laughing at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Safin will try to keep the pressure on Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just start from the first point to return his serve, run for
the balls even if I can't get them, to show the guy that I'm going
to fight for it,'' Safin said. ``I don't want to give him Christmas
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras won't be expecting any.

SOX BULLPEN IS THIN FOR STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been few scenes at Fenway Park that approach the
horror of what took place Friday night, when Bryce Florie was hit
in the face with a line drive. Dick Pole was only 24 years old when
he was struck by a line drive hit by Tony Muser of the Baltimore
Orioles in 1975, and his career was over after the 1978 season, the
vision in his right eye never the same. The memory of Tony
Conigliaro sprawled in the dirt after being hit by a Jack Hamilton
pitch in 1967 still haunts generations of Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Florie lies in the hospital, the bones around his right eye
shattered by a line drive hit by Ryan Thompson of the New York
Yankees, doctors offering only a guarded prognosis that he will
have ``reasonable vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Florie is 30. In February, he signed a two-year deal with the
Sox for $2.8 million, $1.35 million for this season. His financial
security, of course, is of small comfort while he ponders not only
whether he will be able to resume his career but whether his sight
will ever be the same.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the personal tragedy, the Sox are now left facing the
most taxing segment of their schedule _ three doubleheaders in six
days, including back-to-back day-night twin bills _ with their
bullpen suddenly in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Florie was hurt, the Sox were down Hipolito
Pichardo, who has a strained forearm that almost certainly is
related in some way to the elbow surgery he had last season, and
Rich Garces, who strained his right groin. Pichardo, already shut
down for a week in August, is expected to be out at least 10 days,
and with Garces, the hope is that he'll be back sooner than later,
but no one is sure.
</P>
<P>
   So what had been one of the strengths of this team now takes on
an uncertain cast, with more of the burden now falling on Rod Beck
and Tim Wakefield and minor leaguers Paxton Crawford and Rick
Croushore.
</P>
<P>
   Middle relief is an often overlooked component of a team's
success. The Yankees are Exhibit A. Yes, they have the best closer
in the game in Mariano Rivera, but the lefty-righty tandem of Mike
Stanton and Jeff Nelson has been unmatched in getting games to the
ninth inning _ which is why owner George Steinbrenner has been so
hot about their recent failures _ and the loss of swingman Ramiro
Mendoza for the rest of the season leaves the Yankees more
vulnerable than usual heading into October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play 20 or 30 years ago,'' said Sox closer Derek
Lowe, ``but the game is so different today. Before, you gave a
starter the ball and he went at least seven innings, even if he
threw 160 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, if a starter gets to the sixth and is struggling at
all, they get him out as soon as they can. Pichardo was a big part
of our pen, and so was Garces, who was maybe the most valuable guy
in our pen. They're very, very important, especially in the
playoffs, when there are so many tight games. You need to keep
those 2-1 games and 3-2 games from becoming 4-1 or 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what Mendoza did to us in the playoffs last year.
Twice he came into games with the bases loaded and we didn't score.
I think he was a huge reason they won last year. He's the kind of
guy who can come into a game in the second inning and pitch six
innings, or come in in the eighth for one inning. You know he's
going to get a lot of ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if they don't have him last year, we go to the World
Series. That's how important the bullpen can be.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the Sox' bullpen is lacking Florie, Pichardo, and
Garces. The sorrow that his teammates feel for Florie also will
require a grim resolve to get the job done without him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prospects not promising
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette's announcement that the Red Sox have extended the
contract of Wayne Britton, the team's vice president of scouting,
through the 2003 season quiets the whispers that there was friction
between the two. Britton has been the scouting director for eight
years and scored big in his first two drafts when he took Trot
Nixon No. 1 in 1993 and landed Nomar Garciaparra, Brian Rose, Carl
Pavano, and Donnie Sadler in '94.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one glaring hole in the Sox farm system, it is
this: the lack of position players who are anywhere near major
league-ready. First baseman Dernell Stenson, a third-round pick in
1996, is a legitimate prospect, the player closest to making a bid
for a roster spot next season.
</P>
<P>
   But after Stenson, there are only questions. Third baseman
Wilton Veras, who appeared to be a sure thing this spring, took a
giant step backward. Sadler has also invited serious doubts that he
will ever hit in the big leagues. Outfielder Michael Coleman, who
also was on the fast track at one time, fractured his wrist. If he
makes it, it probably will be with another club.
</P>
<P>
   At Double A Trenton, Shea Hillenbrand, a 10th-round pick in '96,
had a nice year at the plate for the Thunder and will go to the
Arizona Fall League, but so far the Sox have been unable to find
him a position, trying him at first, third, and catcher. Peabody's
Steve Lomasney got off to a dreadful start at the plate,
reinforcing some opinions that he strikes out far too much. He also
was hurt. The 23-year-old catcher, a fifth-round pick in the '95
draft, will need at least another year in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the pickings are extremely slim for an organization
that repeatedly has claimed the key to any long-term success is a
productive farm system. Kids such as outfielder Lew Ford at Single
A Augusta, third baseman Tony Blanco (rookie league), and
outfielder Rick Asadoorian (rookie league) are too far away to
project with any certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most promising position player in the Sox' system is
Juan Diaz, the slugging first baseman from Cuba, but he was not
home-grown. Diaz, who dislocated his ankle, came out of the
Dodgers' system after he was declared a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managing _ for now
</P>
<P>
   It has been 58 years since there's been an entire baseball
season without a manager being fired, but job security is as
tenuous as ever for at least eight managers who may be out of work
by Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The likely-to-be-fired list includes Larry Rothschild of the
Devil Rays, Jack McKeon of the Reds, Terry Francona of the
Phillies, Larry Dierker of the Astros, Gene Lamont of the Pirates,
Davey Johnson of the Dodgers, Felipe Alou of the Expos, and Buck
Showalter of the Diamondbacks. In addition, Jim Fregosi (Blue
Jays), Lou Piniella (Mariners), and Dusty Baker (Giants) are all
free agents after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Former PawSox manager Ken Macha, who played in the Pirates
system, is a Pittsburgh native (he went to Pitt), and is now
coaching for the A's, has been mentioned as a candidate for the
Pirates job. Diamondbacks broadcaster Bob Brenly, the former
catcher, reportedly was sounded out by owner Jerry Colangelo about
replacing Showalter, who was under fire even before Arizona's
September collapse. Former Sox boss Kevin Kennedy, a Southern
California native and friend of Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone, has been mentioned as the successor to Johnson, though it's
not a given that Malone will survive a possible housecleaning by
Dodger boss Bob Daly. Baker, a longtime Dodger star, also is
rumored to be interested in going back to Los Angeles, but his
friends deny that, saying Baker has intense personal reasons dating
back to his playing days for turning down any future affiliation
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor that refuses to go away is that the Sox are setting up
Jimy Williams to take a fall in order to clear the way for Alou.
Duquette is a big Alou fan, as is pitching coach Joe Kerrigan,
minor league field coordinator Dave Jauss, and ace Pedro Martinez.
Alou has told confidants that if he is fired by Expos owner Jeff
Loria, he'll sit home and collect the millions due him on his
contract. But he also has said privately that the Red Sox wanted to
interview him once before _ presumably when Williams was hired _
but the Expos denied Duquette permission.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's reputation is unmatched among his peers. White Sox
manager Jerry Manuel, who was a coach for Alou in Montreal, said
the experience was like going to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa also is a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no disrespect to Bobby Cox or Dusty Baker or whoever, if
we all had the same players, Felipe wins the most games,'' said La
Russa. ``I feel he's the best manager in this league. We know
better than not to be ready to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has a year left on his Red Sox contract, and he is a
lock to come back (if he wants to) if the Red Sox advance to the
postseason for a third straight year. But those ridiculous stories
about Williams's refusal to play Izzy Alcantara being so damaging
to the Sox' chances are indicative of how deep the rift between
Williams and Duquette has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has to apologize to no one for the job he has done
here. And if the Sox are absurd enough to believe a change of
managers will be beneficial to the ball club, Williams's phone will
be ringing off the hook.
</P>

   Bleacher bums
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the pathetic fool sitting in the bleachers who, moments
after Florie was hit by Thompson's line drive, yelled, ``Hey, Beck,
you're next.'' . . . Oakland's rookie center fielder, Terrence
Long, told Boston native Howard Bryant of the San Jose Mercury News
that he was the target of racial epithets from the bleachers last
week . . . Grim doubleheader: Buster Olney, the Vermonter who
covers the Yankees for The New York Times, was a kid sitting about
20 rows from the field when Pole was struck by Muser's line drive
25 years ago . . . Sox players (not to mention a few press box
observers) have been reacting with hilarity at the wooden way
Fenway public address announcer Big Ed Brickley recites song titles
in the fans' daily voting for most popular tune (``Get DOWN On
It'') . . . To the question of whether Bret Saberhagen really
intends to come back next year after missing all of 2000, the
righthander has a ready answer: He already has begun the strength
and exercise program designed to get him back on the field next
spring. ``I won't have an offseason this year,'' said Saberhagen,
who is determined to take the time necessary for his shoulder to be
strong enough before he begins throwing again. ``This year, it was
rush, rush, rush, try to get back as soon as possible,'' he said.
``I want to give it a last go and see what happens. Spend two
months strengthening the shoulder without picking up a ball.'' . .
. As bad as his year was, Saberhagen says his close friend, Yankees
pitcher David Cone, had it worse. Cone endured a season-long slump
and then, just when it seemed he had righted himself, separated his
left shoulder last week. ``His year was a lot tougher than mine,''
Saberhagen said. ``I'm used to doing what I'm doing. I just didn't
get it done this year. The time frame just didn't work for us.''
Saberhagen said he isn't sure why Cone struggled so much this
season. ``It didn't seem like he was doing a whole bunch of things
wrong,'' Saberhagen said. ``If anything, I thought there might be
something wrong with his slider. Usually it's a bit sharper, but he
was leaving it up and over the plate more this year. A lot of it
becomes confidence, too. You get hit a few games in a row, you can
get in a rut. I'm sure he was hearing it from all sides, too.
George (Steinbrenner) and New York is a tough media market. And
then, when he finally gets things right, he gets hurt.'' . . .
Randy Johnson needs eight whiffs Sunday to become the 12th pitcher
in major league history to record 3,000 strikeouts. His first
victim was Orestes Destrade, then with the Pirates, on Sept. 5,
1988. Other milestone victims include Lance Parrish (No. 500),
Chuck Knoblauch (No. 1,000), Turner Ward (No. 1,500), Ben Grieve
(2,000), and Eric Davis (No. 2,500) . . . Chipper Jones of the
Braves has five home runs and a double in 15 career at-bats against
The Unit after his two-homer game Tuesday . . . That National
League Cy Young Award that was conceded to Johnson back in July
looks like it should end up in the hands of Billerica's Tom
Glavine, who will be bidding for his fifth 20-win season Sunday
afternoon against Montreal. At the All-Star break, when Glavine was
just 7-5, he didn't even figure in the trophy picture, as Johnson
was 14-2 with a 1.77 ERA and Glavine's teammate, Greg Maddux, was
9-2. Since then, Johnson has gone 3-4 and Maddux has won just five
of 11 starts. Glavine has won 12 of his last 13 starts.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: TABLE TENNIS  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Mandarin Chinese, the term for table tennis translates to
``national ball,'' and the last Olympic tournament in Atlanta did
indeed bear a strong resemblance to a domestic competition as the
Chinese swept all four events: men's singles and doubles, and
women's singles and doubles. More domination is hardly out of the
question in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The gap between elite table tennis and Ping-Pong, the basement
variety of the game that the majority of us have sampled at some
stage, is as wide as the gap between a game of crazy eights and
world-class bridge.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Same as in the basement. Matches are bet-of-five affairs and
games are won by the first player to reach 21. If a game is tied at
20, a player must win by two points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Two adversaries in the world championships once required more
than an hour to finish a single point. But table tennis is normally
a much more expeditious affair with its spinning, elusive serves
and aggressive topspin forehand drives. The objective is to keep an
opponent perpetually off balance by disguising shot direction and
producing rhythm shifts, sharp angles and drop shots.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   China's Liu Guoliang won the men's singles and doubles at the
1996 Games, and at age 24, he remains at the peak of his powers.
But the last year has been one of controversy and frustration.
Shortly after winning the men's world singles title last year, he
tested positive for the banned substance epitosterone. A legal and
medical marathon ensued, and Liu was finally cleared by the
International Table Tennis Federation in April. By then, he had
already lost to the 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner and his
Swedish compatriot Jorgen Persson as the Chinese were upset by the
Swedes in the world team championships. The women's singles
favorites are China's Wang Nan and her doubles partner, Li Ju.

SCREENING IS STILL POROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Whether or not the new blood-and-urine test for the
banned performance-enhancing drug EPO catches many cheaters in
Sydney, it's already been a deterrent. The Chinese last week yanked
an astounding 27 athletes from their team, all of them in endurance
events (distance running, rowing, swimming, and kayaking), where
abuse of erythropoietin is most rampant.
</P>
<P>
   If the test works as claimed, and insiders' estimates of EPO use
is anywhere near accurate, dozens of athletes should test positive
at these Olympics. But the record shows that virtually nobody gets
caught at the Games. After all the hype about state-of-the-art
testing, only two athletes (both women) were nailed in Atlanta. And
only 400 of the 10,000-plus athletes here will be tested for EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new World Anti-Doping Agency is up and running, it
hasn't been in place long enough to make a difference. And until
it's completely independent from the International Olympic
Committee (vice president Dick Pound heads it), critics say, the
agency will never be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC dismissed last week's 107-page report on Olympic
drug use from the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
as hypocritical hectoring from the Americans, the report was
dead-on when it ripped the IOC and the international sports
federations for their ``crazy quilt of jurisdictions'' and
inconsistent policies for fighting doping.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the dopers have been winning the war for years. And
even if the EPO test is foolproof (and that's unclear), many
athletes reportedly have already switched to Hemopure, an
artificial blood substitute. And the IOC still has no test for
banned human growth hormones, which are believed to be widely used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, every performance in an endurance event is
suspect,'' former Olympic marathon champion Frank Shorter (who
chairs the new US anti-doping agency) told Time magazine last week.
``Things have to change, or we're going under. The Olympics will be
a freak show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunset for Samaranch
</P>
<P>
   It's swan-song time for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch,
who is presiding over his final session this week after 20 years at
the top. The 80-year-old Samaranch, who took over from Lord
Killanin at the 1980 Games in Moscow, will formally step down at
next year's session _ in Moscow . . . Rave reviews for Sydney's
athletes' village, which Olympic insiders are calling the best
ever. The village, which cost $350 million to build, contains 1,000
houses and apartments and a dining hall that will serve 60,000
meals a day. ``It's not a village, it's a city,'' gushed Samaranch.
After the Games, it literally will be a city _ the suburb of
Newington . . . Though global TV viewership of these Olympics is
expected to be up by nearly 25 percent over 1996 (to a cumulative
3.7 billion), NBC is projecting a ratings decrease of roughly the
same amount, from a 21.5 to as low as 17.5. The reasons: The Games
aren't in the United States, they're two months later than usual,
and all the coverage will be on tape. Still, the network figures to
turn a small profit on its $700 million investment . . . The US
softball team's unbeaten streak is at 107 after the squad went 60-0
in its exhibition tour, mostly against local all-stars. The
Americans, who are favored to win gold again, haven't lost since
the 1998 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Splendid sendoff
</P>
<P>
   The US baseball team got a rousing adieu from Teddy Ballgame
himself before departing for the Games. Ted Williams talked to the
squad by speakerphone an hour before it boarded the plane in San
Diego. He told the players they should be proud to play for their
country _ and also offered some batting tips . . . Scratch that
idea of both Koreas marching together under the Olympic flag in
Friday's opening ceremonies. Though the South jumped at the offer
made by Samaranch during the countries' June summit, the North
never responded . . . How cold was it during the late Australian
winter? Cold enough that the turf on the soccer field in Canberra,
where the US men meet the Czechs on Wednesday, went into ``shock''
and had to be resodded . . . Phil Coles, the Australian IOC member
who was censured for his role in the Salt Lake bidding scandal and
had to quit the Sydney organizing committee, will be kept out of
the limelight at the Games. Though he'll get to present medals,
they'll probably be at kayaking, the event in which he was a
three-time Olympian . . . The comeback kid on the US Olympic team
is mountain biker Travis Brown, 30, who made the squad despite
breaking a shin when he slammed into a tree in Mexico in April.
After missing the 1996 Games with a broken collarbone, Brown wasn't
going to be kept out of another. So he pedaled an exercise bike
with one leg, went on training spins before he could walk, and was
back competing by June with his shin held together by screws . . .
For all the fuss over swimmer Jenny Thompson's pseudo-topless pose
for Sports Illustrated, so many Australian athletes are posing in
the nude that it's become ho-hum down under. The latest to bare
all: 18 of the Aussie paralympians, who wear little more than body
paint for their calendar . . . Now that Nova Peris-Kneebone has
made the Australian track and field team, half the country's
women's 4x400 relay could be made up of Aborigines. Peris-Kneebone,
who finished second to Cathy Freeman in the 400 meters at trials,
became the first of her race to win an Olympic gold medal when she
played on the field hockey team in Atlanta . . . Though they
expected jacked-up prices during the Games, Australian fans are
fuming over having to pay twice as much for meat pies, which they
gobble like hot dogs at sporting events. By US ballpark standards,
though, even the higher price is fairly cheap _ only $2.40.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: TEAM HANDBALL  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long after the Canadian James Naismith dreamed up a winter-time
diversion called basketball, the Europeans went to work codifying
another winter-time diversion. Initially an 11-on-11 outdoor game
like soccer, team handball was first played at the Olympics in 1936
in Berlin at the Germans' request.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it returned to the Olympics in the 1972 Munich
Games, it had moved indoors and become a seven-on-seven affair. So
it has remained, and though it is still a relatively popular sport
in Europe, this routinely spectacular game has the lowest of
profiles on this side of the Atlantic (NBC will not be getting up
close and personal with the handball players). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   As in Atlanta, there are 12 men's teams in the field, but the
women's field has been increased from eight to 10. A quarterfinal
round has been added in both tournaments, which means that the top
four teams in each pool will advance. This also means pool play
counts for little, particularly in the case of the women (only two
teams will be eliminated).
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   An amalgam of indoor soccer and basketball, goals are scored in
team handball by players throwing a relatively small ball into a 3
meter-by-2 meter goal minded by a goalkeeper. Team handball is much
more high-scoring than soccer; much more low-scoring than
basketball. Croatia beat Sweden, 27-26, in the last Olympic men's
final; Denmark beat South Korea, 37-33, in the women's final. No
Americans will be scoring in Sydney: Neither the American men nor
the American women qualified.

NOTRE DAME CAN'T PEN STORYBOOK FINISH

<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ It came, as expected, on a sprint by Nebraska
quarterback Eric Crouch into the left corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about the only thing that went according to script
Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium for the No. 1-ranked Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   In a contest that tested their skills but probably damaged their
standing, it took a 7-yard TD sprint by Crouch in overtime to give
the Huskers a 27-24 victory over No. 23 Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch's winning score came after the Irish had taken the lead
for the first time on a 29-yard field goal by Nick Setta on their
overtime possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do believe in themselves,'' said Nebraska coach Frank
Solich, who watched in dismay as Notre Dame returned a kickoff and
a punt for scores in the second half to wipe out a 21-7 Husker
lead. ``There was never a doubt in their mind that they would get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the game had a strange feel. Nebraska, making
its first appearance in South Bend in 52 years, came out for
warmups to cheers from more than 30,000 Husker fans who had
traveled 10 hours across I-80, scoffing up so many tickets that
Notre Dame Stadium looked more like Lincoln's Memorial Stadium,
with many in the sellout crowd of 80,232 wearing red.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers played the role of favorite at the start, with
Crouch rushing for the first of his three touchdowns on a textbook
62-yard option run that split the seams of the Irish defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame, which came into the game a rare two-touchdown
underdog at home, responded, going 82 yards in 11 plays, with Tony
Fisher picking up the final 2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, using a game plan that Knute Rockne would have loved,
did not throw a pass during the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue, Nebraska answered with a 65-yard march that
consumed 15 plays, 14 on the ground, with Crouch going the final
yard for a 14-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like a typical Nebraska win was in order when the
Huskers upped the lead to 21-7 in the third quarter on a 28-yard
run by tailback Dan Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   But then a potentially dangerous and fatal flaw _ if the Huskers
intend to compete for the national championship _ showed its face.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of highlight-film plays, Notre Dame climbed back into
the game when Julius Jones took the kickoff following Alexander's
TD run and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed four minutes later by an 83-yard punt return
by Joey Getherall for a touchdown. Suddenly, with 12:48 left in
regulation, it was 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, I never thought we wouldn't win the
game,'' said Notre Dame coach Bob Davie.
</P>
<P>
   The final seconds of regulation were as bizzare as the rest of
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Irish had forced Nebraska to punt, Notre Dame had a
chance to win in regulation. But Davie chose the conservative
approach, staying on the ground as the clock rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question it was the right thing to do it that way,''
said Davie, taking into account quarterback Arnaz Battle's anemic
passing performance (3 of 15, 40 yards). ``I wanted to get that
game into overtime to give us a chance. I did not want to put the
football in the air at that time. I would do it 10 out of 10
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had the ball first in overtime, but after getting to
the Nebraska 8, the Huskers toughened and Setta kicked his field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Nebraska's turn. Faced with the ruination of their
season, the Huskers took care of business, with Crouch sprinting
into the end zone for the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you want to do is get the ball in the end
zone,'' said Crouch. ``When you see that daylight, the overtime,
the situation, it was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish's feelings of disappointment were lessened by their
overall effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities to win this game,'' said Davie.
``It's disappointing. It was the kind of game you liked being in
that situation at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Irish did not win a game they thought they could
have and arguably should have won. ``It's a bottom-line business,''
said Davie. ``And the bottom line is we didn't win.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poets, writers, and conventional wisdom tell us that spring is
the season for rebirth and renewal. The NBA runs by a different
calendar, as we've witnessed in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland and Los Angeles, two individuals trying to resurrect
careers and rehabilitate images said they were ready to do both.
There was no accompanying laugh track in either case, only a
certain sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   You can usually bank on some form of athletic contrition _ dare
we say honesty? _ at the start of training camp every year. A
player will own up to the fact that he had a lousy year, that he
was hurt, that he was mad at the coach, whatever. The other time
for such rare candor is when a player changes teams. That is what
we have now in the cases of Shawn Kemp and Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who basically cheated the Cavaliers for the last two years
when he stopped taking care of himself, stood before reporters in
Portland and said, ``It's going to be the rebirth of my career.''
Never mind that only a few months earlier, in his annual exit
interview with his then-bosses in Cleveland, he pledged to
``reinvent'' himself. Or, that three years earlier, he told
Cleveland reporters, ``I just look forward to coming here and
starting up another half of my career and playing better than I did
the previous eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cavs general manager Jim Paxson, ``Shawn was unhappy in
Seattle. The Cavs made a commitment to him. That same commitment
wasn't coming back. So (trading him) was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Down I-5 a bit, in Los Angeles, the world champion Lakers
unveiled their latest acquisition, Rider, in a teleconference.
Rider basically has been a human carcinogen everywhere he's been,
including Atlanta under the notoriously even-tempered Lenny
Wilkens. He's been with Minnesota, Portland, Atlanta, and, now, the
Lakers. You guessed it; he's been reborn and found his niche,
finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking long-term, not short-term,'' Rider told reporters
after signing a one-year deal. ``I'm looking for a new start.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he talked to coach Phil Jackson and was told, ``I
won't give you any problems if you don't give me any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is old news.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``We got ourselves a young man who's very
talented, who wants to make some changes in perception in how he's
been looked at as a ballplayer. He's given us some real good verbal
promises that he will do what it takes to do whatever he has to do
as a player and whatever spot he has to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded very familiar to Stan Kasten, the president of the
Hawks. As he put it, ``I would bet that you could replay what he
said out there and what he said here and you couldn't tell which
was which.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks acquired Rider from Portland last summer, then he tore
apart the team and was eventually released. But when you have his
talent, and his personality, there always will be a market. The
Lakers also got him for the NBA minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what he did to us, he's a very likable, intelligent
guy,'' Kasten said. ``And I think it's a good deal for the Lakers.
He does have All-Star talent. And if it doesn't work out, you can
always release him. What have you lost?''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks had lost their season by the time they had to release
Rider. The Cavs lost theirs as well, and also saw diminishing
returns from a player they hoped would make them a contender in the
watered-down Eastern Conference. Kemp's salary and weight, however,
were on the increase.
</P>

   But, as both players said recently, those days are gone. They
are testament to the NBA axiom that talent never goes unnoticed or
unrewarded and that previous ``lapses'' are unimportant, if not
altogether meaningless. And as we've seen with Latrell Sprewell,
even the presumably incorrigible can be rehabilitated.

   The Hawks, by the way, soon could have a new but familiar name
in their front office: Dominique Wilkins. The Hawks' career leader
in five categories is talking with his original NBA employer about
a job in basketball operations. Wilkins played 12 years with
Atlanta, then was dealt to the Clippers during the 1994-95 season,
never to return. He also played with Boston, San Antonio, and
Orlando. Romantics say he never should have left Atlanta. ``He
wouldn't if his agent hadn't demanded a Larry Johnson contract,''
Kasten said . . . Many major league baseball players have pictures
of children and other family members in or around their lockers.
Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis has one of Kevin Garnett. The two
have never met. Lewis is simply a fan of the Timberwolves forward.
``I have been following him ever since he came into the league and
try to see him during the season when they come to Oakland,'' Lewis
said. ``I love that he's always working to improve his game. Every
year I see him, he comes back with something new to his game. I
like that. I also like that he's proven people wrong about coming
out of high school.'' . . . The Bulls now can market their new
``M&AMP;M boys'' in Ron Mercer and Brad Miller. Just what they wanted
all along, right? The just-signed Miller stated that he'd never
played for a losing program, in high school, college, or the pros.
All good things etc. The Hornets aren't exactly losing sleep over
yet another defection due to monetary matters. They feel that
rookie center Jamaal Magliore could be even better, and they also
have several other big fellas on the roster . . . Rick Pitino did
an online chat this past week in conjunction with the new Celtics
Web site. He offered no eye-openers, but he did say that if he
could add one player to his team, it would be Tim Duncan. ``He has
all the attributes I like. He passes from the post. He plays
defense.'' Pitino added that he has no more books on his plate.

   Speaking of plates, Celtics GM Chris Wallace took Chris Carr out
to lunch _ to Papa Gino's. What, is Paul Gaston watching the
expense accounts? ``Not at all,'' laughed Wallace. ``Chris said he
knew of this great pizza and pasta place, so I said, `Fine.' ''
Wallace reports that Kris Clack, the team's second-round draft pick
in 1999 and participant in July's summer league, is exploring
options overseas. Frankly, the Celtics hope he goes because their
roster is full (16 players) and the 2-3 position is overloaded.
``It would be tough to fit him in,'' Wallace said. The Celtics
would retain Clack's rights if he went overseas. If he reported to
camp, the team would lose his rights if it had to release him . . .
The latest on Iakovos ``Jake'' Tsakalidis: It appears that the
Suns, who took him in the first round of the draft, and his
European team, AEK, will take the matter to arbitration in London
this month. AEK says it is not interested in a settlement,
believing it has Tsakalidis firmly under contract. The team owner
also has plenty of drachmas, mainly because he is one of the
largest yogurt distributors in Europe. There's also some bad blood
involved. AEK is upset about the ``Free Jake'' T-shirts that the
Suns unveiled, as well as Tsakalidis going public with his desire
to play in the NBA without running it first by his Greek team.
Tsakalidis, meanwhile, is working out in the Phoenix area and has
the NBA on his side in the arbitration process. One possible twist:
AEK may present evidence that Tsakalidis was 23 at the time of the
draft, which would be over the age limit for foreign players. The
Suns, and everyone else in the NBA, operated under the assumption
that he was 21 and that, too, was Tsakalidis's stance when he met
with league officials and Players Association officials prior to
the draft. In other words, the NBA doesn't care how old he is . . .
Chris Gatling may not be happy about being dealt to Cleveland, but
the sting already has been eased financially: He is paid in the
summer in one lump sum. His ``hesitation'' at jumping to join the
Cavs may well be tied more to a desire for an extension, not an
unusual request for a David Falk client . . . The agent for Pervis
Ellison reports that his client is healthy and eager to play this
season. Honest. Right now, however, it's a case of unrequited
affection, which should surprise no one. ``Yes, it's a bit of a
sell job,'' conceded Bill Strickland. ``But the best way for Pervis
to sell himself is by getting into a camp and having a team see
him. I know he has a reputation about being injured. But I have not
heard anyone question his talent. It's simply a matter of keeping
him on the floor.'' Strickland believes someone will extend an
invitation to Ellison, who is only 33 and, need we note, does not
have a lot of miles on the tires. In fact, Strickland said Ellison
agreed to go on the injured list last March _ at the request of a
teammate _ with what everyone knew was a phony back injury so
Walter McCarty could be activated. ``That was to his detriment,''
Strickland said. ``That didn't help his reputation. He made a
personal sacrifice. We'll see what happens. He's healthy now,
working out, enthusiastic and I'm hopeful and optimistic we can
find something for him.'' Stranger things have happened . . . We
would be remiss not to pass along the following comments of Tom
Wilson, president of the Detroit Pistons. Talking about the team's
image problem (season-ticket renewals are way down), he told Chris
McCosky of the Detroit News that Grant Hill, ``as great a player as
he was, wasn't a reflection of this city.'' (Uh, Tom, you play in
the suburbs.) ``This is a gritty city. Even white-collar people
think they are blue-collar people. We respond to Isiah Thomas, Bill
Laimbeer, Kirk Gibson. Guys who you knew wanted to do anything to
win.'' And Hill? ``Grant is a fluid, elegant basketball player. I
am not sure this city responded to that.'' Hill's first visit to
his former haunt is not until March 4. NBC has the game.

FLORIE HAS SEVERE INJURY TO HIS EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Sox pitcher Bryce Florie underwent surgery Saturday morning
for a severe eye injury, and following the nearly two-hour
procedure, the team physician said the 30-year-old reliever has
only a ``guarded'' prognosis for normal vision returning to his
right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Florie suffered what Dr. Bill Morgan called ``macular trauma''
to the right eye after being hit by a Ryan Thompson line drive in
the ninth inning of Friday night's 4-0 loss to the Yankees. Florie
will spend several days in the hospital and may face two more
operations. But seven words stood out in the four-paragraph release
from the Red Sox: ``the prognosis for reasonable vision is
guarded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible, just horrible,'' said Pedro Martinez, who, when
asked for his reaction, pounded his chest with his fist. ``I have
trouble talking about it. It's awful. You just pray to God that
he's healthy and that he can get back to being in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tim Wakefield, ``It's heartbreaking. It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said simply, ``I hope everything works out
for him physically so he won't have any further impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, was more upset than Thompson, who was not aware
of the severity of the prognosis until after Saturday's 5-3 New
York victory. He had called the Red Sox clubhouse earlier in the
day to offer his best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be hard for me, very hard, especially if the
guy isn't going to be able to see,'' Thompson said. ``I don't want
to take food off someone's table. We're all warriors and
competitors, but I don't want to end somebody's career. I have a
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, performed by Dr. Subhransu Ray at Massachusetts Eye
and Ear Infirmary, relieved pressure in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said there also was damage to the retina, which will be
assessed over the next two to three days to determine whether
surgery is needed. He said the retina was not detached, although
there was bleeding behind it. He also said Florie did not have
``entrapment of the eye within the socket,'' which he characterized
as good news.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the macular trauma, Florie also sustained three
fractures in the eye socket area (nasal, medial wall, and socket
floor) that will require surgery. The timetable for those
procedures will be addressed in the next three to five days unless
there is further swelling. In that case, doctors could wait another
two weeks, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary told the
Associated Press that Florie was in stable condition and good
spirits. The hospital subsequently referred all calls on Florie to
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The news was eerily familiar to Thompson, who 10 years ago got
hit in the face by a pitch from Russell Springer while playing in
the minor leagues in Dunedin, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fractured my eye socket and broke my nose in seven places,''
Thompson said. ``The doctor told me my face looked like someone had
crushed a Ritz cracker. So I sort of know how Bryce feels. It
wasn't very pretty. Mentally, it took me at least two years to come
back from it. But they threw me back into the lineup a week later
so I wouldn't be too screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish Bryce well,'' he went on. ``When I get the chance,
I'll give him a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Florie never lost consciousness after getting hit Friday night
and was taken off the field in a golf cart, a towel covering his
face. He was seen briefly at the hospital that night by pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan, who spoke to Florie's father before the pitcher
went in for X-rays and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty bad,'' Kerrigan said. ``It was hard to look at.
His face was really swollen. His lips were swollen. His right eye
was completely shut. He could talk, but it was an effort for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said he figured Thompson's live drive was traveling at
110-115 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually saw the blood fly,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, Williams said he chatted briefly with
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to do his job, trying to hit him hard, and
Florie was trying to get him out,'' said Williams. ``Then something
like that happens. It kind of puts things in perspective in life,
doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's appearance was the 29th of the season for Florie,
who had an 0-4 record and 4.56 ERA. All of the appearances were out
of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Florie broke into the majors with the San Diego Padres in 1994
and also pitched for Milwaukee and Detroit. The Red Sox acquired
him on July 31, 1999, from the Tigers.

JETS FEEL CONNECTED TO OLD TIES WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Shakespeare would be better than sportswriters
at untangling the knots that link these two football families, the
Patriots and the Jets. The Montagues and Capulets may have feuded,
but that was eons before video cameras, sports talk radio, and
hordes of sportswriters eager to pounce on every twist of a plot
that has endless turns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, year by year, the knots that bind _ and blind _ these
football families grow knottier and knottier. The feud has
implications far from the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this recent scene:
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh had just finished a press conference at the Jets'
cramped little headquarters on the campus of Hofstra University.
Groh was much more relaxed than on the previous day, when the coach
had become irked at the endless questions from a large New York
media crowd about what he, time and again, called ``the soap
opera.'' Now the TV cameras were gone, and Groh was relaxing for a
few moments before getting back to work preparing his team for
Monday night's game against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that game?'' Groh was saying. ``Remember how we had a
big lead early in that game?''
</P>
<P>
   Clarification is needed. The ``we'' Groh was referring to was
not the New York Jets but the New England Patriots. The ``we''
referred to a beleaguered New England defense on the afternoon of
Oct. 6, 1996, in Baltimore. The Ravens quarterback, a certain
proficient passer by the name of Vinny Testaverde, had shredded the
Patriots' poor and porous defense in a wild game ultimately won by
New England, 46-38.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we'' had a big early lead, Groh went on, ``and the thing
about Vinny is if you let him throw a lot of balls, he's going to
complete a lot of balls. And I think if we had not been so far
ahead early, and not had to defend 25 or 30 passes in a row from
Vinny, we would not have been as stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But Groh was not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``that game probably had a lot to do with
Vinny being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here.
</P>
<P>
   With ``us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's true,'' said Groh. ``When he became available a
couple of summers later, we remembered what he had done to us that
game. We knew what Vinny could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another weave of the tangled web. Vinny Testaverde is
quarterback of the New York Jets because of what he did one
long-ago afternoon to the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And more weaves intertwine.
</P>
<P>
   During the Patriots' 1996 Super Bowl season, Groh was New
England's linebackers coach. The defense started to come around in
midseason after that horrible game against the Ravens, another
against Jacksonville, and still another against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Groh was saying, ``Bill had joined us that
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill.
</P>
<P>
   As in Bill Belichick, the extraordinary defensive mind with whom
Groh coached for so long with the Giants, Browns, Patriots, and
Jets. His close friend, but now the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   And now the words were flowing from Groh about how he and
Belichick, now the Patriots' head coach, and Bill Parcells, then
the Patriots' head coach and later the Jets' head man, had molded a
team that jelled in December and January, ``and my sweetest memory
of Foxborough was that Jacksonville game (for the AFC title). That
was a great, great day, and we played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh went on, ``I remember when the AFC trophy was presented to
the team and when I finally got my hand on it. Willie McGinest had
it, and he and a bunch of players were walking around the perimeter
of the stadium holding it up, showing it to the fans. Then I just
kind of went down to the sidelines and I just sort of stood there
and watched the whole scene _ the joy of the fans and the pride of
the players. And I'm just watching it and I remember saying to
myself, `In four years, to have gone from the worst record in the
league to going to the Super Bowl, it's so great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed down there and watched it all. No one will ever need
to show me a movie or a picture of that day. I've still got it
clearly in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   There still is warmth in Groh's heart for Patriots defenders
such as McGinest, Chris Slade, Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, and Ted
Johnson. Especially Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while,'' Groh says, ``there'd be a message on
my machine from Ted: `Coach, this is Ted. Nice job. You're doing
well.' And I'd call him up and say, `Ted, how are you doing?' I
wouldn't be doing any tampering, just seeing how he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not play well in last Sunday's opener against Tampa
Bay, clearly rusty from missing the entire exhibition season with a
hamstring injury. Groh has seen the films and would like to get on
the phone again to tell Johnson his game will be back soon. But of
course, Groh can't.
</P>
<P>
   The ``we'' have become ``they.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Ted feels like I do,'' said Groh. ``Uneasy. Not on a
personal level, but on a professional level.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain of events that resulted in Groh becoming head coach of
the Jets in January _ Parcells resigning, and Belichick then
walking away on what was to be his first day on the job to take the
Patriots' position instead _ has been much written about. But just
as Groh will say he feels comfortable with Parcells, now director
of football operations, still working at the Jets' headquarters _
Groh says he frequently talks with Parcells about personnel and X's
and O's, and he'd be foolish not to take advantage of such a
bountiful resource _ there is another lingering presence a few
steps down the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jets locker room this past week, players talked openly of
how much they miss and respect the coach of the enemy, Belichick,
just as Patriots players three years ago said many of the same
words about the then-new coach of the Jets, Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Victor Green called Belichick ``a genius.'' Cornerback
Aaron Glenn described the New England coach as ``a mastermind in
drawing up defensive schemes.'' And Testaverde recalled how
Belichick had endured the fiercest of storms in Cleveland by
benching Browns icon Bernie Kosar, eventually replacing him with
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big game,'' Testaverde said. ``I don't
think either team's going to go out and just do the same old things
we've done against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily for the Jets, a home opener against an opponent
without an offensive line might be cause for salivation. Yet Jet
after Jet last week talked of how much they respect Belichick, all
having seen the schemes of their former defensive coordinator
frustrate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Other old twists of the feud have loosened up as well. Jets
backup quarterback Ray Lucas, for one, talked of how pleasant it
was for him to go up to Foxborough last season and lead his team to
a 24-17 win ``because the coach on the other side (Pete Carroll)
gave up on me and didn't think I could play.'' Carroll is gone now,
however, and, said Lucas, ``I still have a lot of friends on that
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the other side of the soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Brisby, for instance, made a half-hearted effort to
satisfy media questions about whether he thirsts to show up the
Patriots, who cut him last month. The wide receiver said he
couldn't believe Drew Bledsoe said he had lost speed going down the
sidelines, and he wanted to show New England it had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brisby was much more passionate about how he misses receiver
Troy Brown. ``Troy and I were together all the time,'' said Brisby.
``You'd never see me and Troy apart. If you saw Troy, you saw me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got home from Green Bay last Sunday and learned Brown
had run back a punt for a TD against Tampa Bay and played an
outstanding game, Brisby ached to do what he knew he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call Troy up and congratulate him,'' said Brisby.
``But I couldn't. Not this week.''

KEY POINTS ON BRUINS' COMPASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what you will about the Bruins having holdouts yet again
(it's epidemic around the league), there are some aspects of the
club that have improved. Once the three arrive (and it's a
certainty that at least Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov will be
here, with Anson Carter a longer shot), the team will be
competitive in the Eastern Conference. A contender? Too soon to
say. Many things have to go right, all players have to reach their
potential, and the negativity surrounding last year needs to be put
to rest.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are the critical components that have to come
together if the Black and Gold are going to succeed in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   --The team concept: For reasons no one can adequately explain,
there was none last season. Perhaps it was the multitude of
injuries, perhaps there were some wrong elements, perhaps it was
that nebulous term ``chemistry'' or lack of same. Whatever the
reason, this edition is going to have to figure out a way to master
it and embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need attitude, personality, approach, and accountability
to each other to become a team,'' said president/general manager
Harry Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I feel comfortable with the individuals we have
but I'm waiting to see how we turn out as a team. I always felt we
had a team and that they had the attitude, they've always shown me
that. They didn't show me that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   --A good start: Everyone remembers the 0-5-4 beginning of last
year. It wasn't even the goalies' fault. In Byron Dafoe's absence,
John Grahame and Rob Tallas played very well, but the rest of the
club faltered. This year, with so much on the line, it can't happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first road trip is obviously very important, just like it
was last year,'' said Dafoe, who won't be sitting home in a
contract dispute this year. ``We need to get off to a good start
and get confidence back in this hockey club and in this city. It's
so much easier to continue playing the season when you look at the
standings and you're 10-5 instead of 5-10 just because when you hit
that ice before every game, you just brim with confidence knowing
you're one of the top teams in the league rather than clawing up
from the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong start also is important for coach Pat Burns, who was
embattled last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way things went last year and the heat Pat did take,
obviously we're all thankful he's back,'' said Dafoe. ``For him, as
well as the team, a good start is crucial just to get the pressure
off all of us. If we go 7-2 in our first nine games, we're putting
last year behind us, and who cares? It has nothing to do with this
year. That's why the first 5-10 games really are important.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mastering the basics, which include faceoffs: the Bruins were
dreadful in the circle last year because they were center-poor.
This year shouldn't be like that with Jason Allison healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I talked about, unfair criticism, last year,''
said Burns. ``At the end of the year, we just wanted to see
somebody's head roll so bad. It was unfair. We had nobody to take
faceoffs last year. We had one bona fide centerman last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Rolston is not a centerman. We had him playing it. We
had Mikko Eloranta playing it. He is not a centerman. We had Robbie
DiMaio. We had one guy who could take faceoffs at one particular
part of the year and that was Joe. You're asking a 20-year-old kid
to go out there and win every faceoff and win the hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people weren't paying attention to what was going on.
That's probably the worst thing. These kids tried hard but it's
difficult for a guy coming in from the American League to step into
the National League on a completely unexperienced team and expect
them to haul that team around.''
</P>
<P>
   --Size: The players lost to injuries were crucial in not only
skills but size. This edition, which has added mammoth defenseman
Peter Popovic and tough forward Lee Goren, among others, isn't
going to get pushed around. Last season, as Burns put it, there was
no one between the opponent and the Bruins' net. No one got in
anyone's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have size,'' said Burns. ``This team didn't hit
worth hell last year because we didn't have anybody to do it. I see
things like Joe Hulbig going around hitting people _ that's what we
want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't run out of bounds in this sport,'' Sinden said.
``You've got to know that some time or other you're going to get
caught between the boards and another player. If you watch the
playoffs, that's the way all the teams play. That's the way we've
got to play.''
</P>
<P>
   --Better team defense: Don Sweeney was the only blue-liner who
had a decent season last year. Some were burdened by injuries (Kyle
McLaren), some were worn down from being asked to do too much (Ray
Bourque), and some just looked confused (Hal Gill). Burns said he
is expecting Gill to come back strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be a physical player this year,'' said Burns. ``If
he thinks he's going to finesse the puck around the rink, he's got
another thing coming. I watched him (Friday) and I saw things I saw
from him last year _ overhandling the puck. He came in here and
made the team because he kept things simple. He's got to use his
size, too. He's smart enough to come around and be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   --Additions: There are plenty, most notably Paul Coffey. He has
the credentials, certainly. He has the health now and he can sure
skate. Signing him was worth the gamble. Forward Andrei Kovalenko
should add something to the mix; he said he's expecting this to be
his best season ever. The Bruins will also have a healthy goalie.
Dafoe is back and says he'll be on top of things come opening
night. Sinden said he and Grahame could be among the best tandems
in the league if Dafoe plays like he did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So, how will it all come together?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make a team out of them,'' said Sinden. ``And
that's the chore.''

   Fuhr drops anchor
</P>
<P>
   Flames goalie Grant Fuhr elected to retire after 19 NHL seasons
and will join Calgary as a goaltending coach. The 37-year-old Fuhr
won five Stanley Cups with Edmonton in seven years (1984-90), and
his departure leaves Coffey and Mark Messier as the only active
players left from that dynasty. Fuhr's frail knee just wouldn't let
him continue, and a Caribbean cruise with other sports stars made
him sure about his desire to end his playing career. ``The bottom
line was the knee would not do it anymore,'' said Fuhr. ``(The
Flames) let me make my choice. On the cruise, I got a chance to
talk to Steve Carlton, Ozzie Smith, and Harry Carson and other guys
and that was good. Everyone wants to leave on their terms. No one
wants to be forced out, so getting a chance to talk to them made it
easier.'' . . . There has been enough turmoil in Philadelphia with
the Eric Lindros and John LeClair sagas, so it made sense that
management would attempt to calm the upheaval by agreeing to terms
on a two-year deal with 23-year-old goalie Brian Boucher, who is
coming off an impressive rookie campaign. Owner Ed Snider joined
the negotiations late last week in an effort to get it done. The
Flyers are banking a lot on Boucher, with veteran John
Vanbiesbrouck having been traded to the Islanders. ``Brian played
such a big role in the success we had in the second half of the
season and in the playoffs that he's obviously very important to
us,'' said general manager Bob Clarke. ``With his age and his
relative inexperience, he couldn't afford to miss training camp, so
it's nice to get the contract done.'' LeClair, meanwhile, wants a
long-term deal and has given the team until midnight Sunday night
to get it done. If an agreement isn't reached, LeClair said he'll
play out his one-year contract (for a $7 million salary awarded in
arbitration) and become an unrestricted free agent next summer.
LeClair said he won't negotiate with the team during the season and
won't re-sign with the Flyers next summer, so this is their shot to
keep him. The other option is to trade him to a team that would
give him a long-term deal.

<P>
   Coyote circling back
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how well goalie Nikolai Khabibulin
plays this year after a season away from the NHL. It appears
there's a good chance Khabibulin will be back with the Phoenix
Coyotes after sitting out last season in a contract dispute. Wayne
Gretzky, part of the new Phoenix ownership group, has said he would
like to get Khabibulin back in the fold. The goalie practiced last
week with his teammates for the first time in more than a year.
``With a commitment on his part, we'd like to get Khabby signed and
we're going to get Khabby signed,'' said Gretzky. ``We've had some
early positive conversations with his representative and that's
where we are now.'' . . . Seems like a common theme these days:
players on the outside looking in as training camp gets under way.
San Jose has more than a half-dozen restricted free agents still
haggling for deals. The Sabres' big ticket is center Michael Peca.
Word out of Buffalo is that the sides are vastly apart and that
Peca is seeking something in the neighborhood of $4 million a
season . . . The climate appears no better in New Jersey, home of
the Stanley Cup champions. Two crucial players are missing from
training camp: forward Jason Arnott and defenseman Scott
Niedermayer. Each is seeking $4 million a year, while the club is
willing to pay Arnott $2.5 million and Niedermayer about $3.5
million . . . One of the more poignant stories coming out of Bruins
camp comes from 21-year-old defenseman Denis Timofeev, a Moscow
native who was Boston's seventh pick in 1997. At the end of last
year, when he was playing in Greenville of the East Coast League,
Timofeev's family home in Russia burned to the ground. When the
blaze broke out, his parents were sound asleep, but the family dog
woke them and they escaped to safety. Tragically, the animal didn't
survive . . . The New York Rangers have a new GM in Glen Sather, a
new coach in Ron Low, and quite a few of the same players. A key
one _ goalie Mike Richter _ likely won't be ready for opening night
because of a left knee injury. Richter tore the anterior cruciate
ligament during last season's All-Star skills competition and
underwent surgery in April after it was clear the Rangers were not
going to the postseason. Low said he's expecting it will be late
next month before Richter is ready to go. ``It's something that the
doctors are going to have to have a big part in,'' said Low.
``We'll likely talk to them in training camp when we do the
physicals to see how far he has come along.'' . . . There isn't
much news to report with regard to Lindros, who remains the
property of the Flyers despite the prevailing wisdom that he'll
never play for them again. Lindros is in Ontario, continuing to
recover from multiple concussions. The belief is that once he's
healthier, he will be traded. It could be January before he's ready
to resume playing. The Flyers have taken steps to move on. ``This
team will play good,'' predicted Clarke. ``We're not going to roll
over and die because Eric Lindros isn't here. No one player can
replace a player of Lindros's stature but you hope the group
strength is going to be enough. Years ago, the NHL marketing
decided it would be `Wayne Gretzky and LA' and `Eric Lindros and
the Flyers.' Eric was put in that position whether he wanted to be
there or not. We never felt that way. We feel the strength of the
organization is the team.'' . . . 25 days to opening night.

CRIMSON AND PURPLE BLEND NICELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Birk isn't making use of his economics degree from Harvard
exactly the way he'd planned, but at least he's found some use for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings' starting center is very likely the only
NFL player doing a weekly radio spot in which he dispenses stock
tips and investment advice. This he does on KFAN, a Minneapolis-St.
Paul area radio station, on a show called ``Matt's Money.'' To date
Matt hasn't made much money, because he's a former sixth-round
draft choice who commanded little attention when the Vikings
selected him three years ago. But that was then and this is now,
and now is his time in the center of the Vikings' offensive line, a
position he assumed this summer after the defection of two-time Pro
Bowl center Jeff Christy to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really wasn't the plan,'' Birk said. ``All the money I
spent on that degree. Someday I hope I'll use it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Birk keeps playing the way he's been playing, he may use his
economics expertise to renegotiate his contract, because
6-foot-4-inch, 304-pound, athletically gifted starting centers are
hard to find _ and finding them in Cambridge is probably hardest of
all. Yet that's where the St. Paul native ended up after two years
of high school football and a lifetime of academic interest, and
that's where the Vikings found him in 1998 long after ESPN's
coverage of the draft had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I was surprised to play in college, let alone the NFL,
so I was a little surprised to be drafted,'' Birk said. ``I only
started playing football in the 10th grade to be with my friends.
My family is not a football family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is the only sport recognized in my household, which
is kind of nice because if I go there for a free meal or to get my
laundry done I don't have to talk football. I think they're
enjoying the ride right now, but I know when football is over,
they'll be more proud of me for what I do next.''
</P>
<P>
   What Birk does next may have to wait for quite some time,
however. After two years as a backup to Christy, Birk was thrust
into the competition to replace his former roommate this summer and
won the position quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, though, Birk wasn't expecting to win anything
but a plane ticket back home and a chance to begin what he expected
would be his real career on Wall Street after an unusual summer job
in Mankato, Minn., training camp home of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie I had that Harvard label and I wanted to drop
it,'' Birk said. ``When I came in as a rookie, I knew chances were
I wouldn't make the team. Not many late-round picks from Harvard
make it, but I don't focus on results, I focus on effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rookie year there were so many ups and downs. You have more
bad days than good. Every day you doubt yourself. Then you have a
good practice or you make a couple of good blocks and you think you
can do it if you can get consistent enough fast enough. Certainly I
went through some self-doubt that first season, but I got to play
half of the last regular-season game and held my own. That's the
moment I knew I could play at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offseason, everyone knew Jeff was probably leaving, so it
wasn't a shock when it became official. A lot of guys play a long
time and don't get a chance like this. It was my spot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Birk began the process of winning that spot when he arrived at
Harvard and began a workout routine that ultimately allowed him to
gain significant weight, developing from an admittedly ``lean'' 230
to a stout 304 in seven years. Had he not, there would be no place
for him along that purple line, because stout is the way they like
their linemen in Minnesota; Birk is almost a midget next to
346-pound guard David Dixon, 338-pound tackle Korey Stringer, and
308-pound tackle Todd Steussie.
</P>
<P>
   Birk's body began to change (with some assistance from the
Harvard weight room) as he led the Crimson to an Ivy League title
and 9-1 record his senior season that included the requisite win
over Yale. By the next spring, he was on his way to Mankato, not
Wall Street, and on his way to expanding his waistline, not his
stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first Harvard graduate to play in the National
Football League since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly Nebraska,'' Birk said. ``One reason I think
I've made it this far coming from Harvard is that I had a great
(line) coach and the fact that everyone knows offensive linemen
mature later than guys at other positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a basketball player in high school, but once I got to
Harvard I hit the weights and was able to gain weight and still
keep my athleticism. There are tons of guys who are big and strong
but only a few can also move their feet. That's what makes an NFL
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends from Harvard think this is pretty cool. One
of my roommates moved out here and he's living with me right now.
They're proud of me but they don't just see me as a football
player. They know there's more to me than that, which is
comforting. Otherwise football can beat you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some days you get tired of thinking about football
because it's 80 hours a week, but if I was working on Wall Street,
that would be 80 hours a week, too. It's how I make my living. Who
would have predicted that?''
</P>
<P>
   Not so many years and pounds ago, nobody. Not even Matt Birk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shared honor
</P>
<P>
   Birk is not the only Harvard grad in the NFL. Linebacker Isaiah
Kacyvenski, a fourth-round pick of the Seattle Seahawks in April,
is a player Birk remembers from his college days. ``His locker was
next to mine one year at Harvard,'' Birk said. ``I haven't talked
to him, but to tell you the truth I'm kind of sad at losing the
dubious distinction of being the only Harvard grad in the NFL.'' .
. . Henry Thomas watched highlights of Minnesota quarterback Daunte
Culpepper running wild last Sunday and came to one conclusion.
``It's about time for me to retire when the quarterbacks are as big
as I am,'' the Patriots' defensive tackle said. Actually that's not
quite accurate, but Thomas isn't off by much. Culpepper, who in
last week's 30-27 victory over the Bears became the first Viking
quarterback to rush for three touchdowns in a game, stands nearly
6-5, weighs 255, and runs the 40 in 4.6 seconds. That makes him
nearly 3 inches taller and only 20 pounds lighter than Thomas, who
will be among the Patriots chasing Culpepper next Sunday. Also
doing some chasing will be ``undersized'' linebacker Tedy Bruschi,
who at 6-1, 245, will be giving away both height and weight to a
quarterback for the first time in memory. ``I've never seen a
quarterback like him with that size,'' Bruschi said. ``You can see
his strength just watching him on television. A guy like that
changes your mentality of tackling. Normally, you want to put a big
lick on a quarterback but with Culpepper you've got to think about
your tackling process. You want to be sure and get some cloth or
some leg and then hope for some friends.'' . . . Despite
Culpepper's size and speed, Bruschi said he would rather try to
tackle him than spend time chasing Doug Flutie. ``He's easier to
get a piece of than Flutie,'' Bruschi said. ``He's such a big
target, he may run over you, but at least you'll hit him. With
Flutie, you might whiff entirely.'' . . . Word out of Baltimore is
that the Ravens are pleasantly surprised at the play of Ben Coates,
so much that they played much of the game last Sunday using one
wide receiver, two backs, and two tight ends. Coach Brian Billick
has told quarterback Tony Banks that if he could get two more
completions a game this season, the Ravens would be a good team.
When the Ravens signed tight end Shannon Sharpe, Billick informed
Banks that he'd gotten him one of those extra receptions. Then he
went out and drafted Jamal Lewis and Travis Taylor and signed
Coates. One day in training camp, Banks lofted a touchdown pass to
Coates, then hollered to Billick and held up four fingers before
pointing to Coates, Sharpe, Lewis, and Taylor. In his mind, they're
worth four more catches a game. If so, the Ravens will rock . . .
Banks did not have a turnover last weekend, which is noteworthy
when you consider he fumbled 57 times and threw 50 interceptions in
the first four years of his career but has been nearly flawless
since midseason of a year ago . . . Sunday is a big game for
Billick's Ravens. The Ravens/Browns franchise has never beaten
division rival Jacksonville, going 0-10, and six of the eight
losses as the Ravens have been by a touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Emanuel rules
</P>
<P>
   Miami wide receiver Bert Emanuel has been the impetus for two
NFL rule adjustments in less than a year. The league has altered a
rule that caused the Dolphins to be penalized in their opener when
Emanuel was brought in as a short-yardage quarterback. Emanuel
wears No. 87, which is not considered a quarterback's number, and
hence he must report to an official before he enters, which he did
not do last week. He also was penalized because he was not listed
among the three quarterbacks on the active roster. The NFL ruled
last week that with all the shifting and multiple formations, it is
no longer realistic to enforce the number rule and so Emanuel
doesn't have to be listed as an emergency quarterback to play in
short yardage. Last year, it was Emanuel's diving ``non-catch'' in
the playoffs for Tampa Bay that led the league to lighten up on
rules regarding incompletions. On that play, he had control of the
football, but because the tip of it hit the ground, the pass was
ruled incomplete. ``Hopefully I won't be rewriting the whole rule
book,'' Emanuel said . . . Several NFL sources said last week that
Dick Vermeil harbors hopes of returning to NFL head coaching.
Vermeil has been publicly mum on the subject . . . It's unlikely to
happen, but it would be a writer's dream if Jets cornerback
Earthwind Moreland could somehow end up covering Patriots wide
receiver Shockmain Davis Monday night. If it happens, Dennis Miller
will have a dream opportunity to say something . . . Right tackle
Marvel Smith, a second-round draft pick, was the first rookie
offensive lineman since 1969 to start on opening day for the
Pittsburgh Steelers. That includes Hall of Fame center Mike Webster
and future Hall of Fame center Dermontti Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No room for Gruber
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Tampa Bay tackle Paul Gruber gave up on his effort to
come back from the broken leg he sustained at the end of last
season, in part because he wanted the Bucs to let him finish his
rehab at their facility in Tampa but they couldn't because they
would have had to sign him, and that was a salary cap hit they
couldn't afford for a guy they weren't sure would ever play again.
Gruber refused to return to Colorado Springs, where he'd rehabbed
over the summer, and opted to end his career after 12 noteworthy
seasons. He had talked of retiring even before the injury but tried
a comeback so he would not go out this way. Reportedly, he was
curling 250 pounds with his good leg and only 50 with his bad one a
week ago . . . If he continues to turn the ball over the way he has
since the middle of last season, Jon Kitna won't be Seattle's
starting quarterback for much longer. He had five turnovers against
Miami last week and has thrown 16 interceptions and only eight
touchdown passes in his last eight games. Seattle is 1-7 during
that stretch, and as coach Mike Holmgren pointed out, ``This is not
the Civil Service.'' Holmgren met with Kitna and backup Brock Huard
and made it clear that if things didn't change, their roles would .
. . Dallas running back Emmitt Smith seems a lock to make history
Sunday night despite the Cowboys' many problems. He needs just 8
rushing yards against the Cardinals to become the third man in NFL
history to rush for 14,000. He would join Walter Payton (16,726)
and Barry Sanders (15,269) . . . With Troy Aikman out with the
ninth concussion of his career, the Cowboys have simplified their
terminology to make it easier for Randall Cunningham to run the
offense. The Cowboys are using Ernie Zampese's offense, in which
the pass routes are all numbered, but for Cunningham's benefit they
have added names to some of those routes. They also will reduce
their use of men in motion. Considering how they were smoked by the
Eagles last Sunday, simplifying the offense may not be the best way
to go, but offensive coordinator Jack Reilly felt he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling in
</P>
<P>
   The feel-good story of the week is that Jeff Zgonina has an
apartment in St. Louis. That may not sound like much, but the
eight-year veteran has bounced around among five teams in his
career and has not lived in an apartment for five years. He has
been living in long-term hotels, including one across the street
from the Rams' practice facility for the past two years, but he's
moving into an apartment with his new wife at the same time he's
moving into the starting lineup for the first time in his career.
Zgonina will replace the injured D'Marco Farr against the Seahawks
Sunday. On hand in Seattle to see his son's first NFL start will be
Zgonina's father, who is battling pancreatic cancer . . . The plan
to limit Reggie White to 15 plays a game went out the window in one
week. Carolina head coach George Seifert had been adamant that he
would use the 38-year-old White only in rushing situations and
limited duty, but White was in for 37 plays against the Redskins
last week and asking for more snaps this week. Seifert did rotate
out his starting front four every three plays, however . . . No one
wants to admit it in Chicago, but running back Curtis Enis is close
to losing his starting job to unheralded James Allen. Enis, the
fifth player taken in the 1998 draft, carried only four times for
11 yards against Minnesota in a tight game seemingly tailor-made
for his ball-control style of rushing. Allen carried nine times for
60 yards . . . Also in Chicago, former University of New Hampshire
running back Jerry Azumah continues to make a name for himself as a
defensive back. He had one interception, a forced fumble, and a
knocked-down pass, and made two tackles in part-time duty.
Defensive coordinator Greg Blache says he wants to get Azumah on
the field more, but Azumah isn't ready to unseat starters Thomas
Smith and Walt Harris. The Bears hope he is ready by the end of the
season, because Harris can be a free agent next February and Azumah
would be a cost-effective solution to filling that spot.

MEDAL TABLES SHOULD TURN IN FAVOR OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The last time Uncle Sam sent an Olympic team down
under, Ike was president and everybody was listening for CONELRAD
alerts. The world has turned upside-down since 1956: the Iron
Curtain is long gone and the United States figures to own the
eagle's share of the medals again when the Games of the XXVIIth
Olympiad end next month.
</P>
<P>
   Though the US hasn't topped the table at a foreign Games since
1968, that should change. The Americans won 101 medals in Atlanta,
a third more than either the Germans or Russians. Even allowing for
no home cooking, they could approach that total here, with a couple
dozen each in track and field and swimming. The basketball teams
should go double gold again, the minor leaguers should get baseball
back on the podium, and Jim Pedro of Lawrence, Mass., should make
history with the first judo gold by a Yank.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the US prospects:
</P>
<P>
   ARCHERY: No golds, but good chances for bronze with the men's
team and Connecticut teenager Karen Scavotto.
</P>
<P>
   BADMINTON: Kevin Han is a one-man band. With luck, he could win
a match or two.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL: With minor leaguers replacing overmatched collegians,
the US should make it back to the medal stand. If we sent the real
Yanks, it'd be a gold.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL: The Dream Team days are over, but the men are still
the class of the planet and shouldn't lose a game. Tougher road for
the women, but they still should win their fourth gold since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   BOXING: Those four gold medals at last year's world
championships were asterisked by the Cuban pullout. Still, the US
figures to win golds with Brian Viloria (light flyweight), Ricardo
Juarez (featherweight), and Michael Bennett (heavyweight). That's
three times as many as last time.
</P>
<P>
   CANOE-KAYAK: The flatwater types are flat liners these days, but
Scott Shipley should fish a silver out of the whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   CYCLING: Chances for the first gold medal since 1984 all but
vanished when Lance Armstrong was hit by a car on the Riviera last
month. If he competes, Armstrong still could win something in the
time trial, and Marty Nothstein (track) and Alison Dunlap (mountain
bike) should be on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   DIVING: After medals (usually gold) in every Games since 1912,
this could be the year of the belly-flop. Mark Ruiz and the women's
synchro entries have an outside shot, but little more.
</P>
<P>
   EQUESTRIAN: The Americans made the medal stand in all three
events last time. This time, they may have to settle for one, in
the three-day team, which includes Bolton (Mass.)-bred Karen Lende
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   FENCING: No US woman has ever won an Olympic medal, but Iris
Zimmermann has a great chance at a bronze in foil. No chance for
the men, who haven't made the podium at a nonboycotted Games in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD HOCKEY: Neither team qualified.
</P>
<P>
   GYMNASTICS: With only two of the Magnificent Seven back, there's
no chance for a women's team gold this time, but a bronze isn't a
pipe dream. The men haven't won a team medal since 1984, but Blaine
Wilson has a fine shot at a bronze in the all-around.
</P>
<P>
   JUDO: Pedro, bronzed in Atlanta, should upgrade to gold in the
lightweight class. Outside chances for the women, who've never
managed a medal.
</P>
<P>
   MODERN PENTATHLON: The US men haven't won an individual medal
since 1960, but rookie Chad Senior has an excellent chance.
</P>
<P>
   ROWING: The star-spangled flotilla managed only four medals on
home waters last time. That's unlikely to improve down under, but
the men's eight should win gold for the first time since 1964 and
silvers should come from the women's eight and lightweight double
(with Christine Collins of Worcester, Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   SAILING: The US sailors went from an astounding nine medals in
Barcelona to an appalling two in Atlanta. The form sheet says only
a couple this time, but one should be gold, from Paul Foerster and
Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I., in men's 470.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING: One place where the NRA pays off. Half a dozen medals
are possible, with golds from Thomas Tamas in men's prone rifle and
Kim Rhode in women's double trap.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER: The women are favored to repeat, but their draw (Norway
and China to start) is brutal. The men (captained by the
Revolution's Brian Dunseth) have never survived the prelims, but
with an all-pro roster that should change.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTBALL: The Americans have won every global title since 1982,
but the slaughter-rule days are over. The Australians are with them
from top to bottom now. The difference will be pitcher Lisa
``No-No'' Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING: The Yanks shocked everybody by winning 26 medals in
Atlanta but could do even better this time if they can hold the
form they had at the trials. Except for the relays, though, golds
will be scarce. Figure backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg for a pair,
plus Tom Malchow (200 butterfly), Tom Dolan (400 IM), and Brooke
Bennett (800 free).
</P>
<P>
   SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING: Where have the Golden Girls gone? From a
lock to fourth. At best, a team bronze.
</P>
<P>
   TABLE TENNIS: Unless the US annexes Taiwan, no chance.
</P>
<P>
   TAEKWONDO: The Kay Poe-Esther Kim story is lovely, but it comes
with no medals.
</P>
<P>
   TEAM HANDBALL: Neither team qualified.
</P>
<P>
   TENNIS: Without Andre Agassi, there's no chance of triple gold
again. But Lindsay Davenport could repeat and the Williams sisters
have a strong chance in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   TRACK AND FIELD: Whether or not Marion Jones gets her five, the
Yanks figure to top the 23 medals they won last time. The men win
everything up to the 400, the hurdles, and relays, and a couple of
field events. The women take the sprints, the hurdles, and the pole
vault, and have good shots in the 1,500 and 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   TRIATHLON: Had Barb Lindquist made the team, an outside shot at
a women's bronze. Without her, it's an Aussie party. The men will
be happy to outswim the sharks.
</P>
<P>
   VOLLEYBALL: The women should be good for a couple of beach
medals, but without King Karch, the men will struggle. The indoor
teams are better, but out of podium range.
</P>
<P>
   WATER POLO: The word from the USOC's money people is produce
this time or else. Though neither the men nor women figured for a
medal six months ago, both have a shot at a bronze now.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHTLIFTING: Cheryl Haworth, teen-age Samsonette, could win a
bronze. The men still aren't near the podium.
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING: After winning eight medals (three golds) last time,
the Yanks may not win more than three, total. All should come from
the freestylers, with Cary Kolat the top hope. The Greco-Roman guys
may have to petition the Supreme Court.

TUA THINKS HE CAN HAMMER LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Tua learned when he was only 13 that he possessed the gift
of granting unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that he traveled eight hours to get to the New
Zealand national boxing finals, only to find there was no
middleweight opponent for him to fight. He was a champion without a
challenger, a circumstance he did not appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   So the young Samoan went looking for another fighter without a
fight, and he found one. The only problem was the guy was more than
30 pounds heavier than he was. Still, Tua volunteered to face him
and was told if he could make the weight, he'd get his chance. They
also told him he had two hours to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately he also had a powerful appetite that day _ and a
tool box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make it the first time, but my trainer took me
outside and he handed me a small tool box,'' the International
Boxing Federation's No. 1 contender said last week, not long after
landing in Las Vegas from New Zealand to begin training for his
Nov. 11 showdown with undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to put the tool box under my sweatsuit and zip it
up. He told me to make sure nobody saw it. I got on the scales with
my shoes on, in my sweatsuit, with the tool box under my jacket.
And I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   That night he also made the guy who might have been the
heavyweight champion of New Zealand go to sleep in one round. From
that point on, David Tua knew what he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered at an early age that I had something special,''
Tua said. ``It's a God-given talent I have to knock people out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a gift rewarded only in one place. Only in the boxing
ring, which is where Tua will earn $3.5 million to try to render
Lewis null and void.
</P>
<P>
   That has already been done once by a far less formidable fighter
than Tua _ journeyman Oliver McCall knocked Lewis out with one
right hand _ so it would not be the most shocking thing to see
Lewis laid low. But the 35-year-old champion is a far different
fighter than he was six years ago. To many, he now seems
unconquerable, the best heavyweight in the world. With one
exception, Tua agrees with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best out there,'' Tua said. ``He's the world
champion. He's got the belts (even though a court took one from him
and it ended up back around Evander Holyfield's waist). He's got
something to show for it when he says he's the best in the world. I
give the utmost respect to Lennox. But this is my time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tua believes it will soon be bedtime for Lewis, a brief
but concussive slumber induced by one of the thunderous left hooks
or right hands he has used to knock out 32 of his 37 victims
(37-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I land, you get knocked out,'' Tua said. ``If I have to
go 12 rounds, I'll go 12 rounds and get you late. Usually I'll get
you early. The second I sense fear or smell blood, I got to get you
out of there, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many observers believe Tua is a clear and present
danger to Lewis _ because of the combination of the challenger's
power and the champion's still-suspect whiskers _ others think Tua
may be the Samoan version of Michael Grant _ a figment of someone's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, you may recall, came into the ring against Lewis last
April heavily hyped as the champion's stiffest challenge. Less than
two minutes into the fight he was just stiff, floored and
semiconscious. He didn't make it out of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Now people look at Tua's resume and see too many of the same
names Grant beat up on or their clones, and they wonder. Is he the
next Mike Tyson, or is he just a little man who will be exposed by
a very big heavyweight?
</P>
<P>
   Ask David Tua that question, and you risk unconsciousness
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have waited patiently for three years for my chance,'' said
Tua, his voice rising slightly. ``I fought my way to the No. 1
ranking. Grant's team maneuvered him there. They did it in great
style, but he was tailor-made for Lennox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a shorter fighter. I'm in your face all night. I'm
mentally tougher than Michael Grant. I'm in there to take you
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In two months, Tua will be in there with Lewis. If he takes him
out, the gift he first noticed at 13 will be revealed to the world
_ without the aid of a tool box.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Arum bides his time
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum has read and reread the lawsuit filed against him by
attorneys representing Oscar De La Hoya, a lawsuit he calls
specious when he's talking like a Harvard-trained lawyer and
something with a barnyard connotation when he's talking like a
boxing promoter. The suit seems to have no grounds. It alleges, for
example, that Arum has been in violation of the Muhammad Ali Act
since 1996. That would be difficult for even Don King to
accomplish, since the Muhammad Ali Act didn't become law until
2000. So after a week of ranting and raving about the disloyalty of
a fighter whom he has helped earn more than $150 million in purses,
including $46 million in his last three fights, Arum has taken a
new tack. The way he sees it, this is just a case of something
happening to him that has happened to everyone else associated with
De La Hoya who is not family _ but one significant difference. Arum
is protected. ``He's fired somebody every time he had a problem,''
Arum said of the former welterweight champion who is on a two-fight
losing streak and heading for three, as far as Arum is concerned.
``The only reason I never thought it would happen to me is it can't
happen to me. I've got a contract. I've got a contract with him,
and he and I both have a contract with Time-Warner (HBO's parent
company) in which he's a principal, not just somebody signing off.
If he just had a contract with me, he could probably get away with
this because there are ample ways for me to be protected. But he's
got a separate contract with me and Time-Warner, and he can't get
out of that.'' Why, one wonders, would he want to? De La Hoya has
made more money than any boxer but the top heavyweights since he
turned pro following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. He has won
titles in four weight classes and become both a multimillionaire
and a pop idol with recording contracts, TV offers, and endless
business opportunities. He also has a golden reputation Arum's
public relations machine helped build despite more than a few
youthful indiscretions with women and gambling. Yet De La Hoya has
bitten the hand that fed him, Arum says, because a group of
entrepreneurs convinced him he can show his fights on the Internet,
along with other sporting events, and form a company whose initial
public stock offering would make him a billionaire. ``I looked at
the deal for him before the (Shane) Mosley fight,'' Arum said. ``I
told them we didn't want anything to do with it. Oscar wasn't in
the room, so they convinced him I'm the impediment. You've got a
27-year-old kid who barely got a high school diploma convinced he's
going to be the Bill Gates of sports, but it can't happen. They
keep telling him his stock will be worth billions. You can't
compete with that, but it's not going to happen. If he wants to
fight again, he can't fight without me. It's as simple as that. I'm
not going away, and if he comes back I won't coddle him anymore. It
will be an arm's-length relationship. Maybe it always should have
been, but it was like father and son.'' . . . HBO is worried its
planned Jan. 20 rematch between De La Hoya and Mosley will not come
off. To protect itself, the cable network is working on a possible
December fight for Mosley against Arturo Gatti or Oba Carr if a
deal with De La Hoya and Arum cannot be worked out by Oct. 1. Arum
says it will not . . . In total, De La Hoya has dismissed managers
Shelly Finkel, Robert Mittleman, and Steve Nelson; trainers Emanuel
Stewart, Jesus Rivera, and Gil Clancy; business adviser Mike
Hernandez; and now his promoter. To Arum, this means they don't
make fighters like Marvin Hagler anymore. ``He was a pillar of
loyalty,'' Arum said of Hagler. ``A lot of that is coming from New
England. People there are practical and conservative. People in
California go for the Hollywood glitz.''

NORSTROM SUPPORTS STUMPEL'S HOLDOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Mattias Norstrom was the only Los Angeles
King to miss training camp last year. He also was the only one to
play all 82 games of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom, who teams with captain Rob Blake on the club's top
defensive line, knows all about the kind of contract holdout that
has top center Jozef Stumpel back in Slovakia. He also knows how
skipping camp often is a players' best leverage in getting a better
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time the sport and the business overlap, but
from a player's standpoint, this is when you have to secure your
future,'' Norstrom said Saturday before the Kings completed their
second day of training camp. ``I want Stumpy here as much as
anyone, but this is what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the Kings is Stumpel is not Norstrom, one of
the league's best-conditioned players. Although he averages more
than a point a game when healthy, Stumpel missed 43 games the past
two seasons because of groin and knee injuries the club thinks
might have been avoided with better conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate and fellow Slovak Ziggy Palffy saw Stumpel over the
summer and said he is in excellent shape, but management wants to
see for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be here,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``When Matty got
here last year, he came into the season already our best
conditioned athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom: ``I think it took about 10 games, though, to get in
game shape. The thing you really miss are the exhibition games.
They help you get your timing back that you just can't get in
scrimmages.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Norstrom is signed through the 2001-02 season, his
summer was not without controversy. Back in his native Sweden,
Norstrom was embroiled in a flap with the country's sports
federation over a request to submit to drug testing when several
players rented ice time.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL and the NHL Players Association had an agreement with
the International Ice Hockey Federation, which was consulted about
the drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was dropped, but the faces of Norstrom, Edmonton
goaltender Tommy Salo and several other NHL players were splashed
across newscasts and newspapers for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we were right, seeing yourself in the paper for
four days straight was very painful,'' Norstrom said. ``I'm just
glad the controversy is over.''

BC HAS SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ A howitzer erupted from just beyond the east
end of Michie Stadium when Army scored its final touchdown with two
seconds remaining. By then Boston College had rendered the
cannonade a mere formality as the Eagles subjected Army to a
double-barreled blast of their own, erupting for 41 straight points
_ including 28 in a third quarter filled with big plays _ to notch
their first victory of the season, 55-17, before a crowd of 37,544.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which helped the Eagles absolve the sins of last
week's season-opening 34-14 setback at West Virginia, was BC's most
lopsided under fourth-year coach Tom O'Brien, and ranked as the
biggest rout by a BC team since a 66-14 trampling of Temple in
1993. But, as O'Brien noted, it came against a weary Army team that
was playing its second game in six days after dropping a 23-17
decision at Cincinnati Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this team needed a victory,'' O'Brien said of his
Eagles, who will next host Navy Sept. 23. ``We came out in the
first half and we wanted to make sure that we established the run
and tried to make a conscious effort to become a physical football
team. Defensively, Army came out with a lot of different formations
and got us confused a little bit, but once we settled in to the
pace of the game with them, we played much better on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck made Army pay by accounting
for 312 of BC's 587 yards of total offense. He rushed eight times
for 56 yards (including a long of 30) and completed 14 of 21 passes
for 256 yards and three touchdowns, hitting Dedrick Dewalt (3
catches, 122 yards) for scores of 75 and 38 yards that broke the
game open in the second half and turned Army's home opener into a
long gray day for the Long Gray Line.
</P>
<P>
   More important, BC's offense committed no turnovers after having
five against the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he played with much more confidence,'' O'Brien said of
Hasselbeck. ``Our protection was much better and I believe we gave
him opportunities to make easier throws and, quite frankly, we
weren't playing West Virginia, not to take anything away from
Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, had BC's offense come out of the blocks and erupted for
55 points last week, the Eagles would be headed into their off week
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing, actually, the two biggest things today were
we were able to run the ball and be physical, and we didn't turn
the ball over. When you do those two things, you're going to give
yourself a chance to win a lot of ballgames. Obviously, we would've
wanted to start out (at West Virginia) like we did today, but
that's just how the cookie crumbles, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Cedric Washington, who twice challenged his
teammates during the week to step up their play, rebounded from a
lackluster 31-yard effort against West Virginia by recording his
sixth career 100-yard game with 15 carries for an even 100 and a
touchdown. He also factored into the passing game, making two
catches for 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After Josh Holden gave Army a 7-0 lead with a 16-yard run with
6:33 to go in the first quarter, William Green ripped off a
dazzling 84-yard kick return to set up Washington's 8-yard TD run
that tied it. Green, who rushed 17 times for 59 yards, gave BC a
14-7 lead when he capped a six-play, 32-yard drive, set up by
Willie Poole's interception, with a 3-yard TD run through a gaping
hole cleared by right guard Paul Zukauskas and right tackle Michael
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backs were against the wall and last night I told the
team, `Hey, are we going to back down, or are we going to come out
swinging?' '' Washington said. ``Today, I think we decided to come
out swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's defense heeded Washington's message and delivered some
crucial blows by holding Army to 354 yards of offense, and knocking
out starting quarterback Chad Jenkins (sprained left ankle). The
Eagles also rang up five sacks (including two by junior cornerback
Lenny Walls) and three interceptions, the biggest of which was
Curtis Bolden's 22-yard return that came on the heels of
Hasselbeck's 75-yard TD bomb to Dewalt.
</P>
<P>
   After kicker Mike Sutphin, who was perfect on all seven
extra-point attempts, helped BC take a 20-10 lead at halftime with
field goals of 22 and 24 yards, Hasselbeck had the Eagles soaring
when he called ``Fullback Wheel'' in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a play-action and they were playing a coverage called
`robber,' where the safety likes to come up to the line of
scrimmage,'' Hasselbeck said. ``Once I saw Ded get inside of their
corner, he was wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dewalt: ``Every time they call that play, my antennae just
goes up. It was the same play we ran for a 97-yard touchdown last
year at Virginia Tech. So when they called it, I was thinking 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, a sophomore linebacker from Dorchester, certainly had to
be thinking the same thing when he keyed on running back Michael
Wallace, stepped in front of Jenkins's flare pass, and converted
his first career interception into his first career touchdown, one
that proved to break Army's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both teams were really tired and it was a gut-check
for both of us,'' O'Brien said. ``I didn't see a lot of quickness
on our part, but what Army asked their football team to do was
ungodly _ to play on Monday and come back on that short week and
play. I can't believe they did that to those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck closed out the productive third quarter with a 5-yard
scoring pass to sophomore Keith Hemmings (who caught his first
career TD) and a 38-yarder to Dewalt before redshirt freshman
Derrick Knight tallied his first career TD with a 13-yard run with
6:32 remaining. Army, though, managed one final score against BC's
second-team defense when Clinton Woody caught a 12-yard TD pass
from Curtis Zervic to touch off the howitzer.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, the Cadets had been blasted by BC.

A NEW BEGINNING FOR ROLSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ For his entire career as a professional hockey
player, this always was the time of year when Brian Rolston found
himself in West Orange, N.J., at South Mountain Arena with the rest
of the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1993-94 season, during which he split his time between
the US national team and the Olympics before heading to New
Jersey's top AHL affiliate in Albany, N.Y., Rolston's home base was
that practice rink.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time he's found himself anywhere else in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely different for me, because this is my first
camp other than New Jersey that I've ever been to, but I'm
excited,'' said Rolston, who along with the rest of the Bruins
continued camp workouts at Ristuccia Arena Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston had a roller coaster season last year. He began with the
Devils, who had a difficult lineup to crack, then was traded to the
Colorado Avalanche, whose roster was even tougher to make. In
March, when Ray Bourque asked to be traded to a Stanley Cup
contender, Rolston was one of those shipped to Boston in the
multiplayer swap.
</P>
<P>
   He played well in the final 16 games of the regular season, but
morale around the rink was low, injuries were plentiful, and there
was little Rolston could do to rescue the disastrous season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when I came here, the team was worn a little thin
at the end of the season, and I'm excited to have a new start
here,'' he said. ``I think we have some great players.''
</P>
<P>
   With three key members out of camp because of contract disputes
_ Joe Thornton, Sergei Samsonov, and Anson Carter _ there has been
little talk about the rest of the team. But Rolston said that's
just business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is talking about how Joe is not in camp, and that's a
big story, and everyone has been asking me about it, but it happens
everywhere,'' said Rolston. ``When I was in New Jersey, every year
I was there, there was someone holding out of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the players, at least, it's out of sight, out of mind. I
don't think the guys really worry about that. It would be nice to
start the season with everyone. It's business. We all know that.
Obviously they're key components and we want them back, but at the
same time, I don't think we're worried about it because we know,
eventually, they're going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston said he understands the frustration of the fans and
those who feel it's a ``here we go again'' scenario, especially
since the club has had key members holding out the last three
years. However, Rolston said the glass should be looked at as
half-full, not half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic about our season,'' he said. ``We've just
got to come together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, who was married in the offseason, stands to play a huge
role on the Bruins this year. Offensively, he did well with the ice
time he had last year. In 11 games with New Jersey, Rolston had
three goals and an assist. In 50 games with Colorado, he had eight
goals and 18 points. In 16 games as a Bruin, he had five goals and
four assists.. But it was a fractured, strange season for the
27-year-old, who was drafted by New Jersey (No. 11 overall) in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns promises that Rolston, as well as several others
who had a hard time on other teams, will have an opportunity to
flourish. ``He was in a situation where he got traded to Colorado
and he couldn't play there, he couldn't find a place in the
lineup,'' said Burns. ``He's like Mike Knuble (who couldn't crack
the Rangers' lineup and came to Boston in a deal for Rob DiMaio
last spring). Those are good signs for us. Those guys are getting
fresh starts on a different team. I think that's important. Rolston
goes from one team where he couldn't get into the lineup to a team
where he's a leader. That's a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short time he was here, Burns said, Rolston showed a
great deal despite the less-than-perfect circumstances with so many
regulars injured. ``He's a player we can use in so many different
situations, which is good for us,'' said Burns. ``We might play him
on the point on the power play. Certainly, he can kill penalties.
He's going to get an opportunity to do it, whereas he didn't get an
opportunity in the other place. Do you see the talent on the
Colorado Avalanche? Have a look at their team. That's a tough
lineup to break. You're playing behind (Joe) Sakic, (Peter)
Forsberg, (Milan) Hejduk, (Alex) Tanguay _ it's tough to say how
much ice time you're going to get. And New Jersey was the same
situation. He was a third-line, fourth-line player. Here he becomes
maybe a second-line, some nights first-line player.''

   Burns has been impressed with what he's seen from Knuble, whom
the coach termed the best player in Friday's scrimmage. ``Knuble
can do a lot of things I don't think he realizes he can do,'' said
Burns. ``He's a big, strong individual on the boards. He's a
physical player. Knuble scored three goals in the scrimmage because
he went to the net and looked for the puck. If he does that on a
regular basis, he's going to do that in the league.''

PATRIOTS' HAND FORCED ON SNAPPING DUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Nobody would do by choice what the Patriots are
doing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   No NFL coach in his right mind would field a team with one
center in its regular offense, another as a long snapper, and a
third when the quarterback drops into a shotgun formation. Nobody
in his right mind could be convinced it's the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Bill Belichick about this, and you conclude at least one
thing: He's still in his right mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it would be easier if we didn't have to do this,'' the
Patriots coach conceded when asked about his odd shifting of center
Damien Woody to guard and Jason Andersen to center whenever Drew
Bledsoe goes into the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Even odder is that Andersen doesn't handle the normal long
snapping, to the punter and placekicker. That is done by Lonie
Paxton. Has there ever been a team in football history with a
whipper snapper, a medium snapper, and a long snapper? Center may
be complex, but come on.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen handles the short toss only, having become perhaps the
first designated shotgun snapper in NFL history. That is about as
specialized as a football position can get, and were it up to
Belichick, a former center himself, he wouldn't do things this way.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he has to is the normally reliable Woody looked a lot
like Chuck Knoblauch too many times this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But just how difficult is it to shift the center, arguably the
pivotal man in any offensive line, to left guard and put the backup
left guard in at center in a formation that is often used at the
most critical moments in a game?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two problems,'' Belichick said. ``One is it's an
assignment thing. The guard needs to understand what the center is
doing, and vice versa. Second, the techniques are different. A lot
of line play is footwork and positioning, so the technique is
important. The more fluctuation you have, the harder it is to do
things consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was a serious problem last Sunday against the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, who sacked Bledsoe six times and knocked him down
14 more times. This was not all the fault of the center/guard
switch, however. The running game never got off the ground, either,
so there had to have been problems from end to end.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is the switch for Woody, who is arguably the
team's most consistent offensive lineman when he's at his normal
position?
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, guard is easier because I don't have the ball to
worry about,'' said Woody. ``But I've been a center my whole life,
and the techniques at guard are different. So is the footwork and
the angles. Most teams play a 4-3, so when I'm at center I don't
usually have anyone in my face, either. At guard, the defensive
tackle is right there. It changes your aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   To the average fan, guard is no different from center except the
center has to hand the ball to the quarterback before he starts
trying to push a 300-pound block of flesh out of the way.
Otherwise, offensive linemen are seen as interchangeable parts _
wide-bodied people who push around other wide-bodied people for a
living. What does it matter where you start pushing from? It may
look that way to the untutored eye, but nothing could be further
from the truth of a lineman's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Smerlas is a five-time Pro Bowl nose tackle who made a
living making centers' lives miserable. He has studied that
position, as well as the guard's, and knows this: Shifting from
place to place is not the way to build consistent interior line
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensive linemen get a feel for each other and they work more
together, where defensive line is more helter-skelter,'' said
Smerlas. ``You break that continuity and it's like a hole in a cup.
No matter where it is, the water is going to leak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the center and guard positions, the techniques are very
different because the proximity to the guy you're blocking is very
different. Everything they do is different because of that
different distance. Their angles are different. Their steps are
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep shifting them back and forth, all the things
that come naturally are gone. As a defensive lineman, you love to
see guys moving in and out because they don't get as used to how
you play, either. There were guys who played me so often that when
I'd put my hand down in a certain way they'd call out the direction
I was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have not been in the shotgun that often, but the
shift has been made often enough to be noticeable, and it demands
different things from Woody and Andersen, demands that can take
away their edge of aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to think which position you're at and do what
you've been taught,'' Andersen said. ``We do it in practice a lot
and we've been doing it for a while, so we don't think about it
much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need to know the position you're in and the play and
the technique for that play, and make sure you're using it. But it
works in practice, so it should work in the games.''
</P>
<P>
   But given his druthers, Woody would just as soon stay at center.
Not because of any doubts he harbors about Andersen but simply out
of personal pride, the kind that turned him into a No. 1 draft
choice two years ago and a starter from his first game in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long snapping isn't as easy as everybody thinks,'' Woody said.
``It's a matter of being comfortable with it. To a degree, the
problems I've had with it have been mental because it's all about
being comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shifting to guard when Jason comes in hasn't been a bad
transition for me, but sometimes I get a little frustrated when
they don't let me do it (shotgun snap). I just keep thinking
eventually the problem will be resolved and things will come
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever the coaches want, but definitely, I assume,
eventually I'll do that part of it, too. Things will come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, when the Patriots want to fire out of the shotgun, a
former seventh-round draft choice will be the guy coming around.

PETTITTE WON'T PLAY MATCH GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Yankees lefthander Andy Pettitte says that pitchers
battle only the opposing batters, that the idea of dueling the
opposing pitcher makes no sense. But surely the matchup has an
added dimension when the opposing pitcher is Red Sox ace Pedro
Martinez. Your margin of error is slim and you must yield as few
runs as possible, then hope for the best from your teammates
against the best pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, both things happened for Pettitte, who is now
garnering as much respect on the mound at Fenway Park as Martinez
does throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-3 victory at Fenway Park, Pettitte gave up one hit in the
first, second, and fourth innings. The Red Sox scored one run in
the third with a pair of two-out hits. Then Pettitte retired the
side in the fifth (striking out two) and the sixth (another K).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what our guys showed, with the way Andy was pitching,
they didn't want to waste that effort,'' said Yankees manager Joe
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   They made certain it didn't go to waste in the seventh, when
Scott Brosius belted a three-run homer off Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   That would be more than enough for Pettitte, who gave up one hit
in the seventh and retired the side in the eighth before yielding
to Mariano Rivera in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The win not only improved Pettitte to 18-7 (second only to David
Wells in the American League in victories), it continued his
dominance of the Red Sox. He is 3-0 at Fenway and 5-2 with a 2.39
earned run average overall against Boston _ including 2-0, 0.57
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the game, I was shaky, leaving balls over the
plate the first three innings or so,'' said Pettitte. ``Then I got
into a good groove and loosened up.''
</P>
<P>
   He scattered six hits over his eight innings, walked one and
struck out six. He allowed one earned run or fewer for the ninth
time this season and has won nine of his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope you will get more (runs against Martinez), but you
don't expect too much more,'' Pettitte said. He added that after
Brosius hit his homer, ``I still pitched like I was down, 1-0. I
was able to keep my focus and it was nice to be able to finish
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's first jam came in the first inning, when Jose
Offerman walked and Carl Everett singled to center. But Nomar
Garciaparra grounded into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big inning,'' said Pettitte. ``I really didn't feel
sharp with my command but I made a good pitch right there to get
the double play. It was a good fastball into him. Obviously if they
score there and score later, getting a 2-0 lead . . . Pedro might
start pitching a bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said all of his pitches were working, and after the
third inning he began throwing changeups _ which he's hardly thrown
at all this season _ to keep batters guessing.
</P>
<P>
   He's had the Sox guessing the past two seasons _ his wins over
them include Game 4 of last season's American League Championship
Series _ but Torre downplayed the notion of Pettitte mastering the
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 18 wins, he's pitched everywhere well,'' said Torre.
``But he rises to the challenge. He had a pretty good hiccup the
first half of last year, where his confidence level was very low,
but he's made a hell of a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   And, though he said Martinez adds to the electricity of a Fenway
outing, Pettitte insists the idea of a battle between pitchers is
way off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to beat Boston, obviously, because they're in second
place,'' said Pettitte. ``But it really doesn't factor into who is
pitching. That's a nonissue as far as I'm concerned.''

SOX SINK LOWER IN EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez and the manager played by Tom Hanks in ``A League
of Their Own'' share a favorite motto: ``There's no crying in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the dejected Red Sox faithful who watched Martinez,
the team's designated savior, surrender a crucial game to the
dreaded Yankees Saturday, 5-3, as the Sox slipped a perilous eight
games behind New York in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   And remind the Red Sox, whose fears were focused more on their
severely injured teammate, Bryce Florie, than their tenuous
position in the standings. They also fell into third place in AL
wild-card race, three games behind Cleveland and a half-game behind
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox learned that Florie, smashed in the right eye by a line
drive Friday night, underwent surgery Saturday at Massachusetts Eye
and Ear Infirmary. The prognosis for him regaining normal vision
was called ``guarded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on the squad,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg. ``It
kind of deflates you.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gloom, the Sox lost their way for the second straight
game against a yeoman Yankee starter, this one Andy Pettitte. After
Roger Clemens shut them out Friday night, 4-0, the
production-starved Sox finagled only one run off Pettitte in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   And when Martinez was asked after the game to identify the major
difference between the teams, he said, ``Pitching. They are
dominant, better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he said, ``I was trying to win with that one
run.''
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't. After pitching superbly through six innings,
Martinez yielded a leadoff single in the seventh to Tino Martinez.
Two outs later, he walked Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Martinez did not appear headed for disaster. Twice the
Yankees had pushed runners into scoring position, and Martinez had
struck out all four batters who tried to advance them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thought he did the same in this jam as well, when he
threw Scott Brosius a cut fastball on a 1-and-2 count. Martinez was
certain the pitch nipped the outside corner. But home plate umpire
Fieldin Culbreth called it a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had him,'' Martinez said. ``That one pitch cost me
the game. And the other pitch I threw after that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 3-and-2 count, Martinez delivered his 115th pitch of the
day, a changeup over the plate. Brosius had swung and missed wildly
on two changeups earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I'm going to die with something, I might as well die
with something that made him look bad,'' Martinez said. ``I was
hoping I could get it by him.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. Brosius blasted the pitch into the left-field
screen for a three-run homer that turned Sox loyalists sullen in a
divided sellout crowd of 33,355 at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, manager Jimy Williams reminded reporters, Martinez
is not superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is Pedro,'' he said. ``But the Yankees are the Yankees,
and they aren't the world champions for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The champs made it 5-1 in the ninth when two of their
late-season pickups whacked around Rod Beck and Tim Wakefield.
After David Justice doubled with one out, Jose Canseco struck a
mammoth, 439-foot home run over everything in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss,'' said catcher Jason Varitek. ``But any
loss right now is a tough loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding high in June atop the AL East, the Sox have tasted New
York's dust since then, as the Yanks have pulled away behind
Clemens and Pettitte. With the victory Saturday, Pettitte (18-7)
joined Martinez as the winningest pitchers in the majors since 1996
with 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score on Pettitte,'' Williams said. ``He was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   At his toughest, Pettitte held the Sox hitless when they had
runners in scoring position, making the Sox 0 for 8 in the last two
games in scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance failed when Nomar Garciaparra grounded into a
double play with one out and runners on first and second in the
first inning. Garciaparra noted later that the Sox outhit the
Yankees, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more hits than they did,'' he said. ``The timely
hitting just didn't come out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox squeezed a run out of Pettitte in the third inning when
Jose Offerman lined a two-out single to right and Carl Everett
lofted a towering shot to left that skimmed the wall, scoring
Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, the next batter in the order, might have had a
second chance to drive in a run had Everett settled for a double.
But Everett tried to take third as Justice threw toward the plate.
First baseman Martinez cut off the throw and trapped Everett in a
rundown to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   That was it until there two outs in the bottom of the ninth. In
another minidrama, the Sox rallied for two runs off closer Mariano
Rivera on a double by Dante Bichette, a triple by Troy O'Leary, and
a double by Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, pinch hitter Midre Cummings, represented the
potential tying run. But Rivera struck him out to deepen Boston's
hole in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with only 23 games remaining, several Sox players said
they are far from buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any shovels out right now,'' Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez echoed Garciaparra's optimism. But, citing the Yankees'
excellence, he added, ``We're going to have to play near
perfection.''

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: TRIATHLON  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Marion Jones, triathlon figures to play an outsized role in
its first Olympics. It might be a niche endurance sport with a
short history _ the first official triathlon was held in 1974 in
San Diego _ but it is a sport at which Australians excel and which
dovetails nicely with their sun-and-sea culture. The women's event
is the first gold-medal event of the Games; the men compete the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   A 1,500-meter swim in open water is followed by a 40-kilometer
bike ride and then by a 10-kilometer run. The first across the
finish line wins.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Though Americans dreamed up the triathlon, they no longer
dominate. The most consistently successful man (at the Olympic
distance) is Britain's Simon Lessing, a four-time world champion.
His competition should come from his countryman Andrew Johns,
Dmitry Gaag of Kazakhstan and Australians Peter Robertson and Craig
Walton.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful women are Australians: Michelie Jones,
Nicole Hackett and Loretta Harrop. In the women's event, Magali
Messmer of Switzerland and Carol Montgomery of Canada are
considered threats. Sheila Taormina, one of the three U.S. women,
won a gold medal in a swimming relay in Atlanta.

YANKEE BALL DOESN'T COME APART AT SEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the division race wasn't over before the Yankees arrived,
it's a foregone conclusion now.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough for the Bombers. They've reached the stage
where they'd like to blow Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox off the
postseason landscape altogether. There's a rat in the house, and
not just the one that sprinted across Joe Mooney's garden Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said after the Yanks
beat Martinez at Fenway Park for the second time in 11 weeks, 5-3,
inflating the Bombers' lead in the AL East to eight games while
dropping the Sox to third in the wild-card sweepstakes, three games
behind the Indians and a half-game behind the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro can pitch twice in a five-game series, maybe three times
in a seven-game series,'' Torre said. ``No question, whether he's
there as the wild card or as the division winner, you're at a
disadvantage. Not taking anything away from (Andy) Pettitte,
(Roger) Clemens, or Boomer (David Wells), he's been the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you go out there and scuffle against him, you have to
pitch against him the way he pitches against you. That's the only
way to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt, either, Torre acknowledged, if you shut down
Nomar Garciaparra while you're at it. The Red Sox shortstop entered
this series hitting .448 against the Yankees this season. He went 0
for 4 against Roger Clemens and closer Mariano Rivera in a 4-0
Rocket masterpiece Friday night and took another 0 for 4 against
Pettitte and Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had luck against the Mets in a four-game series that we
swept in which Mike Piazza didn't get any hits,'' Torre said,
referring to the Mets' MVP candidate. ``There's a correlation
between winning and those guys not getting hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Nomar) is tough. We're making good pitches on him, and he's
hitting some balls right at people. We're glad we just have two
more games with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Yaz stretch run left in Nomar, he's hiding it
well. In his last 23 games, spanning 84 at-bats, Garciaparra has
two extra-base hits and has knocked in seven runs. In 52 games
since the All-Star break, he has knocked in 24 runs and hit six
homers.
</P>
<P>
   He went 15 games in a row without knocking in a run, a streak
that he ended Monday. But by the weekend, it had become a struggle
again. Friday night, with a runner on third and two out against
Clemens, Garciaparra crushed a ball to right that was caught. In
the first inning, with runners on first and third and one out, he
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   It would be his last chance to bat with men on base, as Carl
Everett (a .256 hitter since the break) tried to do something the
freshman physics class at MIT could have told him was impossible,
namely stretching a Wall-ball double to left into a triple.
Everett's misplaced zeal, perhaps inspired by the rarity of seeing
a Sox runner cross the plate, left Garciaparra in the on-deck
circle and Martinez with a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The way Martinez was pitching, that looked like it might be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets his fastball in the mid-90s like he did today,
there's not much you can do,'' Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill
said. ``We saw him earlier in the season, when his fastball was
down a little, and he still was tough. Is there a pattern in the
way he pitches me? Yeah, he gets me out.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who went down swinging on a fastball that was clocked
at 98 m.p.h. in the first inning, wasn't alone. Martinez had five
K's in the first two innings, six through three. The Yanks didn't
have a hit until David Justice blooped a single over Garciaparra's
glove in short center with two out in the fourth. Only Tino
Martinez, who twice reached on errors, advanced as far as second
base.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte, who is 18-7, was giving the Red Sox nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get down 1-0 (to Martinez),'' O'Neill said, ``a lot of
people say, `We'll get 'em tomorrow. But Pettitte kept us right
there. To beat Martinez any time, you have to have a great-pitched
game, too, and we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they got Pedro, too. Tino Martinez opened the seventh with
a ground-ball single up the middle, and with two outs, Jorge Posada
wheedled his way on via a full-count walk. That brought up Scott
Brosius, who is two years removed from his World Series MVP award
and was hitting just .236 entering play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't matter what kind of year he's having,'' Torre
said, ``when it's late in the game, or a key game, it's deja vu
stuff all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius quickly fell behind Martinez 0-and-2 on two changeups.
His first at-bat, he'd lined out on a fastball. His second, he
fouled out with Martinez throwing only curves. Now, the changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then,'' Brosius said, ``I've seen just about everything and
I'm fighting for dear life after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Martinez missed with one, two, three pitches, a
fastball and two cutters, the 1-and-2 offering just missing. With
the count full, Brosius guessed that Martinez might go back to the
changeup. Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep my hands back, stay back, and try to see it,''
Brosius said. ``I think he left it up higher than he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly touched down at a higher place than Martinez
intended, the left-field screen. Bombers, 3-1. Designated villain
Jose Canseco's two-run home run off Tim Wakefield made it 5-1,
while the reinforcements provided Jimy Williams by Dan Duquette
(Bernard Gilkey, Izzy Alcantara, and Midre Cummings) all went
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who had given Rivera a blow against the Royals because he
wanted his closer to have some rest, brought him in for the second
straight game with a four-run lead. That's a measure of his respect
for Fenway Park, but also how much these games meant to the
Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Pedro was a marked man. But unlike Tampa Bay, the
Yanks meant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you beat Pedro when you come back late in the game,
sure, it's a great win for us,'' O'Neill said. ``But this team has
won too many games to think too far ahead. We're trying to win
games, and coming down the stretch, it's now an all-out sprint
where we try to win every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in first place. Us beating Boston, or us beating Kansas
City, it's still a win.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one fears the Royals in October. And if this keeps up, no
one will have to fear the Sox, either.
</P>

LEYRITZ OUT TO TRANSFORM DODGERS MENTALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Utility player Jim Leyritz hasn't been much of a factor
since the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired him from the Yankees in a
June 20 deal for Jose Vizcaino. But he's been on championship teams
and understands what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz said one reason the Dodgers collapsed is the team is
still learning how to become a title-contending team, primarily in
the mental approach. He added the talent exists to compete on an
everyday basis, but the mental aspect needs work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a learning process,'' Leyritz said. ``From when
I've been on the outside looking at the Los Angeles Dodgers, it's
always been this team that had a lot of cliques. These guys are
over here, these guys are over here and these guys are over here.
It was never a full team thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was me looking from the outside. When I came here, I can
see the changes. Maybe the two years Fox owned them, it kind of got
out of whack. (Bob) Daly came in, and I think (general manager)
Kevin Malone has brought guys in here that want to win as a team. I
think it's gotten better, but I don't think it's gotten to that
next level yet. But it's definitely a more team-oriented ballclub
than I've seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has been active in scouting meetings before each series
and making sure the information is digested in a useful manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at this ballclub, I look at ability first and this
ballclub definitely has that,'' said Leyritz, who built his
big-game reputation playing for the Yankees. ``We have to put it
together in the other facets of the game, as far as the mental
preparation, the scouting reports. It's one thing to have the
scouting report. It's another to make sure we go out and use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys aren't used to that and haven't seen it in
the past, and now they're learning to do that. Over the long haul,
it out. I've seen flashes of it. From the day I got here until now,
it's definitely been much better.''
</P>
<P>
   __ $100,000 outing: Even though Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho
Park had his worst outing in two months _ he allowed seven runs
(five earned) on 10 hits in five innings _ it was worth $100,000 to
him because he reached a pair of incentive mileposts.
</P>
<P>
   Park's contract calls for him to receive $50,000 for each of his
30th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd starts of the season. He also receives
$50,000 when he reaches 195 innings, 200 innings, 205 innings and
210 innings.
</P>
<P>
   By pitching five innings against the Rockies, Park, whose base
salary is $3.85 million, has amassed 195 innings. It was also his
30th start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   __ More marks in a loss: Third baseman Adrian Beltre's
second-inning homer was the Dodgers' 192nd this season,
establishing a single-season best since the club moved to Los
Angeles. . . . Chris Donnels' pinch-hit homer in the sixth was the
ninth by the Dodgers, tying the club mark. It was also done in 1983
and 1992. It was also Donnels' first homer since Oct. 1, 1995.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: VOLLEYBALL  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Americans will be looking for signs of a rebirth. In the
mid- and late-'80s, the Americans were led by Karch Kiraly, a young
player from Southern California. In 1984 and 1988, Kiraly helped
the United States win consecutive gold medals. Then he started to
hit the beach looking for competition, and, perhaps coincidentally,
the United States slowly lost control of the sport to teams like
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the men's team did not even place among the top eight.
The women had fleeting success with a silver in 1984, but have been
overcome lately by teams from Cuba, Russia, China and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's competition will consist of 12 teams: the
top three teams from the most recent World Cup, five winners of
regional tournaments, three teams from Olympic qualifying and the
host nation. Two pools of six teams will compete in a round-robin
format. The top four teams in each pool advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, indoor volleyball was almost forgotten in the hype that
swirled around the debut of beach volleyball. But now new rules are
intended to make volleyball more intense and television friendly.
For the first time, the defense can score, which raises the
intensity and puts more impact on each rally. There is also a
defensive specialist allowed on the floor, and that person will
wear a different-color jersey. The hope is the rule changes will
increase the flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   The scoring has also been tinkered with beyond the elimination
of the old side-out format. In the first four sets, athletes now
play to 25 points, while the final set still goes to 15 points. The
set must still be won by two points, with no ceiling to the score.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The addition of a defensive specialist gives teams a rover. The
rover can be anywhere in the backcourt but cannot serve, spike or
rotate in the front zone. A good specialist can give a team a lift
in rallies and more agility on defense.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban women's team, led by Mireya Luis and Magalys Carrajal,
are the two-time defending Olympic champions. They are the team to
beat, with Russia, China and Brazil in contention. Although they do
not appear to be in the chase for a medal, Tara Cross-Battle and
Logan Tom will lead the U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
   For the men, the countries with developed domestic pro leagues
should dominate. Italy, the Netherlands and Cuba are all in pursuit
of the gold medal. For the U.S. men to succeed, they will need
great performances from the remains of the 1996 team and newcomers
like George Roumain.
</P>
<P>
   BEACH VOLLEYBALL
</P>
<P>
   The site of the competition _ the glitzy Bondi Beach _ has been
almost as big a story as the event. That is hard to pull off. In
its second Olympics, beach volleyball's sex appeal has made it one
of the most popular new sports at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament has a double-elimination format. Unlike indoor
volleyball, there are just two players on a team and points are
scored only by the serving team. The first team to score 15 points
wins. In the medal round, the first team to score 12 points wins,
and in the third set, a point is scored for every rally regardless
of who is serving.
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly, the player whose name became synonymous with beach
volleyball, separated his shoulder trying to earn a berth on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Without Kiraly, the Americans will try to hold off the
Brazilians and the Aussies with the team of Dain Blanton and Eric
Fonoimoana.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women will be led by the combination of Misty May and
Holly McPeak. Once again, the Australians, playing on their home
sand and led by Kerri Potthorst and Natalie Cook, should be
inspired playing in front of their countrymen. Brazil will also
pose a threat.

KARL REMAINS BUST FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Scott Karl is rusty and needs time. The
Anaheim Angels have no time. So, what to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at our options,'' manager Mike Scioscia said
after the Baltimore Orioles riddled Karl and the Angels 10-3 before
22,332 fans Saturday at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the Angels, whose winning streak came to a halt at
three games, aren't long on options, either.
</P>
<P>
   So, Karl who's gone all of 2, 5 and, Saturday, 3 innings in his
three starts for the Angels since they acquired him last month from
Colorado, will probably continue to take his regular turn, 9.53
earned-run average and all.
</P>
<P>
   Which, Karl insists, is exactly what he needs to shake loose
from the mental agony of trying to pitch in mile-high,
hitter-friendly Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's there,'' Karl said of his missing stuff. ``That
makes it so frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole season has been this way. I'm healthy, my pitches
are breaking correctly . . . but I've gotten to the point I don't
trust my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was getting knocked out in the Orioles' four-run
fourth inning and leaving with a 6-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all his doing. A throwing error by shortstop Kevin
Stocker led to two unearned runs in the second. But Karl was cuffed
about for seven hits and he added to his problems by walking three.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meantime, managed all of three hits for six innings
against Baltimore right-hander Jose Mercedes, who helped as best he
could: He walked eight, five of them in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mercedes (12-5) said, ``I have to say this is one of
the best games I've pitched. Eight walks and one run. I'll take
that anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels simply couldn't take advantage of Mercedes' bends,
grounding into four double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five walks and one run,'' Scioscia said, replaying the third
inning, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Mercedes) was one pitch away from coming out of the game a
number of times,'' he added. ``We set the table well.''
</P>
<P>
   And un-set it just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four double plays, obviously, takes the life out of a club,''
Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   So do four-run innings. The Orioles had two of them.
</P>
<P>
   As for Karl, the left-hander fell to 0-2 with the Angels, 2-5
for the season, counting his time in Colorado, which he described
as pret4%-H]v

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: WEIGHTLIFTING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 300 pounds and is only 17
years old. Her combination of strength, flexibility and
explosiveness also makes Cheryl Haworth the United States' best
chance for a women's medal as the sport makes its Olympic debut for
the female lifters.
</P>
<P>
   But men's weightlifting was included in the first modern
Olympics in 1896 and has been a part of every Games since then
except for 1900, 1908 and 1920.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The snatch is the first of the two lifts. The bar is placed
horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped
palms-downward and pulled in a single movement from the ground to
the full extension of both arms above the head. In order to be
considered a successful lift, the weight must be maintained in the
final, motionless position _ arms and legs extended, with the feet
on the same line _ until the referees give the down signal.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the two lifts, the clean and jerk, is executed in
two stages. In the first part, the clean, the bar is placed
horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped
palms-downward and pulled in a single movement from the ground to
the shoulders while bending the legs.
</P>
<P>
   In the second part, the jerk, the athlete bends the legs and
extends them, as well as the arms, so as to bring the bar to the
full stretch of the arms, vertically extended. He returns the feet
to the same line _ arms and legs extended _ and waits for the
referees' signal to put the bar on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   If Haworth is hoping to make history, so, too, is Naim
Suleymanoglu. Nicknamed ``Pocket Hercules,'' Turkey's 5-foot
featherweight is trying to become the first weightlifter to win
gold in four successive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Having come out of retirement last year, Suleymanoglu, now 33,
is currently ranked fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Halil Mutlu of Turkey, who won the gold medal in Atlanta in the
56kg division, has dominated his competition and is expected to
defend his title.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: WATER POLO  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The water member of the soccer/hockey/basketball family can be
ultra physical. It certainly was in 1956 in Melbourne, the last
time the Olympics were held in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Soviet troops invaded Hungary to put down an
uprising, the Soviet and Hungarian water polo teams met in the
Olympics. The angry Hungarians made the game brutal, and there was
blood in the pool as Hungary won.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 men's and six women's teams, each using seven
players, including a goalkeeper. The men will play two six-team
round-robins to qualify for playoffs, with the round-robin winners
meeting for the gold medal. The women, in their Olympic debut, will
play a round-robin, with the top four teams playing for the medals.
The men's pool is 30-by-20 meters (33-by-22 yards) and must be at
least 2 meters (6{ feet) deep. The women's pool is slightly
smaller. A game lasts four seven-minute quarters. Players are not
allowed to touch the bottom or sides of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Much like basketball. Most scoring comes from counterattacks
(fast breaks), and if that is foiled, the next options are getting
the ball to the low post (the 2-meter position) or shooting from
the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The strongest teams are the Yugoslav, Hungarian and U.S. men and
the Australian, Dutch and U.S. women. Chris Humbert (6 feet 7
inches, 235 pounds) of Lodi, Calif., is perhaps the world's best
man at the 2-meter position. Coralie Simmons, an attacker from
Hemet, Calif., leads the U.S. women.

straight-away center field (420).

which is between the left-center-field marker and straight-away

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE NOW IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 RESISTANCE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hollie Mullin of
Olathe had her first taste of amoxicillin when she was less than a
month old, for an ear infection that was making her fussy and
disturbing her sleep.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her parents insisted on an antibiotic, even though her doctor
advised against it.
</P>
<P>
   Hollie's second prescription for antibiotics came just a month
later. And then she got another, and another. Seventeen
prescriptions in all by her first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollie's symptoms persisted, and her infection worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed to so many antibiotics, pneumococcal bacteria in
Hollie's ears adapted to the drugs designed to destroy them. They
evolved into superbugs that none of the drugs could kill.
</P>
<P>
   Only one antibiotic was left in the arsenal: vancomycin, one of
the few drugs that could successfully attack such
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Three times a day for 14 days,
Hollie received intravenous doses.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily that worked.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like Hollie's are becoming all too common, experts say.
Antibiotic resistance, the scourge of hospitals and nursing homes
worldwide, is now a serious threat to children as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cases among children are ``a major contributor to the prevalence
of (antibiotic) resistance as a whole,'' said Matthew Moore, an
infectious- disease expert who monitors antibiotic resistance at
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Routine childhood problems such as ear and sinus infections are
becoming tougher and more costly to treat. The usual dose of
amoxicillin for ear infections now is three or four times what it
used to be to ensure that the bacteria are killed, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   And more threatening infections such as meningitis are yielding
less willingly to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-resistant infections are more likely to require
hospitalization. Hospital stays are longer. And the chances of
death are greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing two, three antibiotic-resistant cases a week in my
clinic,'' said Lloyd Olson, the infectious-disease expert at
Children's Mercy Hospital who finally cured Hollie with vancomycin.
``Ten years ago I never saw one.'' Sharing the blame
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and parents are to blame, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Parents insist that their children get antibiotics for colds and
other viral infections antibiotics cannot treat. And doctors are
far too willing to prescribe the drugs, even when they know they
will not be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really painted ourselves into a corner with
antibiotic-resistant bacteria,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has a campaign under way involving drug companies,
health departments and managed-care organizations to get doctors to
use antibiotics more sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Because children under 5 are so frequently doused with
antibiotics, they have the highest rate of antibiotic-resistant
infections of any age group _ as much as twice that of 20- to
40-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Children also face the greatest risk of running out of effective
antibiotics, said Ronald Jones, a microbiologist with the Sentry
Antimicrobial Surveillance program at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Many newer antibiotics have not been adequately tested in
children; some older drugs cannot be used for children, because
they inhibit bone growth or cause joint swelling.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing antibiotic-resistance problem in children is
an infection like Hollie Mullin's that is caused by pneumococcal
bacteria, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   These bacteria are the most common cause of ear infections in
children. When the bacteria invade deep into the body, they can
cause life-threatening blood infections, meningitis, pneumonia and
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients at Children's Mercy, about 45 percent of serious
pneumococcal infections are antibiotic-resistant, hospital figures
show. Nationwide, about 25 percent to 35 percent of all
pneumococcal infections show some resistance. New weapons give hope
</P>
<P>
   There is hope in the form of a newly approved vaccine against
pneumococcal bacteria. In February the CDC's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices recommended it for all children under 2.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurance plans, as well as the federal Vaccines for
Children program, are covering the new vaccine. Kansas and Missouri
health officials expect to have it available for low-income
children by mid-September at local health departments, at public
health clinics and through doctors participating in Vaccines for
Children.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine protects against seven strains of the bacteria that
cause 80 percent of pneumococcal disease in children under 6. While
the vaccine is designed to prevent dangerous illnesses such as
meningitis, it may eliminate some ear infections as well.
</P>
<P>
   A study in California by the Kaiser Permanente HMO system found
the vaccine cut the overall rate of ear infections by 8 percent. It
lowered recurrent ear infections _ five or more in a six-month
period _ by 23 percent and reduced by 20 percent the number of
children getting ear tubes to drain infected ears. Excessive drugs
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that doctors overprescribe
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Preschool children average four to eight colds per year, studies
show. About 70 percent of their upper respiratory infections are
caused by viruses and clear up on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But almost half the children diagnosed with these viral
infections get prescriptions for antibiotics _ even though
antibiotics kill only bacteria and are ineffective against viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings about overprescribing may be working, however. A new
CDC survey of 2,500 doctors shows the antibiotic prescription rate
dropped 34 percent from 1989-90 to 1997-98 for children under age
15. The drop was 12 percent for common problems such as earaches
and bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   But parental demands still play a big role in whether children
get antibiotics. One recent study found that when doctors thought
parents expected antibiotics for their child's earache, sore
throat, cough or congestion, they prescribed the drugs 62 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors did not perceive a demand for antibiotics, they
prescribed them to only 7 percent of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I know any doctor who hasn't given antibiotics
against his better judgment,'' said Chris Pinkham, a family
practitioner in Kansas City. ``There's a great deal of pressure to
prescribe. Our society is not very tolerant of delayed
gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkham said anxious parents often acted as advocates, demanding
antibiotics to make their child well.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Hollie Mullin's parents, Rob and Gail.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very, very unhappy baby. As first-time parents,
that's pretty overwhelming,'' Gail Mullin said. ``We wanted a quick
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hollie's infected ears did not respond to amoxicillin, she
was switched to Augmentin, then Zithromax and Rocephin and
Gantrisin. Her doctors repeatedly suggested holding off on more
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mullins were uncomfortable with that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, `Yeah, yeah,' and in 24 hours I would call in
tears and say she's really sick; put her on antibiotics,'' Gail
Mullin said. ``But we were only making Hollie more sick. We had
created a monster.'' Vaccine suggested
</P>
<P>
   Pneumococci resistant to penicillin and penicillin-related drugs
such as amoxicillin first appeared in Kansas City in 1993, said
Mary Anne Jackson, a physician and infectious disease expert at
Children's Mercy who is working with area doctors to reduce
antibiotic use.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urges doctors to give children the pneumococcal vaccine.
And she suggests diagnostic tests, such as those available for
strep throat and flu, before prescribing antibiotics. The tests
help determine whether patients have a bacterial infection that
responds to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're all trying to do the right thing, but
sometimes they get their arm twisted'' to prescribe antibiotics,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mullins said they had learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use an antibiotic when you shouldn't and the next time,
it's not going to work,'' Gail Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollie, now almost 3, has been antibiotic-free for more than a
year. She has had a couple of colds, but her parents have not
panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I'd have said, `Rob, she's sick. Let's take her to the
doctor.' Now we shrug our shoulders,'' Gail Mullin said.

SALUTING CZECHS' FREEDOM AT LANDMARKS TO LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Also filed in ``i'' category)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Within sight of the statue that has symbolized
freedom to millions of immigrants, Czech-Americans from around the
country gathered on Saturday to meet Vaclav Havel, the man whose
words, wisdom and will gently edged communism from Czechoslovakia,
returning to them a nation and a spiritual home that many thought
they had lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood before the Manhattan skyline, Havel, the president
of the Czech Republic, said he had long known Ellis Island and the
Statue of Liberty only from literature and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   He evoked memories of those who came to United States to pursue
a new life _ including the Czech settlers who came to escape the
Hapsburg rulers in the 19th and early 20th centuries and who were
the subject of an exhibition that opened on Saturday at Ellis
Island.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel noted: ``The flame of liberty has been spreading
haltingly throughout the world; our country, too, has been free for
the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanka Kudej, of Westchester County, who fled Czechoslovakia
after Soviet troops invaded in 1968, said: ``We are so glad to have
back a republic of our own.'' Havel, she said, is the first
president whom many Czechs accept as their own. ``No other
president meant anything to us,'' she said. ``They were only
appointed. This one means freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 700 Czechs who traveled to New York from as far
away as New Orleans and Houston, the day offered a chance to get a
glimpse and perhaps a photo of the man who accomplished what few
thought would happen in their lifetimes. So many people were intent
on getting photos, or at least a good view of the president, in
fact, that when Havel _ who came to New York to attend the summit
of world leaders at the United Nations _ and his wife, Dasa,
boarded the ferry to Ellis Island at Battery Park, the boat listed
alarmingly to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Kutil, of Queens County, did not seem so intent on getting
a photo, however. ``I came to say thank you to Havel,'' she said
simply, with her daughter and grandchildren nearby. She recalled
her arrival in the United States 30 years ago, in the wake of the
occupation by Soviet troops, and said she felt tremendous gratitude
toward this country. ``But,'' she said, ``I still feel Czech.''
</P>
<P>
   Zdena Hyblova Heller said that Havel helped reunite her with the
country she left in the 1950s, at the age of 16. When she first
arrived in the United States, she said, she was sure that nothing
would ever change in Czechoslovakia and that she could never go
back, so she turned her back on her Czech past. ``I wanted to be
part of America,'' said Hyblova Heller, a poet who lives in Rye,
N.Y. ``I didn't want to tear my heart out all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a peaceful revolution swept Czechoslovakia in 1989,
she returned for the first time, and regained a part of herself.
``I admire Havel, because we both stand for the same things,
basically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embodies the hope that the world underneath is somehow
good, and we can dig our way to it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Ellis Island ceremony, the Havels went to the Bohemian
Hall beer garden in Astoria, N.Y., in Queens County, to plant the
Czech national tree, a linden, before sitting down for goulash and
several mugs of Czech beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have much hope in those who have not been deformed by
communism,'' Havel said, referring to the generation that is coming
of age in the Czech Republic. ``Freedom is something they take for
granted. Once this generation takes power, that belief will pass
into public life.''

No. 1 Nebraska survives OT scare against Notre Dame
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Touchdown Jesus wept.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, much of South Bend probably was weeping Saturday
after Nebraska, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, eked out a
27-24 overtime victory over No. 23 Notre Dame before 80,232 at
Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish were supposed to be outclassed and
overmatched against the mighty Cornhuskers, but on this day Notre
Dame, a team that in the past has has relied heavily upon its
storied history for inspiration in big games like this, was on the
verge of making a little history of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the Irish could only come this close to
their biggest upset in recent memory, finally going down when
Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch turned the corner and scored on a
seven-yard run to finally end Notre Dame's dreams of a miracle
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it wasn't going to be easy coming into this stadium
and getting out of here with a win,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich
said. ``It was a great ballgame. I think it lived up to all the
expectations the fans and the media had with all the publicity that
came with this game. I think both teams will be glad to move on
with the rest of their schedules after this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers (2-0) are more than happy to move along after
almost blowing a 14-point second-half lead. They were considered
virtually invincible, even though they looked decidedly mortal
while sleepwalking through an opening-week, 49-13 victory over San
Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish (1-1), who entered the game as 13{-point underdogs,
took their first lead of the game at 24-21 after Nick Setta
connected on a 29-yard field goal on the opening series of
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch's touchdown run came right in front of the Notre Dame
student section, most of whom were still frozen in their seats 20
minutes after the game, apparently unable to accept the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And Crouch's touchdown happened in the shadow of Hesburgh
Memorial Library, on the side of which is the mosaic of Jesus that
is as much a part of the Notre Dame tradition as Knute Rockne and
the Four Horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that I'll never forget, especially at a place
like Notre Dame,'' Crouch said. ``Just the aura that this place
has. It's real hard for any team rated No. 1 to come in here and
beat these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But this game was less about mystique than it was about mistakes
_ most of which were committed by the Nebraska special teams, who
allowed Notre Dame to pull off a 100-yard kick return by Julius
Jones and an 83-yard punt return by Joey Getherall to rally and tie
the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an area that we're going to have to address,'' Solich
said of the Cornhuskers' special-teams lapses. ``We were, for the
most part, a very good special-teams team last season. But there
was some concern about that entering our fall camp, and those
concerns stayed with us in our first ballgame. And it's still
there, so that is an area we need to address.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mistake in the Notre Dame pass coverage, though, that
wound up costing the Irish dearly. Faced with a third-and-nine in
overtime, Crouch found tight end Tracey Wistrom with a nine-yard
pass, giving Nebraska four new downs from the 15-yard line. Two
plays later, Crouch, who rushed for 80 yards, rolled left and ran
into the end zone untouched for his third touchdown of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that was the biggest play of the game,'' said Crouch,
who finished 7-of-15 passing for 103 yards, of his third-down pass
to Wistrom. ``That's something we've been working on ever since we
started working on our passing game _ the spread set.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie appeared as stunned as the Irish
faithful in the postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities to win this football game,
particularly with the kickoff return and the punt return,'' said
Davie, who is trying to return his team to national prominence
after a disappointing 5-7 record in 1999. ``It was disappointing,
obviously. To have an opportunity to beat the No. 1 football team
in the nation in your stadium, certainly it is disappointing to all
of us to not come out of there with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a slight hint of controversy to this game _ when is it
ever otherwise at Notre Dame these days? The Irish got the ball
with 59 seconds left but opted to let the clock run out rather than
attempt a desperation play to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that without question that was the right decision to
put that game into overtime,'' Davie said. ``I would do the same
thing 10 out of 10 times again. We get the football back with a
minute left in the game, we have two timeouts and we have a
quarterback (Arnaz Battle) who has completed three passes on the
day (out of 15 attempts but with 107 yards rushing). I wanted to
get that game into overtime and give our team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Notre Dame didn't completely stop the Cornhuskers'
attack, the Irish did slow it down in the second half. Dan
Alexander, who broke the 200-yard mark in Nebraska's opener, was
held to 112 yards on 24 carries. And Correll Buckhalter, who had
113 yards vs. San Jose State, was held to 43.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers began the half with a 14-7 lead and quickly
added another seven points when Alexander scored on a 28-yard run.
Jones then took the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to
pull to within 21-14 with 8:30 left in the third quarter, and
Getherall came back just over two minutes into the fourth quarter
with his 83-yard punt return to tie the score and throw a scare
into Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd like to go through the season without any
tests, but that's the way it works,'' Solich said. ``We have gotten
better because of this football game. I don't think there's any
question about it. I think this will draw us closer together and
help us work on the goal that this team has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me (where the Cornhuskers are ranked this
week). It matters to me if people don't recognize the quality of
game this was and what it took to win this game. Wherever we're at,
(No.) 1, 2 or whatever, we're ready to move on.''

Applewhite comes off bench to spark Texas in opener
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ Remember me?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one actually forgot who Major Applewhite was, but
it seemed like his accomplishments the past two seasons as Texas'
starting quarterback had been filed under distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent memory of Applewhite on the football field was
of him writhing in pain, clutching an injured knee in an
embarrassing loss to Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl eight months ago.
And the two memories immediately before that were of him being
tossed around like a dish rag by Nebraska's Blackshirts defense in
a blowout defeat in the Big 12 Championship Game and of him
vomiting on the sideline before a loss at Texas A&AMP;M last year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Applewhite, who did not start for only the second time
in 25 games, moved his file from distant memory to random access
memory, as he led Texas to a 52-10 romp over Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   The junior entered the game to a thunderous applause from the
80,017 in attendance, subbing for sophomore Chris Simms with 1:27
left in the first quarter and Texas trailing 10-0. By the half,
Applewhite had thrown for 246 yards and two touchdowns and Texas
scored 31 unanswered points, its most points in a quarter in more
than 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said that I didn't have a feeling that might
happen,'' Applewhite said of his not starting. ``There's more than
just one way to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say `fine' and just accept it, or you can pout, or you
can accept it and keep working hard, or you can accept and
understand that college football changes like (a snap of the
fingers). But just as quickly as things changed today, they could
change next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms didn't want to leave the game when he was pulled, but he
said he understood the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that Major was going in and he was going to go in
sooner or later,'' Simms said. ``The offense, we didn't get it done
when I was in there, and he came in and they got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from Texas coaches on the possibility of a
change in the starter for next week at Stanford, but Applewhite
definitely made a case for a switch, and it appeared to be as easy
as a snap of the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas went into its ``one-minute'' offense, with Applewhite in
the shotgun, going without huddles after all completions.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, who completed 18 of 26 passes for 315 yards,
directed the Longhorns to seven consecutive scoring drives (none
that took longer than 2:19), before giving way to Simms midway
through the third period with Texas ahead comfortably 45-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are starting quarterbacks, and we've said that
all week,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``It wasn't that Major got
beaten out by Chris at all. It wasn't a competition. But we were
hoping that Chris would have a great day and Major would come in
and have a great day and we'd have them both ready for next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, what happened is Chris had some bad luck. Major
came in and had a great day, and Chris came back and had a great
day. So, we're back to where we started. We have two starting
quarterbacks and you might as well not ask, because I'm not going
to say anything about next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that Major was able to play so well, coming
off a knee operation, and I was really pleased to see that for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The long unanswered question of who would start at quarterback
for the Longhorns was answered when Simms took the field with the
first unit for the first two series of downs, but things did not go
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns managed three first downs during their first two
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   After Louisiana-Lafayette took the opening kick and went 77
yards in 15 plays to score on a Brent Bergeron 21-yard field goal,
Texas moved into Ragin' Cajuns territory but did not convert as
Kris Stockton missed a 52-yard field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Longhorns took over, Simms, while scrambling
to his right, threw a poor pass that was intercepted by the Ragin'
Cajuns' Terrence Hunter and returned 43 yards for a touchdown to
put Louisiana-Lafayette up 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't jerk Chris because of the interception,'' Brown
said. ``We just felt like it would be a good time to settle
everybody down. We thought we'd still win the game (by a wide
margin), which would give us a chance to come back with Chris and
let him get settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms, who finished 7-of-14 passing for 88 yards, returned with
8:04 remaining in the third quarter to lead Texas on a four-play,
50-yard drive that he capped with a nice scramble and toss to
Hodges Mitchell for a 13-yard touchdown to end the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at the big picture,'' Simms said. ``I know
Major came out and (played well), but it's not like next week. I
have to go out and catch up with his yardage and whatever. It
doesn't matter. It's all about playing well and getting the `W.'''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn's ninth-inning strikeout Saturday
was No. 157 for the season, breaking Reggie Jackson's single-season
Anaheim Angels record, set in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a career-high _ low? _ for Vaughn, who led the

A.L. strikeout ``title'' again this season. And No. 2 in the A.L.
in strikeouts is Angels teammate Troy Glaus, at 139.

times.

starting rotation because of ``a fatigued elbow,'' something the
rookie right-hander said shouldn't keep him sidelined too long.

   ``It flares up once in a while,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it's
jujst a one-start thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who was scheduled to start this evening's game against the
Orioles, has made six starts since he was summoned from Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Al Levine (3-4) will take Wise's spot. It will be
Levine's third career start and second this year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Running away: Darin Erstad moved into 10th place on the
Angels' single-season runs-scored list when he walked and
eventually scored run No. 104 in the third inning. The club record
for runs in a season is 120, established by Jim Edmonds in 1995.

   __ Trading up: The Dodgers' Pedro Martinez-for-Delino DeShields

   But at least DeShields is showing again why the Dodgers had
interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he had two hits and drove in three runs for the
Orioles. In his last 37 games DeShields is hitting at .348 clip
with 23 runs batted in and 19 runs scored. For the season he's

PHILLIES BEAT METS, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the frustration was going to show on the Mets
Saturday night, at least they expressed it safely. Unlike Mike
Hampton, who had toppled a pair of water coolers on Friday night,
Turk Wendell merely tossed his glove into the stands as he walked
off the mound, eliciting the few cheers from the Shea Stadium crowd
during the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had good reason to toss gloves, bats or just about
anything else they could find as their September troubles
continued. The bats were silent again, almost a given by now, but
on Saturday night, the gloves failed, too, or at least the glove of
the usually steady Edgardo Alfonzo. Alfonzo, the second baseman,
committed two errors in the seventh inning, helping the
Philadelphia Phillies to a pair of runs and a 6-3 victory that sent
the Mets to their third consecutive loss and their seventh in eight
games since the calendar rolled around to September.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets fell four games behind Atlanta, which played Montreal
Saturday night. In the wild-card race, Arizona picked up a game on
the Mets and is now three and a half games behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had just given the Mets their first run in two nights
with a two-out, run-scoring double in the bottom of the sixth,
evening the score at 1-1. But he allowed one ball to bound past him
and then another to slip through his hands. And the Mets had found
a new way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets managed six hits off the former Met Robert Person and a
procession of Philadelphia pitchers, closing the gap to 3-2 on
Derek Bell's solo homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It took just three outs to see that the Mets' troubles were not
going to be solved by closed-door meetings, just as they had not
been solved by the arrival of the league's worst team. A 2-0
shutout on Friday was followed by a closed-door meeting after the
game and then Saturday night by blanks from Person. In the first
inning, Bell was retired on a hard line drive that shortstop Alex
Arias went to his knees to snag. With two runners on and two out,
Robin Ventura battled from 0-2 to work the count full, and he
ripped a line drive down the first-base line, right at Brian
Hunter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Timo Perez drilled a single to right. When Bell
laced a 1-0 pitch back through the box for an apparent hit, Perez
was running, bringing Marlon Anderson over to cover second base.
Anderson easily scooped up the grounder, stepped on the bag and
started a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing the same baseball we were playing when we won 30
out of 40 or 20 out of 30 and everyone said, `Gee, they're the most
well-balanced team,''' Manager Bobby Valentine said before the
game. ``We're the exact same team playing the exact same way, just
misfiring on a few hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got more of those line drives that could not find a
hole Saturday night, and at times they felt as if they were not
even being given the opportunity to hit the ball hard. In the
second inning, Mike Bordick signaled for a timeout just as Person
was starting his windup, but the home plate umpire, Travis
Katzenmeier, did not grant it. Bordick quickly adjusted, grounding
weakly to shortstop and then glaring at Katzenmeier as he ran to
first. Bordick returned down the baseline, arguing his case
unsuccessfully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If their bats were not waking from their September slumber, the
Mets were at least hanging even thanks to the arm of Glendon Rusch
(9-11), as well as the glove of Bell. Rusch eased through the first
three innings, as Hampton had on Friday night. But Hampton was
undone by a two-run homer by Scott Rolen. This time, Pat Burrell's
bid for a solo blast was foiled by Bell, who snared the ball at the
top of the wall in right field. With that bit of help, Rusch
extended his string of scoreless innings to a career-high 16 as the
teams remained in a scoreless tie through five innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth inning, the Mets slipped over the fine line
they had been straddling and fell behind again as Burrell lined a
double just over the head of Perez, scoring Doug Glanville, who had
singled and stolen second.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally scored their first run in two nights, evening
the score at 1-1 in the bottom of the sixth when Matt Franco,
pinch-hitting for Rusch, worked out a walk and, after moving to
second on a groundout, scored on a double by Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfonzo uncharacteristically gave the run right back in the
top of the seventh, allowing a hard grounder by Bobby Abreu to get
through for an error, putting runners on second and third with none
out. Travis Lee then scored on a sacrifice fly to center by
Glanville, beating the throw from Perez. After an intentional walk,
Burrell lined a single to right to score Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Hunter sealed the Phillies' victory with a
three-run homer off Armando Benitez.

A LOOK AT JOHN E. ROBINSON SR.'S PAST INDICATES A TALENT FOR
FORGERY 
</HEADLINE>
 LETTERS, 2 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Rick Montgomery  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At face value a 1985
letter bearing the signature of Lisa Stasi left a hopeful farewell
from a struggling young mother who has been missing ever since.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was typed by someone who used poor punctuation and a heavy
thumb on the space bar, leaving long gaps between words.
</P>
<P>
   The same gaffes appear in another goodbye _ a note signed ``Love
ya, Paula.'' That letter is thought to have been written about the
time Paula Godfrey vanished in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling similarity: Both letters share the same
typeface _ a typewriter print with oddly shaped characters,
according to a document examiner hired last month by The Kansas
City Star.
</P>
<P>
   Those unusual ``j's'' and ``l's'' also surface on a 1984
document prepared by John Edward Robinson Sr. and filed with the
Kansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   The letters of Stasi and ``Paula'' now are in the hands of
murder investigators, who list the two among the possible victims
of Robinson, suspected of being a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   If genuine, the farewell notes would portray two 19-year-old
women who chose to leave the Kansas City area and build new lives.
</P>
<P>
   But doubtful investigators know that Robinson's past is a
criminal archive of suspicious paper. In fact, 30 years of court
records cast him as a prolific man of letters _ forged, fabricated
and otherwise faked.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of The Star, Stephen C. McKasson, a document
examiner who has worked for the Illinois State Police and the U.S.
Postal Inspection Service crime labs, studied nearly three dozen
photocopied correspondences, public documents and professional
certificates related to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   What McKasson found, he said, appeared to be the handiwork of an
``intermediate'' forger and cut-and-paste artist _ clever enough to
use at least three different machines for typing documents but
clumsy enough to leave telltale traces of a common author.
</P>
<P>
   McKasson speculated that the letters purportedly written by
Stasi and ``Paula'' might have been composed on the same
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   His guess: a common IBM Selectric on which users could install
different typefaces or fonts by replacing the type ball.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the unusual ``J's'' and lowercase ``l's'', ``that's
a typeface I'm not familiar with,'' said McKasson, who has nearly
30 years of experience in identifying forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Because The Star could provide him only photocopies of the
letters, however, McKasson said he could not determine with
certainty that the same typewriter was used.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Evans, the Kansas attorney leading Robinson's defense,
declined to comment Saturday. Paper chain
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 56, faces murder charges in the disappearance of Stasi
and in the deaths of four other women and a disabled teen-age girl
whose bodies turned up in barrels on property he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been charged in connection with Godfrey's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The letters may be part of prosecutors' efforts to establish
that Robinson _ a career con artist with a penchant for forgery _
took steps to make people believe that missing women linked to him
had left the area and were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson crossed paths with Stasi and her infant daughter
Tiffany in January 1985, as he was promoting a charity program
supposedly aimed at helping young mothers in need. Stasi's
relatives told police that Robinson made her sign blank sheets of
paper before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey had met Robinson several months earlier. According to
her father, Bill Godfrey, she disappeared after telling the family
she was headed to Texas to take clerical training courses arranged
by Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Star provided Godfrey's father a copy of the ``Paula''
letter, which the newspaper obtained in July from the widow of one
of Robinson's business associates. Bill Godfrey said the signature,
with its extravagant capital ``P,'' was not his daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey reportedly worked for Robinson and thus might have had
access to an office typewriter. Stasi, however, appeared to have
known Robinson only a few days before vanishing from an Overland
Park hotel. He paid for the room after picking up Stasi and Tiffany
at a battered women's shelter, court records state.
</P>
<P>
   Other documents obtained by The Star point to a chain of
suspicious papers linked to Robinson having nothing to do with
missing persons, but which portray a man seemingly bent on
deceiving people.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1960s, when he worked locally as an X-ray
technician, a variety of medical certificates on his office wall
raised the eyebrows of co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   McKasson examined photocopies of four certificates from medical
technologist associations proclaiming Robinson certified in X-ray,
nuclear medicine and medical laboratory technologies. His two-year
stint at a junior college in Illinois didn't provide such courses,
and trade organizations found no record of Robinson ever being
certified.
</P>
<P>
   McKasson said that the lettering of Robinson's name was
identical in all four certificates. That coincidence and
irregularities in the documents hinted at a cut-and-paste job, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Davis, a former neighbor of Robinson's, said he was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s Robinson took Davis to his Overland Park,
Kan., consulting office, which had a word processor, a paper cutter
and a photocopier. Robinson demonstrated how to cut a signature
from one letter, paste it to another and dab on correction fluid to
produce a phony document, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my eyes, it looked ... good,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Robinson soon had a falling out when, according to
Davis, Robinson used his cut-and-paste skills to forge a letter
intended to cheat Davis' father out of money.

A LOOK AT JOHN E. ROBINSON SR.'S PAST INDICATES A TALENT FOR
FORGERY 
</HEADLINE>
 LETTERS, TAKE 2-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Rick Montgomery  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Davis and Robinson soon had a falling
out when, according to Davis, Robinson used his cut-and-paste
skills to forge a letter intended to cheat Davis' father out of
money.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Godfrey and Stasi disappeared, Robinson was serving
probation on a 1981 conviction for stealing from an ex-employer,
Guy's Foods in Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   His probation officer, Steve Haymes, learned of Robinson's links
to the missing women and pressed Clay County prosecutors in 1985 to
revoke the probation and put Robinson behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson fought back, hiring a nonprofit organization to compile
a booklet outlining his civic deeds and volunteer activities for
Clay County Circuit Judge John Hutcherson's consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet included several letters, including one seemingly
written on University of Kansas stationery by a dean. It thanks
John and Nancy Robinson for their $2,000 donation to an education
fund.
</P>
<P>
   University officials last month said they could find no record
of the Robinsons making such a donation. And even if the couple had
donated, a thank-you note would not have come from the university's
Office of Admissions, as indicated in the letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   Fishy letters, in fact, filled the Robinson booklet prepared by
the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   A letter of reference signed by Joe Ensminger, who headed a
Kansas association of referees, chimed: ``I know John Robinson as a
fine person and am proud to call him a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   They did become acquainted when Robinson was a school volleyball
referee in the 1980s. But Ensminger said last week, ``I did not
write that letter.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it appear on Ensminger's own stationery, under the
letterhead of his organization _ the Sunflower Officials
Association?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, he said. When Robinson joined the organization, ``one of
the first things he said was, `You need some stationery and some
business cards. I'll get them for you,' '' Ensminger recalled.
``And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensminger said his signature was ``a pretty good replica,''
except for one botched ``e'' and the fact that Ensminger's name
appeared at the bottom left corner instead of the bottom right.
</P>
<P>
   Document expert McKasson noticed slightly jittery, labored
penmanship in Ensminger's signature and in several other letters
included in the court booklet on Robinson. Such an effect might
result from tracing signatures on a light table, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awkward, tremorous, hesitant style to many of these
signatures, which certainly suggests slowness in the writing,''
McKasson said. ``They just look funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: a 1985 letter supposedly typed and signed by
``Linda White,'' unknown to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Robinson's own signature _ rushed and illegible
beyond its capital ``J'' and ``R'' _ Linda White's signature
resembles a grade school pupil's, with slow, rudimentary strokes.
</P>
<P>
   McKasson said forgers whose natural handwriting was sloppy
sometimes resorted to ``copybook form'' when concocting a
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if they go back to concentrating how they were taught
to write in second grade, trying to bring back the letter forms as
they appeared on the blackboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the Linda White letter is as intriguing as the
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The writer described herself as a jobless, pregnant mother of
three when she met Robinson through a social-service contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Christmas eve, Mr. Robinson and his children brought boxes
of things over to the house,'' the letter stated. ``There were
socks, underwear and clothes for all the kids, several toys for
each of the kids and food for Christmas day and enough for a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could'nt (sic) believe that anyone could be so nice to
people they did'nt (sic) even know....I had my baby in January and
because of the help and encouragement I received from Mr. Robinson
and his wife, I decided to keep my baby....
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I are greatful (sic) to the Robinson's (sic) and
it makes us all feel good to know that there are people like them
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the typographical errors and misplaced apostrophes _
which crop up in Robinson's own writings _ the computer-generated
look of the letter caught McKasson's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Its typeface, spacing and straight margins on both sides
replicated a 1982 letter to Boy Scout leaders, written and signed
by ``Your friend in Scouting, John Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Few word processors at the time were capable of producing such
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever computer Robinson used, ``it was darned-near state of
the art,'' McKasson said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Bowersock said she just followed orders.
</P>
<P>
   As a secretary for Professional Services Association _ a medical
consulting firm run by Robinson in the mid-1970s _ Bowersock was
instructed to type and sign fraudulent letters aimed at convincing
investors that Robinson's company was on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of those letters prompted a federal grand jury to
indict Robinson for fraud. The jurors compelled Bowersock to
testify, but they did not indict her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 24 years old, five months pregnant and naive as all get
out,'' she said in a recent interview. She earned about $7 per
hour, a comfortable wage at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was literally paid to keep my mouth shut'' about the schemes
of her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a Raytown office building also occupied by a dentist,
a lawyer and a financial adviser, Robinson provided Bowersock
handwritten scripts and ``several copies of different kinds of
letterhead,'' she said. ``He told me to find different typewriters
around the building'' to compose the letters.
</P>
<P>
   As Bowersock typed, Robinson tried to ease her suspicions. He
said he knew the people associated with the forged letters. Because
of their busy schedules, they had given their OK for Robinson's
company to write the letters and to sign their names, he assured
her.
</P>
<P>
   One letter that triggered Robinson's indictment was a phony
announcement from the dean of dentistry at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City, claiming that Robinson had been voted a full
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Another letter, purportedly written by an executive at Kansas
City-based Marion Laboratories Inc., suggested that the drug
manufacturer was considering acquiring Robinson's company.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge fined Robinson $2,500 and placed him on three
years of probation for defrauding investors.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept putting lies on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, while running a consulting firm called Equi-Plus,
Robinson allegedly sent inflated bills and doctored invoices to a
client wishing to market back-care seminars. Amid Robinson's firm
denials, his attorney, Ronald Wood, advised Robinson to secure
sworn affidavits from associates and subcontractors stating that
the invoices were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson obliged. Wood presented the affidavits to a Johnson
County, Kan., judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned out to be bogus, too,'' Wood recalled. ``He makes
up a forgery to cover up other forgeries. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in 1986 convicted Robinson of theft by deception in the
back-care case. Another jury soon found him guilty of writing a
false document in an Arizona condominium swindle.
</P>
<P>
   Does this paper trail of forgery lead to murder?
</P>
<P>
   McKasson said the documents he examined did not prove that
Robinson killed anybody.
</P>
<P>
   But they may help authorities who hope to build a case that
Robinson is his own worst concoction _ clumsy con man and stealthy
serial killer, forged into one.

UNWANTED RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS NEWSPAPER AFFILIATION (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn's ninth-inning strikeout Saturday
was No. 157 for the season, breaking Reggie Jackson's single-season
Anaheim Angels record, set in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a career-high _ low? _ for Vaughn, who led the
American League in whiffs with 150 in 1995. He's headed for the
A.L. strikeout ``title'' again this season. And No. 2 in the A.L.
in strikeouts is Angels teammate Troy Glaus, at 139.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in his 10-year career Vaughn has fanned 150 or more
times.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not so Wise: Matt Wise will miss at least one turn in the
starting rotation because of ``a fatigued elbow,'' something the
rookie right-hander said shouldn't keep him sidelined too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flares up once in a while,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it's
jujst a one-start thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who was scheduled to start this evening's game against the
Orioles, has made six starts since he was summoned from Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Al Levine (3-4) will take Wise's spot. It will be
Levine's third career start and second this year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Running away: Darin Erstad moved into 10th place on the
Angels' single-season runs-scored list when he walked and
eventually scored run No. 104 in the third inning. The club record
for runs in a season is 120, established by Jim Edmonds in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   __ Trading up: The Dodgers' Pedro Martinez-for-Delino DeShields
trade before the 1994 season may go down as the worst in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   But at least DeShields is showing again why the Dodgers had
interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he had two hits and drove in three runs for the
Orioles. In his last 37 games DeShields is hitting at .348 clip
with 23 runs batted in and 19 runs scored. For the season he's
hitting he's hitting .302.
</P>
<P>
   ptsub Familiar tune
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of real interleague
</P>
<P>
   Filling in at the organ Saturday for the Angels' Peggy Duquenel
was Nancy Bea Hefley, the Dodgers' longtime organist.
</P>
<P>
   __ Prince Hatch?: Manager Mike Scioscia has a new nickname for
his longtime buddy, the irrepressible Mickey Hatcher, the Angels'
hitting coach: ``Hatch Patkin,'' a spinoff on the late Max Patkin,
known as the ``Clown Prince of Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Hatcher isn't wild about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got too many teeth,'' complained Hatcher, with his
characteristic smile. ``Max had only one tooth.''

DREAM OF A RIVER FOUNTAIN FACES MANY PRACTICAL HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
 WOES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Jeffrey Spivak and James A. Fussell  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If it's Louisville,
Ky., on the phone, Kansas City might not want to answer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reason: one towering but problematic fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people lined Louisville's riverfront and jammed
bridges to see the flowerlike spray when it was first turned on in
1988. But over a decade, the fountain broke down continually. It
was turned off for good two years ago, and now Louisville officials
are trying to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   And Kansas City, of course, is in the market for a megafountain.
</P>
<P>
   A civic group involved in Kansas City's 150th birthday in June
proposed ``the world's largest river fountain.'' It was the most
visually compelling of the group's ``giant steps'' for the future.
Top foundations are interested in funding steps like the fountain,
and the first fountain-planning meeting is scheduled next week.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, creating such a fountain is tricky and risky. Some
river fountains dazzle and others disappoint; some last decades and
others meet untimely deaths. Pittsburgh's gets shown on TV when
that city is host to Monday Night Football, and couples get married
next to Chicago's. Yet Louisville's and New York City's turned into
embarrassments.

   The lesson for Kansas City: A river fountain can be an
attraction, but only if it's working. So building one, authorities
in other cities say, can't be done cheaply or without careful
planning. The most successful ones don't even use river water _ and
Kansas City's may not have to, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do it willy-nilly,'' said Phil Miller, who has
studied river fountains as the construction manager for one now
being built along the riverfront in Dayton, Ohio. ``You need to do
it first-class.''
</P>
<P>
   When a KC150 committee unveiled the ``giant steps,'' former
Kansas Citian Win Koerper received a telephone call in Arizona.
``They've got your idea, Win,'' an old friend told him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Koerper in the 1960s had tried selling Kansas City's
tourism bureau on a heart-shaped river fountain _ symbolizing the
``heart of America.'' He had developed a fondness for fountains
while working for fountain-loving Joyce Hall, Hallmark's founder.
Then he moved to Phoenix to run his own advertising firm there.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to resurrect his fountain idea in Kansas City _ and
this time, civic leaders are listening.
</P>
<P>
   Koerper will meet Tuesday with representatives from the Hall
Family Foundation, which is interested in financing the fountain,
and the City of Fountains Foundation, which is spearheading the
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The foundations and some other civic leaders regard a river
fountain as one way to draw Kansas Citians back to the Missouri
River. As Arthur S. Brisbane, publisher of The Kansas City Star and
co-chairman of the ``giant steps'' committee, explained: ``We are
the City of Fountains, to begin with, and...(the committee) saw the
river fountain as a way to recapture the river and riverfront as a
dramatic site for Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   With his fountain, Koerper foresees two water sprays going up
diagonally and then curving downward, forming the top loops of a
heart. Maybe, he thinks, it could be hundreds of feet high, like
the tallest fountains in the world. And maybe there could be a
covered boardwalk that juts into the river and screens sightseers
from the fountain's falling mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a pretty awesome experience,'' Koerper said.
``It could be like Niagara Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   River fountains can instantly become attractions, overnight
sensations, civic jewels.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, a 200-foot-high geyser off Point State Park in
the Ohio River ``has taken on the role as the signature feature''
of that city, according to a regional parks manager. In Chicago,
tourists gather every hour downtown to see an arc of water shoot
210 feet across the Chicago River for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a 450-foot-high geyser in the East River off
Manhattan was seen as ``a majestic addition, matching the Empire
State Building and Radio City,'' according to the
publisher-turned-philanthropist who bankrolled it. And in
Louisville, after the Falls Fountain's popular opening, the tourism
bureau dubbed it the ``symbol of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant glitter and pride, with none of them costing more than
$5 million in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Louisville's fountain stopped running after 12
problem-plagued years, and New York's lasted 17 years until it
stopped working in 1986. Pittsburgh's was off for most of 1996
because of damage from a flood. And another famed fountain built in
water, a 500-foot-high geyser in a Phoenix suburb called Fountain
Hills, was closed this year for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   So just what is Kansas City getting into? That depends on
whether Kansas City repeats other cities' mistakes, or learns from
them.
</P>
<P>
   The major pitfalls, according to a half-dozen officials involved
with other river fountains: using river water and underestimating
maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   River water is full of sediment and bacteria that clog filters,
burn out pumps and eat through pipes and nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's fountain spewed brown, sewage-tinged water until
city health inspectors demanded chlorination equipment; then the
chlorinated water drew fire from environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh avoided those problems by tapping into a freshwater
aquifer some 50 feet below ground. Now Dayton is doing the same
thing for its star-shaped fountain. ``We were concerned we wouldn't
be able to operate with river water,'' Dayton's Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has a similar aquifer under the Big Muddy's flood
plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be plenty of ground water down there,'' said
Robert Smith, a regulatory manager with the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As for maintenance, river fountains require constant care. A
Pittsburgh official calls the daily routine of cleaning screens and
checking equipment a ``headache'' and like ``running a large
swimming pool.'' Then there are river logs that crash into such
fountains. Plus, electricity alone runs about $10,000 a month for
some river fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville's Bingham family originally set aside $500,000 for a
maintenance endowment, but that fountain _ eventually ridiculed as
a ``wet elephant'' _ washed away that money in a few years. And New
York City's fountain philanthropist, George Delacorte, kept paying
thousands of dollars in repair bills until he decided to stop
paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect that anything done would be endowed, and there
would be money set aside for its perpetual maintenance,'' said Bill
Hall, president of the Hall Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, boosters of a river fountain in Kansas City may face
some challenges that didn't turn up in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Corps of Engineers won't allow a fountain in
the middle of the Missouri River, where it might disrupt barge
traffic. For another thing, the Federal Aviation Administration
might limit the height of the fountain because of the nearby
Downtown Airport.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it might stifle Kansas City's stab at ``world's largest
river fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guinness Book of Records, the world's largest
fountain, in or out of a river, is the 600-foot-tall Gateway Geyser
on the bank of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis, Ill. But
the tallest river fountain, at least in this country, is believed
to be Pittsburgh's, at 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Garney, a Northland developer and longtime City of
Fountains Foundation board member, summed up the situation best:
``I think a lot more work needs to be done to exhaust all the
possibilities.''

DON'T BELIEVE THE PARTY LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are unofficial holidays, arriving in New England every
fifth day. These Pedro Days have been part of the local culture for
only three years, but they have already been victimized by holiday
cliche: You have a barbecue, turn your sound system up to the
maximum, watch the fireworks, go home, and wait for the next
opportunity to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Pedro Martinez, the one-man parade, can do to you.
He is so consistent (58-16 since 1998) that a loss is surprising.
He is so good that you can find yourself in some ridiculous sports
arguments with Pedro as the subject. For example, try telling
someone that this season _ 16-5, 1.74 ERA _ is his best and they
just might call you an idiot. Imagine. You're saying a season in
which a pitcher has allowed 38 earned runs is his best and someone
thinks you're nuts for having that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Being around Martinez also will lead you into some expectations
that are not normal for professional sports. It is simply not
normal for one great athlete to go out and dominate others, over
and over. Tiger Woods does it often, but not at every tournament.
Larry Bird didn't always do it. Michael Jordan didn't. Bobby Orr
didn't. Joe Montana didn't. Martina Navratilova didn't. But when
these local holidays come, with their ``K'' cards and chants and
merengue and items color-coordinated with the Dominican flag
(Saturday it was a Dominican-flag car at the corner of Yawkey Way
and Van Ness), the expectation is that things will go as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if normal as we know it is truly abnormal. A 1.74 ERA in
the year 2000? Nearly 230 more strikeouts than walks? A pitcher who
is always expected to win, give the bullpen a rest, and keep a
desperate team afloat?
</P>
<P>
   You don't usually see that in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   If you are 28 years old and perform brilliantly most of the
time, that makes you a very good, young athlete. If you perform
brilliantly all the time, it makes you, basically, Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is good. He's not Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Fenway Park, the Yankees beat Martinez and the Red
Sox, 5-3. Martinez lost when everyone, including some people in the
home clubhouse, expected him to win. Of course, not many players
will say that they expect Martinez to carry them, even though it
would be difficult for them to feel otherwise. They have the
equivalent of all-access passes, traveling across North America
with this pitching artist. We know he's good; they know the insider
details of his greatness, which allows them to put his mastery into
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   How could they not be guilty of leaning on him too much? They
can be forgiven for being Pedro dependents. Dan Duquette, though,
has no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   New York's win pushed its lead in the American League East to
eight games with 23 to play. That means the Sox are a $90 million
team that will need handouts to get where it is trying to go. If
the Sox are going to be a part of the playoffs this season, they
will have to fully embrace the second-place mentality. They will
have to equip themselves with wild-card vision, always looking at
other teams for help while trying to win themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Jimy Williams. The fatalistic, play-the-schedule
philosophy no longer is applicable.
</P>
<P>
   The best the Sox can do without anyone else's help is reduce the
New York lead to six games. They can do that by winning Sunday at
Fenway and Monday at Yankee Stadium. A win Sunday also would help
silence the strong New York presence in the Fenway seats. Yankee
fans have been so loud here that a pleased Joe Torre estimated that
they made up 30 percent of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough to start a fight,'' Torre said, referring to
the frequent tussles that usually end with handcuffs and police
escorts out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Torre seemed relaxed before the game. He acknowledged that
winning three out of four against Boston would allow the Yankees to
pick up the scent of the division title. He said his team would
have to ``die'' with an eight-game lead this late. He mentioned
teams that have lost bulges like that, but behind his sunglasses
you could sense an ``It ain't gonna happen to us'' gaze.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen to the Yankees because they are built
differently than the Sox. Their foundation is such that they never
would find themselves in the situation the Sox were in Saturday:
expected to win simply because one, 170-pound man was starting.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of dependence is not normal.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of dependence is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of dependence, most importantly, is no way to win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   While the regional myth is that the Yankees are better because
they have more money to spend, the reality is that they are better
because they know how to spend the money that they have. If you
gave wads of cash to someone who didn't know anything about
fashion, they still would return from a shopping trip with bags of
bad clothes. Money is cool; you just have to know what you're doing
with it. Ask Peter Angelos and the fans in Baltimore about that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about George Steinbrenner's loot, New
York's best players were either developed in their farm system or
acquired in wow-look-what-came-up-in-the-laundry deals. Roberto
Kelly was traded for Paul O'Neill. Derek Jeter was the No. 6 pick
in the 1992 draft. Scott Brosius, the man who changed Saturday's
game by guessing correctly on a Martinez offspeed pitch, was a
player to be named in the Kenny Rogers deal. Bernie Williams,
Mariano Rivera, and Andy Pettitte _ Saturday's winning pitcher _
were draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Big Three were acquired via the draft (Nomar
Garciaparra), and trades (Carl Everett, Martinez). Duquette
deserves credit for that. But what about the rest of the team? Why
does he have so much money tied in to mediocrity? Is this all $90
million gets you these days? A great pitcher and hope that your
playoff prayers are answered? The money lament is convenient, but
it has nothing to do with the fact that the Sox still play poor
infield defense. That's the reason they lost to the Yankees last
fall, and they still haven't gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez smiled and, before leaving, said the team will still
make the playoffs. ``We beat Cleveland three in a row in the
playoffs, didn't we?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But they didn't have enough to keep winning. They had and
have the kind of team that could bring you a local, Pedro holiday.
The Yankees had the kind of team that could bring you a local,
World Series celebration holiday.

BIG FEET, BIGGER SPLASH FOR AUSTRALIAN  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a country where swimming is the most popular Olympic sport,
where important meets draw prime-time television exposure and
exorbitant ratings, it is a 17-year-old named Ian Thorpe who has
Australia entranced.
</P>
<P>
   His trips to the movies and club-hopping nights on the town make
the gossip pages. Every woman he is photographed with draws the
kind of urgent conjecture that once attended May Day photographs of
the Kremlin hierarchy. When he travels, the hotel rooms on either
side of him are taken by security guards, lest overzealous fans
induce a hard day's night.
</P>
<P>
   The first evening of the Sydney Olympics, all of Australia will
be captivated by this 6-foot-5-inch, 210-pound teen-ager with size
17 feet, who will swim the 400-meter freestyle to win a gold medal,
and perhaps to lower his own world record of 3 minutes 41.33
seconds. The Thorpedo, as he is known, is also favored in the 200
freestyle _ his world record is 1:45.41 _ and he will swim for a
third gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
   So dominant is Thorpe that his teammate, Michael Klim, the 1998
world champion in the 200-meter freestyle, will skip the event in
Sydney. Thorpe is modest, mature beyond his years and quietly
confident. He is also a millionaire who enjoys dabbling in day
trading of stocks. Don Talbot, the 67-year-old Australian Olympic
coach, said he has never seen a more capable swimmer in five
decades of international experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a better swimmer than him,'' Talbot said at
the U.S. Olympic swimming trials. ``He's got a great feel for the
water. He makes it look easy. His maturity, that's what you notice.
He's 17, but he seems like he's someone in his 30s or 40s. It's
almost spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   But with expectation comes enormous pressure. If his reputation
is to remain buoyant, Thorpe must win a gold medal, maybe even more
than one, Talbot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's coping, handling it well, but he's got to feel
pressure,'' Talbot said. ``Nineteen million people want him to win.
He's a young boy with an octogenarian's head. It's amazing. But
he's got to feel the pressure. In Australia, it's always been that
way. You're nothing until you win a gold medal. If you don't win
gold at the Olympics, you're not one of the greats.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a country's hopes resting on your shoulders, especially
with the Olympics in your hometown, can be a weighty burden. Thorpe
trained in the United States for part of this summer, seeking the
benefits of altitude and anonymity at the Olympic Training Center
in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, swimmers are treated like rock stars,'' he said
in a recent telephone interview. ``That's difficult to deal with at
times. It takes away my privacy. I don't have the ability to walk
down the street. I don't have the ability to get away from myself.
That's the hardest thing, dealing with being me. I can't get a
holiday from what I do. But I always look at the support as being
positive. I see it more as opportunity than pressure, as something
that pushes me as opposed to wearing me down.''
</P>
<P>
   He has told friends that he wants to retreat from the public
after the Olympics but so far has refused to live the life of a
reclusive star. After all, he is only 17, and it is every
teen-ager's inalienable right not to be bound by the walls of home.
Getting out is as indispensable as oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to, I could stop swimming and stop being a public
figure,'' Thorpe said. ``I don't want to do that. I'm not willing
to give up what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other Australians, Thorpe learned to swim by
age 6 or 7. As Talbot explained it, 95 percent of the population on
the island continent lives within 10 miles of the coastline. ``We
better learn to swim,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's older sister, Christina, was an elite distance swimmer,
and as Ian followed her to swim meets, he decided to take up the
sport himself. There was one slight problem. He was allergic to
chlorine and swam with his head out of the water. But, having
suffered bronchial pneumonia as a child, he found breathing easier
in the warm humid air of swimming pools, even if he had to battle
through sinus congestion and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's father and grandfather had excelled at cricket, but he
stayed in the pool. His sister qualified for the Atlanta Olympics
but did not meet the time standard to compete in the 400-meter
freestyle. Ian, meanwhile, set 13 state records in 13 short-course
meets as a 12-year-old. By age 14, he turned professional,
encouraged by his mother, Margaret, a teacher, and by his personal
coach, Doug Frost. With a year of high school remaining, he took a
sabbatical the past year to prepare for the Olympics. Eventually,
he plans to study medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was becoming too much, the public and professional side,
and trying to study,'' said Thorpe, who ranked near the top of his
class. ``Education is so important, I didn't want to jeopardize it,
so I decided to defer my studies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1998 world championships, held in Perth, Australia,
Thorpe won the 400-meter freestyle at age 15, becoming the youngest
world champion ever. Earlier this year, he broke three world
records at the Australian Olympic trials. But the use of
performance-enhancing drugs is believed to be so pervasive in
Olympic sports that any remarkable performance in events such as
swimming and track and field brings immediate suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Theismann, a German swim coach, said in February that
some people believed Thorpe was using banned substances.
Chris-Carol Bremer, captain of the German swim team, told a German
newspaper that he believed the size of Thorpe's feet could have
been produced by a drug such as human growth hormone. Both later
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, who has been outspoken against the use of drugs, said
the despairing thing was that the current urine-based testing
procedures were so deficient that innocent athletes can no longer
prove their innocence. He said he would be willing to undergo blood
testing and have the samples stored until tests for human growth
hormone and other banned substances were approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really sad thing that happens in sport, athletes being
accused of something they don't do,'' Thorpe said. ``In a way,
they're complimenting me by saying I'm doing something at such a
level they don't believe I can get to without drugs. But it's
disappointing because a lot of children look up to me, and when
they see the media talk up the accusations, it puts negative
thoughts in children's minds.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's large feet do help him swim faster, but it has nothing
to do with drugs, according to Australian sports authorities. His
feet are so flexible that he can touch his shin with his toes,
Talbot said. The surface area and flexibility of Thorpe's feet help
generate a great force to propel him through the water, high on the
surface, thus reducing drag, said Bruce Mason, a biomechanics
expert at the Australian Institute of Sport. He is also aided by
the bodysuits approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe uses a six-beat kicking cycle, generally used by
sprinters at shorter distances; the turbulence created in the water
``is like being in a washing machine,'' according to the South
African swimmer Ryk Neethling. Daniel Kowalski, who won three
freestyle medals for Australia in Atlanta, said the agitation of
Thorpe's wash is such that he tries to avoid finishing second and
third in any prelims so that he will not be given a lane next to
Thorpe in the finals..
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's stroke is nearly 9 feet long, so attenuated that Thorpe
needs only 16 strokes per 50-meter lap, compared with 20 that his
fellow Australian Kieren Perkins used to win the 1,500-meter swim
in Atlanta. Thorpe also watches videotapes of his performances and
boxes for cross training. But his greatest assets are his maturity
and emotional stability, said Clark Perry, the Australian team's
sports psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age they tend to go up and down a bit, but Ian is very
level,'' Perry said. ``When he is swimming, he is not racing
others, he is racing Ian Thorpe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His face is ubiquitous in Australia, endorsing a phone company,
an airline, a bank, a cereal and an automobile. But Thorpe has also
been acclaimed for his generosity with children's charities and for
his visits to children's hospitals. One of his closest friends is
15-year-old Michael Williams, the brother of his sister's husband,
who received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 1997. Williams
has accompanied Thorpe to several recent meets and will be on hand
for the Olympics. His friend's struggle changed his own life,
Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was diagnosed at a time when I wasn't training as fast as I
had in the past and I was questioning why I was swimming,'' Thorpe
said. ``Here was Michael, with a thousand tubes in him, having a
potentially fatal disease. The last thing he could do was get into
a pool. I was feeling sorry for myself. It made me realize that
life is so precious and you have to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent commercial featuring Thorpe showed him swimming with
seals in the same sleek, effortless manner. But, Thorpe has one
frailty as an athlete, Talbot said, it is his gawkiness out of the
water. Last fall, Thorpe fractured a bone in his foot while jogging
and had to swim for a while in a Fiberglas cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't run,'' Talbot said. ``Swimmers can't run. They should
never run.''

VENUS KNOWS WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, Venus Williams was 17 years old and
a surprise US Open finalist. And Martina Hingis took her apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy,'' Williams said. ``I didn't know what I was doing,
basically.''
</P>
<P>
   She sure knows now.
</P>
<P>
   Knows how to work over an opponent. Knows how to rally from a
slow start. Knows how to finish off a match. Knows how to dig out
shot after shot and, in the process, lock on to momentum. And knows
what it's like to pocket $800,000 in the last major tournament of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams knocked Hingis out Friday in the semifinals and
Saturday completed her Open task, pounding away at Lindsay
Davenport for a 6-4, 7-5 decision at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight title in a major for Williams, who
also beat Davenport in straight sets at Wimbledon this summer.
``Wimbledon was something totally different. I just had a whole new
attitude,'' Williams said. ``It was like I was going there to win
it and I knew I was going to take it home and I did. But this two
weeks I've been a little shaky because I've been working hard but
things haven't always gone the right way. But I played the big
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's Open title was also a family double. Serena Williams,
who lost to Davenport in the semifinals this year, won last year's
US Open. After shaking hands with Davenport last nigh, Williams's
next stop was the family box to celebrate with Serena. Soon, their
coach and father, Richard, joined her on the court and did a little
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena are the first two sisters to win titles in Open
history.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams lost to Hingis in last year's Open semifinals.
``Of course I wasn't happy,'' she said. ``I played horribly. I
still haven't gotten over that loss. Ever since then, I've changed
my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus is on a tremendous run. After starting the season with
tendinitis in her wrists, and her father talking about how,
perhaps, she should retire, she has won 26 straight matches and
five tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Like she did in the semifinals against Hingis, Williams started
slowly. This time, she turned things around without losing a set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in deep trouble in the first set. And just like
that, she rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport won four straight games _ and broke Williams twice _
to race to a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wasn't taking my opportunities very well,''
Williams said. ``I was just missing a bit too much, maybe even
hitting it a little too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Williams _ perhaps fueled by her third foot fault _
reeled off six in a row herself.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was called for a foot fault on what would have been an
ace, and then double-faulted to 30-40. But she served and volleyed
to deuce. Davenport put a backhand into the net and Williams hit a
forehand winner.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Williams was on a roll. She won 19 of 24 points in one
stretch to win the six straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Her ground strokes were hit deeper and harder. Davenport had
problems with her backhand and serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``She runs it down and hits it hard back,'' Davenport said.
``It's hard to put balls away against her.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke Davenport two times and Davenport served again at
4-5. Williams got a point at the net for 15-30. And then Davenport
faltered again on her serve, giving the set away with two straight
double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's run of games took her to a 1-0 lead in the second
set.
</P>
<P>
   And when Davenport went down, 0-15, on her serve, things looked
grim. So all she did was serve three straight aces and a winner to
get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   She broke Williams and Williams broke back and it was 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth game, Davenport had four break points, but this
time Williams escaped them all and held.
</P>
<P>
   That became the story of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was serving at 5-5 and Davenport had her in a 15-40
hole. But then she hit a couple of forehands long. Williams threw
in an ace and Davenport couldn't handle another serve for the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the match, Davenport had 15 break points and converted three
of them. Williams was far more break-efficient. She converted five
of eight chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was breaking well enough,'' Davenport said. ``But I wasn't
serving well enough and holding my serve.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 5-6 and 30-30 and Davenport was serving to get it to a
tiebreaker. Williams got Davenport on the run again and she put a
forehand into the net. Then a backhand long, and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   And the Family Williams _ with Venus winning the title that
eluded her in 1997 _ had another major.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, she knows what she's doing.

SKY KING'S SONGBIRD LIES ROTTING AT AN AIRSTRIP NEAR CLINTON, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
 KING-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Jim Fisher  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   CLINTON, Mo. _ Can most baby boomers,
recalling those long ago Saturdays, ever forget these words coming
from the TV as a twin-engine plane skimmed toward them over the
Arizona desert?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Out of the clear blue of the western sky comes Sky King!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the plane, which everybody knew was Sky's beloved Songbird,
would bank to the left, and the screen would fade to a
breakfast-food commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The show, its episodes shown over and over from the early 1950s
to 1966, combined cutting edge technology (aviation) with a tried
and true drama (the western). It had good vs. evil, Sky King's
rugged good looks, and _ rare for the time _ the portrayal of a
competent young woman, Sky's niece, Penny.
</P>
<P>
   The show's stars were Sky (Kirby Grant), Penny (Gloria Winters),
nephew Clipper (Ron Hagerthy) and, of course, the Songbird, a
Cessna T-50 with huge radial engines and a fuselage that seemed
almost an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Sky is dead, killed in a Florida car crash in 1985, Penny lives
in Southern California, and Clipper's whereabouts are undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   The Songbird?
</P>
<P>
   It's five miles east of Clinton, at an airstrip, in three large
piles of duralumin, decaying wood, and steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just rotted away,'' said Lawrence Ferro, owner-operator of
the Ranch-Aero airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has been here for 40 years, ever since Ferro paid $450
for it. He is the 15th owner of the plane, which was built in 1943
and used after the war almost exclusively on the West Coast, where
it became the Songbird.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least once a month, Ferro said, he reads of people
happily investing six figures in identical airplanes, which have
become part of the World War II nostalgia boom.
</P>
<P>
   Although 5,200 of the odd-looking T-50s _ also known as the
UC-78 _ were built in Wichita, Kan., to train B-17 and B-24 bomber
pilots, only a handful remain. These days they're coveted for their
forgiving flying characteristics and their old-fashioned fabric,
wood and metal construction.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro said the Songbird sort of melted before his eyes _ the
skin covering peeled off, the wooden wing spars developed dry rot,
and the wind one day blew the plane into a nearby pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro, with voluminous records on the ownership and history of
the ship, No. N67832, has always known he probably has the most
valuable T-50 of all, despite its disassembled state. For years it
has been a mishmash of two Jacobs radial engines, a tangle of
tubular steel and a jumble of engine cowlings, seat frames, and
other parts, all piled helter-skelter. Ferro says he has 99.9
percent of the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ferro said, it could be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've have people offer me $25,000 just for the paperwork,''
said Ferro. ``They've pulled out money and waved it in my face just
for the registration number. This plane does something to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual fact is that Ferro bought the plane in 1960 with an
eye toward exhibiting it _ refurbishing it, getting some seed
money, then maybe barnstorming at air shows. That hope went
aglimmering when the fifth owner of the Songbird, Paul Mantz, an
aviation legend as well as the technical adviser to the Sky King
series, was killed in 1965 in the filming of a movie called
``Flight of the Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantz was a friend of mine, and we were going to work
something out,'' said Ferro. ``Then he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantz's death took the steam out of Ferro. He had a business to
run, and he could always use the occasional spare parts for his
crop-spraying operation. Plus, he said, he was far ahead of the
curve. In the 1960s, nostalgia for World War II was still a long
way off.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fans of the old black-and-white series have
tracked Ferro down and visited about the Songbird. There have been
long letters offering suggestions about restoring the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they usually come down to is me giving the plane away,
putting up most of the money, and doing the work,'' said Ferro.
</P>
<P>
   What has struck Ferro over the years is that while his Songbird
was replaced by a newer, sleeker Cessna 310B after the 1955-56
season, most aficionados of the show equate the old T-50 with the
series.
</P>
<P>
   That may be in part because Grant himself was an accomplished
pilot and owned another T-50. A studio mockup of a T-50 was used
for interior shots.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, while Grant gained a sort of immortality with his
portrayal of the flying rancher from Grover, Ariz., he played
mostly villains in his B-western movie career.
</P>
<P>
   Odder still was his first love _ music. An accomplished violist
and vocal soloist, he would be remembered by some in Hollywood as
the man who recorded popular songs with studio orchestras and then
worked with a crooner from Spokane, Wash., named Bing Crosby who
had difficulty reading music.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous of those songs, now a Crosby standard,
was ``Pennies from Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferro's Songbird last flew May 3, 1960. That day he had picked
it up at a Camdenton airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could get it started,'' he said. ``We worked on it a
couple of hours and had it running. We left and came back, and I
looked at the gas caps. They were in a different position than I'd
left them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we drained the gas. It had enough water in it so we would
have had real trouble once we got airborne. Somebody, I don't know
who, wasn't happy with me having that plane.''

ANTIBACTERIAL CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD, SOME
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 PRODUCTS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Alan Bavley  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Using soaps and other
products that promise to kill bacteria seems like a good way to
avoid infection, but is it?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not necessarily, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Triclosan and other antibacterial ingredients contained in a
growing number of consumer products, such as liquid soaps, are
coming under increasing scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association recently reviewed the
scientific evidence and found no data supporting the effectiveness
of these products.
</P>
<P>
   But there is growing evidence, the AMA said, that bacteria are
developing resistance to these antibacterial substances, and that
might predispose the germs to resistance against antibiotics as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific evidence I know of that triclosan in
soap is better than regular soap. Regular old soap and water is the
gold standard,'' said Charles Rock, a biochemist at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Rock is studying the antibacterial properties of triclosan.
There's no doubt, he said, that triclosan would make a good
bacteria-fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
   But putting triclosan in soap would be ``like washing your hair
with penicillin,'' he said. ``To me, it's more of a marketing issue
than reality-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock has found that some bacteria are less susceptible than
others to triclosan. And Rock and researchers at other centers have
managed with relative ease to make strains of common disease
bacteria such as E. coli that are resistant to triclosan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear implication of using triclosan is that it will lose
its effectiveness,'' Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   Soap manufacturers scoff at these concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibacterial personal-care products provide an extra measure
of protection for consumers at home and doctors and nurses in
hospitals,'' said Ed Kavanaugh, president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry
and Fragrance Association.
</P>
<P>
   For example, research published in a dental journal shows a
triclosan-fortified toothpaste, Colgate Total, helps prevent
plaque, tartar and gingivitis.

ELDER WILLIAMS TURNS ON AFTERBURNERS IN FIREFIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She's got wheels. Like chariots of fire. And wings on
her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've got wheels on myself,'' says Venus Ebone Starr
Williams, who takes another US Open trophy back to the House of
Williams in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. She could probably run all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Little Sister Serena got one last year, and now Big Sister Venus
catches up with her very own championship bauble.
</P>
<P>
   Venus sat here in Arthur Ashe Stadium a year ago, bundled in a
hooded sweat shirt and looking a glummer shade of glum as Little
Sister conquered Martina Hingis in the title bout, and pranced
victoriously. Venus, who'd lost to Hingis in the semis, was
supposed to be first _ but now she is again, adding this trinket to
her Wimbledon championship memento.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport, beaten, 6-4, 7-5 (after leading 4-1), is just
another hit-and-run victim to testify that you may dodge one
Williams juggernaut, but the other one is sure to crush you.
Davenport, the 1998 champ, had dethroned Serena in the
quarterfinals, and for a while she was headed that way once more.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon Venus came on as a tidal wave inundating Davenport for
six consecutive games to a 1-0 lead in the second. With 23,219
onlookers gaping at her freewheeling, Venus floored it on the
floodlit green track to roar away to the title.
</P>
<P>
   It was an 85-minute firefight of two women who believe in
fighting fire with fire. Call the hook-and-ladder trucks and get
out of the way. However, Venus raised the temperature unbearably
with her scorching groundies, and turned a blazing engagement into
a major conflagration from which Davenport could find no relief.
Even an asbestos playsuit couldn't have saved her from heatburn _
and heartburn _ while Venus torched her as at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody runs down balls like Venus,'' concedes Davenport.
``Arantxa Sanchez Vicario gets everything back, too, but the
difference is that Venus hits them back harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus decided to play foot-in-the-door defense, standing well
inside the baseline to return serve, and the daring tactic spooked
Davenport. Nobody can look at Davenport's lustiest serves up close
and survive. Nobody but Venus. She caromed the deliveries back at
Davenport almost as soon as balls left her racket _ belting them
forcefully and deep, keeping Davenport on her heels.
</P>
<P>
   This made Davenport go for too much on serve, and miss in her
times of need.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but those whirring wheels of a thief's getaway car. Never
has a woman stolen so many points with her legs. Davenport would
blast to the corners, as she did against Serena, but the ball came
back too many times with length and heat. She made Davenport hit
too many balls, and finally miss on crucial points.
</P>
<P>
   A great defense became an overpowering offense.
</P>
<P>
   A good big woman beat a good little woman in Friday's semis:
Venus over Hingis. Saturday, a good big woman beat a good bigger
woman, and the beat went on _ 26 straight for Venus. Her prevent
defense was at its thorniest when she had her back to the goal
line: break points. Though Davenport had the turn-it-around
opportunities, she cashed only three of 15 breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Venus sagged during the fifth game of the second set,
double-faulting twice, but kept running through a seven-minute
ordeal of five deuces and four break points to stay ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Venus speed across the court to transform the finest
shots into winners of her own must be dismaying to an opponent.
There's a lot of dismay in store for her colleagues as Venus
matures and reinforces her confidence. Although Medusa, the Women's
Tennis Association computer, lists Hingis and Davenport as Nos. 1-2
in the world, Venus, knocking them off in succession, makes the
computer seem hard-driven into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   For all purposes, the 2000 season is over, even though the
Olympics and the Chase Championships remain. Venus, with her two
majors, is the lady of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm moving forward,'' she says. Moving, moving, moving as
no one else has moved.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's dreams couldn't have been pleasant Saturday night.
There is Venus, crowding her, moving in to destroy her serve, and
rolling over her with those relentless, heavy-duty wheels.

SPORTS COLUMN: SUPER SATURDAY TURNS INTO WOMEN'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Super Saturday at the United States Open has always
been a noisy, hectic experience that often leaves me with a giant
tennis hangover, but as a concept, I can't knock it. The other
Grand Slams give the women their own day to play for the big prize,
but they also pay them less than they do the men.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a draw, and don't feel sorry for Venus Williams, whose
wait until dark yesterday was worth her first Open title, her
second straight Grand Slam victory, her 26th consecutive match
victory, and $800,000 worth of pocket money of which the government
will want its share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you lower my taxes?'' Williams asked President Clinton
when he telephoned and apologized for not sticking around after
watching the men.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he'd try, to which Williams volleyed back, ``Should
I read your lips?''
</P>
<P>
   Political and social niceties don't come naturally to this
20-year-old burgeoning star. Her idea of engagement is to blast
away until she gets her way, as she did with Lindsay Davenport
after falling into a 1-4 first-set hole, on the way to winning,
6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   It is no big deal if the Williams sisters don't bond with
Davenport and Hingis. Steffi Graf was no one's best friend, and
nobody will ask how Pete Sampras gets along with Marat Safin, whom
he'll meet Sunday afternoon for the men's title. It wouldn't kill
the Williams family, from Richard on down, to be a little more
gracious to their opponents, but as far as Venus Williams' tennis
goes, just hit her the damn ball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By late in the third set of Sampras' 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5)
victory over the Australian Lleyton Hewitt, that was pretty much
the attitude in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Come on, Pete, get on with it.
On the broadcast feed, one of the network announcers was even
overheard to say: ``I've seen enough of this. Let's bring on the
women.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davenport and Williams hit the court, Patti LaBelle's sonic
version of the national anthem caused a cloudburst and sent the
players back to the locker room to ignore each other some more.
Whom to blame? Not even the Republicans could pin this one on
Clinton, who had watched Sampras advance to his sixth Open final
from a luxury box.
</P>
<P>
   For the women, their patience was rewarded with more exposure, a
Saturday night live slot. They used to shoehorn the gals between
the men's semifinals, but anywhere you put them these days, the
final is the final. It stands on its own and it stands tall,
regardless of whom the men serve up in their semis.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two weeks at the Open, the men played the more
compelling matches and the women still got the majority of the
attention. From the second round on, 50 of the 60 women's matches
were won in straight sets. Seles-Capriati? Straight sets.
Hingis-Seles? Straight sets. Serena Williams-Davenport? Straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of overall tour depth gives the women more of a name-brand
quality to their events. They consistently have the same players,
the star value, running through the draw at the major tournaments,
on any surface. The late-round matchups among the top-ranked
players are more than anticipated. They are counted on. And when
they deliver spectacularly, as Venus Williams and Hingis did Friday
afternoon, their primary rivalries grow. Momentum for the next
event builds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to dispute the opinion of Sampras as the best
player of either sex, even if he hasn't won the French Open and, at
this point, is not likely to. It isn't Sampras' fault that the crop
of challengers in recent years has largely been a collection of
interchangeable parts, from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Going for his 14th Slam victory, he dodged a first-set tiebreak
bullet Saturday, when Hewitt acted 19 with a short ball in the
middle of the court on set point. He went for too much and spanked
it wide. Then Sampras rallied from service break down in the third
set, and set up match point with two demonstrations of his
trademark athletic brilliance: a magnificent low backhand volley
off a blistering Hewitt backhand, and a leaping overhead winner off
a Hewitt lob a few feet short of the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Safin went off to meet the president, who was still
in United Nations Summit mode when he assured the 20-year-old
Russian: ``You have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary hope of the ``New Balls'' generation, Safin may be
ready to move up near the top and stick around a while. He presents
a formidable challenge for Sampras on Sunday, even if they didn't
know him from Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the Open's transportation desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called like three times,'' he said after beating Todd Martin
to reach his first Slam final in the morning semifinal, 6-3, 7-6
(4), 7-6 (1).
</P>
<P>
   ```Please, can I have a car to come to the stadium?'
</P>
<P>
   ```What's your name?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Safin.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Can you spell it please?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a decade ago Saturday that that a 19-year-old Sampras
practically needed a name tag as he introduced himself as the
player for his generation, and beyond. By the time Williams and
Davenport struck their first evening ball, the Safin-Martin match
seemed as dated as Sampras' first Open title.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, long day, but in the end, there was Williams
holding the trophy and her father doing some silly dance on the
court and Serena congratulating Venus from the family box the way
Venus congratulated Serena one year ago. Tennis is a Williams' and
a woman's world right now, and not even the world's powerful man
could argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many Rick Lazio commercials,'' Venus told the lame duck
president on the phone. ``Tell Hillary I said, `All the way.'''

WILLIAMS BEATS DAVENPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A veil of rain slipped past Arthur Ashe Stadium
Saturday night, and as if a curtain had been drawn back, out
stepped Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport in costume and
character.
</P>
<P>
   In an orange sherbet halter dress, Williams wore a sparkling
choker and earrings that shimmered in the towering banks of light.
In a pale pink ensemble, Davenport blended more passively into the
spectacle Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once their United States Open final began to unfold, the
audacity and confidence that now ribbons inside the spirit of
Williams sustained her through the most precarious situations. It
was pure defiance. At the moment Williams willfully overcame a 4-1
deficit in the first set, upon the point that gave her a startling
5-4 lead, she strutted off the court for the changeover, with her
head tilted high.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the attitude. One year ago, a dispirited Williams
was slumped in the players' box and hidden behind a hood as she
witnessed her little sister Serena take the first Grand Slam title
in the family at the United States Open. Saturday night, Venus
Williams was the one who burst into joy on match point, happily
staggered over to the players' box and celebrated her second Grand
Slam victory in a row after her 6-4, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration could not be contained. Once she embraced her
mother, Oracene, after she hugged her sister Serena, Richard
Williams worked his way down from the seats. Unlike any other
parent in memory, he walked back with his daughter onto the court.
Just a few yards from where Davenport was seated on the sideline,
Richard Williams began to shuffle his feet, spin around in circles
and point to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always turn my head,'' Davenport said. ``It's better not to
see how they act.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Richard Williams danced on the roof of a television
booth after Venus Williams tucked away Davenport at Wimbledon. This
time, there seemed to be even more oomph to the Williams family
reaction. The spotlight-needy Richard Williams _ who left his
daughter's semifinal match a day earlier when Venus Williams
appeared on the verge of losing _ appeared to be sending a message
to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, Davenport and Martina Hingis, weary
of the all-Williams, all-the-time hype, formed their own alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, they tried to motivate each other to break
up an all-Williams final. Hingis failed, but Davenport did her part
by eliminating Serena Williams in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lindsay and Martina better come to me for advice,
because they're not winning,'' Richard Williams said after the
match.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy only seemed to steel Venus Williams for the
final. After Davenport began the match by using a familiar strategy
_ crushing the ball into Williams' wingspan _ she gave her opponent
life when her serve came unglued.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth game of the first set, Davenport began with a
double fault. Then she sent in a stream of second serves that
allowed Williams to line up and pummel away, leaving Davenport on
her heels. The same scenario also unfolded in the eighth game of
the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been playing the wrong tennis,'' said Williams, who
began the night by over hitting her ground strokes, and going all
out for winners. ``I had to change it up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the life slowly slipped out of Davenport's
confidence. She was never the same after holding a 1-4 lead. Her
footwork started to slip, her reactions became too slow. All the
while, Williams was able to run off six games in a row before
Davenport could regroup. It was too late, though. Williams had all
the momentum, and soon had the championship trophy in her hands.
Her 26th match victory in a row gave her a second Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it at Wimbledon, and I've done it here,'' Williams said.
``I know I can do these things. It's the finals. I was able to keep
my game under control.''
</P>
<P>
   She had to be patient for this moment, though. Just after the
rhythm and blues star Patti LaBelle nearly overwhelmed the speaker
system with a soulful version of national anthem, the rain began to
fall around 5:25 p.m. About 90 minutes later, now in prime time,
Williams and Davenport were ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   The streamlined Williams arrived at the National Tennis Center
Saturday was a far different version of the 17-year-old neophyte
with the red-white-and-blue beads she wore back in 1997. Back then,
she was a gangly, giggly teenager with an aggressive but unpolished
game. Still, she stunned everyone on her way to becoming an
unseeded finalist at the United States Open. Although she lost to
Hingis, she transformed herself from curiosity to a force on the
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy, '97, I was a yearling,'' Williams said. ``I have no
regrets in `97 because I just _ I didn't know what I was doing,
basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Williams was a competitor. Since July, she has
looked and played the part of a champion. Williams was seeded third
in this tournament, but after taking out the top-seeded Hingis and
then the second-seeded Davenport, it is hard not see her as the
dominant player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a different competitor than what I was in the
past,'' Williams said. ``For me, it didn't matter that I was down,
4-1. I was just competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt like the best player. I think it's all an
attitude, kind of the attitude you take out there toward your
game.''

ON BASEBALL: MARTINEZ CAN'T SAVE THE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez's fingers are not fat enough to fill the
holes in the Fenway Park dike. Not even he can halt the flood that
threatens to sweep the Red Sox out of playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was his marvelous self for six innings Saturday, but
before he slipped in the seventh, his teammates had not been there
for him. They had not provided him with the equilibrium he needed
to steady himself on the ice-covered slope that was a three-run
home run by Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox simply had not been able to fare much better against
Andy Pettitte in the first six innings than the Yankees had against
Martinez. One run was all Pettitte allowed in the eight innings he
pitched. Last-inning runs for both teams made it 5-3, the Yankees'
second straight victory in what will be a four-game confrontation
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   This is the team that a national magazine picked in the spring
to win the World Series? This is the team that other supposedly
knowledgeable observers picked to win the American League East and
the pennant? This is the team that was supposed to beat the
Yankees? Well, roses bloom in the spring and fade in the fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   The only way the Red Sox could beat the Yankees would be as the
wild-card team in the League Championship Series. But even there,
the Red Sox suffered a setback Saturday, falling three games behind
the wildcard leader, the Cleveland Indians, who defeated the
Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox have lagged more than three games
off the wild-card pace before, but that was a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have only three weeks and 23 games left. Eight of those
games are with the Indians, but to make up the three-game deficit
in that series they would have to win six of the eight. ``I'm not
going to tell you we're going to catch up with the Yankees,''
Martinez said, ``but none of the other guys are far away from us.
Name one that's three games ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians,'' he said. ``Who else? Nobody else. Three games?
We play them. We have plenty of games to beat them. We beat them
three in a row in the playoffs, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Does last year count this year? ``No,'' the pitcher said
resignedly, ``we've got to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting over after Saturday's loss could be difficult. The Red
Sox cannot afford to lose when Martinez starts. When Brosius
stepped into the batter's box in the seventh inning, the Yankees
had two runners on and two out. At that moment, Boston opponents
were batting .167 against Martinez; .120 with runners in scoring
position; and .121 with runners in scoring position and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's earned run average for the season was 1.60. He had
allowed fewer than three runs in 19 of his 25 starts, fewer than
three earned runs in 20 of those starts. What chance did Brosius
really have?
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him two good changeups and he swung and missed,''
Martinez said. ``I missed with the fastball, missed with the
cutter. I came back with the cutter in a 2-2 count and I thought I
had a strikeout.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fieldin Culbreth, who joined the American League umpiring
staff last season, called the cut fastball the third ball. Brosius
concurred. ``I thought everything I saw from 0-2 on was away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez begged to differ, though not vociferously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and looked at the video,'' he said, ``and it looked to
me like I had a strikeout, especially that deep in the game, doing
it as consistently as I had the whole game. I hit that corner with
the fastball and the cutter. I thought I should have gotten that
pitch, but the umpire is human. You can't blame him for that. You
have to be able to make another pitch and get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   For that pitch, Martinez selected a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous two changes he swung and missed,'' Martinez
explained. ``I said if I'm going to die with something, I might as
well die with something I made him look bad. He didn't even foul
them off. He swung over it. I was hoping I could get the same
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Changeup was in the back of Brosius' mind for the same reason,
because he had looked so bad on the first two. When he swung at
this changeup, Martinez figured Brosius was waiting for it. ``If
fastball crosses your mind one time,'' Martinez said, ``you swing
ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez didn't blame Culbreth for the loss; far from it. But he
did lament what he perceived as a change in umpiring styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the National League for seven years,'' he said. ``If
you were a veteran like Maddux and Glavine, if you were hitting the
corner, even it if was one, two, three inches out and you're
hitting it in a consistent way and you're old enough to know what
you're doing and the umpire knew you were doing that on a
consistent basis, they would give it to you at certain times.
That's how it used to be. Now you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking of the umpire, he added: ``In tight situations
like that, you have to think that this could mean the whole season
for this team, this one game, this one pitch. So you have to keep
your focus on the game. But I don't blame him. We're all human.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't necessarily see Martinez as human. Joe Torre,
their manager, made it clear after the game that he would be very
happy to see the Red Sox fail to reach the playoffs. Encountering a
weapon like Martinez in a short series, he suggested, could be very
hazardous to a team's health. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S PERFECT CHILD: Living and Dying in the Christian Science
Church &LR;  By Caroline Fraser. (Owl/Holt, $16.) A former Christian
Scientist traces the history of the religion founded by Mary Baker
Eddy, which in its heyday drew many followers with its spiritual
approach to healing. Fraser ``does a splendid job of explaining the
reasons for Christian Science's rise and fall,'' Philip Zaleski
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WELDING WITH CHILDREN &LR;  By Tim Gautreaux. (Picador USA, $12.)
These Cajun-flavored stories are set in a place where rusted car
engines dangle from trees and kids have names like Nu-Nu and
Tammynette. ``The author proves himself an able cartographer as
well as a nimble writer, mapping with affectionate but unflinching
accuracy both the back roads of Louisiana ... and the distance
between parents and children,'' Liam Callanan wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEN PRIDE STILL MATTERED: A Life of Vince Lombardi &LR;  By David
Maraniss. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16.) According to this
biography, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach was a complex
figure who was both a world-class motivator and a small-minded
bully. ``Maraniss has a superb eye for detail'' and he ``shows not
only that winning isn't everything, it's not even what it's cracked
up to be,'' Allen St. John wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND &LR;  By Jane Shapiro. (Back Bay/Little,
Brown, $12.95.) The heroine of this humorous novel is a 40-ish New
York photographer who is driven to distraction by her pathological
_ if well-meaning _ klutz of a husband. ``Shapiro's most subtle
accomplishment ... is her creation of a loony-beyond-belief
marriage that nevertheless bears a resemblance to every marriage,''
Karen Karbo said in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNGRY YEARS: A Narrative History of the Great Depression
in America &LR;  By T.H. Watkins. (Owl/Holt, $16.) This chronicle of the
1930s draws on the experiences of ordinary Americans in both urban
and rural areas. ``Watkins' prose often has the intensity and
warmth of a photo by Dorothea Lange or a novel by John Steinbeck,''
Michael Kazin wrote last year. ``He refreshes old accounts about
the misery and insurgencies of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST DAYS OF LOUISIANA RED &LR;  By Ishmael Reed. (Dalkey
Archive, $11.95.) This 1974 novel, nominally a detective story
featuring a hoodoo sleuth named Papa LaBas, is mainly a
free-wheeling satirical attack on 1960s racial politics and
culture, exemplified by a militant movement known as the Moochers.
``Reed has a shrewd eye, a mean ear, a nasty tongue,'' Robert
Scholes said in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Reed's novels,
 &UR; YELLOW BACK RADIO BROKE-DOWN &LR;  ($11.95), a loopy allegory about a
black cowboy in a surreal Wild West that lampoons organized
religion and white myths about American history. ``Reed's
topsy-turvy vision says something meaningful _ certainly in a
unique way,'' one critic said in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORDS FAIL ME: What Everyone Who Writes Should Know About
Writing &LR;  By Patricia T. O'Conner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $12.) A former
copy editor at The New York Times Book Review offers advice on how
to draft, write, revise, unsnarl and rescue prose. ``The practical
and tough-minded O'Conner uses her playful sense of humor to help
us swallow with a laugh the rules that schoolmarms once forced down
students' throats,'' Diane Cole wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIVER SOUND: Poems &LR;  By W.S. Merwin. (Knopf, $15.) Now in
his 70s, the poet continues to explore the grieving that
accompanies daily life, but his work here is infused with a desire
to settle old debts and bequeath particular moments. ``He's
performing what James Merrill knew was the most important task of
all, taking care of the `need to make some kind of house / Out of
the life lived, out of the love spent,''' Melanie Rehak wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PARROT'S LAMENT: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue,
Intelligence, and Ingenuity &LR;  By Eugene Linden. (Plume, $12.95.)
These accounts of wildlife behavior, drawn from interviews with
zookeepers, researchers and trainers, feature con artists,
scoundrels, jesters and even an orangutan escape artist. ``Linden's
respect and love for all creatures in the animal kingdom is
infectious,'' Sara Ivry wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AARON COPLAND: The Life and Work of an Uncommon Man &LR;  By Howard
Pollack. (University of Illinois, $24.95.) This open-minded,
respectful biography portrays the great composer (1900-90) as an
indefatigable promoter of American music whose national convictions
were central to his art. The result is ``the definitive study of
Aaron Copland's life and work,'' John Rockwell wrote last year.

   Will this week's largest-ever conclave of world leaders at the
United Nations' ``millennium summit'' in New York make a bit of
difference to the billions of victims of poverty, cruelty or war?
The United Nations is determined that it should, says Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, who wrote the report that became the
basis for an ambitious declaration signed by the summiteers on
Sept. 8. If the summiteers actually succeed in making the rich
world a little less selfish in its dealings with the poor world,
all the puff and flummery will have been worthwhile. &QL;

   Suffering from a touch of deja vu? Oil prices have more than
tripled since the end of 1998; political leaders, including Bill
Clinton, are appealing to OPEC countries _ whose oil ministers are
meeting this weekend _ to increase production; France has seen the
return of long queues at gas stations, as truckers protesting fuel
prices block supplies. Such news flogs scary memories of the three
previous big oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in
1990. Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a
prospect today. Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to
ask: ``what might go wrong?'' Will OPEC _ and our insatiable oil
consumption _ soon have us over a barrel? &QL;

   Few cities are as gloomy as Yangon, the rot-blackened capital of
Myanmar, known in better days as Rangoon and Burma respectively.
The one bright light amid the murk is Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader
of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Her nine-day protest,
trapped in a car on the outskirts of Yangon, and her subsequent
detention under house arrest, remind her countrymen, and the wider
world, both of the intransigence of the military junta and of the

   (UNDATED) _ America is the first society in the world that has
tried to organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not
need sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding
chapels, and, of course, 24-hour lap-dancing emporiums. So it was
only a matter of time before someone invented the 24-hour political
campaign _ and it is only right that that someone should be Al
Gore, the protege of the man who invented the ``permanent
campaign.'' If Gore is the Energizer Bunny of this campaign, George

   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Now, however, it is Al Gore who is surging ahead in
the polls, with an average lead of three percentage points in most
and ten points in one. Suddenly, it is Gore who is forcefully
setting the agenda, while Bush stumbles on the hustings, getting
his billions and trillions muddled (twice) and blurting vulgar
things into open microphones. The phoney campaign is over, folks.
Election 2000 now promises to be the closest race in decades. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the Mecca of Democratic Texas _ a place (pre-Gov.
George W. Bush) where an elected Republican was a contradiction in
terms. It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the powerful speaker
of the House, who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress;
Johnson, his protege, could always count on it. Yet in many ways,
Texas Democrats can longer say, ``we'll always have Paris.'' As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold, and watch grimly as Texas increasingly becomes a
one-party state for the Republicans. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic disaster, and scarred by political
violence and guerrilla rebellion. On Dec. 1, he will hand over to
Vicente Fox a country that differs for the better. Whatever
Zedillo's shortcomings, Mexicans will have grounds for satisfaction
if their new president turns out to be as successful as his
predecessor. &QL;

   BEIJING _ Garrison Keillor was not quite right when he said that
only Americans pulled down old houses because they were too
difficult to clean. In the past few years, Beijing's municipal
authorities have been systematically tearing down centuries-old
neighborhoods of narrow alleyways to make way for souless six-lane
avenues and commercial buildings. Beijing, desperate to win the
contest to hold the 2008 Olympic Games, boasts about the
``greening'' and ``modernizing'' of the capital. In reality,
China's quest for modernity destroys much of the old in favor of
the ugly. &QL;

were on a feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted
to Ford Explorers, Ford's pugnacious chief executive, Jac Nasser,
appeared in prime-time TV ads professing the company's commitment
to customers and their safety, and promising to do everything to
replace suspect tires as quickly as possible. Days later, a
defensive Nasser tried to duck his way out of appearing before a
congressional subcommittee investigating the recall. Was it
cowardice or arrogance? Whichever, unless somebody at Ford soon
gets this consumer-safety issue under control, it will not just be
Firestone tires that are shredded _ it may well be Jac Nasser's
mercurial career as well. &QL;

   Will this week's largest-ever conclave of world leaders at the
United Nations' ``millennium summit'' in New York make a bit of
difference to the billions of victims of poverty, cruelty or war?
The United Nations is determined that it should, says Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, who wrote the report that became the
basis for an ambitious declaration signed by the summiteers on
Sept. 8. If the summiteers actually succeed in making the rich
world a little less selfish in its dealings with the poor world,
all the puff and flummery will have been worthwhile. &QL;

   Suffering from a touch of deja vu? Oil prices have more than
tripled since the end of 1998; political leaders, including Bill
Clinton, are appealing to OPEC countries _ whose oil ministers are
meeting this weekend _ to increase production; France has seen the
return of long queues at gas stations, as truckers protesting fuel
prices block supplies. Such news flogs scary memories of the three
previous big oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in
1990. Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a
prospect today. Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to
ask: ``what might go wrong?'' Will OPEC _ and our insatiable oil
consumption _ soon have us over a barrel? &QL;

   Few cities are as gloomy as Yangon, the rot-blackened capital of
Myanmar, known in better days as Rangoon and Burma respectively.
The one bright light amid the murk is Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader
of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Her nine-day protest,
trapped in a car on the outskirts of Yangon, and her subsequent
detention under house arrest, remind her countrymen, and the wider
world, both of the intransigence of the military junta and of the
fact that an alternative still exists, despite years of
oppression. &QL;
