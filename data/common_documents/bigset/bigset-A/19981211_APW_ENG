	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has drawn up an austerity
budget for 1999 but the bid to repair Russia's decrepit economy
requires massive debt restructuring that foreign creditors have so
far been unwilling to grant.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said.
	   The draft budget that was approved by the government Thursday
calls for dlrs 7.2 billion in new foreign loans, and provides for
repaying only dlrs 9.5 billion in foreign debt next year, Zadornov
said.
	   That means Russia, in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, will seek restructuring
of dlrs 8 billion of the dlrs 17.5 billion it is due to pay in
1999.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who holed up in a country residence this
week after more than two weeks in a hospital for treatment of
pneumonia.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris Club of
creditor nations.
	   But so far the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The government will submit the draft budget on Friday to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Zadornov said. Primakov,
who enjoys broad support in the Duma, is counting on quick
approval.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that it is very austere,'' Primakov
told his cabinet as leaders hashed out the draft. ``The essential
thing is that it is honest. We didn't include spending that can't
be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov said expected revenues would cover all of Russia's
domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia needs to
restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet Union.
The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what Russia
owes next year.
	   But creditors have been unwilling to rework the debts Russia
already has, and the prospects for more foreign loans are equally
hazy.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt
default and ruble devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign credits that had yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that if it does not get foreign
aid, it would simply print money _ which would send inflation
soaring.
	   The government already intends to print about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) worth of rubles next year, according to the
draft budget, to cover part the 101 billion ruble (dlrs 5 billion)
deficit.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues worth 475 billion rubles
(dlrs 24 billion), by Thursday's exchange rate for the ruble, and
spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion), officials said.
	   Many economists predict the deficit will be even larger because
the government's estimates of an average ruble rate of 21.5 to the
dollar and 30 percent next year may be unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.

Reports: Thai villagers end protest against power plants

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai villagers ended their protest
against the construction of three power plants after government
officials promised they would not be built, local papers reported
Friday.
	   The dispute over the coal-fired plants that villagers say would
pollute the environment sparked rioting between thousands of police
and demonstrators over two days in which at least 65 people were
injured.
	   Thailand's Interior Minister denied reports that three
protesters had been killed, according to Friday's The Nation
newspaper.
	   The villagers from Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (145
miles) southwest of Bangkok, said the plants, at least one of which
would use lignite, or brown coal, would destroy their environment
and health.
	   They cited a similar plant in the Thai city of Mae Moh, where
villagers charge that abnormally high rates of cancer, lung
disease, birth defects and the poisoning of land and water are
attributable to residue from the lignite plant.
	   The Nation said that Deputy Interior Minister Pinit Charusombat
late Thursday signed an agreement with the protesters promising he
would not approve licenses for the three plants.
	   Thailand is privatizing its power industry, and the three plants
are joint ventures with foreign companies. It remained unclear how
much further efforts at privatizing the industry would be harmed if
the projects end up being canceled.
	   Japan's Tomen Corp., and Finland's Imatran Voima Oy, which are
involved in two of the consortia awarded contracts to build the
plants, said on Friday they would proceed with construction despite
the protests.
	   They pointed out that they took part in an international bidding
process overseen by the Thai government, and expected the
government to follow through on its commitments.
	   The reported agreement convinced the protesters to end their
blockade of the Phet Kasem highway, the main road linking Bangkok
with the south.
	   Earlier Thursday, the protest had again turned violent when
villagers assaulted Wassapol Jaisin, the Prachuab Khiri Khan police
chief, causing him serious head injuries.
	   At least 50 protesters and 15 policemen were injured in rioting
Wednesday night when officers staged a baton charge and drove
trucks into the protesters to try and dislodge them from the Phet
Kasem highway.
	   Wednesday's battle was just one of several that have broken out
in recent years between police and members of communities opposed
to dams, power plants or other development projects in their areas.
	   More than 15,000 farmers and villagers descended on Bangkok last
year to protest that many development projects were destroying
their land and way of life while only enriching the country's elite
and wealthy businessmen.

Kazakstan wins five more canoeing golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan kayak racer Tatyana Sergina
charged from behind for a 0.13-second victory over Japan's Sayuri
Maruyama, helping her nation capture five more canoeing golds at
the Asian Games Friday.
	   The Kazakstan canoe team finished with eight golds from 12
events, to three for China and one for Uzbekistan. China won the
two- and four-woman kayak races Friday.
	   In the women's single kayaks, Sergina was half a second behind
at the halfway point, but edged ahead at the finish, covering the
500 meters in 2 minutes, 3.67 seconds. Maruyama won the silver in
2:03.80, with China's Zhou Yingjie third in 2:07.64.
	   In another close race, Kazakstan's Dmitriy Torlopov and Dmitriy
Kaltenberger took an early lead and held off China's Fang Lei and
Wang Cuizhong by 0.21 seconds in two-man kayaks. The Kazak pair
finished in 1:39.01 to 1:39.22 for the Chinese. Uzbekistan's
Vladimir Kazantsev and Andrey Shilin took bronze in 1:41.16.
	   Kaisar Nurmaganbetov scored the most lopsided victory in
Friday's races, all over 500 meters.
	   He won by nearly 11 seconds, beating Uzbekistan's Dmitriy
Kovalenko 2:03.51 to 21:14.41 in one-man canoes, with South Korea's
Lee Seung-woo third in 2:15.64.
	   Teammate Yevgeniy Yegorov won the one-man kayak race, finishing
in 1:49.52 to 1:54.15 for Uzbekistan's Anton Ryahov and 1:55.51 for
Japan's Kenta Tsutsui.
	   Konstantin Negodyayev and Sergey Sergeyev, the gold medalists at
1,000 meters, also won in two-man canoes at 500 meters. Their
1:53.16 beat the 1:57.15 of South Korea's Jun Kwang-rak and Park
Chang-kyu, and the 2:06.19 of China's Meng Guanliang and Sun
Maosheng.
	   For China, Gao Beibei and Zhong Hongyan beat the Kazak pair of
Natalya Sergeyeva and singles winner Sergina by 1:54.64 to 1:57.28.
Uzbekistan's Tatyana Levina and Oksana Shpiganevich took bronze in
1;59.42.
	   In the four-woman kayaks, China's 1:39.20 beat the 1:40.81 of
Uzbekistan and the 1:44.23 of North Korea.

Report: Singapore database to collect samples of Chinese dialects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The National University of Singapore will set
up databases to collect samples of more than 1,000 Chinese dialects
and make them available to researchers throughout the world, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Academicians and computer specialists from Singapore, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and China formed a consortium to establish the research
center during this week's International Symposium on Chinese Spoken
Language Processing, The Straits Times reported.
	   Samples of spoken Chinese dialects are to be collected during
the next three months, collated by the university's School of
Computing and stored on a web site, said associate professor Lua
Kim Teng.
	   Lua said the spoken language samples can be used for research
into voice recognition and translation from one dialect to another.

U.N. praises human rights vision, but shamed by continued abuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations marked the 50th
anniversary of the world's most comprehensive human rights
declaration by praising its vision but somberly recognizing that
hundreds of millions of people worldwide still face political
oppression and haunting poverty.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan and officials from around the world
took part in a daylong General Assembly session Thursday to mark
the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
adopted Dec. 10, 1948.
	   Annan used the occasion to call on the world to renew its
promise to combat oppression.
	   ``Today we honor the highest of human aspirations and renew our
promise to conquer the worst of human cruelty,'' Annan said. ``We
pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of these human
rights, and to the memory of those who died for them.''
	   Speakers at the special session noted that hundreds of millions
of people worldwide remain deprived of the most basic political,
social and economic rights, despite ratification of 60 treaties
inspired by the declaration.
	   Among the human rights violations cited: the lack of health care
and education for women and girls in Afghanistan; mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia; murders and disappearances of
thousands of people under former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinchet.
	   Chile's deputy U.N. ambassador, Juan Larrain, didn't refer to
Pinochet's 1973 coup in his speech, but said his country had
learned firsthand how fragile human rights are when Chile's
democratic history was interrupted.
	   ``It was in these difficult circumstances of our life as a
nation that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights took on even
more meaning for the Chilean people, serving as a permanent guide
for those who believed that the dignity and respect for human
beings couldn't be trampled in any way, under any pretext,'' he
said.
	   China and Algeria defended their human rights records, often
criticized by the United Nations and activists, and pledged to
adhere to the declaration.
	   ``(China) respects and protects civil rights and political
rights and opposes the activities that violate the legitimate
rights of its people,'' said China's U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun
said.
	   The United States announced new measures Thursday to combat
human rights abuses abroad. Washington has signed and ratified a
key covenant regarding civil and political rights but has been
criticized by human rights groups for failing to ratify the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as
well as treaties to benefit women and children.
	   Mary Robinson, the top human rights official at the United
Nations, said ``it is shameful'' that 20 percent of the world's
population consumes 80 percent of its resources while over 1
billion people live without proper food, shelter, water or
education.
	   Clare Short, Britain's Secretary for International Development,
echoed that outrage, saying the declaration didn't just mean
``freedom from fear but freedom from want.''
	   The special assembly session, with representatives from 126
nations signed up to speak, began with Annan awarding Human Rights
Prizes to those in the front lines of the struggle against
injustice.
	   This year's winners are former President Jimmy Carter; Sunila
Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka; Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda; Jose
Gregori of Brazil; and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic.
	   A sixth prize honored ``all human rights defenders all over the
world.''
	   Celebrities Michael Douglas, Wynton Marsalis, Mia Farrow,
Luciano Pavarotti and Vanessa Redgrave were taking part in the
commemorations.
	   Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi delivered an address to
delegates via a videotape smuggled out of military-controlled
Myanmar, saying ``the struggle for democracy has become synonymous
with the struggle for human rights.''
	   The General Assembly adopted a nonbinding resolution reaffirming
``the faith of the United Nations in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of
men and women and of nations large and small.''
	   Despite such symbolic efforts _ and more concrete ones,
including the creation of international tribunals to prosecute war
crimes suspects _ Robinson said the world's record in responding to
and preventing gross human rights abuses ``does not give ground for
encouragement.''
	   In Paris, where the declaration was signed 50 years ago, Anna
Eleanor Roosevelt recalled the intention of the declaration's
original supporters, including her grandmother, former American
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
	   ``Human rights begins in the small places, close to home,'' she
said, quoting her grandmother. ``If we remember to respect our
neighbor, our coworker, our children ... we will understand how to
give strength to peoples who live far away, who perhaps we will
never know.''

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will
make a state visit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum summit next September, Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley announced Friday.
	   The state visit will be the first by a U.S. president since
President Lyndon Johnson's in the 1960s.
	   ``New Zealanders can be confident that APEC 99 will be well
attended by world leaders, with confirmation from United States
President Bill Clinton this week that he will be here,'' Shipley
said.
	   Clinton missed the recent APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
sending Vice President Al Gore instead.
	   Clinton confirmed he would make the state visit to Wellington
following the APEC summit in Auckland.
	   ``It will strengthen relations between New Zealand and the
United States, will lift our international profile and is good news
for the success of our year as chair of APEC,'' Shipley said.
	   Shipley also announced that she would visit Canada and the
United States from Jan. 13-15.
	   Shipley said that while in Washington she would call on senior
members of the Clinton administration and Congressional leaders.

War in Congo continues ahead of uncertain peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALEMIE, Congo (AP) _ Jet fighters drop bombs on a quiet fishing
village and rebels claim new victories over government-allied
troops. In eastern Congo, planned peace talks have so far done
little to slow the fighting.
	   The war-weary Congolese in Kalemie, a port town on the eastern
shore of Lake Tanganyika, braced Friday for more government air
strikes. There was little sign that either President Laurent
Kabila, or the rebels fighting to oust him, were serious about a
proposed cease-fire and U.N.-sponsored peace talks scheduled next
week in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   ``Kabila knows he cannot win. So he is using war planes to
terrorize the population,'' said Waya Shindano, a rebel spokesman
in Kalemie. ``What he is doing is turning the population against
him. He is helping us win the war.''
	   Earlier this week, war planes from Kabila's main ally Zimbabwe
killed at least 12 people and injured 15 others in an attack on
Kalemie, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital Kinshasa.
	   Residents pulled children from schools after one of the bombs
landed nearby, while others avoided the usually bustling market in
fear of more attacks. But some, made complacent by the second
rebellion in as many years, went about their lives, fishing in the
morning and selling the catch in the afternoon.
	   Efforts to broker peace have so far failed because Kabila
refuses to negotiate directly with the rebel coalition made up of
ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians. The rebels are backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda
and Kabila has insisted on negotiating only with the leaders of
those two countries.
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of persecuting ethnic Tutsis and
enlisting forces opposed to the Rwandan and Ugandan governments.
	   Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, speaking from his
headquarters in Goma, said there will be no cease-fire until he is
included in peace talks. By Friday, the rebels still had not
received an official invitation to participate in the Lusaka talks,
he said.
	   Meanwhile, Zimbabwean jets attacked Kalemie for the fourth time
Tuesday, missing a hilltop radio station overlooking the port and
hitting the neighborhood surrounding it, destroying already
crumbling houses along palm tree-lined streets.
	   ``I was in the house when the bombs fell. My grandmother died on
the spot and I was hit by shrapnel,'' said 14-year-old Namwezi
Nawadera, whose left leg was amputated below her knee.
	   Shidano said the population, most of whom are from Kabila's
Baluba tribe, were initially hostile to the rebels whom they
largely viewed as foreign invaders. He said they had since grown
disillusioned with Kabila's government.
	   A rebel commander said his forces had crossed the Congo River at
Kabalo on Sunday, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Kalemie, and
were advancing on mineral-rich Katanga province. He said they had
destroyed one armored personnel carrier and seized two others
belonging to government-allied Namibian forces.
	   Apart from Zimbabwe and Namibia, Angola and Chad have also
supplied troops and arms to support the government
counteroffensive.

Report: Suharto's son becomes a suspect in corruption allegation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Prosecutors have formally named the
youngest son of former President Suharto as a suspect in a
corruption case involving a shady land deal, a news report said
Friday.
	   The newspaper Kompas reported that Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala
Putra, Suharto's youngest son, and Beddu Amang, a former chief of a
state-run food distribution organization, known as Bulog, had been
named as suspects. Both have been banned from leaving Indonesia.
	   Officials at the attorney general's office say they are
investigating a land deal between Bulog and a company that had been
owned by Tommy, in which the Indonesian government allegedly lost
millions of dollars.
	   Under Indonesian law, people are named as suspects after
preliminary questioning but before formal charges are filed in a
criminal case.
	   The development comes two days after prosecutors questioned the
ex-president in a separate investigation over allegations that
Suharto had corruptly amassed a fortune during 32 years in power.
	   Suharto, who stepped down in May after a wave of protests and
riots, has denied any wrongdoing.
	   But opponents allege that he abused his power to build massive
business empires for his six wealthy children.
	   Student protesters, who helped oust Suharto six months ago, have
staged big, sometimes violent demonstrations recently to press
demands that he be sent to trial immediately.
	   Two other Suharto sons, Bambang and Sigit, also have been
questioned over a series of recent bank collapses.
	   Bambang has also been prohibited from traveling overseas.
	   Tommy, 36, has also been implicated in corruption allegations
swirling around his 77-year-old father.
	   Prosecutors have questioned the old leader about Indonesia's now
defunct national car project under which Tommy imported South
Korean-made cars with the help of huge tax and import duty breaks.

Asian stocks plunge following Wall Street's fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after markets close &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stocks plunged Friday on the back of Wall
Street's overnight drop, but the U.S. dollar was little changed
against the Japanese yen.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
244.48 points, or 1.65 percent, to end the morning session at
14,563.32.
	   The dollar bought 117.06 yen, unchanged from late Thursday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 117.33 yen.
	   Tokyo investors were unimpressed with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's proposal on Thursday for income tax relief which
includes ``little actual cut'' in the tax burden on most
middle-class families, said Masaaki Higashida of Nomura Securities
Co.
	   Other markets were tumbling in reaction to Thursday's session in
New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 167.61
points, or 1.86 percent, to 8,841.58.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 333.33 points,
or 3.2 percent, to close the morning session at 9,982.11.
	   The overall ``bearish sentiment across Asia'' was weighing down
Hong Kong prices, said Patrick Yiu of Kingsway SW Securities Ltd.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index was down 14.87
points to end morning trading at 1,425.01 _ a 1 percent drop from
Thursday's close of 1,439.88.
	   The Singapore market had rallied this week on local prime
lending rates cuts.
	   In Taiwan, shares finished sharply lower for a fourth straight
session.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange was down
108.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 6,939.74.
	   ``Obviously the downward trend has built up,'' said C.J. Liu of
National Capital Management Corp.

Hundreds of workers protest government's economic policies

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hundreds of angry workers marched
through a New Delhi industrial area Friday and others observed a
general strike to protest the government's plan to further open the
Indian economy to foreign investment.
	   The marchers belonged to leftist unions who, along with leftist
political parties, called a one-day nationwide strike Friday.
	   Though the strike appeared only partially observed early Friday
in the capital, where most government offices were open and traffic
relatively normal, local news agencies reported most shops, banks,
offices and the commuter railroad were shut down in the eastern
city of Calcutta. The state-owned airline canceled service for the
day in and out of Calcutta, the state capital of West Bengal, which
is controlled by Communists.
	   The strike was sparked by a bill opening up the Indian insurance
sector. The bill is expected to be presented to parliament for
debate next week and is expected to pass. Both the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party and the main opposition Congress party support the
bill allowing up to 40 percent foreign investment in Indian
insurance companies.
	   Leftists, whose influence has waned in recent years, argue
working people will be hurt because foreigners will destroy
indigenous businesses, while reformers say the Indian economy will
be strengthened by new ideas and entrepreneurs.

`Papa Bear' Nicklaus gives fatherly support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ At the opening ceremony, U.S. team
captain Jack Nicklaus almost shed a tear when he introduced his
team, who he said later he considers to be like family.
	   The Golden Bear paused in his opening remarks before a crowd
which included former U.S. President George Bush at the ceremony
Thursday and said the Presidents Cup was a very emotional time for
him.
	   On Friday, when David Duval and Mark O'Meara were two-down in
the first day's foursomes match and New Zealanders Frank Nobilo and
Greg Turner, Nicklaus walked with Duval down the 14th hole to give
them support.
	   ``They were two down, I thought it would be a good idea,''
Nicklaus said.
	   ``I'm the captain and these are my children in so many ways.
	   ``I would do the same thing to support one of my sons; I would
support one of team members in the same fashion.
	   ``I wouldn't tell them anything, just basically say, you know,
I'm there for you.''
	   Duval and O'Meara won the hole, but lost the match.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RYDER IT'S NOT: There might be two competing teams at the
Presidents Cup,
	   but it looked nothing like that during Friday's opening round.
Opponents Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh walked up the second fairway
together, chatting amicably, as did Woods' teammate Fred Couples
and Ernie Els.
	   About 20 meters behind them, and without any idea which players
were talking to whom, Woods' California girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda,
talked with Ardena Singh, Vijay's wife. Just behind them, Couples'
wife, Thais, chatted about Christmas presents with Leizl Weymeyer,
Els' South African girlfriend.
	   When Couples hit his tee shot on the par-3 third to within 12
feet of the
	   hole, Thais Couples turned to the other three and said ``That's
my man!''
	   U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus also got into the spirit. On the
sixth, Singh hit a superb sand shot _ blasting out of one bunker,
over another and to 8 feet from the pin, enabling the International
pair to halve the hole. ``Good bunker shot, Vijay,'' Nicklaus
yelled from across the green.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TWO YEARS ON &LR; : When the last Presidents Cup was held in 1996 at
Gainesville, Virginia, 1991 British Open champion Ian Baker-Finch
was the assistant captain. This year, after having virtually
retired from competitive
	   golf, he's among the spectators. On Friday, he followed
Australian Stuart Appleby and Zimbabwean Nick Price during their
halved match with Americans Davis Love III and Justin Leonard.
Baker-Finch, who was mired in a horrible slump before deciding to
put away his clubs, spent much of his time talking to the players
and caddies and signing a few autographs. A few comments from the
gallery about a possible return to the pro tour were met only by
smiles.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SPECIAL AUTOGRAPHS: Autograph hunting is usually out of bounds
while play is under way, but Greg Norman fetched his own pen from
his golf bag and made for the ropes when he saw two physically
disabled spectators on the 10th hole Friday.
	   Norman walked ahead and while waiting for foursomes partner and
fellow Australian Steve Elkington to tee off, signed International
team flags and baseball caps for the two, who sat in wheelchairs in
the shade of some shrubbery.
	   The two didn't speak, but broad smiles and a thumbs up were
Norman's thanks.
	   ``You got it, mate,'' Norman said.
	   The distraction didn't appear to affect Norman's game. The
Australian pair birdied the par-5, 443-meter (483 yards) hole to
halve with Americans Jim Furyk and John Huston, who lost the match
2-down.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUG PROBLEM: Flies and other bugs reveling in the hot conditions
at Royal
	   Melbourne are making their presence felt on the course.
	   Players and onlookers previously unfamiliar with the ``the great
Aussie salute'' _ a loosely-defined gesture which involves touching
a finger to one temple then waving the hand across the face in a
motion designed to keep away
	   buzzing flies _ are getting the hang of it fast.
	   Play even stopped once Friday when a bug landed on Australian
Stuart Appleby's ball during his foursome match. No amount of
staring, or even gentle blowing on the ball, could move the pest,
which left in its own good time. (rs/djp)

Heavy fighting north of the city shatters Kabul calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Residents in this beleaguered city
awoke Friday to the thud of artillery fire and the steady staccato
of heavy machine guns as the Taliban religious army and its
opponents waged a fierce battle barely 20 kilometers (12 miles)
north of Kabul.
	   Mohammad Jan, a Taliban commander at the front line, told The
Associated Press that the opposition began a heavy artillery
assault Thursday, but at daybreak on Friday the attack intensified.
	   For three hours the guns on both sides roared.
	   When it stopped neither side in the protracted conflict had won
any ground and there were no immediate reports of casualties among
the soldiers on either side, said Jan.
	   But in the villages there were wounded.
	   Residents fleeing Chakardara _ a front line village ruled by the
Taliban _ said that rockets and mortars slammed into their homes
from opposition positions barely five kilometers (three miles)
away.
	   Abdul Ghafoor, a young man who arrived in Kabul on Friday from
Chakardara said he saw three children wounded when a rocket landed
in a nearby field.
	   ``They were collecting wood for the winter when the rocket
landed,'' he said. Two of the children were badly injured.
	   The Taliban, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan including the
capital Kabul, is locked in a fierce battle with their opponents,
led by former military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   The fighting is centered north of the city and in the northern
provinces, particularly Takhar and Kunduz provinces.
	   Last week the opposition held a meeting in Massood's stronghold
in the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, to coordinate their attacks
on the Taliban.
	   ``We have a unified command now,'' said an opposition spokesman
known only as Abdullah. ``Before the commanders were acting on
their own and there was no coordination.''
	   The opposition is hoping that the new command will allow them to
put increasing pressure on the Taliban army. In recent weeks the
opposition has made some gains, but there has been no significant
change in the area controlled by the two sides.

Is Puerto Rico too poor, too foreign to be a U.S. state?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic, AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The arguments against making Puerto
Rico a U.S. state have been around for a century, and statehood
advocates say they are even older than that, having been applied
against aspirants from Alaska to New Mexico.
	   Some say Puerto Rico is too poor. Others say it is too remote.
But the key argument _ one that moves hearts and minds on the
mainland and island both _ is that it is simply too foreign.
	   Anibal Acevedo Vila, one of the leading anti-statehood
politicians on the island, this week blasted Gov. Pedro Rossello's
campaign as ``an agenda of assimilation and imposition.''
	   In a typical commentary in The San Juan Star, anti-statehood
mainlander Gerda Bikales said making Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico
the 51st state would be ``a nightmare of our own making.''
	   ``I can assure the people of the island that mainstream America
will not accept into its fold a new political entity with all the
characteristics of a foreign nation,'' wrote Bikales, a founder of
the English Language Advocates lobby.
	   She said it was a ``serious deception'' to believe Puerto Rico's
beloved Latino culture would not be eroded by mainland influence
under statehood. And it could forget about its Olympic team and
Miss Universe entry, for ``it is the United States and not one of
its component parts that competes on the world stage.''
	   An even more virulent attack came in The Boston Herald this
week, in which columnist Don Feder asked: ``Don't Americans have
... the right not to be saddled with an impoverished, crime-ridden
island of non-English speakers as our 51st state?''
	   ``We need more non-English speakers in this country like we need
more welfare recipients, higher crime rates and an alien culture _
all of which we'll get with Puerto Rican statehood.''
	   Such reservations on both sides have blocked the ascension of
statehood aspirations even since the United States invaded and
occupied the island in 1898.
	   From the very beginning some Puerto Ricans agitated for
statehood, but more saw the cultural barrier as simply too much.
	   Statehood was defeated so far in two referendums. The existing
``commonwealth'' arrangement, people reasoned, was ``the best of
both words:'' a little American, and a little independent as well.
	   Under commonwealth, now in its 46th year, Puerto Rico is a U.S.
territory, and its 3.8 million people are U.S. citizens eligible
for military draft. But they don't pay federal taxes and they can't
vote for president or Congress unless they live on the mainland.
	   Statehooders see this as a distortion of democracy. Buoyed by
last-minute polls, they hope Sunday's referendum will mark a
historic turnaround.
	   The arguments against statehood, said Puerto Rico's economic
development secretary, Carlos Vivoni, are old hat. With relish, he
rattled the names of territories that became states over some of
the very same objections being raised against Puerto Rico:
	   _ New Mexico became a state in 1912 despite its majority
Hispanic population.
	   _ Florida was accepted into the union in 1845 despite concerns
that its widespread poverty and small population and resources
might prevent it from fulfilling financial obligations.
	   _ North and South Dakota joined in 1889 after overcoming
complaints that they would be a financial burden.
	   _Tennessee became the 16th state in 1796 despite widespread fear
that the federal income tax structure would ruin its economy.
	   _ Alaska's statehood movement had to overcome substantial local
opposition, up to 40 percent, before joining the union in 1959.
	   Vivoni said more than a dozen states joined on the strength of
the same argument used by island statehooders: that their position
as ``disenfranchised citizens'' was unacceptable.

Japan warns North Korea over missile, nuclear policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan warned Friday that North Korea will lose
support for a multinational nuclear power project unless it clears
up fears about a suspected weapons program.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said it would be difficult for
the government to gain support among Japanese citizens for the
Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO, project
to help North Korea build nuclear reactors.
	   ``When we think about the suspected underground facility, we
have to link it with KEDO,'' Komura told reporters.
	   ``KEDO is aimed at preventing nuclear development, and it
becomes meaningless'' if the North is really building a nuclear
facility, he said.
	   Washington has alleged that North Korea is building an
underground facility to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a
bilateral 1994 agreement.
	   Under its terms, North Korea agreed to abandon its suspected
nuclear weapons program. In return, it is to receive two safe
nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion plus substitute fuel oil
and other economic benefits.
	   Besides Japan, the United States and South Korea are part of the
KEDO project.
	   North Korea has refused a U.S. demand that it unconditionally
allow inspectors into a suspected underground nuclear site at
Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main
nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   It has agreed to open up the facility in exchange for dlrs 300
million in compensation for America's ``false'' accusation that
North Korea is building a nuclear facility. Washington has turned
down that offer.
	   On Thursday, Komura and other senior Japanese officials met with
former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry to discuss Pyongyang's
refusal to allow the inspection. Perry, who also visited Seoul and
Beijing, left Japan later Thursday.
	   Tokyo has been particularly concerned about a military buildup
in North Korea after Pyongyang fired a missile in late August that
flew over northern Japan. U.S. officials believe the launch was a
test of a Taepo Dong ballistic missile.

China looking to knock out Iran in Asian grudge match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Unbeaten in the Asian Games, an
increasingly confident China may need only a draw Saturday against
Iran to knock its powerful Asian soccer rival out of the games and
avenge elimination before the finals of this year's World Cup.
	   A swarming Chinese offense led by a pair of goals from Li Jinyu
demolished Oman 6-1 in Thursday's second-round Group 3 matches.
Bayern Munich star Ali Daei scored twice in Iran's defeat of
doormat Tajikistan 5-0.
	   That sets up an archetypal Asian group showdown Saturday pitting
a young Chinese side looking sharper in each match against Iran's
powerful style, dominated by World Cup veterans.
	   A pair of Iranian victories kept China out of the World Cup in
France. But Saturday, the Iranians will be playing with their backs
to the wall, while the Chinese should qualify for the quarterfinals
even if they lose.
	   ``We have a whole new team here,'' said a pleased Bobby
Houghton, China's English coach, after Thursday's victory.
	   For Iran, the wildcard will be Oman, which upset the heavily
favored Iranians in their group opener, 4-2. The Omanis are
expected to best Tajikistan in their final match, getting two group
wins to match China's. If Iran loses or draws against China, Oman
would then advance.
	   Iran would need a victory to also achieve a two-win, one-loss
record, setting up a possible three-way tie at the top. Goal
differential _ probably in Iran's favor over Oman after Thursday's
goalfest _ would determine which two sides reach the knockout
stages.
	   ``Both the players and me want to win,'' said Iran's coach,
Mansour Pourheidari.
	   Iran and China are among the favorites for Asian Games gold.
Oman has been a surprise with one of the games' top scorers, Hani
al-Dhabit, with five goals.
	   Oman's Brazilian coach, Valdeir Vieira, said there was no way
his players could have recovered from their giant-killing
performance against Iran on Tuesday to come back two days later and
work the same miracle against China.
	   But he has no grudges. Calculating the group table, Vieira said
he would be cheering for China on Saturday.

Chechnya's general prosecutor disappears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Only days after the gruesome beheadings of four
foreigners, Chechnya's general prosecutor has disappeared, a news
report said Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening as he returned to
Chechnya's capital city of Grozny from a small village, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Citing unidentified sources, Interfax said Tagirov could have
been seized by armed bands who want one of their colleagues freed
from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway
Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia which
ended in 1996, the Caucusus region has been awash in violence as
feuding gangs wage bloody turf wars. It has also seen a sharp rise
in kidnappings, mostly for ransom.

Indonesian police to charge opposition figures, reports say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A dozen opposition figures will be
charged with conspiracy in connection with deadly clashes between
students and soldiers last month, news reports said Friday.
	   Military leaders have accused the activists of inciting students
to attack troops and campaigning to topple the government of
President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``The results of investigations by the police have led to
charges of conspiracy,'' The Indonesian Observer quoted Lt. Gen.
Nana Permana, the national deputy police chief, as saying Thursday.
	   Critics say the treatment of the government opponents is a
throwback to the authoritarian era of former President Suharto, who
resigned in May amid riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Habibie has promised political reforms, but student protesters
say he has too many ties to his predecessor and former mentor to
overhaul Indonesia's rigid political system.
	   The dozen opposition leaders who face legal action include
former army Gen. Kemal Idris, ex-Jakarta Gov. Ali Sadikin and Sri
Bintang Pamungkas, a former political prisoner. Several have been
banned from leaving the country, The Jakarta Post reported.
	   The activists were questioned after troops opened fire Nov. 13
on student demonstrators who had been trying to march to Parliament
to protest a government assembly on political reform. Nine
protesters died.
	   A day before the fighting, the opposition figures met to demand
the formation of a transitional government that would replace
Habibie and administer the country until elections in 1999.

Japan stocks close sharply lower, dollar rises against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks and mid-afternoon dollar,
bond prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices fell sharply Friday amid
concern over an overnight drop on Wall Street and disappointment
with the government's latest tax reform proposal. The U.S. dollar
posted a modest gain against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 402.16 points,
or 2.72 percent, to close at 14,405.64. On Thursday, the index
closed down 124.10 points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.14 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.08
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level
of 117.33 yen overnight.
	   Stocks in Tokyo declined in reaction to a 167.61 drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average overnight to 8,841.58 and selling
triggered by the settlement of monthly stock future contracts,
known as the special quotation, traders said.
	   Word of the Japanese government's latest tax reform plan also
pushed down share prices, they said.
	   Investors were unimpressed with the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's proposal on Thursday for income tax relief, which includes
``little actual cut'' in the tax burden for middle class families,
said Masaaki Higashida of Nomura Securities Co.
	   The government and the LDP decided to cut income tax payments by
20 percent across the board in 1999, the Japanese business daily
Nihon Keizai reported Friday.
	   But the paper said few taxpayers will be eligible for the full
amount, saying most middle class households will effectively pay
more in taxes next year than in the current fiscal year.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 21.62 points, or 1.90 percent, to close at
1,118.16. The TOPIX lost 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, the previous
day.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency gained
strength when investors bought on dips following dollar-dampening
remarks by Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami, traders said.
	   The currency fell as low as 116.90 yen in early trading after
Hayami said he does not think the recent slide in the dollar has
led to an exchange rate against the yen that is ``unreasonable.''
	   It dropped further after Kyodo News agency reported the BOJ head
had said an overly weak yen would be a ``problem,'' and that
intervention in the currency market should not occur ``too much.''
	   Weakness in U.S. stocks and lingering concerns over financial
problems in Latin America have also discouraged investors from
aggressively building up dollar positions, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.155 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.180 percent, pushing its price up to 105.51 yen from 105.29 yen.

China Democracy Party leader says he will fight for human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Chinese pro-democracy party leader who
was freed from prison in April says he will keep fighting for
democracy and human rights in China.
	   Yao Zhenxiang, of the beleaguered China Democracy Party, made a
surprise appearance Thursday alongside Chinese dissident Harry Wu
and other human rights activists at the U.N. conference marking the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   International Action for Human Rights, a coalition that
organized the event, said Yao had been imprisoned for his political
activities and had arrived in New York from Shanghai with his
family on Wednesday.
	   International Action comprises 33 human rights, peace and
religious organizations from more than 20 nations.
	   On Thursday, in his first news conference since his arrival, Yao
thanked the U.S. government and the coalition, but did not discuss
why he left China. The coalition said he was ``fleeing political
persecution.''
	   Through an interpreter, Yao said he plans to continue the
activities of the China Democracy Party and wants to return to
China, though he said it was too soon for him to say when.
	   At least 29 dissidents have been detained or questioned since
China's Communist Party leaders moved last week to crush the China
Democracy Party. The Democracy Party's leading figures remain in
jail and appear to be headed for trial, one of them next week for
alleged subversion.
	   Asked why he wanted to go back to China if he knew he would
probably also face arrest, Yao replied that he wasn't afraid of
going to prison.
	   ``Many dissidents in China are not afraid. It's a necessity.
It's become a part of life. If one individual is afraid of going to
prison, this movement will never move forward,'' he said.
	   Yao said his brother, who was imprisoned in China after
returning from asylum in France, is still behind bars, apparently
for political reasons.
	   He said he had seen ``many horrible things'' during his two
years in prison, including hunger strikes against human rights
abuses and beatings and torture of prisoners.
	   A lot of prisoners would actually torture themselves, by jabbing
a needle into their abdomen, so they could receive medical
attention and not be forced to work, Yao said.
	   He said he also wants to expose what he called a new form of
imprisonment in which authorities are allowed to detain prisoners
without due process or a trial and then imprison them for periods
ranging from nine months to two years.
	   During his first day in the United States, Yao said he had seen
products on sale that had been produced in Chinese prisons. In
July, a prison in Shanghai _ one that authorities often show to
visitors _ was still producing balls for a major export company, he
said.
	   Wu, a former political prisoner who has called attention to the
products of prison laborers and exposed the underground sale of
prisoners' organs, said that Chinese authorities define human
rights as food and clothing.
	   Chinese U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun told the General Assembly on
Thursday that providing adequate food and clothing to 1.2 billion
people was a major contribution to global human rights.
	   The ambassador did not mention the China Democracy Party.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The arguments against making Puerto
Rico a U.S. state have been around for a century, and statehood
advocates say they are even older than that, having been applied
against aspirants from Alaska to New Mexico.
	   Some say Puerto Rico is too poor. Others say it is too remote.
But the key argument _ one that moves hearts and minds on the
mainland and island both _ is that it is simply too foreign. On
Sunday, residents will have a chance to vote on the issue.

Countries with poorer human rights records defend themselves at UN

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Countries criticized for human rights
abuses used the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights to defend their records and pledge adherence to the
document's lofty goals.
	   China, Algeria and even Chile _ whose rights record has come
under scrutiny with the recent arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet _
were among the speakers opening a special General Assembly session
to mark the anniversary.
	   The session was continuing late Thursday and through Friday
because only a fraction of the 126 speakers signed up had delivered
their addresses.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan began the session by awarding Human
Rights Prizes to five activists in the front lines of the struggle
against injustice.
	   ``Today we honor the highest of human aspirations and renew our
promise to conquer the worst of human cruelty,'' Annan said. ``We
pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of these human
rights, and to the memory of those who died for them.''
	   The winners were former U.S. President Jimmy Carter; Sunila
Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka; Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda; Jose
Gregori of Brazil; and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic.
	   A sixth prize honored ``all human rights defenders all over the
world.''
	   Later Thursday, Luciano Pavarotti and Wynton Marsalis gave a
gala concert in the assembly hall _ capping a day of appearances by
celebrities such as Michael Douglas and Vanessa Redgrave.
	   ``Our music, jazz music, is the music of freedom,'' Marsalis
told the audience before he began.
	   Speakers at the special session and at a parallel conference in
Paris noted that hundreds of millions of people throughout the
world are still deprived of the most basic political, social and
economic rights _ despite the declaration and the ratification of
60 treaties inspired by it.
	   Among the human rights violations cited: the lack of health care
and education for women and girls in Afghanistan; mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia; the murders and disappearances of
thousands of people under Pinochet.
	   Chile's deputy U.N. ambassador, Juan Larrain, didn't refer to
Pinochet's 1973 coup in his speech, but said his country realized
the fragility of the idea of human rights when its democratic
history was ``interrupted.''
	   ``It was in these difficult circumstances of our life as a
nation that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights took on even
more meaning for the Chilean people, serving as a permanent guide
for those who believed that the dignity and respect for human
beings couldn't be trampled in any way, under any pretext,'' he
said.
	   China and Algeria, meanwhile, defended their human rights
records and stated their adherence to the declaration's values.
	   ``As a country under the rule of law, China gives equal
importance to the individual rights of its people,'' China's U.N.
ambassador, Qin Huasun said. ``It respects and protects civil
rights and political rights and opposes the activities that violate
the legitimate rights of its people.
	   Algeria's ambassador, M. Abdallah Baali, said his country had
seen ``major advancements'' in democracy and the field of human
rights, despite efforts to thwart them _ a reference to a Muslim
insurgency that has wracked the country for seven years.
	   At the start of the session, the General Assembly adopted a
nonbinding resolution reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations
in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small.''
	   Despite such symbolic efforts _ and more concrete ones,
including the creation of international tribunals to prosecute war
crimes suspects _ the world's record in responding to and
preventing gross human rights abuses ``does not give ground for
encouragement,'' said the top U.N. human rights official, Mary
Robinson.
	   Clare Short, Britain's Secretary for International Development,
echoed that outrage, saying the declaration didn't just mean
``freedom from fear but freedom from want.''
	   The United States announced new measures Thursday to combat
human rights abuses abroad. Washington has signed and ratified a
key covenant regarding civil and political rights but has been
criticized by human rights groups for failing to ratify the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as
well as treaties to benefit women and children.
	   In Paris, where the declaration was signed 50 years ago, Anna
Eleanor Roosevelt recalled the intention of the declaration's
original supporters, including her grandmother, former American
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
	   ``Human rights begins in the small places, close to home,'' she
said, quoting her grandmother. ``If we remember to respect our
neighbor, our coworker, our children ... we will understand how to
give strength to peoples who live far away, who perhaps we will
never know.''

Yeltsin goes to Kremlin to meet several top aides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin
office on Friday, where he planned to meet several top aides, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   It is the first time Yeltsin has gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   The report gave no other information about Yeltsin's Friday
plans.
	   Yeltsin has been at a country residence, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) outside Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released
from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has handed over responsibility for solving the country's economic
problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of first-day matches &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Now the Americans know why the
International players were so bent on moving golf's Presidents Cup
out of the United States.
	   With spectacular play from the Australians, surprising results
from the Japanese and a birdie putt by Frank Nobilo that shook
Royal Melbourne Golf Club, the International team took a 7-3 lead
after the first day of matches.
	   ``I think the Americans are going to be a little more geared up
now,'' said Norman, who won both his matches with Elkington.
	   The Americans wilted on the second hottest December day this
century in Melbourne, winning only two of the 10 matches outright _
both involved Fred Couples, their most experienced player.
	   Couples teamed with Tiger Woods to whip Vijay Singh and Ernie
Els in alternate shot, and he and Davis Love III improved to 5-3
lifetime as cup partners when Couples drilled an approach into 2
feet for a 1-up victory Carlos Franco and Craig Parry in a
best-ball match.
	   In each of the first two years of the Presidents Cup, the United
States had a 7{-2{ lead after the first day and never looked back.
Fittingly, the tables have been turned Down Under.
	   ``We want to keep the momentum and the emotion,'' Norman said.
	   The momentum started early on a day in which the temperature
soared brisk northerly winds blew, making conditions difficult.
	   Nobilo and Greg Turner, the two Kiwis from New Zealand added to
the team as captain's picks, were in control of their
alternate-shot match against the best two Americans this year,
David Duval and Mark O'Meara.
	   But the lead was only 1-up on the 18th. Turner's 6-iron settled
on the fringe at least 12 meters (40 feet) from the hole, and
O'Meara responded with an approach to 2 feet that set up a probable
halve of their match.
	   Nobilo had other ideas. The descendant of Ivory Coast pirates
robbed the Americans of a half-point by rolling in a birdie putt
that clinched the match
	   and set off a roar that resounded throughout Royal Melbourne.
	   ``That filtered all the way back down to the whole team,''
Norman said.

U.N. inspectors begin final days of current inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. teams returned to the field Friday,
searching suspected weapons sites in intensive inspections that are
scheduled to wind up after this weekend.
	   At least three teams in white, four-wheel drive vehicles with
the U.N. logo were seen leaving the Canal House, a former hotel
that serves as the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   The searches this week in Baghdad and outside the capital have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
inspections last month.
	   A hitch occurred when an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday _ in a direct challenge to the inspectors _ that
U.N. teams would be barred from the party office they tried to
inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told reporters on the steps of
the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site without conditions. But neither the
Iraqis nor U.N. inspectors have indicated that any teams have tried
to return to the site since the standoff.
	   Eight U.N. teams Thursday checked 12 sites, and two teams used
helicopters, the official Iraqi News Agency said, quoting Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring Directorate.
	   Amin said a U.N. biological team arrived in Iraq Thursday and
another biological team left the country.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the Security Council will not lift an oil embargo and
other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   In a weekly report to the U.N. Security Council released
Thursday in New York, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Iraq not only blocked the search of the Baath Party
office but also placed unacceptable conditions on photographing
bombs at a chemical monitoring site Saturday.
	   That same day, he said, Iraq tried to prevent videotaping and
refused to answer questions during a biological weapons inspection.
	   In the report, Butler also said inspectors had evidence that the
Baath Party office ``contained materials of significance.''
	   In another dispute that ended well Thursday, a U.N. team tried
to search what Iraqis called a private home, Amin said. The Iraqis
insisted they first get permission from the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, he said.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq,
as well as teams of experts who have arrived in recent weeks. All
together, they number just under 200. This round of work is
scheduled to end Monday, U.N. officials have said.

Philippines labor situation continues to improve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine labor situation
continues to improve, with the number of strikes falling slightly
from last year, labor officials said Friday.
	   Buenaventura Magsalin, chief of National Conciliation and
Mediation Board, said that as of November of this year, only 89
strikes have been reported nationwide, down from 91 work stoppages
recorded during the same period last year.
	   Magsalin said the number of workers involved in strikes also
dropped by more than a third to 32,819 during the same period.
	   He is optimistic that if the trend continues and more strikes
get resolved during the Christmas period, the country will have a
peaceful December.
	   ``We, therefore, expect to meet out target of maintaining strike
level at below the 100 mark this year,'' he said.

Myanmar press ridicules World Bank dlrs 1 billion dialogue offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar state-run newspapers said on
Friday that the government can't be bought off with a World Bank
offer of dlrs 1 billion in aid to open a dialogue with opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Myanmar's military government has been officially silent on the
offer, which was revealed last month, but commentaries in the
military-controlled press are believed to reflect the thinking of
at least some members of the government.
	   ``National objectives cannot be enticed and bought with the
dollar,'' said a commentary in the New Light of Myanmar. ``To obey
such condition is beneath one's dignity.''
	   The commentary questioned who would benefit from spending a
billion dollars to install ``the bogadaw,'' or the wife of a white
alien, on the political stage.
	   Suu Kyi is married to a British academic, which the military
rulers have said disqualifies her from political office or becoming
a national leader.
	   The United States charge d'affaires in Yangon, Kent Wiedemann,
said on Voice of America radio on Thursday that the U.S. would help
fund the World Bank assistance.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962,
during which time the resource-rich country has become one of the
world's poorest nations.
	   The generals have adamantly refused to talk with Suu Kyi, the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the country's embattled
democracy movement.
	   The only time they chose to meet her face to face was when they
had her under house arrest for six years from 1989-95.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a
1990 election the military refused to honor.
	   In recent months, the military has arrested about a thousand
members of her party and refused to release them unless they sign
agreements to quit the party, according to party leaders.
	   The military has said the party members have been invited to
guest houses, where after friendly discussions they chose to resign
voluntarily.

that serves as the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   The searches this week have been the most intensive since U.N.
teams were allowed to resume inspections last month.
	   A hitch occurred when an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would be barred from the party
office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told reporters on the steps of
the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site without conditions. But neither the
Iraqis nor U.N. inspectors have indicated that any teams have tried
to return to the site since the standoff.
	   Eight U.N. teams Thursday checked 12 sites, and two teams used
helicopters, the official Iraqi News Agency said, quoting Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring Directorate.
	   Amin said a U.N. biological team arrived in Iraq Thursday and
another biological team left the country.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the Security Council will not lift an oil embargo and
other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   In a weekly report to the U.N. Security Council released
Thursday in New York, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, said Iraq not only blocked the search of the Baath Party
office but also placed unacceptable conditions on photographing
bombs at a chemical monitoring site Saturday.
	   That same day, he said, Iraq tried to prevent videotaping and
refused to answer questions during a biological weapons inspection.
	   In the report, Butler also said inspectors had evidence that the
Baath Party office ``contained materials of significance.''
	   In another dispute that ended well Thursday, a U.N. team tried
to search what Iraqis called a private home, Amin said. The Iraqis
insisted they first get permission from the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, he said.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq,
as well as teams of experts who have arrived in recent weeks. All
together, they number just under 200. This round of work is
scheduled to end Monday, U.N. officials have said.

Police officer testifies in support of prosecution case

allegedly suppressed police investigations

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior police officer testifying
in the corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Friday that Anwar told police not to investigate allegations that
he committed sexual misdeeds.
	   ``When I told Anwar that our investigations were still not
completed and were only in its initial stages, he told me that this
matter shouldn't be pursued further,'' Musa Hassan, the
prosecution's 13th witness, told the court.
	   Musa, the officer charged with investigating Anwar since last
year, said Anwar issued the directive in the presence of Malaysia's
top lawmaker, Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah.
	   ``Anwar told us that the investigations should be stopped
because it goes against what the prime minister had already
concluded, that the matter was slanderous,'' Musa said.
	   His testimony sparked off a storm of protest from Anwar's
defense team, who accused prosecutors of using the witness to
introduce prejudicial evidence unrelated to any of the charges
leveled against the ousted deputy prime minister.
	   ``It offends the rule of relevancy,'' said lawyer Christopher
Fernando.
	   Trial judge Augustine Paul overruled the objections, dealing the
defense team another setback. On Thursday, Paul reversed his
decision to let defense lawyers argue that a key prosecution
witness was lying about being sodomized by Anwar.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar put immense
pressure on the police to silence two people, the former driver of
his wife and the sister of his former secretary, and obtain
retractions from them.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, the driver, has testified that Anwar
repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, while Ummi Hafilda Ali has
accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife.
	   The two were arrested briefly in August 1997 and have claimed
they were forced by police to sign statements retracting their
allegations against Anwar.
	   Earlier, Musa said that regular police were kept from
interrogating Ummi Hafilda and Azizan.
	   Intelligence officers of the Special Branch were deputed to
interrogate the two accusers and not the detectives from his
criminal investigation department, Musa testified.
	   He said the decision by authorities to allow only the Special
Branch to handle the case angered the head of the criminal
investigation unit.
	   Musa took the stand Thursday at the end of stormy testimony by
Azizan, who claimed he was coerced into homosexual acts not only by
Anwar but also by his adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence after pleading guilty
to allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar. The other person in
jail for pleading guilty to having sex with Anwar is Munawar Ahmad
Anees, Anwar's speech writer.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions.
	   Although defense lawyers have complained about Azizan's
credibility as a witness, citing glaring inconsistencies in his
stories, the judge on Thursday disallowed a move to throw out his
entire testimony and disqualify him.
	   Azizan's sodomy accusations form the core of the 10 charges
against Anwar, who was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Sept. 2 on grounds of immorality.
	   Anwar's sacking and his subsequent arrest and beating while in
police custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.
	   He is being tried first on four counts of corruption. He will
face trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and
five for alleged illegal sex acts.

Change of scenery works wonders for International team

 &UR; Eds: adds first name of Norman, Elkington, adds other quotes, new
material throughout, wraps up for day &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Now the Americans know why the
International players were so bent on moving golf's Presidents Cup
out of the United States.
	   With spectacular play from the Australians, surprising results
from the Japanese and a birdie putt by Frank Nobilo that shook
Royal Melbourne Golf Club, the International team took a 7-3 lead
after the first day of matches.
	   ``I think the Americans are going to be a little more geared up
now,'' said Greg Norman, who won both his matches with fellow
Australian Steve Elkington.
	   The Americans wilted on the second hottest December day this
century in Melbourne, winning only two of the 10 matches outright _
both involved Fred Couples, their most experienced player.
	   Couples teamed with Tiger Woods to whip Vijay Singh and Ernie
Els in alternate shot, and he and Davis Love III improved to 5-3
lifetime as cup partners when Couples drilled an approach into 2
feet for a 1-up victory over Carlos Franco and Craig Parry in a
best-ball match.
	   In each of the first two years of the Presidents Cup, the United
States had a 7 1-2 to 2 1-2 lead after the first day and never
looked back. Fittingly, the tables have been turned Down Under.
	   ``We want to keep the momentum and the emotion,'' Norman said.
	   The momentum started early on a day in which the temperature
soared and brisk northerly winds blew, making conditions difficult.
	   Nobilo and Greg Turner, the two Kiwis from New Zealand, added to
the team as captain's picks, were in control of their
alternate-shot match against the best two Americans this year,
David Duval and Mark O'Meara.
	   But the lead was only 1-up on the 18th. Turner's 6-iron settled
on the fringe at least 12 meters (40 feet) from the hole, and
O'Meara responded with
	   an approach to 2 feet that set up a probable halve of their
match.
	   Nobilo had other ideas. The descendant of Ivory Coast pirates
robbed the Americans of a half-point by rolling in a birdie putt
that clinched the match and set off a roar that resounded
throughout Royal Melbourne.
	   ``That filtered all the way back down to the whole team,''
Norman said.
	   And the International team marched right on.
	   Norman and Elkington closed out their 2-up victory over Jim
Furyk and John Huston when Elkington rifled his approach from the
rough on the 18th into 3 feet for a birdie, and Parry and Shigeki
Maruyama had no problem beating Scott Hoch and Lee Janzen.
	   The International team led 3 1-2 to 1 1-2 after the morning
matches, and showed no signs of letting up when Norman birdied the
first two holes of a best-ball match against Furyk and O'Meara.
	   Maruyama went out in the afternoon with Joe Ozaki and thrashed
John Huston and Mark Calcavecchia, leading 4-up at the turn and
going on to a 4 and 3 victory.
	   The Americans had their chances.
	   Duval and Phil Mickelson led their match against Els and Nick
Price from the seventh hole on, but had to settle for a draw when
Price made a 6-foot birdie putt on the last hole and Duval, who
struggled all day with his putter, missed from 10 feet.
	   Woods and Justin Leonard were all square with Singh and Stuart
Appleby through 13 holes but wound up losing 2 and 1.
	   The International team has never led after any day of matches in
the three-year history of the Presidents Cup.
	   ``We can come back,'' Couples said. ``But obviously, we need to
get maybe
	   six out of the 10 matches tomorrow. It's not like it's a
basketball game where you're down with 30 seconds to go. It can be
done.
	   ``But they are playing beautifully,'' he said. ``Whatever they
did today was real good.''
	   Norman and Elkington, the only team that either captain kept
together for the morning and afternoon matches, lost only five of
the 35 holes they played.
	   ``I knew I was swinging well,'' said Norman, who didn't look
anything like a man who missed seven months because of shoulder
surgery and only returned to competition last month.
	   ``All that hard work I had done from the rehab up to this moment
in time is there. I feel like I made another step forward on the
road to recovery.''
	   A little magic seemed to be on the International side all day _
Elkington
	   holed a 50-footer for birdie to close out the best-ball match
against O'Meara and Duval; in a morning match, O'Meara hit a chip
that was headed right for the pin when it struck a sprinkler head
on the fringe and shot into a bunker.
	   And then there was Nobilo's putt, which sent Duval and O'Meara
to their first loss in four Presidents Cup matches together.
	   ``The thing with Kiwis is we will nip at someone's heels all day
for 18 holes,'' Nobilo said. ``And eventually we will take the leg
off.'' (df/djp)

Ma's army missing, but China still strong
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Chinese athletes who thrived on
turtle blood soup and caterpillar fungus aren't here, so there
won't be any of Ma Junren's magic.
	   But the Asian Games' track and field events opening Sunday may
still see domination of China over Japan and South Korea, with Sri
Lanka capturing medals in the women's events and others picking up
ones or twos.
	   China did not field all its top athletes at the Asian
championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in September but still ran away
with 26 golds from 43 events, far ahead of Japan's six. Qatar had
three and Kazakstan and Sri Lanka two each. Chinese women finished
with 17 in all.
	   Of the 43 track and field golds in the last Asian Games in
Hiroshima four years ago, China took 22. At Bangkok, there might be
only a little variation in that Chinese script.
	   But the Chinese success at Hiroshima was overshadowed by 11
athletes _ including seven swimmers _ failing drug tests.
	   To keep its reputation clean in Bangkok, China carried out more
than 500 drug tests in the month before the games, with at least
one unnamed athlete returning a positive test. Almost 3,000 drug
tests in 20 sports have been taken in China this year, said Shi
Kangcheng, deputy secretary of China's Asian Games delegation.
	   Though Chinese officials say that ``Ma's army'' was not included
in the 1998 team because its runners did not turn up at training
camps, there had been suspicions that maybe more than a regimen of
high-altitude training, daily marathons and herbal concoctions
accounted for their speed.
	   Ma has attributed his runner's success to that training and a
special diet of herbal tonics, turtle blood soup and caterpillar
fungus. Competitors accused runners coached by Ma of using
performance-enhancing concoctions after they demolished a slew of
world records in 1993 _ allegations that were never proven.
	   Bangkok's hot, sultry weather will be a factor at track and
field, especially in distance events, where the Sri Lankans and
Indians may have some edge.
	   The Chinese medal hunt at Bangkok is being led by sprinter Yan
Jiankui, a double gold medalist at the Asian track championships.
There, Yan edged teammate Huang Mei 23.00 seconds to 23.21 in the
200 meters, adding that gold to her 100-meter victory.
	   Another to watch from China is Li Xuemei, who set the Asian
records of 10.79 in the 100 meters and 22.01 in the 200 in meets in
China last year. She is in Bangkok and preparing.
	   While unlikely to challenge China's overall supremacy, the
Japanese and the Qataris can take medals in some of the men's
events. The Kazaks and Uzbeks can cause some upsets.
	   For Japan, Koji Ito will seek to repeat his performance in
Fukuoka, where he edged China's Han Chaoming by 0.07 second in the
200 meters, winning in 20.70.
	   At a home meet in October, Ito equaled the Asian record of 10.08
in the 100 meters, and set an Asian mark of 20.16 in the 200.
	   Another Japanese, Toshinari Takaoka, who beat India's Gulab
Chand by more than a second in the 5,000 in Fukuoka, is also a
medal prospect.
	   Chinese women's triple jumper Ren Ruiping, who came 0.55 meters
short of her 2-year-old Asian record of 14.66 at Fukuoka, is
difficult to beat.
	   China can no longer take the men's throws for granted. Though it
swept the golds in Hiroshima, it could gather only two of the four
at Fukuoka.
	   Sri Lanka, a small island nation off India's southern coast, is
expected to gain medals from the running of Sugath Tillakeratne,
Damayanthi Darsha and Susantika Jayasinghe. The color of the
medals, however, is in doubt.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Angry workers marched through a New
Delhi industrial area Friday and others across the country observed
a general strike to protest the government's plan to further open
the Indian economy to foreign investment.
	   The New Delhi marchers belonged to leftist unions who, along
with leftist political parties, called a one-day nationwide strike
Friday.
	   The protests reached parliament, where leftist politicians held
an hour-long morning sit-in and later normal business in both the
upper and lower houses was interrupted by shouts from members whose
demands to discuss the strike were refused.
	   Politicians also clashed in parliament Friday over plans to set
aside a third of parliamentary seats for women, making it uncertain
the bill will ever come to a vote.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but has never come to a vote. Women accuse male politicians of
being unwilling to surrender any power in a country where religious
practice and tradition often keep women in the shadows.
	   Though the strike appeared only partially observed Friday in the
capital, where shops and offices were open and traffic relatively
normal, local news agencies reported most shops, banks, offices and
the commuter railroad were shut down in the eastern city of
Calcutta.
	   The state-owned airline canceled service for the day in and out
of Calcutta, the state capital of West Bengal, which is controlled
by Communists. The city's stock market and major commodities
markets were closed.
	   In Bombay, India's financial hub, the Reserve Bank of India said
business was normal.
	   ``There are two unions in the RBI, one for the officers and
another for the clerical staff and neither have joined the
strike,'' central bank spokesperson Alpana Killawala told Dow Jones
News Wires from Bombay, India's financial hub.
	   Factories, shops and government offices were closed across the
southwestern state of Kerala and the northeastern state of Tripura,
news agencies added, saying protests were peaceful across the
country.
	   The strike was sparked by a bill opening up the Indian insurance
sector. The bill is expected to be presented to parliament for
debate next week and is expected to pass. Both the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party and the main opposition Congress party support the
bill allowing up to 40 percent foreign investment in Indian
insurance companies.
	   Leftists, whose influence has waned in recent years, argue
working people will be hurt because foreigners will destroy
indigenous businesses, while reformers say the Indian economy will
be strengthened by new ideas and entrepreneurs.

Mark Waugh booed by Adelaide crowd

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Disgraced batsman Mark Waugh made
just seven after being booed by the Adelaide crowd on the first day
of the third Ashes cricket test Friday.
	   Australia, batting first and thanks to a timely century by left
hander Justin Langer, hit 266 for five after England had dropped
two more catches to extend its series tally to 13.
	   Langer having batted for 5 1-2 hours, was unbeaten on 108 while
Ricky Ponting hadn't scored.
	   Waugh, one of the two Australians to accept tainted money from
an illegal
	   bookmaker from Delhi, lasted just 35 minutes before becoming off
spinner Peter Such's second victim.
	   Waugh and Shane Warne took money to give waether reports and
pitch conditions to the millionaire bookmaker during a one-day
series in Sri Lanka in September 1994.
	   Langer's second test century was also overshadowed by the
Australian Cricket Board's (ACB) decision to appoint an independent
person to clean up the game from any unknown links with bookmakers
from the Indian sub-continent.
	   The 25 first-class cricketers contracted by the ACB will give
evidence to
	   an outside appointee.
	   Langer, playing in his 14th test, condemned the England bowlers
in 40-degree heat that forced two drink breaks per session.
	   England compounded its day, dropping the two openers _ Mark
Taylor and Michael Slater.
	   Taylor, dropped before he had scored in the third over of the
morning, went onto make 59 runs and in the process shared 112 for
the second wicket with Langer.
	   Slater's miss didn't prove costly as the right hander was caught
behind three balls later off recalled medium paceman Dean Headley.
	   England was rewarded for its hard work under the hot sun despite
conceding 33 runs in the first four overs after the lunch break.
	   Such, playing in his first test in four years, claimed Taylor
for the fifth time in five tests, and 16 runs later removed Waugh.
	   But his twin Steve had other ideas and nursed Langer to his
first century
	   at home in only his fifth test.
	   The fourth-wicket pair took Australia from 156 for three to 264
before Gough, armed with the second new ball, struck.
	   With the fourth ball, Gough forced Waugh (59) to edge an off
cutter and Hick at second slip made no mistake in latching on to a
shin-high catch.
	   The pair raised 108 runs in just 148 minutes and Waugh's
109-ball knock included a six and four boundaries.
	   Such, who had played just one first-class game on tour, a month
ago here,
	   vindicated his selection with some tidy spin which allowed
skipper Alec Stewart to alternate the medium pace trio from the
Cathedral end.
	   Such finished with 2-57 in 27 overs while Gough and Headley took
a wicket
	   each.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Saeed Anwar cracked his 17th Test half
century as Pakistan was solidly placed at 111 for one at lunch on
the second day of the second cricket Test against Zimbabwe Friday.
	   Pakistan dismissed Zimbabwe for 183 Thursday and began its first
innings with debutante Mohammad Naveed and Anwar scoring 69 runs
for the first wicket.
	   Naveed, 24, faced Zimbabwe seamers Heath Streak and Henry Olonga
with confidence and stroked four boundaries during his patient
innings of 32. Streak got the first breakthrough when he had Naveed
bowled in his second spell as the batsman missed the line of the
ball while attempting to play an on-drive.
	   Anwar was unbeaten on a flawless 68 which included 10 fours.
	   Streak has claimed 1-30 off a steady 12 overs while the three
other medium paceman Olonga (0-41), Mbangwa (0-24) and Johnson
(0-15) are yet to get a wicket.

Cambodian government sees slim hopes for ASEAN entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Southeast Asian nations still
split on whether Cambodia should be admitted into its regional bloc
next week, Prime Minister Hun Sen sounded pessimistic Friday about
his country's chances at entry.
	   Hun Sen will travel to Hanoi for a state visit two days before
the Dec. 15-16 summit of the Association of Southeast Nations. He
appeared Friday to have already accepted that the consensus
required among ASEAN's nine countries to admit Cambodia would
probably not emerge.
	   He said before a Cabinet meeting that whether or not Cambodia is
able to enter ASEAN at next week's summit, ``it will still remain a
future member of the association.''
	   But Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong expressed cautious
optimism on admittance as he left for the Hanoi summit on Friday
along with Finance Minister Keat Chhon.
	   ``We'll see. It depends on ASEAN,'' Hor Nam Hong said at the
Phnom Penh airport.
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join ASEAN in July 1997
along with Laos and Myanmar, but its application was indefinitely
suspended when Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh in a violent coup d'etat.
	   Following a disputed election in July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh set
aside their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal, and
the prince became president of the National Assembly.
	   Hun Sen's new government has lobbied hard to regain the
international legitimacy Cambodia lost after the coup, and on
Monday it successfully reclaimed its seat the United Nations.
	   While a majority of ASEAN members have supported Cambodia's bid
to be admitted to the group next week, Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines have said the troubled nation's entry should be delayed
until the Hun Sen-Ranariddh coalition proves it is stable.
	   Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy applauded the reticence
of the three in a statement on Friday.
	   ``Their reluctance to admit Cambodia immediately is
well-considered,'' he said.
	   Sam Rainsy said the government must do more to curb political
violence and promote democracy.
	   ``In the long term, stability goes hand-in-hand with
democracy,'' he said.
	   Foreign and economic ministers from ASEAN countries will meet
separately on Friday and Saturday, then jointly on Sunday ahead of
the summit. Cambodia's application is expected to dominate their
agenda.

Ukraine to provide Russia with grain as part of gas debt payment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will supply neighboring Russia with
500,000 metric tons (550,000 tons) of grain to cover part of its
debts for Russian gas supplies, a news report said Friday.
	   Artur Gubar, spokesman for the state oil and gas company
Naftogas, said Ukraine will provide other commodities as well, but
the details had not been finalized, the independent Ukrainian News
agency reported.
	   ``At the moment, we're discussing the list, reception points and
supply conditions for other commodities,'' he said.
	   Gubar also declined to say how much the grain deal was worth,
Ukrainian News reported.
	   Under an agreement reached last month, Ukraine is to cover half
of its dlrs 1 billion debt for Russian natural gas supplies with
food products, and the other half with farm machines and gas
industry equipment.
	   The two former Soviet republics have often wrangled over
Ukraine's gas debts.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, needs about
80 billion cubic meters (2.8 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas
annually, of which only 18 billion cubic meters (630 billion cubic
feet) is domestically produced. The rest is imported, mostly from
Russia.

Reports: Major Japanese bank to be put under state control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese finance officials are considering putting
a major lender, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., under state control after
judging the bank is insolvent, media reports said Friday.
	   Japan's central bank and the Financial Supervisory Agency
decided to consider nationalizing Nippon Credit as part of a more
drastic restructuring plan for the ailing bank, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun reported in its evening edition.
	   The bank would be the second to be put under state control
because of bad-loan troubles. The government took over the
operations of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Spokesmen for both the Bank of Japan and the Financial
Supervisory Agency, which is responsible for the banking industry,
denied the report.
	   Nippon Credit was not aware of such a plan, said a bank
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Several other media agencies, including national broadcaster
NHK, also reported that officials were moving to nationalize the
bank.
	   If the reports are true, it wouldn't be the first time the
government has intervened to help NCB.
	   Last April, the government ordered a cash injection to help the
bank deal with hundreds of billions of yen (billion of dollars) in
bad loans and to restore confidence in Japan's financial system.
	   Japanese banks are struggling with a mountain of loans gone sour
after frenzied land and stock speculation in the late 1980s.

Ukrainian company to open ferry line to Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrferry shipping company will open a
ferry line from Ukraine's Black Sea port of Iliychevsk to Batumi in
Georgia, the company's president said.
	   In comments carried Friday by the UNIAN news agency, Oleksandr
Kurliand said Ukrferry already has a contract to transport 30 train
cars filled with machine goods and is examining other possibilities
for cargo transportation.
	   The new line, which will open Dec. 18, might also be used to
transport construction materials from Iliychevsk to Turkey, located
near Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa.

Japanese baseball team finds no evidence of sign-stealing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese baseball team accused of stealing
catchers' signs said Friday that it had found no evidence of the
alleged scheme.
	   The Daiei Hawks, managed by home run king Sadaharu Oh, said it
had questioned the accused three players and team employees and
gone over videotapes of games but ``could not confirm'' the
reported sign-stealing.
	   According to the charges, which surfaced in Japanese media
reports last week, a Daiei employee monitored a TV camera in
Fukuoka Dome that was focused on the opposing catcher.
	   The employee picked up signs given to the pitcher and relayed
them by walkie-talkie to a youngster in the stands who relayed
information to the batter.
	   Holding a megaphone in front of his face meant a fastball.
Holding it to the right meant a curve or a slider, and to the left
a forkball.
	   Daiei said it had experimented carrying out the scheme as part
of its internal 10-day investigation and found that it was
extremely difficult to pull off.
	   The players and other team members they had questioned all
denied the allegations, it said.
	   ``We went over the videotapes of the games and found no evidence
of any suspicious people,'' the team said in a statement.
	   The allegations of the sign-stealing had drawn much attention in
Japan, particularly because Oh, who hit a record 868 home runs,
said he feared a lifetime ban if the team was found to be behind
the scandal.
	   It was unclear whether all doubts had been put to rest.
	   The Pacific League has said that it might carry out an
independent investigation, depending on the findings of the team's
investigation. The league said Friday it will call a meeting of its
senior officials next Monday to discuss the scandal.
	   ``We must do out utmost to never allow such suspicions to emerge
again in professional baseball, whose mission is to offer dreams
and hope to the young, as well as joy to the work place and
families,'' Daiei said.

Daewoo, Samsung workers continue walkout to protest swap deal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of workers at two major
conglomerates continued work stoppages Friday, protesting an
industry shakeup they said would lead to mass layoffs.
	   In a government-mediated deal struck earlier this week, Daewoo
Electronics Co. will be swapped by its parent conglomerate for
Samsung Motors Co., an auto-making subsidiary of the Samsung group.
	   Samsung Motors will be absorbed by Daewoo Motors, the nation's
No. 2 car maker, while Daewoo Electronics will be merged into
Samsung's home appliance arm, the nation's largest.
	   The dlrs 10 billion deal is part of an industrial restructuring
in which the nation's top five conglomerates _ Hyundai, Samsung,
LG, Daewoo and SK _ will spin off half of their 264 subsidiaries.
	   One industry study estimates that the restructuring will result
in up to 40,000 workers being laid off.
	   On Friday, more than 9,000 Daewoo Electronics workers at the
company's five plants put down their tools for the third straight
day. A third of them later rallied in front of their head office in
Seoul, demanding that the swap with Samsung be scrapped.
	   ``No to the irresponsible restructuring!'' they chanted.
	   Hundreds of riot police stood by but did not interfere.
	   Daewoo protesters included several representatives from the
company's 100 overseas factories and subsidiaries, which employ a
combined 11,000 workers in Europe, South America and elsewhere.
	   ``This unilateral policy will bring serious repercussions that
will damage the political relationship between Korea and the
European Union,'' said a statement read by Steve Brownless, a
representative from Daewoo Electronics Sales U.K.
	   In two provincial cities, Pusan and Taegu, 6,000 Samsung Motors
Co. workers walked off their jobs for the fourth straight day to
protest the deal.
	   Samsung Motors, under a technical tie up with Japan's Nissan
Motors Co., entered South Korea's saturated car market in 1996. The
firm, with an annual capacity of 80,000, has already run up a dlrs
2 billion deficit.
	   The Samgsung-Daewoo swap is the centerpiece of President Kim
Dae-jung's efforts to restructure South Korea's bloated,
family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, thus boosting foreign
confidence in the country's battered economy.

Buddhist group says Myanmar military hunting seven monks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime has launched
a manhunt for seven Buddhist monks who participated in an
anti-government demonstration in Mandalay during November, a monks
group said on Friday.
	   ``Military intelligence agents are demanding that the abbots of
monasteries hand over the monks,'' said the All Burma Young Monks
Union in a statement received in Bangkok.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is a predominantly Buddhist
country.
	   A spokesman for the military government did not immediately
respond to the monks union's allegations.
	   The Buddhist group said that the seven hunted monks were some of
the 300 to 400 monks who staged an anti-government protest in the
central city of Mandalay, 560 kilometers (360 miles) north of
Yangon, on the evening of Nov. 23.
	   The monks were demanding the ``removal of military
dictatorship,'' the release of imprisoned monks and a legal enquiry
into missing jewels from a Buddha image the military restored, the
monks union said.
	   The group said bystanders joined in the demonstration after
police fired on the monks.
	   The monks union claimed there were nine other demonstrations by
monks in other parts of Myanmar during November and that military
intelligence officers have been keeping a close watch on certain
monasteries.
	   The group accused the government of attempting to incite
anti-Muslim unrest to draw attention away from the monks'
complaints.

Kazakstan brings pause to Chinese medal haul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan's canoeing team brought a
short pause Friday to China's rapid-fire gold medal collection at
the Asian Games, winning five races within about an hour.
	   But even on the canoeing course, China won the last two races of
the day. Then it took a shooting gold.
	   That boosted the Chinese gold total early on the fifth day of
competition to 53, far ahead of Japan's 21 and South Korea's 20.
They were expecting more from swimming and weightlifting.
	   Kazakstan's five golds brought its total to 11, fourth in the
standings.
	   Tatyana Sergina had to come from behind in the first of the
day's 500-meter races, beating Japan's Sayuri Maruyama by 0.13
seconds in the one-woman kayaks.
	   In another close race, Kazakstan's Dmitriy Torlopov and Dmitriy
Kaltenberger took an early lead and held off China's Fang Lei and
Wang Cuizhong by 0.21 seconds in two-man kayaks.
	   Konstantin Negodyayev and Sergey Sergeyev, the gold medalists at
1,000 meters, also won in two-man canoes at 500 meters, nearly four
seconds ahead of South Korea's Jun Kwang-rak and Park Chang-kyu.
	   Kaisar Nurmaganbetov won his gold by nearly 11 seconds over
Uzbekistan's Dmitriy Kovalenko in one-man canoes, and Yevgeniy
Yegorov won the one-man kayak race, 1:49.52 to 1:54.15 over
Uzbekistan's Anton Ryahov.
	   China won the two- and four-women kayak races. Gao Beibei and
Zhong Hongyan beat the Kazak pair of Natalya Sergeyeva and singles
winner Sergina by 1:54.64 to 1:57.28.
	   In the four-woman kayaks, China was 1.61 seconds ahead of
Uzbekistan.
	   Off the playing fields, Indian team leader Gurudayl Singh Mander
shrugged off criticism of his organization by world champion
billiards player Geet Sethi.
	   Sethi was angry that the Indian track suits for the games have
been slow to arrive and lashed out in an interview with the
newspaper Indian Express, suggesting the team was dressed like
``beggars.''
	   Sethi told the Indian Express that said competing at the Games
was a source of great pride but he ``must say I'm totally disgusted
that we have come here so ill-prepared.''
	   Sethi said bought his own track suit and T-shirts in Bangkok and
had been using those because the official uniforms had failed to
arrive.
	   Mander said the team had official uniforms which they wore at
the opening ceremony on Sunday. He admitted Friday that not all
track suits had arrived from destinations in India.
	   Mander has the power to sanction Sethi, who is making his Asian
Games debut along with his sport here, but said he had spoken with
the player and no action was expected.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indian team leader Gurudayl Singh
Mander has shrugged off blistering criticism of his Asian Games
organization by world champion billiards player Geet Sethi.
	   Sethi was angry that the Indian track suits for the games have
been slow to arrive and lashed out in an interview with the
newspaper Indian Express, suggesting the team was dressed like
``beggars.''
	   Mander has the power to sanction Sethi, who is making his Asian
Games debut along with his sport here, but said he had spoken with
the player and no action was expected.
	   Sethi told the Indian Express that said competing at the games
was a source of great pride but he ``must say I'm totally disgusted
that we have come here so ill-prepared.''
	   Mander said the team had official uniforms that they wore at the
opening ceremony Sunday. He admitted Friday that not all track
suits had arrived from destinations in India.
	   Mander said he had not read Sethi's comments but told The
Associated Press, ``He's a very senior champion and it would have
been better if had not said those things.''
	   Mander said Sethi stood back from his comments when they
discussed the issue Friday.
	   ``He said he didn't mean those things in the paper. Sanctions
are dealt with on a case to case basis and while I haven't seen his
comments yet, we are not planning any action.''
	   Sethi told the Indian Express that he bought his own track suit
and T-shirts in Bangkok and had been using those because the
official uniforms had failed to arrive.
	   ``Just about every team in the village looks smart. The Chinese
even wear coordinated Reebok shoes. I told the Indian Olympic
Association that we are not beggars and we should move around
dressed as smartly as the others.''
	   An angry Sethi said he thought of arranging a ``gherao'' _ an
Indian term describing a tactic used in labor disputes when
protesters prevent officials from leaving a room.
	   ``It's the only language these chaps understand,'' Sethi told
the paper.

Coca-Cola acquiring Cadbury Schweppes' brands in 120 countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Coca-Cola Co. is buying Cadbury Schweppes'
brands in 120 countries in a deal estimated at dlrs 1.85 billion,
the companies announced Friday.
	   The deal covers Schweppes and Canada Dry mixers, Dr Pepper and
Crush, the companies said. The transactions, which do not apply to
the United States, France and South Africa, also include
acquisition of beverage plants in Ireland and Spain.
	   Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory review in a
number of countries but is anticipated in the middle of next year,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced.
	   The deal will affect approximately 450 Cadbury Schweppes
employees, who will have the opportunity to take jobs with
Coca-Cola, the company said.
	   ``These agreements will allow The Coca-Cola Co. to participate
in segments of the beverage business where it currently does not
have meaningful entries,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, chairman of the
board and chief executive of Coca-Cola.
	   John Sunderland, chief executive of London-based Cadbury
Schweppes, said the deal will create ``substantial value for our
shareowners and simultaneously enhance out ability to develop and
focus on our strong global confectionary and U.S. beverage
business.''
	   In Feburary, Cadbury Schweppes PLC entered a joint venture with
U.S.-based Carlyle Group to acquire two soft-drink bottlers,
Beverage America and Select Beverages, for dlrs 724 million.
	   The deal was seen as an important step by Cadbury to secure its
distribution system for soft drinks like 7Up, Dr Pepper, Canada
Dry, Sunkist and A-and-W. Cadbury trails Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola
Co. in the dlrs 55 billion U.S. soft drink industry.

Train traffic practically normal after end of rail strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rail traffic in France was practically back to
normal Friday following a decision by conductors to end their
strike that had disrupted service for 13 days.
	   The conductors in the majority of French regions on strike voted
Thursday night to go back to work.
	   Train workers, who had asked for 600 more employees, were
returning to work because they were largely satisfied with the
government's response, union officials said.
	   Union officials also were satisfied with a 200-franc (dlrs 36)
increase in a monthly bonus for conductors, boosting the amount to
1,400 francs (dlrs 250) a month for 1999.
	   The high-speed TGV line to and from Nantes in Brittany was still
experiencing reduced service Friday, and traffic was expected to be
disrupted around Bordeaux, Rouen and Toulouse among others.

China defeats champions to win Asian Games badminton gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women beat defending champion
South Korea for the Asian Games badminton team gold Friday,
avenging a humiliating defeat four years ago.
	   China's world No. 3, Gong Zhichao, secured the gold with an
11-4, 11-1 trouncing of Lee Joo-hyun in the third match of the
best-of-five team final.
	   Chinese coach Li Yongbo said the team, expected to remain
unchanged for the 2000 Olympics, has matured and improved since
South Korea's 5-0 semifinal whitewash of China on its way to gold
at the last Asian Games in 1994.
	   ``We've gone from losing to winning,'' he said. ``Our team
members have played pretty well. What makes me happy is that
they've shown maturity.''
	   Ye Zhaoying, the 1997 singles world champion, got China off to a
solid start with a hard-earned 11-9, 13-10 victory over Korea's Kim
Ji-hyun, the world No. 8.
	   ``Now that I've won the first match, the remaining matches
should not be a problem,'' the 24-year-old world No. 1 said after
her victory. ``I played well.''
	   Kim had clawed her way back from a 5-0 deficit in the first game
to level the score, only to falter and let Ye close out the game.
After fighting her way back from 5-10 down to win the second game
and the match, a delighted Ye went over to the stands to high-five
her coaches and teammates.
	   Gu Jun and Ge Fei, the Olympic and world doubles champions,
built on Ye's victory with a closely fought 15-13, 15-11 victory
over La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee.
	   Gu said the team had hoped to face South Korea in the final
following their crushing loss in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Gu and
Ge also had a two-year record of no defeats to defend.
	   Gu described the win as ``completing the duty of four years
ago.''
	   Indonesia, which lost to Korea 4-1 in the semis, and Japan,
which was trounced 5-0 by China, shared bronze.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Only days after the killings of four foreigners,
Chechnya's general prosecutor has disappeared and may have been
kidnapped, a news report said Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening as he returned to
Chechnya's capital city of Grozny from a small village nearby,
according to Russian news reports.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said Tagirov was seized by
unidentified assailants, possibly by an armed band seeking the
release of one of their colleagues from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man and claimed he had confessed to
kidnapping the four foreigners. The suspect was identified as Apti
Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching Friday for
additional suspects as well as the the bodies of the four
foreigners who were killed.
	   Atgeriyev also dismissed a videotape that showed one of the four
victims saying he was spying for Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been in
Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway
republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the
government had it.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia which
ended in 1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as
feuding gangs wage bloody turf wars. It has also seen a sharp rise
in kidnappings, mostly for ransom.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two major brands of Italy's traditional Christmas
cake, ``panettone,'' will be withdrawn from shelves across the
country Friday after an animal rights group said it had injected
them with rat poison.
	   The Italian distributor of Nestle products ordered the
approximately 1,000 stores that carry its brands ``Motta'' and
``Alemagna'' to stop their sale after Italy's major news agency
received a panettone accompanied with a note saying the cakes had
been poisoned.
	   The group Animal Liberation Front said it used syringes to
inject rat poison into the Christmas cakes, which are Italians
favorite food during the holiday season. The activists said they
were protesting Nestle's use of genetic engineering to develop its
products.
	   Results of tests on the panettone sent to the ANSA news agency
in Florence were expected later Friday.
	   Experts interviewed by RAI state radio said there was no way to
inject a fatal quantity of rat poison into a panettone. They said
at worst people would get bad stomach cramps and diarrhea.
	   Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident.

Strong winds give Australians advantage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian Rod Pampling fought
through a second day of brutal wind conditions for a one-shot
halfway lead in the New Zealand Open golf tournament Friday.
	   Fierce southwest wind made club selection a headache for players
at the Formosa Auckland Country Club for the second day running.
	   Seeking his first tour win, Pampling kick-started his round with
an eagle and used his considerable power to tame the par 5s for a
second round of 1-under-par 71 to get to 4-under 140.
	   Australia's Nick O'Hern shot a 68 to be tied in second spot with
New Zealander Matthew Lane, who shot 69.
	   However, the New Zealand bid for a third consecutive Open crown
is strong, with Michael Campbell and first-round leader Phil
Tataurangi tied in third place a shot further back.
	   Tataurangi said the leaders' sub-par rounds in the afternoon
were sensational given the wind.
	   ``Every shot takes twice as much concentration,'' Campbell said.
``It just beats you up.''
	   Pampling finished sixth at last week's Australian Open with a
total of 292, including two rounds of one-under 71.
	   O'Hern, who hits the ball lower than most players, succeeded in
the wind shooting a six-birdie round Friday.
	   ``I go out with the attitude 'hit us with whatever you've can'
and grind through it where some of the guys tend to chuck in the
towel a bit,'' said O'Hern, 30, earned a European Tour card last
month.
	   Pre-tournament favorites who succumbed to the wind and missed
the cut of 7-over par included Peter Senior, who shot a 9-over 80,
and England's Justin Rose, 18, who shot an 11-over 82 and has now
made 11 missed cuts from 11 professional starts. (rs)

Court: further detention for ex-Ukranian PM, bail possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko must
remain in jail for another month pending a money-laundering trial
unless he meets conditions for a multimillion-dollar bail next
week, his lawyer said Friday.
	   Paul Gully-Hart said the Geneva correctional court ruled in a
hearing Friday that it will accept the as yet unspecified bail if
Lazarenko, a former prime minister, can prove he got the money
legitimately.
	   Gully-Hart has proposed to the court a bail of 4 million to 5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.8 million-3.6 million).
	   If Lazarenko is released, it would be up to the court to decide
whether he will have to remain in Switzerland to face trial.
	   Gully-Hart said his client is ready to cooperate with the Swiss
authorities, but that he didn't want information he gives them to
be transmitted to the Ukrainian capital Kiev because he believes it
would be used against him for political purposes.
	   Lazarenko, detained last week as he entered Switzerland, has
admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but claims he can prove it
has no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko was charged last Friday in connection with a
``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   His supporters in Ukraine claim he is the victim of a political
campaign.
	   Lazarenko, prime minister from 1996 to 1997, was dismissed by
President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say he use the office to reap huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet
republic, but he and his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko maintains Ukrainian officials want to discredit him
before presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even
accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's centrist Hromada party fared well in parliamentary
elections this year and he was widely considered a top contender in
the future presidential race.
	   A Geneva judge, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, went to Ukraine this
week in connection with the investigation.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank, and major
Japanese lender Sakura Bank Ltd. have agreed to form a strategic
alliance by merging their securities subsidiaries, a local
newspaper said Friday.
	   Under the deal, Sakura Securities and Deutsche Securities would
merge as early as next summer, the Yomiuri, Japan's
widest-circulation daily, reported.
	   The two banks also plan to link their businesses in areas such
as asset management and the development of mutual fund-type
investment products, the report said. A formal announcement of the
tie-up was expected as soon as next week, it said.
	   A spokesman for Sakura did not rule out such an alliance, but
said no final decision has been made.
	   The move would mark the latest bid by Deutsche Bank and other
foreign financial firms to expand their presence in Japan, which
has begun to implement drastic deregulation of the banking,
brokerage and insurance industries.
	   Last month, Deutsche Bank announced plans to set up a joint
venture asset management company with Japan's Nippon Life Insurance
Co.
	   Also, Bankers Trust Corp. of the United States agreed last month
to be acquired by Deutsche Bank in a mega-deal valued at about dlrs
10.2 billion.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine labor situation
continues to improve, with the number of strikes falling slightly
from last year, labor officials said Friday.
	   Buenaventura Magsalin, chief of National Conciliation and
Mediation Board, said that as of November of this year, only 89
strikes have been reported nationwide, down from 91 work stoppages
recorded during the same period last year.
	   Magsalin said the number of workers involved in strikes also
dropped by more than a third to 32,819 during the same period.
	   He is optimistic that if the trend continues and more strikes
get resolved during the Christmas period, the country will have a
peaceful December.
	   ``We, therefore, expect to meet out target of maintaining strike
level at below the 100 mark this year,'' he said.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese finance officials are considering putting
a major lender, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., under state control after
judging the bank is insolvent, media reports said Friday.
	   Japan's central bank and the Financial Supervisory Agency
decided to consider nationalizing Nippon Credit as part of a more
drastic restructuring plan for the ailing bank, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun reported in its evening edition.
	   The bank would be the second to be put under state control
because of bad-loan troubles. The government took over the
operations of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Spokesmen for both the Bank of Japan and the Financial
Supervisory Agency, which is responsible for the banking industry,
denied the report.
	   Nippon Credit was not aware of such a plan, said a bank
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Several other media agencies, including national broadcaster
NHK, also reported that officials were moving to nationalize the
bank.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of workers at two major
conglomerates continued work stoppages Friday, protesting an
industry shakeup they said would lead to mass layoffs.
	   In a government-mediated deal struck earlier this week, Daewoo
Electronics Co. will be swapped by its parent conglomerate for
Samsung Motors Co., an auto-making subsidiary of the Samsung group.
	   Samsung Motors will be absorbed by Daewoo Motors, the nation's
No. 2 car maker, while Daewoo Electronics will be merged into
Samsung's home appliance arm, the nation's largest.
	   The dlrs 10 billion deal is part of an industrial restructuring
in which the nation's top give conglomerates _ Hyundai, Samsung,
LG, Daewoo and SK _ will spin off half of their 264 subsidiaries.
	   One industry study estimates that the restructuring will result
in up to 40,000 workers being laid off.
	   On Friday, more than 9,000 Daewoo Electronics workers at the
company's five plants put down their tools for the third straight
day. A third of them later rallied in front of their head office in
Seoul, demanding that the swap with Samsung be scrapped.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government confirmed Friday its preliminary
estimate that the adjusted unemployment rate for September was 4.5
percent, almost double June's 2.3 percent.
	   The Manpower Ministry for this city-state of 3.1 million people
issued the final figures in its quarterly report, confirming
preliminary figures given in late October by Minister Lee Boon
Yang.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
ruling party have decided to cut income taxes by 20 percent across
the board next fiscal year, Japanese newspapers reported Friday.
	   In a meeting Thursday, tax officials from the government and the
Liberal Democratic Party agreed on the measures, which will include
a maximum cut of 150,000 yen (dlrs 1,280), the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported.
	   They also agreed to cut residential taxes by 15 percent, or up
to 40,000 yen (dlrs 340), said the paper, Japan's leading business
daily.
	   News of the cuts was also carried on the front pages of three
other major Japanese newspapers.
	   But a Finance Ministry spokesman quoted Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa as saying that nothing concrete had been decided and that
government and LDP tax officials were discussing details.
	   The spokesman said a decision will be announced by the end of
next week. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The government plans to send tax reform legislation to the next
regular session of Parliament beginning in January.
	   The Nihon Keizai said the 1999 tax cuts are expected to total 4
trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion).

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Koreans winning one match, final score &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women beat defending champion
South Korea for the Asian Games badminton team gold Friday,
avenging a humiliating defeat four years ago.
	   China's world No. 3, Gong Zhichao, secured the gold with an
11-4, 11-1 trouncing of Lee Joo-hyun in the third match of the
best-of-five team final.
	   The final score was 3-1. With the outcome already certain, the
fifth match was scrapped.
	   Chinese coach Li Yongbo said the team, expected to remain
unchanged for the 2000 Olympics, has matured and improved since
South Korea's 5-0 semifinal whitewash of China on its way to gold
at the last Asian Games in 1994.
	   ``We've gone from losing to winning,'' he said. ``Our team
members have played pretty well. What makes me happy is that
they've shown maturity.''
	   Ye Zhaoying, the 1997 singles world champion, got China off to a
solid start with a hard-earned 11-9, 13-10 victory over Korea's Kim
Ji-hyun, the world No. 8.
	   ``Now that I've won the first match, the remaining matches
should not be a problem,'' the 24-year-old world No. 1 said after
her victory. ``I played well.''
	   Kim had clawed her way back from a 5-0 deficit in the first game
to level the score, only to falter and let Ye close out the game.
After fighting her way back from 5-10 down to win the second game
and the match, a delighted Ye went over to the stands to high-five
her coaches and teammates.
	   Gu Jun and Ge Fei, the Olympic and world doubles champions,
built on Ye's victory with a closely fought 15-13, 15-11 victory
over La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee.
	   Gu said the team had hoped to face South Korea in the final
following their crushing loss in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Gu and
Ge also had a two-year record of no defeats to defend.
	   Gu described the win as ``completing the duty of four years
ago.''
	   Trailing 3-0, the Koreans saved some pride when Kim Shin-young
and Yim Kyung-jin beat Zhang Ning and Tang Hetian 15-11, 15-7.
	   Indonesia, which lost to Korea 4-1 in the semis, and Japan,
which was trounced 5-0 by China, shared bronze.

 &UR; EU, Switzerland conclude package deal - at last
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union and Switzerland on
Friday agreed on a board trade accord that took years to conclude,
largely because of Swiss concerns about foreign trucks polluting
its alpine environment.
	   On the eve of an European summit in the Austrian capital, EU and
Swiss negotiators sorted out a seven-point accord dealing with
anything from better access for Swissair to EU airports to
wine-labeling to a weight limit on trucks.
	   Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti was flying to Vienna to sign
the agreement.
	   EU Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said the
agreement ``will yield many concrete benefits for European citizens
... and for businesses when it comes to market access and improved
cooperation.''
	   He said that opened ``future avenues for the European
integration of Switzerland,'' a country that has chosen not to be
part of the EU.
	   ``It puts Switzerland back on track for closer relations with
the EU.''
	   Last week, EU and Swiss negotiators lifted the key hurdle in
their talks. After four years of difficult talks, they struck a
transport deal under which the Swiss agreed to raise the weight
limit on trucks crossing the Swiss Alps to 40 tons from 28 tons by
2005.
	   Switzerland's tight restrictions, fed by environmental concerns,
long upset its neighbors _ Germany France, Austria and Italy. The
Swiss ban meant big trucks had to take North-South routes through
France and Austria, clogging highways and increasing travel times
and transportation costs.
	   ``We have reached a well-balanced package deal,'' Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel. He welcomed the better
distribution of truck traffic across the Alps between Austria and
Switzerland
	   The road-transport deal cleared the way for a wider agreement on
six other issues: air transport, free movement of people,
agriculture, research, public procurement and certification
standards.
	   In the final hours of the negotiations Wednesday, negotiators
haggled over the name of a Swiss white wine named after a small
lakeside village called Champagne.
	   The French objected to the use of that name, which is protected
in France. The Swiss argued they only followed their practice of
naming a wine after a village where it is produced.
	   They finally gave in, saying they would drop the name after a
transitional period of two years.
	   In 1992, Swiss voters rejected plans for a loose free trade
agreement with the EU. This forced the government in Bern to open
talks with Brussels on a series of bilateral agreements, to gain
access to crucial export markets.

Children, elderly, journalists donate for lion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ The plight of a mistreated lion has
touched school children, the elderly and journalists in northern
India, who have donated money to help the local zoo care for the
animal.
	   Vrinda was seized from a traveling zoo where confinement in a
cage so small he could not stand upright had resulted in painful
injuries to his spine and hind legs. Authorities at the Prince of
Wales Zoo in Lucknow had thought they would have to kill the
11-year-old lion to put him out of his misery, but now say he is
responding to drugs and ointments administered by a practitioner of
the alternative medical system of homeopathy.
	   When eight-year-old Lucknow student Pragya Mathur heard Vrinda's
story, she donated 400 rupees (dlrs 9.5) she'd saved from her
allowance for Vrinda's care.
	   ``I thought it was my duty to help out,'' Pragya said Friday.
	   Other children read about her gesture in the local newspaper,
and in the past two weeks sent in their own contributions totaling
8,500 rupees (dlrs 202), said zoo director G.P. Sharma.
	   Then the state's Monthly Journalists' Union added 10,000 rupees
(dlrs 238), and a group of senior citizens got together and sent
2,900 rupees (dlrs 69) from their pensions.

Japan stocks close sharply lower, dollar rises against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond prices and
details.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose slightly against the yen on
Friday, propped up by Japanese investors eager to buy on dips
during interday trading. Japanese stocks fell sharply.
	   The dollar bought 117.28 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.22
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level
of 117.33 yen overnight.
	   Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 402.16
points, or 2.72 percent, to finish at 14,405.64 _ the lowest close
since Nov. 19. On Thursday, the index fell 124.10 points, or 0.83
percent.
	   The U.S. currency recovered from a dip beneath the 117-yen level
as Japanese investors moved in to buy at what they saw as an
attractive price, traders said.
	   The dollar's fall in interday trading came after Bank of Japan
Governor Masaru Hayami said the U.S. currency's rate wasn't
``unreasonable'' despite its recent slide against the yen.
	   The greenback dropped further from levels in New York overnight
after Kyodo News agency reported the BOJ head said intervention in
the currency market should not occur ``too much,'' indicating a
reluctance to bolster the sagging dollar.
	   Weakness in U.S. stocks and lingering concerns over financial
problems in Latin America have also discouraged investors from
aggressively building up dollar positions, traders said.
	   The dollar fell as low as 116.85 yen and rose as high as 117.55
yen in Tokyo trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the share prices sank following
Thursday's drop on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 167.61 points.
	   Further selling was triggered by the settlement of monthly stock
future contracts, known as the special quotation, they said.
	   ``Selling accelerated, especially after the Nikkei fell below
the psychological and technical support line of 14,500,'' said
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at Chuo Securities Co.
	   Disappointment with the Japanese government's latest tax reform,
which appears to hold little benefit for middle class households,
also pushed down share prices, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 21.62 points, or 1.90 percent, to close at
1,118.16. The TOPIX lost 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, the previous
day.
	   An estimated 778 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up sharply from 360 million
shares on Thursday. Declining shares overwhelmed advancers 942 to
248, while 111 issues closed unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.160 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.180 percent, pushing its price up to 105.47 yen from 105.29 yen.

British, Irish leaders seek to break Northern Irish deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern sought Friday to get the Northern
Irish peace process back on track.
	   On the eve of the leaders' talks, Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews said they were hoping for a breakthrough that would bring
``a Christmas bonus for Ireland.''
	   The two leaders met for head-to-head talks in the Austrian
capital ahead of the year-end summit of European Union leaders.
	   Efforts to establish a political settlement to the Northern
Irish conflict have snagged on details of power-sharing
arrangements between Protestant and Catholic parties, the powers of
cross-border institutions involving the Irish Republic and when, if
ever, the outlawed IRA will give up its weapons.
	   Andrews met in London with Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam Thursday evening to prepare the Vienna talks.
	   ``It would be really good for everybody and a Christmas present
all round if we could achieve something,'' he said.

Two Pakistanis to play for gold in men's squash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Amjad Khan, the 18-year-old surprise
winner of the Pakistan Open last month, trounced Hong Kong's
Abdul-Fahim Khan 9-0, 9-3, 9-3 Friday and advanced to the gold
medal match of the Asian Games squash tournament.
	   It will be an all-Pakistani final on Saturday. Zaraq Jehan
overcame Malaysia's Low Ewe-loong 10-8, 9-7, 9-0 in the other
semifinal.
	   Hong Kong and Malaysia still had gold medal chances in the
women's competition.
	   In Friday's semifinals, Hong Kong's Chiu Wing-yin defeated
Singapore's Lee Li-ling 9-0, 9-1, 9-3, and Malaysia's Nicol-Ann
David beat Singapore's Mah Li-lian 9-5, 9-1, 9-7.
	   Amjad Khan is the nephew of former world No. 1 Jansher Khan, who
elected not to defend his Pakistan Open title this year. Local fans
feared the title might fall into foreign hands for the first time,
but Amjad Khan was the unlikely hero, rising from obscurity and
beating sixth seed Graham Ryding of Canada 15-8, 11-15, 15-9,
13-15, 15-8 in the final.

Affair, divorce, now a partner swap for Russian dancers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In their nastiest confrontation, the two
Russian ice dancers once fought over a man at Spago's restaurant in
Los Angeles.
	   On Thursday, they had another highly emotional, yet more civil,
meeting. It even included an apology from the man.
	   For the first time since they swapped partners _ ending one
marriage as well as two of the most popular dance teams of all time
_ Maya Usova and Pasha Grishuk shared the same ice in a practice
session for the World Pro Championships, which start tonight at the
MCI Center.
	   ``It was really strange,'' said American Jerod Swallow, who
forms the third duo in the competition with wife Elizabeth
Punsalen. ``We were trying to concentrate.''
	   Grishuk and her new partner, Usova's ex-husband Alexander
Zhulin, and Usova and Yevgeny Platov, with whom Grishuk won two
Olympic gold medals, virtually ignored each other while running
their their routines.
	   Then they retreated to hold one of the most awkward joint press
conferences in skating memory, where a good dose of humor from
Platov, the one skater who came out of the whole thing unscathed
and unscarred, helped keep the atmosphere from turning frigid.
	   ``I was at center ice holding Maya's hand and then (the
announcer) said `Maya Usova.' I went _ Alexander Zhulin?'' said
Platov, making his eyes huge as he reinacted his double-take. ``It
was pretty funny. It's interesting.''
	   But there was also a poignant moment, an apology from Zhulin,
whose long-running affair with Grishuk under Usova's nose led to
the scene at Spago's in the early 1990s and the subsequent years of
emotional turmol that led to his divorce from Usova this year.
	   ``I just want to say we are all human, and, of course, we make
some mistakes,'' Zhulin said. ``We've done something wrong in the
past. I'm sorry for that, for Maya. And I just want to say we're
thinking about the future, new programs, just thinking about the
future, nothing about the past.''
	   The two women had little to say. Usova talked about coming here
to ``try to do our best,'' while Grishuk said: ``Whoever wins,
great, and we'll be happy for each other.''
	   ``So if we win, you'll be happy?'' quipped Platov, to another
round of laughter.
	   Happiness did indeed seem to be the theme of the moment. During
practice, Usova repeatedly flashed the smile that was missing from
her later years with Zhulin. Also, it would have been hard for
anyone to crack jokes among the four before they changed partners.
	   ``I see Maya and Yevgeny and Pasha and myself, and to me it's
seems we look more happy, more relaxed,'' Zhulin said. ``Because
it's like a new generation of life.''
	   While the four Russians bring plenty of medals to the table,
nothing beats the pedigree of the women's field at the event, which
is open to all skaters _ professional and Olympic-eligible _ for
the first time in its 26-year history.
	   Olympic silver medalist Michelle Kwan will debut a long program,
which includes seven triple jumps, that she'll use later this
season at the U.S. nationals and the World Championships.
	   Lu Chen and Nicole Bobek, the two other Olympic-eligibles in the
field, are used to that kind of competition, but it almost seems
unfair to veteran pros Oksana Baiul, Yuka Sato and Katarina Witt,
who barely does a triple jump these days.
	   ``I'm more excited to skate with Michelle than against
Michelle,'' Witt said. ``Because this is not a competition I win. I
have to be honest about this.''
	   Among the men, world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia,
five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge and 1996 U.S. winner Rudy
Galindo face Canada's Browning, who has dominated the pro level the
last three years.
	   The pairs features Olympic champions Oksana Kazakova and Artur
Dmitriev of Russia, and bronze medalists Mandy Wotzel and Ingo
Steuer of Germany.

Official: Ukraine to receive EU loan after resumption of IMF aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Union will provide Ukraine
with a loan worth dlrs 182 million as soon as the country meets
guidelines set by the International Monetary Fund, a government
official was quoted as saying Friday.
	   The EU and Ukraine have already finalized the terms of the loan,
but it will only be released after the IMF restarts the flow of its
own aid package, Tamara Solianyk, of the National Agency for
Reconstruction and Development, told the independent Ukrainian News
agency.
	   The IMF suspended the latest disbursement of its dlrs 2.2
billion loan package to Ukraine last month because of the
government's poor tax collection and lack of reforms in key
economic sectors.
	   Government officials have said the next installment of the
fund's three-year aid package, approved in September, will probably
not be provided before February.
	   Ukraine applied to the European Union in October for a loan to
support its national currency, the hryvna, and boost reserves of
foreign cash after the hryvna was sharply devalued following
economic crisis in Russia, Ukraine's major trading partner.
	   The government in the former Soviet republic had originally
hoped to receive ECU 50 million (dlrs 60.6 million) of the loan by
the end of the year.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign aid to replenish its hard currency
reserves, which now total dlrs 1 billion, because it doesn't have
nearly enough money to pay off its foreign debt obligations for
1999.

Kazakstan brings pause to Chinese medal haul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan's canoeing team brought a
short pause Friday to China's rapid-fire gold medal collection at
the Asian Games, winning five races within about an hour.
	   But even on the canoeing course, China won the last two races of
the day. Then it took a shooting gold.
	   That boosted the Chinese gold total early on the fifth day of
competition to 53, far ahead of Japan's 21 and South Korea's 20.
They were expecting more from swimming and weightlifting.
	   Kazakstan's five golds brought its total to 11, fourth in the
standings.
	   Tatyana Sergina had to come from behind in the first of the
day's 500-meter races, beating Japan's Sayuri Maruyama by 0.13
seconds in the one-woman kayaks.
	   In another close race, Kazakstan's Dmitriy Torlopov and Dmitriy
Kaltenberger took an early lead and held off China's Fang Lei and
Wang Cuizhong by 0.21 seconds in two-man kayaks.
	   Konstantin Negodyayev and Sergey Sergeyev, the gold medalists at
1,000 meters, also won in two-man canoes at 500 meters, nearly four
seconds ahead of South Korea's Jun Kwang-rak and Park Chang-kyu.
	   Kaisar Nurmaganbetov won his gold by nearly 11 seconds over
Uzbekistan's Dmitriy Kovalenko in one-man canoes, and Yevgeniy
Yegorov won the one-man kayak race, 1:49.52 to 1:54.15 over
Uzbekistan's Anton Ryahov.
	   China won the two- and four-women kayak races. Gao Beibei and
Zhong Hongyan beat the Kazak pair of Natalya Sergeyeva and singles
winner Sergina by 1:54.64 to 1:57.28.
	   In the four-woman kayaks, China was 1.61 seconds ahead of
Uzbekistan.
	   Off the playing fields, Indian team leader Gurudayl Singh Mander
shrugged off criticism of his organization by world champion
billiards player Geet Sethi.
	   Sethi was angry that the Indian track suits for the games have
been slow to arrive and lashed out in an interview with the
newspaper Indian Express, suggesting the team was dressed like
``beggars.''
	   Sethi told the Indian Express that said competing at the Games
was a source of great pride but he ``must say I'm totally disgusted
that we have come here so ill-prepared.''
	   Sethi said bought his own track suit and T-shirts in Bangkok and
had been using those because the official uniforms had failed to
arrive.
	   Mander said the team had official uniforms which they wore at
the opening ceremony on Sunday. He admitted Friday that not all
track suits had arrived from destinations in India.
	   Mander has the power to sanction Sethi, who is making his Asian
Games debut along with his sport here, but said he had spoken with
the player and no action was expected.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dora Mikhailova's pulse quickens when she tugs
open the steel door to her local pharmacy and approaches the
counter to ask for her next batch of insulin.
	   It's no longer just a question of how much the price has gone
up. It's a question of whether there will be any left at all.
	   Russia produces very little insulin, leaving its 2.2 million
diabetics reliant upon imports. But imports have become
prohibitively expensive since the government devalued the ruble in
August when the economic crisis hit.
	   Officials estimate Russia has a month or two of insulin supplies
left.
	   Diabetics aren't the only ones worried: Before August, about 90
percent of medicine in Russia was imported or made from imported
materials, according to the Health Ministry.
	   ``We'll survive without Uncle Ben's (imported rice),'' said
Mikhailova, a 55-year-old telephone operator, after the pharmacist
gave her five days worth of insulin instead of the month's supply
her prescription calls for. ``But without insulin?''
	   Mikhailova could fall into a life-threatening coma within days
if she does not get the medicine.
	   Russia has never had much of a pharmaceutical industry. Czarist
and then Soviet regimes relied on medicine producers in satellite
countries, such as Poland and the Baltics.
	   With the demise of the Soviet bloc, Russia lost cheap access to
those medicines, while drug companies from around the world
discovered a vast new market in Russia with virtually no domestic
competition.
	   The cash-starved government has promised to ensure crucial
medicines, including insulin, even if that means costly imports.
But that will also mean skimping on things such as salaries at
hospitals and other parts of Russia's disintegrating health care
system.
	   Long before the Soviet collapse, patients were sometimes told to
bring their own anesthesia, bandages, even plaster for casts if
they wanted to be treated. Poorly paid doctors regularly demand
bribes for basic procedures.
	   ``In fact, the crisis didn't change anything. It just
highlighted the situation,'' said Yuri Katlinsky, head of the
Health Ministry's medicine department.
	   Facing sharply devalued wages or extended wage delays, many
Russians are no longer buying aspirin or are forgoing anesthesia
for minor surgery, said Margarita Pudnikova of the International
Federation of the Red Cross.
	   There have been no signs of hoarding or panic medicine buying,
but that's partly because pharmacies don't have or won't sell more
than a few doses at a time. Still, lines sometimes form outside
pharmacies before they open, on rumors that they have a new
shipment.
	   Several times a day, Dr. Ivan Ignatkov, head of the Russian
Diabetes Association, receives a phone call from an alarmed mother
or diabetes patient saying their pharmacy has run out of insulin.
He moans sympathetically, then instructs them to come to his
office, where he has a limited supply of samples from foreign drug
companies.
	   ``What kind of system is this?'' he asked heatedly, hanging up
after yet another phone call. ``Our country can build rockets. ...
Why don't we have normal health care?''
	   The solution, most agree, is for Russia to develop a
pharmaceutical industry. But that means starting from scratch.
Russia's few drug companies rely largely on imported raw materials.
	   Mikhailova, like all Russia's insulin-dependent diabetics, is
supposed to get her insulin free. Rarely has she been so fortunate.
	   In a familiar pattern, $30 million was allocated by the
government for diabetics this year, but just $420,000 had been
released as of Oct. 31, Ignatkov said.
	   In Soviet times, Mikhailova said, she knew to bring a bottle of
cognac if she wanted good insulin. In recent years, cash has proved
more effective.
	   A few months ago, it cost her 66 rubles ($11) for a month's
supply. Now, because of the devaluation in the ruble, it costs her
220 rubles (the equivalent of $11 at today's exchange rate), no
small change for Mikhailova, with her 1,200-ruble ($60) monthly
salary.
	   Twice the pharmacist has told her there was no insulin at all.
The first time, Mikhailova said, she broke down in tears _ and the
exhausted pharmacist did, too.
	   Katlinsky is pinning his hopes on foreign investment. Ignatkov,
his eye on the immediate future, wants foreign aid.
	   The European Union, Red Cross and foreign drug companies are
providing some medicine. However, Katlinsky warned, many aid
shipments are past their expiration date.
	   In addition, he estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of
medicine aid is misappropriated. ``Corruption is no secret in our
country,'' he said.
	   At a recent pharmaceutical trade show, most attendees appeared
to be seeking personal medical advice or looking for free samples
instead of placing bulk orders.

Asian version of `Planet Hollywood' in financial trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A restaurant billed as Asia's answer to Planet
Hollywood has been placed under court management less than a year
after opening, the latest casualty of the region's economic crisis.
	   Celebrities Asia opened last Dec. 19 to much media ado about the
Asian stars who have ownership in the restaurant and donated
personal belongings for display in it. There was even talk of
establishing branches in other Asian countries.
	   Last week, the restaurant was placed under court control with
debts of more than 1 million Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 600,000),
general manager Henry Pang said in an interview with The Straits
Times.
	   The 11,000-square-foot restaurant was used by stars to launch
music albums or announce other projects.
	   But as the economic crisis deepened, Singaporeans cut back on
expensive dining, and fewer tourists arrived from other Asian
countries.
	   Meanwhile, the businessmen who had promised to bankroll the
restaurant found they didn't have the money because the crisis had
hit their own enterprises, Pang said in The Straits Times.
	   The court management ``gives us time to turn things around,
instead of having to deal with the creditors on a daily basis,''
Pang was quoted as saying.
	   A new management team has been brought in, a lower rent has been
negotiated for next year and a disco is to open in the restaurant
later this month to celebrate the one-year anniversary.

Search on for best athlete of Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Will the Asian Games' MVP please stand
up and be counted? There's a check waiting for you.
	   Games organizers have pledged a significant dlrs 100,000 prize
for the best performance during the 15-day sporting event. But with
six days gone, no one athlete has risen above his or her peers,
leaving the games without an identifiable star.
	   There have been multiple world records in weightlifting events,
but separating the competitors involved would be an impossible
task.
	   Japanese marathon runner Naoko Takahashi, who won the first of
377 gold medals at the Games, probably has the best claim on the
prize so far.
	   Takahashi was on world record pace through 20 kilometers (12
miles) of the 42.195-kilometer (26-mile, 385-yard) event before
missing the record by a minute. Her performance in 30-degree (90 F)
heat was exceptional, however, and she beat the next runner by 13
minutes.
	   Organizing committee BAGOC has set up a committee to oversee the
award and will ask reporters covering the games to cast votes.
	   The prize money will be awarded to the winning athlete's
national Olympic committee to be used for future expenses. Rules
prevent the athlete from receiving the money directly.
	   ``This award will provide even more motivation for athletes to
succeed at the games,'' said BAGOC committee member Charouck
Arirachakaran.
	   The track and field competition, usually the centerpiece of a
games, will start Sunday with several MVP contenders in action,
including Sri Lanka's world championship 200-meter silver medalist
Susantika Jayasinghe and Japan's Koji Ito, the Asian record holder
for the men's 100- and 200-meter events.
	   The soccer competition has attracted the most fans so far and a
hat trick in the final would also put a strong claim on the BAGOC
riches.

Yeltsin goes to Kremlin to meet several top aides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Days after purging several of his closest
lieutenants, President Boris Yeltsin ventured today into his
Kremlin office where he planned to meet several top aides, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Yeltsin has been at a country residence, about 60 miles outside
Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released from the hospital
after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has handed over responsibility for solving the country's economic
problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Today is the first time Yeltsin has gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   The ITAR-Tass report gave no other information about Yeltsin's
plans for today.
	   Russia is in the midst of its worst economic crisis since the
fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The government badly needs a cash
infusion to pay its bills, but a $22.6 billion loan package put
together by the International Monetary Fund has been frozen since
Russia defaulted on its debts in August and devalued the ruble.

Australian Cricket Board announces new inquiry after bookmaker
</HEADLINE>
revelations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's top cricketers will be
called before an independent inquiry into players' links with
bookmakers following revelations that two test players sold
information to an Indian bookmaker.
	   Australian Cricket Board (ACB) chairman Denis Rogers said Friday
that all 25 contracted players _ including Waugh and Warne _ would
be interviewed as part of the investigation, expected to be headed
by a judge or other independent official.
	   Rogers said the ACB wanted to know whether any other cricketers
had been involved with bookmakers, after former Australian spinner
Greg Matthews and ex-New Zealand fast bowler Danny Morrison
revealed they had also been approached to provide information.
	   ``Two former players said today they were approached by
bookmakers for information, what I want to clear up is that there
are no other sleepers in the Australian team in that context,''
Rogers said.
	   ``I think the right thing to do is expand our level of inquiry
to make sure that there aren't any sleepers about.
	   ``I have a responsibility to instigate something that clears it
once and for all.''
	   Test players Shane Warne and Mark Waugh plunged Australian
cricket into a
	   humiliating crisis Wednesday when they admitted to taking money
from an Indian bookmaker for providing information on pitch and
weather conditions during a 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   Waugh and Warne, who are among Australia most popular and
highest-paid players, said they were ``naive and stupid'' for
taking the money, but have denied any involvement in match fixing
or bribery.
	   The ACB was forced to go public this week and reveal it had
fined Waugh 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and Warne
8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) over the matter, and had
asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to keep it quiet.
	   The revelations have shaken the cricket world and are almost
certain to force the ICC to address the subject of illegal betting
in the sport at its meeting next month in Christchurch, New
Zealand.
	   Waugh was a crucial witness in a judicial hearing against former
Pakistan
	   captain Salim Malik, who Australian players have claimed
approached Waugh, Warne and Tim May to play badly in 1994. Malik
has denied the claims.
	   Earlier Friday, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on the ACB to
release all information on Waugh and Warne's role in the betting
scandal.
	   ``We would like the Australian Cricket Board to place all the
cards on the table, which would mean we would like to know exactly
what happened, when did it happen, and what are the other
associated details,'' PCB chief executive Khalid Mahood told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio from Lahore.
	   Rogers, speaking publicly on the issue for the first time,
defended the ACB's silence on the matter for almost four years but
said if he had been chairman it may have been handled differently.
	   ``I want to apologize to the Australian public, especially the
kids,'' Rogers said.

Long-ignored merchant seamen win measure of recognition from
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Caught up in patriotic fervor but kept out of
the Army and Navy for less-than-perfect eyesight, Francis Coughlin
wanted to serve his country. So he became a merchant seamen,
helping deliver coal to freezing Italians in the winter of 1945.
	   ``We sailed up the Adriatic Sea to Venice,'' recalled Coughlin,
71, a doctor and lawyer in New Canaan, Connecticut. ``We passed
mines ... that could have destroyed our ship. We fired on them with
rifles because they were in the seaway.''
	   Some mariners died at sea even after the Japanese surrendered on
Aug. 14, 1945.
	   But the U.S. government does not regard Coughlin or the other
3,000 surviving seamen who worked on ships carrying cargo to
war-ravaged Europe and the Pacific as full-fledged veterans.
	   That has changed, to a degree, because of a law passed last
month.
	   It extends basic burial benefits to merchant seamen who sailed
between Aug. 15, 1945, and Dec. 31, 1946, the date proclaimed as
the official end of World War II by then-President Harry S. Truman.
	   It does not confer full veteran status on the men, who will not
have access to the same health care or disability benefits
available to the nation's 6.3 million surviving World War II
veterans.
	   But by providing a flag, a grave marker and burial in a national
cemetery, it conveys something that mariners want more than money
or health care: recognition that they served their country with
honor.
	   ``These men want be able to look at their grandchildren and say,
`I'm a veteran of World War II. I served my country in a different
way,''' said Thomas Fraley of Cape Coral, Florida, secretary of
American Merchant Marine Veterans.
	   The 1945-46 group was left out 10 years ago, when a federal
court ruled that Merchant Marine veterans of World War II should be
granted veterans' status.
	   The Air Force, in charge of implementing the rule, imposed a
service cutoff date of Aug. 15, 1945 _ even though the December
1946 date is recognized by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
as the cutoff for veterans' status for the Army, Navy, Marines and
Coast Guard.
	   Merchant seamen were being recruited as late as May 1946 to
bring supplies to occupation forces throughout the world, according
to the mariners.
	   ``They were left out in the cold,'' said Lawrence Brooks, 71, of
Wareham, Massachusetts, who joined the Merchant Marine in 1944.
	   In 1936, the Merchant Marine was created to carry cargo and
serve as a military auxiliary in time of war. Two years later, with
war on the horizon, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the
mass production of Liberty ships to carry war supplies and
established the U.S. Maritime Service, now defunct, to train
seamen.
	   Not everyone agrees that mariners _ classified as civilians even
when their ships were under military control during war and they
received gunnery training _ should be veterans.
	   The 2.1-million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars opposed
veterans' status for World War II mariners.
	   VFW spokesman Bob Manhan acknowledges the crucial role mariners
played in the Allied victory by moving supplies. But they also were
not subject to the draft, were sometimes better paid and could
volunteer _ or not _ for risky missions.
	   ``I'm not going to say they didn't run some horrible risks,''
Manhan said. ``However, members of the military service never had
the option not to volunteer for a hazardous assignment such as Iwo
Jima or Normandy.''
	   For mariners, the casualty figures provide grim evidence that
many were in harm's way.
	   About 6,800 of the 215,000 World War II mariners were killed, a
death rate of nearly 3.2 percent, mariners' groups estimate. That
is a higher rate than for the Army, Navy or Marines, although those
services sustained much higher fatalities.
	   Some mariners are pressing the Civilian Military Service Review
Board for full veterans' status for the 1945-46 group.

Hong Kong shares prices down sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Friday, with
the key index losing 3.5 percent on the back of overnight falls on
Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 363.44 points, closing at 9,952.00. On Thursday, the index had
slipped 45.85 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
730 million), up from Thursday's 4.02 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 515 million).
	   Brokers said overall ``bearish sentiment across Asia'' following
an overnight slump on Wall Street dampened market sentiment. On
Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.8 percent to
8,841.58.
	   The fall in overseas markets offered an excuse for share
sell-offs in Hong Kong, said Felix Ngai, vice president of Sun Hung
Kai Commodities Ltd.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 2.50 Hong Kong dollars to
53.75, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 2.25 dollars to 54.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 8.00 dollars to
189.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.50 dollars to 66.25 dollars.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 2.50 dollars to 51.75, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.50 dollars to 35.20.

 &UR; Israel: no PNC vote, no West Bank withdrawal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israel saying it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank if the PNC does not hold a vote, Israel
rejecting compromises on prisoners; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel affirmed Friday that it will not
withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian
decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of
Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West
Bank.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council
meets on Monday in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown
with Clinton who is visiting Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement.
	   Under the accord, the annulment of the offending provisions by
the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton
is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task because
that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat informed Clinton that the
charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction were null and
void. In all, 81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement. A
key point of contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians have said Israel broke a promise to release
prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities. Israel said it never
made such a pledge, and accused the Palestinian Authority of
incitement over the prisoner issue. A week of Palestinian rioting
has left two Palestinians dead and more than a hundred injured.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   Naveh told Israel radio that only Israel decides who is to be
freed, ``and this is not a matter for negotiations.'
	   Another Netanyahu aide, David Bar-Illan, welcomed Thursday's
vote of the Palestinian Central Council, drawn up long before
Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps at a
special session of the PNC in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu has
said the PNC never completed the job. During the Wye River talks,
the Palestinians agreed to invite PNC members and delegates from
other groups to Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided with the
Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, they
don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister
during the PNC vote in 1996.

Japan's Parliament approves third extra budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament enacted a 5.7 trillion yen (dlrs
48.5 billion) supplementary budget Friday that will finance part of
a record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 205 billion) of spending on projects
to jump start the nation's moribund economy.
	   The extra budget, the third of its kind for the current fiscal
year, passed the upper house of Parliament easily with support from
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and also the Liberal and New
Komeito parties.
	   It will finance programs designed to increase the flow of bank
loans to businesses. The credit crunch that is squeezing Japan's
small companies is one of the main causes of the country's worst
recession since World War II.
	   The special budget also earmarks funds to support
crisis-stricken Asian nations and promote development of
telecommunications systems.
	   Japan originally passed a 77.7 trillion yen (dlrs 663 billion)
budget for fiscal 1998, which ends next March. An initial
supplementary budget approved in May allowed 4.6 trillion yen (dlrs
39 billion) in additional pending. A second extra budget was passed
in October guaranteeing 53 trillion yen (dlrs 452 billion) to
stabilize Japan's shaky financial system.
	   Also Friday, the House of Councillors voted to suspend a
balanced-budget law to allow the government to go deeper in debt to
pay for the extra spending.
	   The Fiscal Structural Reform Law had required government to
curtail the size of its annual debt to 3 percent or less of gross
domestic product by the end of fiscal 2005.

 &UR; Israel: no PNC vote, no West Bank withdrawal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israel saying it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank if the PNC does not hold a vote, Israel
rejecting compromises on prisoners; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel affirmed Friday that it will not
withdraw troops from the West Bank unless the top Palestinian
decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of
Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West
Bank.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council
meets on Monday in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown
with Clinton who is visiting Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement.
	   Under the accord, the annulment of the offending provisions by
the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton
is unlikely to declare that the PNC has not completed its task.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat informed Clinton that the
charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction were null and
void. In all, 81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   Both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement. A
key point of contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians have said Israel broke a promise to release
prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities. Israel said it never
made such a pledge, and accused the Palestinian Authority of
incitement over the prisoner issue. A week of Palestinian rioting
has left two Palestinians dead and more than a hundred injured.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   Naveh told Israel radio that only Israel decides who is to be
freed, ``and this is not a matter for negotiations.''
	   Another Netanyahu aide, David Bar-Illan, welcomed Thursday's
vote of the Palestinian Central Council.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps at a
special session of the PNC in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu has
said the PNC never completed the job. During the Wye River talks,
the Palestinians agreed to invite PNC members and delegates from
other groups to Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided with the
Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, they
don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister
during the PNC vote in 1996.

Presidents Cup Capsules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A capsule look at play Friday in the
Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne Golf Club:
 &UR; Alternate Shot &QC; 
	   Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner, International, def. Mark O'Meara
and David Duval, United States 1-up: Nobilo and Turner took the
lead at No. 6 when Duval blocked his tee shot over a fence. The
lead was 1-up when O'Meara hit his approach within 2 feet on No. 18
to set up a sure birdie, but Nobilo holed a 40-foot putt to win the
match.
	   Greg Norman and Steve Elkington, International, def. John Huston
and Jim Furyk, United States, 2-up: The first Presidents Cup
pairing between Australia's best two players was successful as
Norman and Elkington took the lead on the par-5 ninth. They were
1-up on the last hole when Elkington hit his approach from the
rough within 3 feet for the birdie that ended the match.
	   Shigeki Maruya and Craig Parry, International, def. Lee Janzen
and Scott Hoch, United States, 3 and 2: A successful alternate-shot
pairing in the Ryder Cup was a bust. The teams halved the first
five holes, but the International team birdied No. 6 to take the
lead. Hoch and Janzen won only two holes.
	   Tiger Woods and Fred Couples, United States, def. Ernie Els and
Vijay Singh, International, 5 and 4: The marquee match of the
morning turned into a
	   rout thanks to a superb bogey on the par-3 8th. Woods hit into a
pampas bush. Couples took a drop and hit a wedge over a tree within
8 feet, which Woods made to halve the hole. The Americans then
birdied the next two holes.
	   Davis Love III and Justin Leonard, United States, halved with
Stuart Appleby and Nick Price, International: Love and Leonard were
2-up through 11 holes before dropping two of the next three holes
with a bogey and a double. They salvaged a tie when Leonard hit his
approach on No. 18 within 6 feet.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Best Ball &QC; 
	   Norman and Elkington, International, def. O'Meara and Furyk,
United States, 2 and 1: One of the best-played matches of the first
day. Norman started with a birdie and an eagle, O'Meara answered
with two birdies, and Elkington gave International a lead with a
birdie at No. 5. The lead stood the rest of the way, but never was
more than 2-up.
	   Maruyama and Joe Ozaki, International, def. Huston and Mark
Calcavecchia, United States, 4 and 3: Calcavecchia birdied the
first two holes, but it went downhill from there. The Japanese won
the next four holes, let by 4 at the turn and wound up with the
most lopsided International victory.
	   Duval and Phil Mickelson, United States, halved with Els and
Price, International: Mickelson was sharp with the putter as the
Americans took the lead on the seventh hole. They did not give up
the lead until Price made a 6-foot birdie putt on 18th and Duval
missed his 10-foot attempt.
	   Couples and Love, United States, def. Parry and Carlos Franco,
International, 1-up: Another great moment by Couples in the
Presidents Cup. The Americans did not lead the end. Couples birdied
the 11th, birdied the 16th to tie it, then hit his approach within
2 feet on No. 18 to set up the winning birdie.
	   Singh and Appleby, International, def. Leonard and Woods, United
States, 2 and 1: Singh broke a tie with a birdie on the par-3 11th.
Woods answered with birdie on No. 13, but the Americans bogeyed No.
14 to drop behind for good. Singh closed out the match with the
team's eighth birdie.

For Thais, royal bloodlines matter most
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two foreign princes are unknowingly
adding to the Asian Games organizers' worries by their presence
since for many Thais, anyone with a royal bloodline is a demigod.
	   ``No go, no go,'' whispered a Thai policewoman at the snooker
hall. ``Prince sitting there. You no go.'' Prince Tunku Imran of
Malaysia was watching a match.
	   Traffic is either stopped or diverted whenever the tunku or
Japan's Prince Tomohito hops from one Asian Games venue to the
other.
	   At a snooker final when Malaysian star Sam Chong was playing,
police went on alert when Imram, second son of Malaysian King Tunku
Ja'afar, arrived. After he took his seat, police blocked the area.
For Imran, who owns a sprawling business empire, cricket is his
first love, but he sat for three hours to watch his subject
playing.
	   When Tomohito, a nephew of the late Emperor Hirohito, arrived at
the same venue, Thai organizers advised spectators, including news
photographers not to turn their backs.
	   Thai hold their king in very high esteem and the media
guidebooks at the games caution visitors not to show any form of
disrespect.
	   ``The Thai people have a deep traditional reverence for their
royal family, and a visitor should also be careful to show respect
for the king, the queen and the royal children,'' the guide
advises.
	   King Bhumibol, a constitutional monarch who celebrated his 71st
birthday on Dec. 5, is the longest reigning monarch in the world,
with 52 years on the throne.
	   The 38-year-old Tomohito, on the other hand, caused a sensation
in 1982 by trying unsuccessfully to quit the imperial family by
renouncing his ties to the throne and living as a commoner.
	   Popularly known as the ``Bearded Prince'' after his well-groomed
facial hair in a nation where few young men sport beards, he has
devoted much of his time to social work with the physically
handicapped.
	   In 1989, the Weekly Yomiuri magazine quoted the prince as
complaining about motorcades and over-protective security.
	   ``As a member of the imperial family, I believe that the
security escorts should be kept at a minimum so that they will not
bother the lives of the public,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   His late uncle Hirohito, father of current Emperor Akihito,
renounced his formerly divine status after Japan's defeat in World
War II.

Poland's death toll reaches 100 from fierce cold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost four weeks of
sub-freezing temperatures in Poland has reached 100, almost double
that from all of last winter, police said.
	   The latest victim, a 68-year-old man, died Wednesday night when
he passed out from alcohol on the way home from a bar in Kamionki
Stare, near Czestochowa, 124 miles south of Warsaw.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 4.
	   While the homeless have an especially tough time, police
spokesman Pawel Biedziak said most of the victims have been men
ages 40 to 60, who had homes but were drinking before they died.
	   Police say 54 cold-related deaths were recorded last winter.

Ma's army missing, but China still strong

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Chinese athletes who thrived on
turtle blood soup and caterpillar fungus aren't here, so there
won't be any of Ma Junren's magic.
	   But the Asian Games' track and field events opening Sunday may
still see domination of China over Japan and South Korea, with Sri
Lanka capturing medals in the women's events and others picking up
ones or twos.
	   China did not field all its top athletes at the Asian
championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in September but still ran away
with 26 golds from 43 events, far ahead of Japan's six. Qatar had
three and Kazakstan and Sri Lanka two each. Chinese women finished
with 17 in all.
	   Of the 43 track and field golds in the last Asian Games in
Hiroshima four years ago, China took 22. At Bangkok, there might be
only a little variation in that Chinese script.
	   But the Chinese success at Hiroshima was overshadowed by 11
athletes _ including seven swimmers _ failing drug tests.
	   To keep its reputation clean in Bangkok, China carried out more
than 500 drug tests in the month before the games, with at least
one unnamed athlete returning a positive test. Almost 3,000 drug
tests in 20 sports have been taken in China this year, said Shi
Kangcheng, deputy secretary of China's Asian Games delegation.
	   Though Chinese officials say that ``Ma's army'' was not included
in the 1998 team because its runners did not turn up at training
camps, there had been suspicions that maybe more than a regimen of
high-altitude training, daily marathons and herbal concoctions
accounted for their speed.
	   Ma has attributed his runner's success to that training and a
special diet of herbal tonics, turtle blood soup and caterpillar
fungus. Competitors accused runners coached by Ma of using
performance-enhancing concoctions after they demolished a slew of
world records in 1993 _ allegations that were never proven.
	   Bangkok's hot, sultry weather will be a factor at track and
field, especially in distance events, where the Sri Lankans and
Indians may have some edge.
	   The Chinese medal hunt at Bangkok is being led by sprinter Yan
Jiankui, a double gold medalist at the Asian track championships.
There, Yan edged teammate Huang Mei 23.00 seconds to 23.21 in the
200 meters, adding that gold to her 100-meter victory.
	   Another to watch from China is Li Xuemei, who set the Asian
records of 10.79 in the 100 meters and 22.01 in the 200 in meets in
China last year. She is in Bangkok and preparing.
	   While unlikely to challenge China's overall supremacy, the
Japanese and the Qataris can take medals in some of the men's
events. The Kazaks and Uzbeks can cause some upsets.
	   For Japan, Koji Ito will seek to repeat his performance in
Fukuoka, where he edged China's Han Chaoming by 0.07 second in the
200 meters, winning in 20.70.
	   At a home meet in October, Ito equaled the Asian record of 10.08
in the 100 meters, and set an Asian mark of 20.16 in the 200.
	   Another Japanese, Toshinari Takaoka, who beat India's Gulab
Chand by more than a second in the 5,000 in Fukuoka, is also a
medal prospect.
	   Chinese women's triple jumper Ren Ruiping, who came 0.55 meters
short of her 2-year-old Asian record of 14.66 at Fukuoka, is
difficult to beat.
	   China can no longer take the men's throws for granted. Though it
swept the golds in Hiroshima, it could gather only two of the four
at Fukuoka.
	   Sri Lanka, a small island nation off India's southern coast, is
expected to gain medals from the running of Sugath Tillakeratne,
Damayanthi Darsha and Susantika Jayasinghe. The color of the
medals, however, is in doubt.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Tanzanian President Benjamin
William Mkapa began a three-day visit to Malaysia on Friday to
discuss trade and investment with officials here.
	   The president, accompanied by his wife, Anna Mkapa, and other
senior government officials, received an official welcome at

Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mkapa later inspected an honor guard of 107 mounted army
officers.
	   He was scheduled for an hour-long meeting with Mahathir later in
the afternoon, which would focus on trade between the countries.
	   Over the next two days, Mkapa will visit government agencies,
including the Economic Planning Unit, the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority and the Palm Oil Research Institute of
Malaysia.
	   The Tanzanian leader will also meet with local businessmen and
visit the world's tallest skyscraper, the 88-floor Petronas Twin
Towers.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top prosecutor, the man who was
investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, has
himself been abducted by unidentified assailants, officials said
Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening as he returned to
Chechnya's capital city of Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said Tagirov was seized by
attackers, and they speculated that it was the work of an armed
band seeking the release of one of their colleagues from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man who they claimed had confessed to
kidnapping the four foreigners. The suspect was identified as Apti
Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching Friday for
additional suspects as well as the the bodies of the four
foreigners.
	   Atgeriyev also said he did not place any value in a videotape
that showed one of the four victims saying he was spying for
Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been
sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the
breakaway republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the government
got it.
	   Great Britain's Embassy in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape,
spokesman Michael Haddock said on Friday.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top prosecutor, the man who was
investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, has
himself been abducted by unidentified assailants, officials said
Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening as he returned to
Chechnya's capital city of Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said Tagirov was seized by
attackers, and they speculated that it was the work of an armed

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko must
remain in jail for another month pending a money-laundering trial
unless he meets conditions for a multimillion-dollar bail next
week, his lawyer said Friday.
	   Paul Gully-Hart said the Geneva criminal court ruled in a
hearing Friday that it will accept the as yet unspecified bail if
Lazarenko, a former prime minister, can prove he got the money
legitimately.
	   Gully-Hart has proposed to the court a bail of 4 million to 5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.8 million-3.6 million).
	   ``The court isn't convinced about the origin of the money so I
am going to do what is necessary,'' said Gully-Hart.
	   If Lazarenko is released, it would be up to the court to decide
whether he will have to remain in Switzerland to face trial, he
added.
	   Gully-Hart said his client is ready to cooperate with the Swiss
authorities, but that he didn't want information he gives them to
be transmitted to the Ukrainian capital Kiev because he believes it
would be used against him for political purposes.
	   Three Swiss cantons (states) are investigating Lazarenko, and
the Geneva investigating judge is in the Ukraine this week.
	   Gully-Hart said he had already made arrangements for Lazarenko
to be interviewed by the Zurich investigating judge next week.
	   ``Mr. Lazarenko must answer the questions as soon as possible,
and I think the situation can be sorted out very quickly,'' he
said.
	   ``I am personally convinced that he has not committed any crime
in Switzerland.''
	   Lazarenko, detained last week as he entered Switzerland, has
admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but claims he can prove it
has no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko was charged last Friday in connection with a
``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   His supporters in Ukraine claim he is the victim of a political
campaign.
	   Lazarenko, prime minister from 1996 to 1997, was dismissed by
President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say he use the office to reap huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet
republic, but he and his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko maintains Ukrainian officials want to discredit him
before presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even
accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's centrist Hromada party fared well in parliamentary
elections this year and he was widely considered a top contender in
the future presidential race.

Ukrainian teen-ager dies after being shot by police chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian teen-ager who was shot by a
city police chief two weeks ago has died of his wounds, a newspaper
said Friday.
	   Andriy Shevchenko, 17, died in a hospital in Sevastopol, in
Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, the daily Segodnya newspaper said.
	   The incident began when Sevastopol Interior Ministry branch
chief Lt. Gen. Vivat Biloborodov detained Shevchenko and his friend
Andriy Zolotov, also 17, on the outskirts of the city on suspicion
of theft.
	   The two teen-agers, who had electric appliances in their
possession, allegedly attacked Biloborodov and tried to seize his
pistol, according to police.
	   Biloborodov fired in response, killing Zolotov instantly and
seriously wounding Shevchenko in the chest, according to police
accounts. The general was injured in the scuffle and hospitalized.
	   The prosecutor's office in Sevastopol is conducting an
investigation into the shooting to determine whether Biloborodov's
use of the weapon was justified.
	   Biloborodov is now believed to be the only living witness and
the investigation may be dropped, Segodnya said.

Nobilo, Turner make captain look like a genius
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ One putt made Peter Thomson look
like a genius.
	   Thomson, the International team captain in the Presidents Cup,
raised eyebrows when he decided to spend his wild-card selections
on a couple of Kiwis _ Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner of New Zealand.
	   On Friday, Nobilo raised the roof at Royal Melbourne.
	   With the American pairing of Mark O'Meara and David Duval
staring at a 2-foot birdie to tie the match, Nobilo rammed home a
12-meter (40-ft) birdie putt from the fringe that secured a 1-up
victory and sent the International team on their way to 7-3 lead
after Day One.
	   ``I was thrilled with the way they pulled it off this morning,''
Thomson said. ``They beat two wonderful names there, and in a way,
it justified my picking them. That's not a big issue. They've still
got to win tomorrow, and hopefully on Sunday.
	   ``Until then, I'm vulnerable.''
	   If Nobilo and Turner can put together another brilliant
alternate-shot match Saturday, that won't be a problem, either.
	   Conventional wisdom suggested that Thomson would spend his two
captain's picks on a couple of Australians, which would give the
International team even more local knowledge at Royal Melbourne.
Robert Allenby was among the players almost everyone figured he
would take.
	   But Thomson went with Nobilo, who was on the past two Presidents
Cup teams, and Turner, his longtime partner in World Cup of Golf
tournaments.
	   Nobilo has won only once on the U.S. PGA Tour, although he has a
short history of playing his best in the major championships.
Turner, who went to the University of Oklahoma, has never won in
America but had been playing well in Europe the latter part of the
season.
	   Both are free spirits, not about to back down from any challenge
_ even playing the first Presidents Cup match against the top two
Americans this year _ O'Meara, the Masters and British Open
champion and player of the year, and Duval, a four-time winner and
leading money-winner.
	   ``I think it's a tough thing for a captain to pick two guys,''
Nobilo said. ``No matter who he picked, it was going to be a tough
thing, so throwing us together meant we had a lot to prove. We
could have had a slightly easier draw.''
	   Instead, they made it look easy. They never trailed in the
match, taking the lead when Duval's tee shot on the sixth hole
sailed over a fence and onto a city street.
	   Nobilo put his tee shot in the fairway on the 18th hole, then
gave Turner some bad advice _ he had a 7-iron in his hand, and
Nobilo thought he should hit a 6-iron.
	   ``With that pin there, you can't afford to be short, so I was
happy enough to go with that,'' Turner said. ``So when I hit up the
back there, I thought, 'Well, you goosed me, Frank. You better make
the damn thing.'''
	   No worries, mate.
	   After Nobilo looked over the putt, his caddie reminded him that
Wayne Riley made a similar putt to win the Australian Open.
	   ``It puts you in a good frame of mind,'' Nobilo said. ``I hit
that putt beautifully, and the hole just sucked it in.''
	   O'Meara and Duval both looked on in disbelief as Nobilo pumped
his fist and the roar from the gallery resounded across Royal
Melbourne.
	   ``In the back of my mind, I thought Frank might make that
putt,'' O'Meara said. ``In this type of format, you can never
underestimate your opponent.''
	   Nobilo and Turner sat out the afternoon best-ball matches _ not
a bad idea since Nobilo has never won a best-ball match. But hours
after the biggest putt of the day, the satisfaction was still on
his bearded face.
	   ``The thing with Kiwis is we will nip at someone's heels all day
for 18 holes,'' Nobilo said. ``And eventually, we will take the leg
off.''

Crisis reveals Russia's dangerous reliance on imported medicines
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dora Mikhailova's pulse quickens when she tugs
open the steel door to her local pharmacy and approaches the
counter to ask for her next batch of insulin.
	   It's no longer just a question of how much the price has gone
up. It's a question of whether there will be any left at all.
	   Russia produces very little insulin, leaving its 2.2 million
diabetics reliant upon imports. But imports have become
prohibitively expensive since the government devalued the ruble in
August when the economic crisis hit.
	   Officials estimate Russia has a month or two of insulin supplies
left.
	   Diabetics aren't the only ones worried: Before August, about 90
percent of medicine in Russia was imported or made from imported
materials, according to the Health Ministry.
	   ``We'll survive without Uncle Ben's (imported rice),'' said
Mikhailova, a 55-year-old telephone operator, after the pharmacist
gave her five days worth of insulin instead of the month's supply
her prescription calls for. ``But without insulin?''
	   Mikhailova could fall into a life-threatening coma within days
if she does not get the medicine.
	   Russia has never had much of a pharmaceutical industry. Czarist
and then Soviet regimes relied on medicine producers in satellite
countries, such as Poland and the Baltics.
	   With the demise of the Soviet bloc, Russia lost cheap access to
those medicines, while drug companies from around the world
discovered a vast new market in Russia with virtually no domestic
competition.
	   The cash-starved government has promised to ensure crucial
medicines, including insulin, even if that means costly imports.
But that will also mean skimping on things such as salaries at
hospitals and other parts of Russia's disintegrating health care
system.
	   Long before the Soviet collapse, patients were sometimes told to
bring their own anesthesia, bandages, even plaster for casts if
they wanted to be treated. Poorly paid doctors regularly demand
bribes for basic procedures.
	   ``In fact, the crisis didn't change anything. It just
highlighted the situation,'' said Yuri Katlinsky, head of the
Health Ministry's medicine department.
	   Facing sharply devalued wages or extended wage delays, many
Russians are no longer buying aspirin or are forgoing anesthesia
for minor surgery, said Margarita Pudnikova of the International
Federation of the Red Cross.
	   There have been no signs of hoarding or panic medicine buying,
but that's partly because pharmacies don't have or won't sell more
than a few doses at a time. Still, lines sometimes form outside
pharmacies before they open, on rumors that they have a new
shipment.
	   Several times a day, Dr. Ivan Ignatkov, head of the Russian
Diabetes Association, receives a phone call from an alarmed mother
or diabetes patient saying their pharmacy has run out of insulin.
He moans sympathetically, then instructs them to come to his
office, where he has a limited supply of samples from foreign drug
companies.
	   ``What kind of system is this?'' he asked heatedly, hanging up
after yet another phone call. ``Our country can build rockets. ...
Why don't we have normal health care?''
	   The solution, most agree, is for Russia to develop a
pharmaceutical industry. But that means starting from scratch.
Russia's few drug companies rely largely on imported raw materials.
	   Mikhailova, like all Russia's insulin-dependent diabetics, is
supposed to get her insulin free. Rarely has she been so fortunate.
	   In a familiar pattern, dlrs 30 million was allocated by the
government for diabetics this year, but just dlrs 420,000 had been
released as of Oct. 31, Ignatkov said.
	   In Soviet times, Mikhailova said, she knew to bring a bottle of
cognac if she wanted good insulin. In recent years, cash has proved
more effective.
	   A few months ago, it cost her 66 rubles (dlrs 11) for a month's
supply. Now, because of the devaluation in the ruble, it costs her
220 rubles (the equivalent of dlrs 11 at today's exchange rate), no
small change for Mikhailova, with her 1,200-ruble (dlrs 60) monthly
salary.
	   Twice the pharmacist has told her there was no insulin at all.
The first time, Mikhailova said, she broke down in tears _ and the
exhausted pharmacist did, too.
	   Katlinsky is pinning his hopes on foreign investment. Ignatkov,
his eye on the immediate future, wants foreign aid.
	   The European Union, Red Cross and foreign drug companies are
providing some medicine. However, Katlinsky warned, many aid
shipments are past their expiration date.
	   In addition, he estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of
medicine aid is misappropriated. ``Corruption is no secret in our
country,'' he said.
	   At a recent pharmaceutical trade show, most attendees appeared
to be seeking personal medical advice or looking for free samples
instead of placing bulk orders.

those medicines, while drug companies from around the world
discovered a vast new market in Russia with virtually no domestic
competition.
	   The cash-starved government has promised to ensure crucial
medicines, including insulin, even if that means costly imports.
But that will also mean skimping on things such as salaries at
hospitals and other parts of Russia's disintegrating health care
system.
	   Long before the Soviet collapse, patients were sometimes told to
bring their own anesthesia, bandages, even plaster for casts if
they wanted to be treated. Poorly paid doctors regularly demand
bribes for basic procedures.
	   ``In fact, the crisis didn't change anything. It just
highlighted the situation,'' said Yuri Katlinsky, head of the
Health Ministry's medicine department.
	   Facing sharply devalued wages or extended wage delays, many
Russians are no longer buying aspirin or are forgoing anesthesia
for minor surgery, said Margarita Pudnikova of the International
Federation of the Red Cross.
	   There have been no signs of hoarding or panic medicine buying,
but that's partly because pharmacies don't have or won't sell more
than a few doses at a time. Still, lines sometimes form outside
pharmacies before they open, on rumors that they have a new
shipment.
	   Several times a day, Dr. Ivan Ignatkov, head of the Russian
Diabetes Association, receives a phone call from an alarmed mother
or diabetes patient saying their pharmacy has run out of insulin.
He moans sympathetically, then instructs them to come to his
office, where he has a limited supply of samples from foreign drug
companies.
	   ``What kind of system is this?'' he asked heatedly, hanging up
after yet another phone call. ``Our country can build rockets. ...
Why don't we have normal health care?''
	   The solution, most agree, is for Russia to develop a
pharmaceutical industry. But that means starting from scratch.
Russia's few drug companies rely largely on imported raw materials.
	   Mikhailova, like all Russia's insulin-dependent diabetics, is
supposed to get her insulin free. Rarely has she been so fortunate.
	   In a familiar pattern, dlrs 30 million was allocated by the
government for diabetics this year, but just dlrs 420,000 had been
released as of Oct. 31, Ignatkov said.
	   In Soviet times, Mikhailova said, she knew to bring a bottle of
cognac if she wanted good insulin. In recent years, cash has proved
more effective.
	   A few months ago, it cost her 66 rubles (dlrs 11) for a month's
supply. Now, because of the devaluation in the ruble, it costs her
220 rubles (the equivalent of dlrs 11 at today's exchange rate), no
small change for Mikhailova, with her 1,200-ruble (dlrs 60) monthly
salary.
	   Twice the pharmacist has told her there was no insulin at all.
The first time, Mikhailova said, she broke down in tears _ and the
exhausted pharmacist did, too.
	   Katlinsky is pinning his hopes on foreign investment. Ignatkov,
his eye on the immediate future, wants foreign aid.
	   The European Union, Red Cross and foreign drug companies are
providing some medicine. However, Katlinsky warned, many aid
shipments are past their expiration date.
	   In addition, he estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of
medicine aid is misappropriated. ``Corruption is no secret in our
country,'' he said.
	   At a recent pharmaceutical trade show, most attendees appeared
to be seeking personal medical advice or looking for free samples
instead of placing bulk orders.

Reports: Major Japanese bank to be put under state control

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese finance officials are considering putting
a major lender, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., under state control after
judging the bank to be insolvent, media reports said Friday.
	   Japan's central bank and the Financial Supervisory Agency have
determined that Nippon Credit cannot overcome massive bad-debt
problems on its own and are in the final stages of preparations to
nationalize the bank, state-run broadcaster NHK reported.
	   Nippon Credit would be only the second bank in Japan to be put
under state control since World War II. The government took over
the operations of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct.
23.
	   Spokesmen for both the Bank of Japan and the Financial
Supervisory Agency, which regulates the finance industry, denied a
takeover is imminent. And a spokesman for Nippon Credit said he was
not aware of such a plan.
	   Several other media agencies, including the mass-circulation
newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, also reported that the government was
mobilizing a takeover of the bank.
	   Nippon Credit was recently reported to have been in merger talks
with Japan's Chuo Trust and Banking Co., but earlier this week Chuo
said it was not considering a buyout of the ailing bank.
	   Government regulators will declare as soon as Sunday that the
bank's debts exceed its assets, Kyodo news reported. The bank must
be declared insolvent before the government can legally assume
control of its operations.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the
fifty largest in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune
magazine. NCB has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106
billion), but some 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) of its loans
were at risk of going bad, according to Kyodo.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate and stock prices early this
decade.
	   Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's so-called long-term
credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding of Japanese
industry following World War II by providing companies long-term,
low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies to
raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have
failed to find a new role.
	   The government has stepped in to aid NCB before. Last April,
finance officials asked a group of financial institutions and the
central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.

India tops former British colonies' non-performance at Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Are former British colonies playing too
much cricket and ignoring other sports?
	   As Asia's version of the Olympics, the Asian Games, reach its
midpoint, the performance of nine former British colonies,
including the world's second most populous nation India, is nothing
but dismal.
	   The Indian team did not even get into the medal standings until
five days into the 41-nation competition, when a woman weightlifter
and a team of horse riders won a silver and a bronze.
	   The Indian team went into Friday's events placed 21st among the
24 teams to have won medals. Even the small Himalayan country of
Nepal, India's northern neighbor, was one step above with one
silver and two bronzes.
	   In contrast China, where cricket is generally not played because
the British empire was never there, had grabbed 50 golds, 35
silvers and 23 bronze _ a total of 108 medals _ by the end of
Thursday's events.
	   All the nine nations that were under British colonial rule have
together won just one gold, seven silvers and 10 bronzes in the
first five days.
	   Their combined medal tally is lower than that for Kazakstan, a
former Soviet republic, which by midday Friday had captured 11
golds, 11 silvers and 16 bronzes.
	   Hong Kong, handed over to China last year from British rule,
doesn't have India's poverty problems, but has only 6 million
people. It has won three bronze medals.
	   Pakistan so far has been the ``jewel in the crown'' with one
gold. But that gold was won not by a resident Pakistani, but by
Shokat Ali, born in Blackburn, Lancashire, a county in northern
England where he still lives. He speaks English with a heavy
northern English accent with no trace of his origin.
	   Another gold for Pakistan is certain Saturday. Compatriots Amjad
Khan and Zaraq Jehan are playing in the men's squash final.
	   Malaysia has three silver and three bronzes.
	   Bangladesh, Brunei and Sri Lanka have yet to win medals.
	   India was one of the founder members of the Asian Games and was
host for the first one in New Delhi in 1951, four years after the
British divided the subcontinent and India and Pakistan were born
as independent nations.
	   ``We are trying our best to win medals and will surely win some
in the coming events,'' said Gurudyal Singh Mander, leader of the
Indian delegation.
	   Among India's prospect are men's field hockey, tennis, shooting,
billiards and kabaddi.
	   In India, home to 980 million people, it is cricket taught by
the British that has become the No. 1 sport. Cricketers flash new
cars, houses and money, whereas other athletes just try to survive
by getting two square meals a day after their days of glory are
over.

	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer led
after the first run of a women's giant slalom Friday, setting up a
sweep of the weekend's events.
	   Meissnitzer, who won Thursday's Super-G as the World Cup
returned to European snow, twisted her way around the classic
Piste-G course in 1 minute, 8.53 seconds to take the lead, ahead of
Liechtenstein's Brigit Heeb and Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni.
	   Heeb, who has never won a World Cup race, crossed second in
1:08.78, edging Compagnoni, the winner of the giant slalom at this
French resort last year.
	   Compagnoni, who has 13 career giant slalom victories, sits .56
back.
	   Sweden's Anna Ottosson clocked the fourth best time in 1:09.10,
ahead of Austria's Anita Wachter, fifth in 1:09.18.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course left reigning World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl back in 11th place with a 1.14
deficit.

Once regime's core, Iraqi youth want jobs, not politics

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad's Central High School, a dreary
building where three Iraqi presidents received an education, is a
symbol of the myths and realities that are so jarring in Iraq.
	   On the wall is a badly faded mural of Iraqi soldiers and their
rifles. Across the playground is a painting of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein with three dutiful young men in camouflage.
	   And near the entrance reads a slogan, ``A student in school is
like a soldier in battle defending the nation.''
	   But in classrooms with peeling paint, ramshackle desks and
broken windows, the students have one thought that outweighs the
symbols of patriotism: how to get out of Iraq.
	   ``Anyone that has the opportunity, he'll go abroad,'' said
Mohammed Aboud Hassan, a 19-year-old student.
	   When Iraq's Baath Party came to power in 1968, Saddam coined a
popular slogan that encapsulated the party's vision of its tenuous
future: ``Take them young.''
	   Saddam himself was recruited into the party as a teen-ager and,
at just 22, he tried to kill Prime Minister Abdel-Karim Qassem.
	   But if the disenchantment, frustration and hopelessness that run
rife among Iraqi youth in the streets and schools are any
indication, the young aren't coming. It is a reality that may pose
a mounting threat to the party's ruthless three-decade grip on
Iraq.
	   The poor are consumed by a struggle to survive, and the rich
seek a way to leave the country. There's no middle class left.
	   ``I don't have any ambition. We earn to live and that's it.
There's nothing else,'' said Ali Hussein, an 18-year-old standing
on a corner in the neighborhood of Bab el-Sheik, a warren of narrow
streets, crumbling buildings and pools of milky sewage.
	   That desperation is evident everywhere amid a generation born at
the start of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980, raised amid the 1990
invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf War, and matured during
eight years of U.N. sanctions that have wrecked the country.
	   More than 1 million Iraqi students _ a stunning 20 percent of
the total _ failed to enroll in school this year in a country that
once boasted literacy of 97 percent or more, the government says.
	   Those youths who drop out are lucky to make dlrs 5.60 a week.
Few of them talk politics _ they don't have time _ and even fewer
say they take part in government-staged protests during frequent
bouts of tension with the United States.
	   In Saddam City, a slum named after the president, young men toil
in a market of tattered plastic bags strung over rickety stands.
	   Younis Ghazi is one.
	   He operates a popcorn machine that he bought in 1990 with all he
had: the equivalent of dlrs 1,250. He now makes maybe 80 cents
during a day that can last from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. His father is
blind, and he has eight brothers to support.
	   ``I'm the best off of all of them. At least I work,'' he said.
	   The government rarely acknowledges the problem of its lost
generation. But its leaders, aged cadres whose paunches often
stretch their olive drab uniforms, are increasingly worried that
the party's ranks are being depleted, said Western diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In one sign of that concern, Saddam has put his son Odai in
charge of the institutions that try to lure youth: the National
Olympic Committee, the Iraqi Soccer Federation, the Iraqi Youth
Federation, the Iraqi Students Union and even a youth-oriented TV
station.
	   Their target, even more than the poor youth in places like
Saddam City, is the best and the brightest, the diplomats say.
	   Some can be found at the Institute for Languages and Translation
_ but the government wouldn't like what goes on there.
	   Hanging in its lobby are a map of France and brochures about
Indonesia and Bali. The institute offers classes in English,
French, Turkish, German, Russian and Spanish as well as courses in
computers.
	   One of about 20 that have sprung up in Baghdad in the past few
years, the institute is meant to make it easier for students to
live abroad _ an almost unthinkable idea a generation ago.
	   ``People have the desire to travel, so they need our courses in
language,'' said the director, Jalal Safa el-Din.
	   He pulls out a postcard from San Diego, California, showing
sailboats on a bay girded by palm trees and mountains. It was sent
in May by Hikmat Suleiman, who received a certificate from the
institute.
	   ``He used it to find opportunity,'' Safa el-Din said.

Summit confronts rift over EU's shift to the east

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders attempted Friday
to map out the next big steps on the path to greater unity.
	   The 15 leaders started the EU's year-end summit with new impetus
behind plans to forge a common defense strategy less dependent on
the United States. But there are deep divisions over how to bring
in new members from the former Soviet Bloc and end Europe's postwar
divisions.
	   The two-day summit, dominated by the socialist leaders who now
run 11 of the 15 EU nations, also brainstormed over getting the
Union's 16.6 million unemployed back to work.
	   Meeting amid the imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from
where Austrian emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the
leaders are sure to restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate
nations can join the Union someday.
	   The EU has already opened membership talks with the frontrunners
_ Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
_ who hope to join early next decade.
	   To applicants' chagrin, the EU won't set a timetable for
expansion. Its reluctance is over differences in the pace and
scale, and over who covers the costs of accepting poor neighbors.
	   Before the enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, over 80 percent of which goes to subsidies for
farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, over half the
number in the whole of the current EU. All the eastern European
candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _ Greece.
	   Germany and other rich EU nations want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more for the enlargement.
Other nations are also defending their corners to ensure they don't
have to pick up the tab for expansion.
	   ``We don't want to solve Europe's problem with a German check
book,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters. Schroeder said
there was ``growing understanding'' for Germany's position, but he
was sure to run into Spanish opposition.
	   Spain is leading other poorer EU members who fear they will lose
out when EU funds start flowing eastward. They insist on an
increase that will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006. On
the eve of the summit, Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar promised to
resist what he called an assault ``on the bastion of solidarity''
between rich and poor nations within the EU.
	   Schroeder acknowledged agreement in Vienna was impossible, but
officials said without some progress at the summit, the Union
risked missing a March deadline for wrapping up the budget review
and be forced to delay the enlargement.
	   Complicating the issue are divergences over how many should be
allowed in. Britain, Denmark and Austria support a review that
could see Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta open formal
membership talks next year. Germany and France disagree.
	   There's more unity on defense, following Britain's decision to
back plans for cooperation so Europe can respond to crises like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo without having to rely on the United
States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Jacques Chirac are
expected to explain the recent Franco-British agreement to develop
defense ties and seek support for widening the ideas on an EU
level.
	   As always, unemployment will feature prominently. Blair and
Aznar have appealed to other leaders to join them in cutting
red-tape on business, overhauling welfare and simplifying hiring
and firing.
	   ``Reform is essential if Europe is to maximize the positive
employment effects of growth,'' Blair and Aznar wrote.

Kazak economy expected to drop by up to 2 percent next year

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's economy is expected to drop by 1.5
percent to 2 percent next year as the country feels the impact from
the economic turmoil in Russia, a news report said Friday.
	   Karatai Turysov, head of the country's economics committee, made
the forecast during a parliament session in the Central Asian
nation on Friday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Kazakstan has large oil reserves, but low world prices are also
expected to contribute to an economic slowdown next year. Like most
former Soviet republics, Kazakstan's economy has struggled
throughout the 1990s.

Rebel ethnic Albanian fighter sentenced to 13 years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, who
reportedly was a member of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, was
sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison for ``terrorism,'' the
Tanjug news agency reported.
	   The district court in the town of Pec said Naim Zejnaj, 23, took
part in an armed attack on a police convoy in western Kosovo in May
in which eight Serbian policemen were wounded, Tanjug said.
	   The gunmen, belonging to the KLA rebel group fighting for
secession of Kosovo, used automatic rifles, machine guns and
mortars in the attack.
	   Similar KLA attacks on Serbian police prompted a massive
crackdown against the rebels earlier this year in which hundreds of
people were killed and up to 300,000 left homeless.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are awaiting trials on
charges similar to those faced by Zejnaj.

	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer led
after the first run of a women's giant slalom Friday, setting up a
sweep of the weekend's events.
	   Meissnitzer, who won Thursday's Super-G as the World Cup
returned to European snow, twisted her way around the classic
Piste-G course in 1 minute, 8.53 seconds to take the lead, ahead of
Liechtenstein's Brigit Heeb and Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni.
	   Heeb, who has never won a World Cup race, crossed second in
1:08.78, edging Compagnoni, the winner of the giant slalom at this
French resort last year.
	   Compagnoni, who has 13 career giant slalom victories, sits .56
back.
	   Sweden's Anna Ottosson clocked the fourth best time in 1:09.10,
ahead of Austria's Anita Wachter, fifth in 1:09.18.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course left reigning World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl back in 11th place with a 1.14
deficit.

Summit confronts rift over EU's shift to the east

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders attempted Friday
to map out the next big steps on the path to greater unity.
	   The 15 leaders started the EU's year-end summit with new impetus
behind plans to forge a common defense strategy less dependent on
the United States. But there are deep divisions over how to bring
in new members from the former Soviet Bloc and end Europe's postwar
divisions.
	   The two-day summit, dominated by the socialist leaders who now
run 11 of the 15 EU nations, also brainstormed over getting the
Union's 16.6 million unemployed back to work.
	   Meeting amid the imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from
where Austrian emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the
leaders are sure to restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate
nations can join the Union someday.
	   The EU has already opened membership talks with the frontrunners
_ Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
_ who hope to join early next decade.
	   To applicants' chagrin, the EU won't set a timetable for
expansion. Its reluctance is over differences in the pace and
scale, and over who covers the costs of accepting poor neighbors.
	   Before the enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, over 80 percent of which goes to subsidies for
farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, over half the
number in the whole of the current EU. All the eastern European
candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _ Greece.
	   Germany and other rich EU nations want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more for the enlargement.
Other nations are also defending their corners to ensure they don't
have to pick up the tab for expansion.
	   ``We don't want to solve Europe's problem with a German check
book,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters. Schroeder said
there was ``growing understanding'' for Germany's position, but he
was sure to run into Spanish opposition.
	   Spain is leading other poorer EU members who fear they will lose
out when EU funds start flowing eastward. They insist on an
increase that will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006. On
the eve of the summit, Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar promised to
resist what he called an assault ``on the bastion of solidarity''
between rich and poor nations within the EU.
	   Schroeder acknowledged agreement in Vienna was impossible, but
officials said without some progress at the summit, the Union
risked missing a March deadline for wrapping up the budget review
and be forced to delay the enlargement.
	   Complicating the issue are divergences over how many should be
allowed in. Britain, Denmark and Austria support a review that
could see Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta open formal
membership talks next year. Germany and France disagree.
	   There's more unity on defense, following Britain's decision to
back plans for cooperation so Europe can respond to crises like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo without having to rely on the United
States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Jacques Chirac are
expected to explain the recent Franco-British agreement to develop
defense ties and seek support for widening the ideas on an EU
level.
	   As always, unemployment will feature prominently. Blair and
Aznar have appealed to other leaders to join them in cutting
red-tape on business, overhauling welfare and simplifying hiring
and firing.
	   ``Reform is essential if Europe is to maximize the positive
employment effects of growth,'' Blair and Aznar wrote.

Labor commission upholds Philippine Airlines job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Philippine Airlines said Friday its
decision to fire 1,400 flight attendants in July has been upheld by
the government agency overseeing labor disputes.
	   Philippine Airlines said the National Labor Relations Commission
agreed to its right to cut its work force, especially at a time
when the airlines faces collapse because of financial difficulties
following years of losses, labor strikes and the regional financial
crisis.
	   ``The free will of management to conduct its own business
affairs to achieve its purpose cannot be denied,'' the commission
said in a document furnished to media by Philippine Airlines.
	   A division of the commission earlier imposed an injunction order
against the job cuts following a complaint from the airlines'
flight attendant union.
	   In June, PAL sought relief from payment of dlrs 2.1 billion in
debts due to cash flow problems, which it attributed to financial
losses from operations and costly workers strikes.
	   The airline has lost money in most of the past 15 years. It
posted a net loss of 8.08 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in the
fiscal year ended March, its biggest loss in its 57-year history.

Three bombings shatter night quiet _ nobody injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Three separate bombing incidents
shattered the peace in Budapest's residential areas early Friday,
but no one was wounded, police said.
	   A few minutes after midnight, an explosive went off under a
Daewoo car in the capital's 18th district, causing extensive damage
to the car, Budapest police spokesman Zoltan Petoe was quoted by
state television as saying.
	   The car was reported to have belonged to the wife of a Malev
Hungarian Airlines pilot.
	   The other two explosions occurred a few minutes apart, at around
5:00 am (04:00 GMT).
	   In the 14th district, a Molotov cocktail was thrown to the door
of a house. The door caught fire, but the fire brigade soon
extinguished it.
	   Almost immediately afterward, in the neighboring 15th district,
a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the garden of a house, burning
the grass.
	   There have been more than 140 bombings and grenade attacks in
Hungary between 1991 and early 1998, targeting people, houses,
bars, restaurants and cars.
	   Police theorize that most are part of a gangland war for turf,
or are a means of settling accounts among rival criminal gangs.
	   However, politicians and police officials recently noted that
the explosions had stopped after May's general elections, when the
Young Democrats of new Prime Minister Viktor Orban beat the ruling
Socialist Party.
	   Before Friday's explosions, the last incident had occurred July
2 in downtown Budapest, when a remote-controlled bomb killed a
police informer and three passers-by, and wounded 24 people.

Singapore unemployment rate doubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government confirmed Friday that the
adjusted unemployment rate for September was 4.5 percent, almost
double June's 2.3 percent.
	   The Manpower Ministry issued the final figures in its quarterly
report, confirming preliminary figures given in late October by
Minister Lee Boon Yang.
	   The city-state of 3.1 million is suffering from one of its worst
economic downturns in its history, and layoffs have risen to record
levels.
	   The number of workers fired in the first nine months of 1998
totaled 21,073 people, more than the 19,529 cut during Singapore's
last economic recession in 1985, said the ministry.
	   Layoffs would likely rise to between 25,000 and 30,000 by the
end of the year, Permanent Secretary for Manpower Tan Chin Nam told
reporters Friday.
	   Currently, only three job openings are available for every 10
workers in Singapore, compared to an average 25 jobs for every 10
workers over the last four years.
	   ``The outlook for employment is rather gloomy,'' said Tan.

Former Bavarian state premier Max Streibl dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Max Streibl, who led the southern German
state of Bavaria from 1988-93, died in a Munich clinic early Friday
after suffering a heart attack. He was 66.
	   Bavaria's parliament observed several minutes of silence Friday
in his honor.
	   ``Streibl was a passionate Bavarian, a convinced federalist and
a champion of a regions-based Europe,'' said parliamentary
president Johann Boehm.
	   A native of Oberammergau and a lawyer by training, his political
career began in 1962 when he was elected to the Bavarian state
parliament for the ruling Christian Social Union, the Bavaria-only
sister party of the conservative Christian Democrats.
	   Streibl quickly rose to prominence, appointed secretary general
of the CSU in 1967.
	   He became state finance minister in 1977 and state premier 11
years later after the death of Franz Josef Strauss.
	   He resigned in 1993 under the cloud of the so-called ``Amigo
affair,'' with allegations surrounding government loans to an
aviation entrepreneur of millions of marks (dollars) for a fighter
plane project. Streibl was a frequent guest on the entrepreneur's
Brazilian ranch.
	   Streibl is survived by his wife, Irmingard, and three children:
Martin, Florian and Monika. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

Japan loses to United Arab Emirates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ United Arab Emirates edged Japan 1-0
Friday for its first victory in the second round of Asian Games
soccer, a result that sent South Korea into the quarterfinals.
	   Japan and the UAE ended the second round with a victory and two
defeats each. Both still had a slight chance of gaining the
quarterfinals if Kuwait lost to South Korea later Friday.
	   South Korea has two victories already, making it certain of
being one of Group 2's two teams in the quarterfinals. Because of
its superior goal differential, Kuwait also was likely to advance
even without winning.
	   In Group 1, North Korea kept alive a slight chance of making the
quarterfinals with a 2-1 victory over winless India. That gave it
one victory, one draw and one loss in the round. Uzbekistan,
already in the quarterfinals, played Turkmenistan later Friday.
	   After defeats to Kuwait and South Korea, the Emirates found its
form again against Japan.
	   Though the first half ended scoreless, the Gulf team, paced by
Hassan Saeed Rashid and Ali Saeed Rashid, showed flair and pierced
the Japanese defense.
	   Japan looked tired and sluggish after its upset of Kuwait
Thursday, which kept alive Japanese dreams of a quarterfinal for
two more days.
	   Japan brought a young team to the Asian Games but was hoping for
a good showing as preparation for the 2000 Olympics and the 2002
World Cup, for which it is co-host with South Korea.
	   Both sides fought for their goal but Hassan got there first, in
the 59th minute, scoring UAE's fourth goal in four matches.
	   A long free kick in the goal area dived into a jumble of heads
and feet before substitute Kazim Ali Abdulla gained control and
shipped a short cross to Hassan, who pushed the ball in from
point-blank range.
	   Falling behind lifted Japan's energy but it was unable to mount
a consistent attack.
	   Shinsuki Nakamura, Kazuyuki Toda, Toshiya Ishii and Kenji Fukuda
pressed the attack dangerously close but either shot wild or
crashed into a swarm of red shirts.
	   The first half was notable for six minutes of injury time,
mostly taken up by the bandaging of Japan goalkeeper Yuta Minami's
head after he was chopped down by a flying elbow from Mohammad
Ibrahim Alboloshi.
	   The rest came from a bizarre kick from behind by Japanese
captain Tsuneyau Miyamoto that connected with Alboloshi's face and
brought him down. Miyamoto drew his second yellow card of the
games.
	   Carlos de Queiroz of Portugal, who took over the UAE team three
months ago, complained that his team was fatigued after playing
four matches in nine days.
	   ``The players become tired and their reaction time is not the
same,'' de Queiroz said.
	   Like his counterpart for Japan, Frenchman Philippe Troussier, de
Queiroz brought a young team in preparation for the Olympics.
	   The intense pace of the Asian Games tournament, de Queiroz said,
was too much for young players to cope with.
	   ``From a physiological point of view, they can't recover,'' de
Queiroz said.
	   Troussier agreed.
	   ``In this weather and in this schedule, the players cannot
concentrate their efforts. With one more day, the players can
change their efforts 100 percent,'' Troussier said.

Spanish coast guards search sea after immigrant ship goes down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Spanish coast guards on Friday were
searching the narrow stretch of the Mediterranean Sea that
separates North Africa from Europe for 30 missing would-be Moroccan
immigrants, a spokesman said.
	   The prospective illegal immigrants went missing Wednesday when
the makeshift boat in which they were crammed went down because of
bad weather, spokesman Francisco Cantizano said.
	   A Turkish merchant ship spotted two of the passengers clinging
to part of the wrecked boat and alerted the Spanish maritime
authorities who picked up the two survivors who were suffering from
hypothermia, Cantizano said.
	   Rescue services have also recovered two bodies and held out
little hope of finding more survivors, Cantizano said.
	   Every year thousands of North Africans attempt the treacherous
crossing over the Strait of Gibraltar seeking to slip unnoticed
into Europe. Most travel in overcrowded single-motor boats, and
many are believed to drown.
	   Those seized during the trip or once they have arrived in Spain
are repatriated.

Third writer goes missing in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The family of a dissident Iranian writer
reported Friday that he has gone missing, the third government
critic to disappear over the past month.
	   The other two writers were later found dead, one of them
apparently strangled _ the latest in a series of unexplained
murders of government critics.
	   Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator,
left his workplace Wednesday and has not been heard of since, his
daughter, Nazanin Pouyandeh, said.
	   ``We have contacted the morgues, the coroner's office, and the
police, but have gotten nowhere,'' said the 17-year-old Nazanin.
	   ``After what has recently happened to other writers like my
father we fear the worst,'' she told The Associated Press.
	   Tehran's Hamshahri daily reported Thursday that the body of
Mohammad Mokhtari, another dissident writer who went missing last
week, was found dumped on the outskirts of the capital.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's
head and neck indicated that he had been murdered, possibly by
strangulation, although no autopsy has yet been carried out.
	   Mokhtari and Pouyandeh were among eight government critics who
had been trying to establish a writers' association. They were
summoned to a court about two months ago to answer questions about
their activities.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami are resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the
past year, vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers
and even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that the campaign is being backed by powerful hard-line
clerics like spiritual leader Ali Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, went missing and was
later found dead but his family said he may have died of a heart
attack.
	   Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in
their home.
	   Police said they've made several arrests in the murders of the
Foruhars after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. But the findings have not been made public.
	   Human Rights Watch has demanded an investigation into ``these
killings,'' saying they are part of an ``increasingly sinister
pattern of harassment and persecution of government critics in
Iran.''

Russia's economic crisis put privatization efforts on hold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis has brought the
privatization of major state assets to a virtual halt, and revenues
this year are only a fraction of those forecast, the government
said Friday.
	   The government had hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles (about dlrs
400 million) by auctioning off state property, but it has earned
only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 70 million) through October, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The delay in selling state assets has contributed to the
government's chronic cash shortages. It owes billions of rubles
(dollars) to workers, pensioners and foreign creditors.
	   The government is currently working out an austere budget for
next year, when the economy is expected to continue shrinking.
	   Russia's draft budget provides for repaying only dlrs 9.5
billion of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt that falls due
next year. That means the country will seek restructuring of the
additional dlrs 8 billion.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   But creditors have not yet expressed a willingness to rework the
debts Russia already has, and the prospect for more foreign loans
is hazy at best.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt
default and ruble devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign loans that had yet to materialize.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who has frequently been ill in recent
months and has not been involved in the day-to-day business of
government.

Japanese delegation chief praises Bangkok gamest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The leader of Japan's delegation to the
Asian Games said Friday the athletes' village and competitions in
Bangkok exceed those in the last games four years ago in the
Japanese city of Hiroshima.
	   ``We sent an advance team of officials in September who made a
number of requests and suggestions. ... We did have some concerns
whether Bangkok could pull off the games,'' Teruji Kogake said at a
news conference.
	   Bangkok's slow early preparations also had worried the games'
governing body, the Olympic Council of Asia, which talked at one
point of moving them elsewhere. Then the Asian financial crisis
handicapped Bangkok's efforts to catch up.
	   ``However,'' Kogake added, ``the athletes' village and
competitions here are excellent and exceed those at the 12th Asian
Games held in Hiroshima. We recognize Bangkok's great efforts in
hosting the games.''
	   Japan's team had 21 gold medals, 23 silver and 28 bronze after
the fourth full day of competition Thursday, second to China's 50,
35 and 22.
	   Kogake said Naoko Takahashi's victory in near-world record time
on the opening ceremonies day Sunday inspired other Japanese
athletes, who picked up six golds on the first full day of
competition _ the best first day ever for Japan.
	   Kogake's deputy, Nobuyki Sato, said competition levels have been
high. In judo, he said, Central Asia was gaining ground in what had
been a sport dominated by East Asians and Europeans
	   ``We are looking to the latter half of the games to athletics,
karate and bowling to see if we can match the medals won at
Hiroshima,'' he added.
	   In Hiroshima, Japan won 59 golds, behind China's 135 and South
Korea's 63.

Spanish coast guards search sea after immigrant ship goes down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Spanish coast guards on Friday were
searching the narrow stretch of the Mediterranean Sea that
separates North Africa from Europe for 30 missing would-be Moroccan
immigrants, a spokesman said.
	   The prospective illegal immigrants disappeared Wednesday when
their makeshift boat went down because of bad weather, spokesman
Francisco Cantizano said.
	   A Turkish merchant ship spotted two of the passengers clinging
to part of the wrecked boat and alerted the Spanish maritime
authorities, who picked up the two survivors suffering from
hypothermia, Cantizano said.
	   Rescue services have also recovered two bodies and held out
little hope of finding more survivors, Cantizano said.
	   Every year thousands of North Africans attempt the treacherous
crossing over the Strait of Gibraltar seeking to slip unnoticed
into Europe. Most travel in overcrowded single-motor boats, and
many are believed to drown.
	   Those seized during the trip or once they have arrived in Spain
are repatriated.

Asian stocks plunge following Wall Street's fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's major stock markets plunged Friday on
the back of an overnight tumble on Wall Street. Smaller markets
finished the week mixed.
	   Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 402.16
points, or 2.72 percent, to finish at 14,405.64 _ the lowest close
since Nov. 19. On Thursday, the index fell 124.10 points, or 0.83
percent.
	   Share prices sank following Thursday's drop on Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 167.61 points.
	   Disappointment with the Japanese government's latest tax reform,
which appears to hold little benefit for middle class households,
also pushed down share prices, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.28 yen in
late-afternoon trading, up 0.22 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 117.33 yen overnight.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong also slumped, with the key index
falling 3.5 percent.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 363.44 percent, closing at 9,952.00. On Thursday,
the index had slipped 45.85 points.
	   Brokers said the fall on Wall Street dampen market sentiment in
Hong Kong.
	   The fall in overseas markets offered an excuse for share
sell-offs in Hong Kong, said Felix Ngai, vice president of Sun Hung
Kai Commodities Ltd.
	   Singapore shares also closed sharply lower as investors took
advantage of the overnight plunge on Wall Street to lock in
profits, dealers said.
	   The Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 2 percent, or 28.61
points, to 1,411.27.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SEOUL: The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
12.44 points, or 2.2 percent, to 555.17. Dealers attributed the
fall to profit-taking after the index had surged 11 percent in the
past two sessions.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the fourth straight
session. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 108.83
points, or 1.5 percent, to 6,939.74.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 2.56 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 1,941.57.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks rose 13.38 points, or 0.7
percent, to 1,835.61.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, dragged down by
weaker commodity prices. The All Ordinaries Index fell 33.2 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 2,730.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on the back
of speculative buying by local retail investors. The benchmark
Composite Index rose 8.30 points, or 1.5 percent, to 533.88.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher. The Composite Index rose
1.927 points, or 0.4 percent, to 405.595.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index edged up 0.76 point to 360.30.

Thai boxers in good position for gold, team manager says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's boxing team at the Asian
Games is certain to win at least two gold medals, and rising stars
could add two more, the team manager said Friday.
	   Thailand is counting on light-flyweight Suban Punnon and boxing
hero Somluck Kamsing, who won Thailand's first Olympic gold medal
in Atlanta in 1996, said Thawatchai Sajjakul.
	   Thawatchai expects to see Suban reach the final, where he will
have his hands full with either a North or South Korean fighter.
	   ``As for Somluck, there is nobody out there who is strong enough
to snatch his gold away,'' Thawatchai added.
	   Winning would give Somluck his second Asian Games gold medal.
	   Meanwhile, pressure has been mounting on two rising stars.
	   ``We still have one strong boxer in the lightweight, which is
Pongsit (Wiangwesas), and another one, Parkpoom (Jangphonak) in the
welterweight,'' said Thawatchai, who manages the country's soccer
team as well.
	   The two have a good chance to win gold, though it will not be
easy, he said.
	   For the rest of the team, it's a 50-50 chance, he said.
	   Suban won his quarterfinal by defeating Kazakstan's Meity
Ismilov in a close match Wednesday.
	   The Thai squad suffered its first defeat Wednesday night, when
super-middleweight Sayidkhan Kulamahmad lost by two points to
Uzbekistan gold medal hopeful Dilshod Yarbekov.
	   ``We have lost only one match. The way I see it, we still have a
very strong team,'' Thawatchai said.
	   Elsewhere, Thailand also is having a successful games, with
seven gold medals by the end of the fourth full day of competition
Thursday.

European LPGA names new chief executive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Europe's struggling womens' golf tour has named
Tim Howland as its new chief executive.
	   The European Ladies Professional Golf Association offered a
schedule of only 10 major events in 1998 and has had problems since
the controversial departure last year of Terry Coates and his
assistant Gill Wilson.
	   The tour, which announced the move Thursday, was run this year
by managing director John Mort and chairman Trevor Kirkpatrick.
	   Howland agreed to take the job while continuing in his role with
the European Sport Group, which will jointly manage the commercial
activities of the tour.
	   ESG is a subsidiary of the World Sport Group, whose sister
companies manage the Asian and Australian PGA tours.
	   ``Our first priority will be to develop a coherent schedule and
more importantly to work closely with existing sponsors,'' Howland
said.
	   ``The tour has to compete in the commercial marketplace for
sponsorship support and media exposure.''

Tropical storm sweeps across central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Tropical storm Faith swept across the
central Philippines Friday before moving out over the South China
Sea, the Manila weather bureau said.
	   At least two persons were reported dead in the central island of
Iloilo, but there have been no report of damage so far.
	   At 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), the storm was packing sustained winds of
105 kilometers (66 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 135
kilometers (84 miles) per hour, the Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Services said. It was moving west southwest at 26
kilometers (16 miles) per hour towards Vietnam, the bureau said.
	   Residents of coastal areas in the central Philippines have been
advised to move to safer grounds due to the possibility of
flooding.
	   Signal No. 3, the country's second highest storm alert, was
issued in several islands near the storm's center.
	   The 11th large storm to hit the country this year was carrying
typhoon-strength winds late Thursday when it came ashore near
Borongan town on Samar island. It weakened as it sliced through
islands in the central Philippines.
	   It is expected to reintensify back to typhoon-strength now that
it's back over open sea.

Le Pen further punishes Megret, asks rank-and-file to support him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on
Friday further punished his longtime lieutenant and heir apparent
for defying him, suspending his party membership.
	   The National Front leader also appealed to his party's
rank-and-file not to fall into the ``trap'' his rival, Bruno
Megret, has laid with his appeal for an urgent congress to
determine the party's future.
	   ``I have never lied to you, never abandoned you, never betrayed
you,'' Le Pen said. He asked National Front members across the
country not to sign petitions calling for the congress.
	   Already this week, Le Pen had dismissed Bruno Megret from his
job as No. 2 man, stripping his title of general delegate.
	   On Friday, at party headquarters in Saint-Cloud, he announced:
``At my request, the executive bureau has suspended the membership
(of Megret and four others), and is waiting for them to appear
before our disciplinary institution.''
	   The leadership feud has split the National Front into two
warring camps.
	   Megret's camp _ which has moved into its own building _ claims
it has almost all the 10,000 signatures necessary to hold a
congress. According to party rules, 20 percent of the 50,000 or so
members is enough.
	   ``This is not just about the National Front _ this is about
France,'' Le Pen said. ``France is in danger. Yes, she is in grave
danger.''
	   He noted that last year he was elected president of the party
for three years, and denounced the ``scandalous campaign of
disinformation'' that is seeking to destabilize him.
	   Among the others Le Pen suspended was Serge Martinez, a former
Le Pen loyalist who on Monday made the original call for a party
congress and was immediately fired as chief of personnel.
	   Also suspended was Philippe Olivier, the companion of Le Pen's
daughter, Marie-Caroline Le Pen, who has been accused by her father
of betraying him.

Indonesian students press demand for trial of Suharto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 200 student protesters gathered
near Parliament on Friday to demand a fair election and a trial of
former President Suharto on corruption charges.
	   The rally followed one of the biggest days of protest in recent
months, when 10,000 students marched on Thursday to demand swift
democratic reform and legal action against Suharto.
	   But the protesters appeared willing to give a reprieve to
President B.J. Habibie, who has promised to hold general elections
in June 1999 and dismantle the authoritarian legacy of his
predecessor.
	   ``We just want a just and fair election,'' said student leader
Firman Bafo. ``The only way to form a legitimate government is to
wait until the next general election.''
	   Many other students have called for the resignation of Habibie.
The president, however, has ignored student demands that Suharto be
tried for allegedly amassing a fortune at the expense of state
resources during his 32 years in power.
	   Habibie, who replaced his former mentor in May after riots and
protests, has launched an investigation of Suharto's wealth that
critics dismiss as cosmetic.
	   The protesters on Friday first demonstrated outside the Jakarta
police headquarters before moving on to Parliament. On Thursday,
angry students threw stones and bottles at the building.
	   Also Friday, some 250 government supporters demonstrated against
a human rights commission that has criticized the military for its
conduct in clashes with students.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights was founded by the
government but has developed a reputation for independence.
	   The government supporters complained that the commission ignored
human rights violations against Muslim groups. Indonesia is
predominantly Muslim.
	   ``(The commission) should treat everybody the same way,'' said
Ranni Zarman, a protester wearing an Islamic shawl.

U.S. envoy discusses missile row with U.N. official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A U.S. envoy and the U.N.'s resident
representative here met Friday to coordinate efforts on reducing
regional tensions over Cyprus' decision to deploy Russian missiles.
	   Thomas Miller, the State Department's coordinator for Cyprus,
said in a statement on arrival Thursday that ``the missiles clearly
are a problem.''
	   Miller and the U.N. official, Dame Ann Hercus, refused to talk
to reporters after their 90-minute meeting at the U.S. Embassy.
	   Turkey has warned it will use force to prevent the deployment of
the Russian S-300 antiaircraft missiles ordered by the Greek
Cypriot government. The threat has raised the specter of a war with
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with this east Mediterranean
island nation.
	   Cyprus has said the missiles will be deployed in the next month
or two, and has rejected suggestions by Greece that it set up them
on the Greek island of Crete instead. However, the proposal is
still being pushed.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized
its northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Miller is not seeing any Cypriot officials as both President
Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, are currently abroad.
	   Clerides insists on deploying the missiles unless Turkey accepts
his proposal to demilitarize the island, or if there is progress
toward the reunification of the island.
	   U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have been deadlocked since
August 1997 when Denktash walked out demanding recognition of his
breakaway state and the cancellation of Cyprus' entry talks with
the European Union as preconditions for his return.
	   Miller will fly to Athens later Friday on his way to Istanbul,
Turkey, where he will join Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special
presidential envoy on Cyprus.
	   On Dec. 12 and 13 Holbrooke and Miller will participate in a
meeting of Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen, part of a
Holbrooke initiative to promote closer cooperation between the
Cypriot sides.
	   The two will fly to Athens Dec. 14 for talks with senior Greek
officials.

Ishii, Kanemoto share lead in Okinawa Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ONNASON, Japan (AP) _ American David Ishii shot a 3-under-par 68
Friday to hold on to a share of the lead after the second round of
the season-ending Okinawa Open.
	   Ishii, seeking his first victory in four years, scored three
birdies in a bogey-free round at the 6,359-yard (5,787-meter),
par-71 Daikyo Country Club course.
	   Takashi Kanemoto shot the day's best round _ a 65 _ to move into
a tie with Ishii. Kanemoto, who has yet to win a tour title in five
years as a pro, sank six birdies and no bogeys to join Ishii at 135
after two rounds.
	   Akihito Yokoyama was one stroke behind the leaders at 6-under
after he carded a 67 Friday.
	   Australian Brad Andrews was a further stroke behind along with
Japan Open champion Hidemichi Tanaka.
	   Richard Backwell, also from Australia, was tie for sixth with
Masayuki Kawamura at 138.
	   A total of 62 players will advance to the final two rounds of
the 80 million-yen (dlrs 680,000) tournament. The winner will
collect 14.4 million yen (dlrs 123,000).

IOC orders inquiry into Salt Lake payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Salt Lake organizing chief and U.S.
official
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ What started as a local controversy
in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international
scandal.
	   The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level
investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group
which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a ``bribe.''
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international
body's juridical commission _ which deals with legal and ethical
issues _ to investigate.
	   The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, a highly respected former World Court judge.
	   The scholarship fund was first disclosed two weeks ago by a Salt
Lake radio station.
	   The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress
report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to
make to the IOC executive board this weekend.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne Friday,
welcomed the IOC investigation.
	   ``I think that's who the matter should be taken up by,'' he told
The Associated Press. `` Of course, we intend to collaborate fully
with the IOC and its investigation.''
	   Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's
image.
	   ``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he
said.
	   Asked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he
hadn't seen the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. But he
sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a
distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the
current organizing committee.
	   ``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the
bid commitee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing committee
certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would
stand any investigation. The facts were in the early 1990s when the
bid committee was operating.''
	   U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky
described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image
and preparations for the games.
	   ``It doesn't do us any good at all,'' he said. ``I hope we see a
speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be a
footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter.''

Third writer missing in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The family of a dissident Iranian writer
reported Friday that he has disappeared, becoming the third
government critic to vanish in the past month.
	   The other two writers were later found dead, one of them
apparently strangled _ the latest in a series of unexplained
murders of government critics.
	   Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator,
left his workplace Wednesday and has not been heard from since, his
daughter, Nazanin Pouyandeh, said.
	   ``We have contacted the morgues, the coroner's office, and the
police, but have gotten nowhere,'' said the 17-year-old Nazanin.
	   ``After what has recently happened to other writers like my
father we fear the worst,'' she told The Associated Press.
	   Tehran's Hamshahri daily reported Thursday that the body of
Mohammad Mokhtari, another dissident writer who disappeared last
week, was found dumped on the outskirts of the capital.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's
head and neck indicated that he had been murdered, possibly by
strangulation, although no autopsy has yet been carried out.
	   Mokhtari and Pouyandeh were among eight government critics who
had been trying to establish a writers' association. They were
summoned to a court about two months ago to answer questions about
their activities.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami are resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the
past year, vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers
and even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that the campaign is being backed by powerful hard-line
clerics like spiritual leader Ali Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, went missing and was
later found dead but his family said he may have died of a heart
attack.
	   Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in
their home.
	   Police said they've made several arrests in the murders of the
Foruhars after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. But the findings have not been made public.
	   Human Rights Watch has demanded an investigation into ``these
killings,'' saying they are part of an ``increasingly sinister
pattern of harassment and persecution of government critics in
Iran.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court took Boris Yeltsin's side
in an old battle with parliament, ruling Friday that the president
can nominate the same person up to three times as a candidate for
prime minister.
	   Communists and other hardliners in parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, asked the court to rule on the issue when Yeltsin
nominated Sergei Kiriyenko three times for prime minister this past
spring.
	   Parliament voted down Kiriyenko's nomination the first two
times, but then approved him on the third vote. If lawmakers had
rejected Kiriyenko a third time, then Yeltsin would have been
empowered to dismiss parliament and call new elections.
	   Some members of parliament believed that Yeltsin was required to
nominate a different candidate if parliament rejected his choice.
	   The Constitutional Court ruled Friday that the president is
entitled to nominate the same candidate all three times if he
wants.
	   Kiriyenko lasted only four months as prime minister. He was
sacked by Yeltsin in August after the government devalued the ruble
and defaulted on some debts, triggering the country's economic
crisis.
	   Yeltsin then nominated former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
as his new candidate for prime minister. But after Chernomyrdin was
twice rejected by parliament, Yeltsin opted for Yevgeny Primakov,
who quickly won parliament's approval.
	   A steady string of illnesses has weakened Yeltsin's power, and
he has had little to say about the country's pressing economic
problems.
	   However, the president was in the Kremlin on Friday to meet with
several top aides after spending two weeks in the hospital to
recover from pneumonia.

South African university releases discovery of major skeleton find
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JOH101 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When researcher Ron Clarke
announced to the world he had discovered the oldest skeleton of a
human ancestor, top government officials rejoiced and called it a
victory for South African society.
	   But it emerged Friday that South Africa is losing Clarke, one of
the nation's foremost paleo-anthropologists. The University of the
Witwatersrand did not reappoint him for 1999, and he will go to
work for a German university.
	   Wits said that after seven years, Clarke's contract was not
renewed in a ``restructuring.''
	   It would not comment on negative remarks about Clarke by his
supervisor in Friday's Mail and Guardian weekly. The newspaper
quoted Lee Berger as saying Clarke ``has no great record'' or
special skills, and that the excavation site where Clarke made his
reputation needed a rest.
	   Berger, a 32-year-old American who heads the Wits
Paleo-Anthropology Research Group, did not immediately return a
phone message.
	   Clarke will continue to excavate some months of the year at the
site, the Sterkfontein caves near Johannesburg. But his move to a
foreign university will come as a blow to the government,
especially to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   Mbeki has been promoting the idea of an African cultural and
economic renaissance. He appeared at the Wednesday news conference
announcing Clarke's remarkable discovery and referred to him as a
national ``hero.''
	   Clarke ``is among a team of people who are very invaluable to
our country,'' Mbeki's spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa, said Friday.
``His departure, if true, would be a loss, but we hope it will not
be a loss to the human sciences as a whole.''
	   Wits spokeswoman Peggy Jennings called Clarke's find a
``monumental discovery for South Africa.'' She said his departure
was ``sad.''
	   In a telephone interview, Clarke said he took a research job
with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Institute in Frankfurt shortly
after hearing about six months ago he would not be reappointed.
	   ``I was told that because of operational changes my contract
would not be renewed. I don't want to get into any acrimony over
this,'' he said.
	   Wits said Wits was giving him an honorary appointment in the
Anatomy Department, and that he would continue working at
Sterkfontein. But the university did not have much choice. Only
Clarke and his mentor, retired Wits professor Phillip Tobias, have
government permits to run excavations at the cave, a major
repository of human and animal fossils.
	   On Wednesday, Clarke said the cave had yielded the oldest
complete skeleton of a human ancestor, a 4-foot-tall ape-man dating
back 3.2 to 3.6 million years. The find could shed crucial light on
the anatomy and activity of our earliest forebears.
	   The university's action ``does disturb me,'' said Clarke, an
unfailingly polite researcher who has spent nearly half his
53-years associated with the caves. He added: ``I thought they were
making a very big mistake.''

South African bowlers grab initiative against WIndies

	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa snatched four
early wickets to have the West Indies in trouble at 63 for four in
reply to their 245 all out at lunch on the second day of the second
test at St. George's Park Friday.
	   It was rookie David Terbrugge who struck two vital blows just
before lunch, bowling opener Stuart Williams and Carl Hooper in
successive overs.
	   Shaun Pollock had started the ball rolling by dismissing Clayton
Lambert for a duck in his first over. Allan Donald got in on the
act by having Brian Lara caught at first slip by Darryll Cullinan
for four.
	   South Africa resumed their innings with Donald and Pat Symcox at
the wicket, and added just 22 runs to their overnight 223 for
eight.
	   Donald finished on 33, to equal his highest test score. He
perished to Hooper's fourth catch in the slips, giving Courtney
Walsh his fourth wicket in the innings.

Malaysia to maintain capital controls for now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Friday that capital controls designed to fend off currency
speculators and shelter his country's embattled economy would be
maintained for now.
	   In a private briefing to regional fund managers, Mahathir said
the government would instead consider fine-tuning the strict
measures that allow its currency, the ringgit, to be traded only
within the country.
	   The dozen financiers from Hong Kong and Singapore told Mahathir
their concerns that these measures, if prolonged, would scare off
foreign investment, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   Foreign equity investment in Malaysia has ground to a virtual
standstill since Mahathir made the announcement on Sept. 1. The
price of shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange hit a year low
that same day.
	   However, stocks have soared since then due to strong buying
interest from local investors.
	   Besides pegging the Malaysian currency to 3.80 ringgit against
the U.S. dollar, the curbs also prohibit foreigners from
repatriating their investments for one year after the purchase
date.
	   The major international fund managers present at the private
briefing include Morgan Grenfell, Rothchilds, HSBC Asset
Management, Invesco Asia Ltd, Aberdeen, UOB-OSK Asset Management,
Mercury, Schroder, Henderson and Allianz.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's major stock markets plunged Friday on
the back of an overnight tumble on Wall Street. Smaller markets
finished the week mixed. Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average fell 402.16 points, or 2.72 percent, to finish at 14,405.64
_ the lowest close since Nov. 19. On Thursday, the index fell
124.10 points, or 0.83 percent. Share prices sank following
Thursday's drop on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 167.61 points. Disappointment with the Japanese
government's latest tax reform, which appears to hold little
benefit for middle class households, also pushed down share prices,
traders said. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese finance officials are considering putting
a major lender, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., under state control after
judging the bank to be insolvent, media reports said Friday.
Japan's central bank and the Financial Supervisory Agency have
determined that Nippon Credit cannot overcome massive bad-debt
problems on its own and are in the final stages of preparations to
nationalize the bank, state-run broadcaster NHK reported. Nippon
Credit would be only the second bank in Japan to be put under state
control since World War II. The government took over the operations
of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23. Spokesmen
for both the Bank of Japan and the Financial Supervisory Agency,
which regulates the finance industry, denied a takeover is
imminent. And a spokesman for Nippon Credit said he was not aware
of such a plan. Several other media agencies, including the
mass-circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, also reported that the
government was mobilizing a takeover of the bank. (JAPAN-TROUBLED

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Coca-Cola Co. is buying Cadbury Schweppes'
brands in 120 countries in a deal estimated at dlrs 1.85 billion,
the companies announced Friday. The deal covers Schweppes and
Canada Dry mixers, Dr Pepper and Crush, the companies said. The
transactions, which do not apply to the United States, France and
South Africa, also include acquisition of beverage plants in
Ireland and Spain. Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory
review in a number of countries but is anticipated in the middle of
next year, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced. The deal will affect
approximately 450 Cadbury Schweppes employees, who will have the
opportunity to take jobs with Coca-Cola, the company said. ``These

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Like most second-string Japanese automakers in
the United States, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has struggled in recent
years _ a victim of its own failure to come up with an image and
vehicles that would make it stand out from the competition. But a
lively new ad campaign, new U.S. leadership and a redesigned entry
in the ultracompetitive midsize sedan segment has Mitsubishi hoping
to generate its first profit in the United States since 1987. The
biggest Japanese automakers, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor
Co., have gained in the U.S. market while smaller Mitsubishi,
Nissan Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. have fallen farther
behind. Ninth-ranked Mitsubishi holds only 1.2 percent of the
market; its sales fell 22 percent from 1994 to 1997. Mitsubishi is
pinning much of its hopes for a revival on its redesigned 1999
Galant, which competes against best sellers like the Toyota Camry,
Honda Accord and Ford Taurus in the crowded midsize segment. The
car, built at Mitsubishi's Normal, Illinois, plant, has been
praised by automotive critics as a strong competitor. But the
segment is full of strong competitors. (US-MITSUBISHI REBUILDS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Angry workers marched through a New
Delhi industrial area Friday and others across the country observed
a general strike to protest the government's plan to further open
the Indian economy to foreign investment. The New Delhi marchers
belonged to leftist unions who, along with leftist political
parties, called a one-day nationwide strike Friday. The protests
reached parliament, where leftist politicians held an hour-long
morning sit-in and later normal business in both the upper and
lower houses was interrupted by shouts from members whose demands
to discuss the strike were refused. Politicians also clashed in
parliament Friday over plans to set aside a third of parliamentary
seats for women, making it uncertain the bill will ever come to a
vote. (INDIA-STRIKE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis has brought the
privatization of major state assets to a virtual halt, and revenues
this year are only a fraction of those forecast, the government
said Friday. The government had hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles
(about dlrs 400 million) by auctioning off state property, but it
has earned only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 70 million) through
October, the Finance Ministry said. The country's economic downturn
has chased away foreign investors, and the government has decided
to put off auctions of two large companies, the Rosneft oil company
and the Svyazinvest communications firm. The government is still
planning to auction off a 2.5 percent stake in the gas monopoly
Gazprom later this month, the Interfax news agency reported. The
delay in selling state assets has contributed to the government's
chronic cash shortages. It owes billions of rubles (dollars) to
workers, pensioners and foreign creditors. The government is
currently working out an austere budget for next year, when the
economy is expected to continue shrinking. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a pivotal day reached only twice before in
the nation's history, Republicans are primed to muscle through the
House Judiciary Committee an impeachment resolution that advocates
removal of President Clinton from office. The committee where legal
arguments are co-mingled with raw partisanship was to debate four
articles of impeachment Friday and make its recommendations to the
435-member House. The articles accuse the president of lying under
oath to a court investigative panel known as a grand jury, lying
under oath in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power. All of Clinton's actions were designed, they
say, to conceal his extramarital affair with a former White House
intern half his age, Monica Lewinsky. Only twice before has the
committee taken such a grave vote against a president, recommending
impeachment of Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Andrew Johnson in 1868.
Nixon resigned before the House could act. Johnson was impeached by
the House and acquitted by a single vote in a Senate trial.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel affirmed Friday that it will not
withdraw troops from the West Bank unless the top Palestinian
decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction. Israel also rejected a
U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue
that has sparked riots in the West Bank. The Palestinians have said
they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by a vote,
when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in the presence
of U.S. President Bill Clinton. With its demand, Israel may be
setting itself up for a showdown with Clinton who is visiting
Israel and the Palestinian areas to usher in the next stage of the
Wye River land-for-security agreement. Under the accord, the
annulment of the offending provisions by the PNC is to clear the
way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely to declare
that the PNC has not completed its task. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders attempted Friday
to map out the next big steps on the path to greater unity. The 15
leaders started the EU's year-end summit with new impetus behind
plans to forge a common defense strategy less dependent on the
United States. But there are deep divisions over how to bring in
new members from the former Soviet Bloc and end Europe's postwar
divisions. The two-day summit, dominated by the socialist leaders
who now run 11 of the 15 EU nations, also brainstormed over getting
the Union's 16.6 million unemployed back to work. Meeting amid the
imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from where Austrian
emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the leaders are sure to
restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate nations can join the Union
someday. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   KALEMIE, Congo (AP) _ Jet fighters drop bombs on a quiet fishing
village and rebels claim new victories over government-allied
troops. In eastern Congo, planned peace talks have so far done
little to slow the fighting. The war-weary Congolese in Kalemie, a
port town on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, braced Friday
for more government air strikes. There was little sign that either
President Laurent Kabila, or the rebels fighting to oust him, were
serious about a proposed cease-fire and U.N.-sponsored peace talks
scheduled next week in Lusaka, Zambia. ``Kabila knows he cannot
win. So he is using war planes to terrorize the population,'' said
Waya Shindano, a rebel spokesman in Kalemie. ``What he is doing is
turning the population against him. He is helping us win the war.''
Earlier this week, war planes from Kabila's main ally Zimbabwe
killed at least 12 people and injured 15 others in an attack on
Kalemie, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital Kinshasa.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior police officer testifying
in the corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Friday that Anwar told police not to investigate allegations that
he committed sexual misdeeds. ``When I told Anwar that our
investigations were still not completed and were only in its
initial stages, he told me that this matter shouldn't be pursued
further,'' Musa Hassan, the prosecution's 13th witness, told the
court. Musa, the officer charged with investigating Anwar since
last year, said Anwar issued the directive in the presence of
Malaysia's top lawmaker, Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah. ``Anwar
told us that the investigations should be stopped because it goes
against what the prime minister had already concluded, that the
matter was slanderous,'' Musa said. His testimony sparked off a
storm of protest from Anwar's defense team, who accused prosecutors
of using the witness to introduce prejudicial evidence unrelated to
any of the charges leveled against the ousted deputy prime
minister. ``It offends the rule of relevancy,'' said lawyer
Christopher Fernando. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)

Second round of voter registration set for January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Another round of voter
registration for national elections next year will take place in
January, the body organizing South Africa's second all-race polls
said on Friday.
	   Voters will be able to register in all nine of the country's
provinces on the last weekend of the month from Jan. 29 to Jan. 31,
said the Independent Electoral Commission.
	   It had originally hoped to conduct the entire registration on a
single weekend in November, but amid major confusion _ even
President Nelson Mandela went to the wrong registration office _
and poor turnout it was decided to add more dates.
	   Of South Africa's estimated 24.7 million voters, only 8.4
million have registered so far. A third round of registration dates
will be announced once the date of the election is decided.
	   The election has to be held within three months of the end of
April, 1999, with a date in May seen as the most likely in order to
avoid the vagaries of the southern hemisphere winter.

Blair, Ahern push for breakthrough in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Blair's spox.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said they would push ahead Friday
with efforts to persuade parties in Northern Ireland to overcome
differences holding up the peace process.
	   ``Both (leaders) feel a real sense of frustration on the
continuous failure to reach agreement,'' said Blair's spokesman,
Alastair Campbell.
	   Blair and Ahern met for head-to-head talks in the Austrian
capital ahead of the year-end summit of European Union leaders. On
the eve of the leaders' talks, Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews
said they were hoping for a breakthrough that would bring ``a
Christmas bonus for Ireland.''
	   Campbell said Blair would take time out from the EU talks to
phone Northern Irish leaders.
	   Efforts to establish a political settlement to the Northern
Irish conflict have snagged on details of power-sharing
arrangements between Protestant and Catholic parties, the powers of
cross-border institutions involving the Irish Republic and when, if
ever, the outlawed IRA will give up its weapons.
	   ``It simply cannot be impossible to agree on these issues and
move on,'' Campbell told reporters.
	   Andrews met in London with Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam Thursday evening to prepare the Vienna talks.
	   ``It would be really good for everybody and a Christmas present
all round if we could achieve something,'' he said.

Battles between Angolan gov't, rebels spread into countryside
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Heavy fighting between the government army
and UNITA has spread from the rebel group's central highland
strongholds to other towns in the area, the two sides said Friday.
	   A government statement said the UNITA rebels had launched ``a
violent military offensive'' across the central highland provinces
of Bie and Huambo, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA representative contacted by telephone in
Lisbon, Portugal, confirmed the foes were engaged in ``intense
combat'' in various areas of the two provinces.
	   Morgado said battles also were taking place in the northern
province Uige, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of the
capital on the border with Congo.
	   The escalation of the fighting came after the army launched an
air and ground offensive against the UNITA headquarters at Andulo
and Bailundo, in Bie and Huambo provinces, Dec. 4.
	   The attack appeared to mark a definitive end to the ailing 1994
peace pact that halted a two-decade civil war between the foes,
though neither side openly acknowledges that the peace accord has
collapsed.
	   In breach of the peace deal, UNITA had refused to surrender
control of Andulo and Bailundo, where the group's leadership lives,
to the government.
	   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say UNITA
has rearmed over the past year and has a well-equipped guerilla
army of about 30,000 men.
	   The government army numbers some 100,000, though only about
30,000 are believed to be properly trained soldiers.
	   The drawn-out battle for the two small towns indicates the army
has met stronger resistance than expected, the diplomats said.
	   Despite the spread of fighting, aid agencies said Kuito, the
capital of Bie province, and Huambo, the capital of Huambo
province, were calm.
	   World Food Program spokeswoman Maria Flynn said the two cities
were tense and were receiving an influx of thousands of displaced
people.
	   However, the WFP ran two aid flights into the two cities'
airports early Friday, and the main road between them was still
open, she said.
	   WFP bases at nine other provincial capitals in the vast
southwest African nation were operating normally.
	   The civil war erupted after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal. The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace
deal, but the agreement collapsed a year later after UNITA rejected
its defeat in the country's first-ever elections.

Rain delays work on plan to attach ``suspenders'' on Pisa tower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ Heavy rain on Friday delayed the start of the
first steps in a plan to attach steel ``suspenders'' to the Leaning
Tower, the latest strategy aimed at ensuring the monument doesn't
topple over.
	   The engineer overseeing the work, Paolo Heiniger, said the two
sets of 50-millimeter (2-inch) thick cables had been moved to the
base of the 12th-century tower but could not be raised until the
weather improved.
	   The project has run into a series of obstacles, delaying its
start for months. Heiniger said he hoped the cables would be in
place by the end of the month.
	   The 103-meter (340-foot) long cables will be attached to anchors
placed behind the tower and connected to the monument at a height
of 26 meters (86 feet).
	   Heiniger said the cables would serve as a ``precaution,''
against any possible movement of the tower when work begins in 1999
to straighten it.
	   That plan calls for removal of some soil from underneath one
side of the tower to allow it to settle better and lean one-half
degree less. It now leans six degrees or four meters (13 feet) off
the perpendicular.
	   If the soil removal appears to endanger stability, the
``suspenders'' would be pulled tight to hold up the tower. Heiniger
said the chances of this happening were minimal.
	   If all goes well, the braces will be removed.
	   The 55-meter (180-foot) high tower was closed to tourists in
1990 for fear it might topple over.
	   After the closure, several steel bands were placed around the
tower to act as a kind of support girdle.
	   There has been no estimate on when the public would be allowed
to again make the dizzying climb up the tower steps.

Rebels report senior Sudanese officers killed by landmine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two senior Sudanese military officers
were killed when a government vehicle struck a landmine near the
northeastern border town of Kassala, Sudanese rebels said.
	   The chief government operational officer in Kassala and an
intelligence unit officer were killed in the incident near the
border with Eritrea, according to a statement issued Thursday by
the National Democratic Alliance, the umbrella group for Sudanese
dissidents and rebel groups.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   The statement also said two other people, one of them a reporter
for Sudanese state television, were wounded.
	   It said the mine had been planted by the Beja Congress, one of
several opposition groups fighting the Sudanese government.
	   Meanwhile, an Asmara-based spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army fighting in southern Sudan said 84 government
troops had been killed since the SPLA launched an offensive Nov. 18
in the central Nuba Mountains.
	   SPLA spokesman Yasir Arman said only nine rebels were killed.
	   Again, no independent confirmation was available.
	   A study released this week by the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a
humanitarian agency, said an estimated 1.9 million Sudanese have
died in south and central Sudan since 1983 when fighting erupted
between rebels from the Christian and animist south and the
government in the Arab and Islamic north.

Chinese world champions go 1-2 in medley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese swimmers Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan
repeated their world championship 1-2 finish in the final of the
200-meter medley at the Asian Games on Friday.
	   Wu, also the world record holder in the event, set up her
victory with a stunning third 50 meters of breaststroke after
lagging in fourth turning into the second half of the race.
	   Chen was returning to the pool after being struck by a severe
case of diarrhea, which kept her out of two events following her
bronze medal in the 400 medley earlier in the meet.
	   Wu was second in the 400 behind Japan's Yasuko Tajima, who was
fourth in the 200. South Korean Cho Hee-yeon made the early pace,
getting away with a strong butterfly and maintaining her lead after
the backstroke.
	   But Wu, who holds the world record at 2:09.72, stormed to the
lead and finished in 2:15.12, with Chen close behind in 2:15.54.
	   Chen, the world 400 medley champion and record holder, produced
a brave performance as team officials said she was considerably
weakened by her stomach illness.
	   Wu and Chen were China's standout swimmers at this year's world
championships in Perth after the team was demoralized by the
expulsion of six team members on drug charges.
	   Fu Yong, suspended for two years after a positive steroid test
as the 1994 Asian Games, was beaten into second place in the
100-meter backstroke as Keng-Liat Lim gave Malaysia its first gold
medal in the pool at these games.
	   Lim set a games record of 55.53 after converting a flying start
into a good victory over 200 backstroke winner Fu (56.40) and
Raymond Papa of the Philippines.
	   Japan's Takashi Yamamoto secured a men's butterfly double,
adding the 200 gold to his 100 victory earlier in the meet.
	   The 20-year-old from Osaka won easily in 1:56.75, finishing more
than a length in front of China's world shortcourse 400 medley
champion Xie Xufeng (1:59.67). South Korean Han Kyu-chul had the
bronze in 2:00.46.
	   The winning time also gave Yamamoto a second Asian Games record
and helped Japan maintain a lead on the swimming medals table.
	   After 23 events, and three of six Friday, Japan led China 11-9
with Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan holding one gold apiece.

Six get amnesty, five refused for aparthed era crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Six men received amnesty on
Friday for apartheid era crimes, but five others were refused for
acts ranging from armed robbery to murder.
	   In order to qualify for amnesty applicants have to prove they
acted out of a political motive and told the whole truth about
their crimes.
	   In rejecting five applications the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission decided there was no political motive for Phillip
Malefane, who robbed a cash van at a mine in 1991, or Borowsky
Masilela and George Sapele who killed a prison guard in 1992.
	   Amnesty was also refused for Michael Mofokeng and Nkosinathi
Nkabinde who killed a man whose house they were robbing in 1994.
	   All five had claimed to be members of the armed wing of the
radical black nationalist party the Pan-Africanist Congress.
	   Andile Shiceka, Falibango Thanda and Gcinekhaya Makoma, who were
involved in a 1992 bombing in a black township near Cape Town, were
all granted amnesty.
	   The other successul applicants were Thabelo Maseko, for a 1990
murder; Thulasizwe Cele, who killed a fellow member of the African
National Congress who had defected to a rival group; and Sonkalana
Mabhena who tried to kill a policeman in 1992.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended white
rule, the Truth Commission has officially ended its probe into the
murky apartheid past. However, its amnesty operation is continuing
indefinitely due to the sheer numbers of applicants.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rival groups of demonstrators confronted each
other Friday outside the court where former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet faced his first public appearance since his arrest
nearly two months ago on a Spanish extradition warrant.
	   ``Free Pinochet'' supporters chanted from behind police lines
outside Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, 10 miles (15 kms) from the
city center, while others shouted back and waved placards declaring
``Don't let this butcher go!''
	   Police kept the several hundred demonstrators some 10 yards
(meters) apart.
	   The 83-year-old general's new ordeal was the latest step in what
could be years of legal wrangling over his extradition to face
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Court officials moved the hearing from central London to
Belmarsh, a high-security magistrate's court once used to indict
Irish Republican Army gunmen, because of the huge interest.
	   Also Friday, the House of Lords planned to announce how it would
proceed on an extremely unusual appeal by Pinochet's lawyers to
overturn the Lords' decision that Pinochet does not have immunity
from arrest as a former foreign head of state. British newspapers
reported Friday that a hearing on the appeal would be held Tuesday.
	   The grounds of the appeal were not disclosed. But the lawyers
had complained that one of the law lords who ruled Pinochet has no
immunity is the unpaid director of the fundraising arm of Amnesty
International, the human rights group that has played a key role in
a long campaign to have the general put on trial.
	   Amnesty International says Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann did not
take part in the campaign.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said there was no bias in the Lords,
Britain's highest court, when he decided Wednesday to let Spain's
extradition request proceed.

Iranian embassy denies report that it recruited Russian scientists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Iranian Embassy and a senior Iranian scientist
have denied a report that they actively recruited Russian
scientists who previously worked on Russia's germ warfare program.
	   In a statement, the Iranian Embassy said Thursday that the
Iranian government ``has not and will not try under any
circumstances to get access to such types of (biological) arms.''
	   Iran is conducting peaceful biological research programs that
are ``directed at combating AIDS and lung diseases, tuberculosis in
particular,'' the statement added.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had successfully
lured five Russian scientists, and was trying to attract more from
research centers in Russia and Kazakstan.
	   An Iranian scientist identified in the report as a key figure in
the recruiting effort also issued a denial, the Times reported
today.
	   Mehdi Rezayat insisted that his overtures were peaceful and that
he was only trying to obtain medicines and information to make
diagnostic kits, the Times reported.
	   Rezayat, whose business card identifies him as a pharmacologist,
said he was ``astonished'' by the Tuesday report.
	   The Iranian Embassy statement said that the relationship between
Russia and Iran is fully open and that both countries were meeting
their commitments concerning the nonproliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Meanwhile, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
called Thursday for tightened control over the export of equipment
and expertise to Iran.
	   After meeting with visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, Maslyukov said the United States had expressed
concern about apparent unauthorized supplies of Russian missile
expertise and equipment to Iran.
	   Maslyukov demanded specific evidence before Russia would take
any action but added that ``control over exports should be
tightened,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor, and both
countries insist the reactor will only be used to generate power.
	   However, the United States and Israel say that the technology
may help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no plans to
develop such weapons.
	   The United States also has been providing aid to Russian
scientists in recent years in hopes that they will not be tempted
to sell their expertise to countries that want to build weapons of
mass destruction.

honor. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Alexander
Solzhenitsyn would receive the country's top cultural honor in an
announcement Friday, the 80th birthday of Russia's most famous
living writer.
	   Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service before the fatherland and great contributions
to world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
the Interfax news agency.
	   The award, named after the Christian missionary, is one of
Russia's highest honors.
	   Solzhenitsyn is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet
Union's gulags, or prison camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   On Friday, Solzhenitsyn was expected to attend a play,
``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First
Circle.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work. He had already become
internationally famous when Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974.
He lived a secluded existence in Vermont before returning to Russia
in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet regime.

Taiwan's high-flying Nationalists may face turbulence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite a strong showing at the polls,
Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party could see party unity crumble as
members struggle to pick a successor for President Lee Teng-hui, a
party insider said Friday.
	   Though Vice President Lien Chan remains the front runner for the
nomination, he could face a challenge from James Soong, the
influential governor of Taiwan province.
	   Even if Lien prevails, assembling a ticket could still prove
divisive if the party's various factions aren't properly placated,
a high-level party strategist told The Associated Press.
	   ``It's going to be an extremely delicate process and a lot of
things could go wrong,'' the official said in a wide-ranging
interview that was given only on the condition he not be identified
by name.
	   In an extreme case where no ticket emerges that looks strong
enough to win the next presidential election in 2000, Lee might
scrap plans to retire and seek another term at the age of 76,
running on a platform of stability, the party official said.
	   Until Saturday's victory, the 104-year-old Nationalist Party had
seen its influence slipping in recent years amid perceptions of
widespread corruption.
	   The Nationalists won 123 legislative seats, almost twice the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's 70. The only blow for the
party _ and a consolation prize for the DPP _ was the defeat of a
Nationalist incumbent mayor in the big southern city of Kaohsiung.
	   The Nationalists' wins in the legislative races alleviated any
concerns that they might have to share power with the opposition.
The Nationalists won a big enough majority to easily push through
their legislative agenda.
	   The performance puts the Nationalist Party in excellent shape
for the 2000 presidential polls, but a large question mark looms
over the ticket.
	   Though Lien has Lee's blessing, and can boast strong
administrative experience, many voters consider him aloof. Soong
has made himself popular by spending freely on roads, bridges and
water works in his territory, but he lacks Lee's backing and will
lose his power base when his job is eliminated this month as part
of a government streamlining program.
	   Other pitfalls await as the Nationalists attempt to negotiate a
series of constitutional changes next year that are unpopular with
many of the party's elected politicians.
	   For one, the party leadership wants to reduce the powers of the
National Assembly, a congress that is separate from the Legislature
and is responsible for amending the constitution. The Nationalist
leadership wants members of the assembly allocated to parties based
on their percentage of the popular vote, rather than direct
election by voters.
	   Some party legislators also warn the Nationalists must try
harder to change a reputation for corruption, ineptitude and
criminal links. That could mean tossing out suspect members or
altering qualifications for membership.
	   ``A lot of voters still equate a strong Nationalist affiliation
with dirty politics,'' said lawmaker Chao Yung-ching, a Nationalist
who deliberately avoided publicizing his party affiliation during
the election campaign.

University students start hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Demanding better conditions in
dormitories and higher scholarships, 40 students from Tirana and
Shkodra universities have started a hunger strike, officials said
Friday.
	   ``This hunger strike is organized by the leader of the
Democratic Party, Sali Berisha,'' Minister of Information Musa
Ulqini was quoted as saying by the independent daily newspaper
Gazeta Shqiptare.
	   The hunger strike began late Thursday in a disco in the
dormitory complex in Tirana. Students from Shkodra University, in
northern Albania, joined in the protest.
	   Ulqini stressed that the government pledged two months ago to
improve the conditions in the dormitories, known informally as
Student City. About dlrs 70,000 will be invested in the buildings.
	   ``We are not concerned about this hunger strike. We are
determined to resolve all the students' problems. But in every
Albanian house it's the same: no power, no water,'' Ulqini said.
	   The students also want scholarships increased from their current
level of about dlrs 35 a month to dlrs 70.
	   According to the Information Ministry and the Democratic Party,
Berisha's son was interrogated by police Friday morning in
connection with the hunger strike. Shkelzen Berisha, 20, is thought
to be a key member of the group organizing the protest action.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes seven years ago were
instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist leader to call
multiparty elections, and the spread of organized student protests
significantly increased pressure on the government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer led
after the first run of a women's giant slalom Friday, setting up a
possible sweep of the weekend's events.
	   Meissnitzer, who won Thursday's Super-G as the World Cup
returned to European snow, twisted her way around the classic
Piste-G course in 1 minute, 8.53 seconds to take the lead, ahead of
Liechtenstein's Brigit Heeb and Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni.
	   Heeb, who has never won a World Cup race, crossed second in
1:08.78, edging Compagnoni, the winner of the giant slalom at this
French resort last year.
	   Compagnoni, who has 13 career giant slalom victories, sits .56
back.
	   Sweden's Anna Ottosson clocked the fourth best time in 1:09.10,
ahead of Austria's Anita Wachter, fifth in 1:09.18.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course left reigning World Cup
giant slalom champion Martina Ertl back in 11th place with a 1.14
deficit.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin
office on Friday, where he met with several top aides, his
spokesman said.
	   It is the first time Yeltsin has gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   On Friday, the president met with his new chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's
work, the Interfax news agency said, citing presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin also planned to meet Vladislav Sherstyuk, the newly
appointed chief of the government's agency in charge of classified
communications, one of many successors to the former KGB.
	   Yeltsin has been at a country residence, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) outside Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released
from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has handed over responsibility for solving the country's economic
problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

Pakistan has an edge over Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with afternoon play. CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) - Pakistan with a score of 184 for five
had a slight edge over Zimbabwe when stumps were called Friday on
the second day of the second Test.
	   The home team, trailing 1-0 in the three-match series, dismissed
the tourists for 183 on day one.
	   Yousaf Youhanna was batting on 30 not out, with five fours while
captain Moin Khan was unbeaten on 18 when bad light brought play to
an early end.
	   ``Obviously from now on every run will be vital. I am looking
forward to take a lead of around 150. It will put Zimbabweans under
pressure,'' said Khan, who is leading Pakistan after skipper Aamir
Sohail pulled out because of illness. ``This Test is very important
for us. If we get enough of a lead, I hope to square the series.''
	   Earlier, opener Saeed Anwar (75) cracked his 17th Test half
century and was involved in two productive partnerships. Anwar put
on 69 runs for the opening wicket with debutante Mohammad Naveed
and then made a run-a-minute 52 for the second wicket with Ijaz
Ahmed.
	   Naveed, 24, negotiated the four-pronged Zimbabwean pace attack
for two hours with Anwar before Heath Streak got the breakthrough.
	   The Zimbabwean seamer knocked back Naveed's stumps as the
right-hander tried to play an on-drive and missed the line of the
ball.
	   But Anwar completed his half century before lunch as Pakistan
was solidly placed at 111 for 1 at lunch.
	   However, the Zimbabweans hit back after lunch taking four
wickets in just 26 runs.
	   With Pakistan cruising along well at 121 for one, Neil Johnson
found the inside edge of Anwar's bat and wicketkeeper Andy Flower
took a smart catch to his right. Anwar made 75 with the help of 11
fours and faced 114 balls during his three hours at the crease.
	   Ahmed struggled for runs before he played a reckless pull off
Johnson and holed out to Adam Huckle at mid on.
	   Veteran Salim Malik was brilliantly run out by Streak off a
direct throw from covers. He had scored just two off 21 balls.
	   ``It was a sad end,'' Malik said.
	   Hasan Raza offered an easy bat and pad catch to Gavin Rennie
after scoring just three.
	   Johnson, who took two wickets in his second spell, finished the
day with 2-40 while Streak (1-50) and Huckle (1-5) claimed the
other wickets.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin
office on Friday, where he met with several top aides, his
spokesman said.
	   It is the first time Yeltsin has gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   On Friday, the president met with his new chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's
work, the Interfax news agency said, citing presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin also planned to meet Vladislav Sherstyuk, the newly
appointed chief of the government's agency in charge of classified
communications, one of many successors to the former KGB.
	   Yeltsin has been at a country residence, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) outside Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released
from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has handed over responsibility for solving the country's economic
problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

 &UR; EU, Switzerland sign trade pact; Swiss see impetus to renew
membership
 &UR; Eds: Recasts to raise membership issue; UPDATES with quotes.
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After four years of bargaining, the
European Union signed a broad trade pact with Switzerland Friday
which the Swiss government said will spur it to renew its drive for
EU membership.
	   For the Bern government membership is a strategic goal. But in a
1992 referendum, the Swiss people rejected closer economic and
political ties with the rest of Western Europe.
	   The accord signed here took four years to conclude because the
Swiss long resisted a transport deal by banning big trucks from
Swiss roads because of environmental concerns.
	   The Swiss relented last week. On the eve of an European summit
in the Austrian capital, disagreements in six others areas were
ironed out, enabling Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti to fly
here to seal the agreement.
	   The accord covers anything from Swissair's access to EU airports
to wine-labeling to trucking rules to farm trade and cooperation in
research.
	   ``Today is a very important day for Switzerland,'' Cotti told
reporters. If endorsed in a Swiss referendum, the agreement could
take effect in 2001.
	   He restated his government's interest in joining the EU, and
that the agreement here was a stepping stone to that.
	   The Swiss government will ``pursue a broad dialogue with the
people of Switzerland ... Geographically, Switzerland belongs to
Europe,'' said Cotti.
	   EU Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said while
it was up the the Swiss people to decide on EU membership, ``we see
this (trade agreement) as an interesting step. It opens future
avenues for the European integration of Switzerland.''
	   Last week, EU and Swiss negotiators lifted the key hurdle in the
talks, four years after they began. They struck a deal under which
the Swiss agreed to raise the weight limit on trucks crossing the
Swiss Alps to 40 tons from 28 tons by 2005.
	   Switzerland's tight restrictions, fed by environmental concerns,
long upset its neighbors _ Germany France, Austria and Italy. The
Swiss ban meant big trucks had to take North-South routes through
France and Austria, clogging highways and increasing travel times
and transportation costs.
	   ``We have reached a well-balanced package deal,'' Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel. He welcomed the better
distribution of truck traffic across the Alps between Austria and
Switzerland.
	   ``We (Austria) look forward to seeing the Brenner Pass relieved
of traffic,'' he said.
	   In the final hours of the negotiations, negotiators haggled over
the name of a Swiss white wine named after a small lakeside village
called Champagne.
	   The French objected to the use of that name, which is protected
in France. The Swiss argued they only followed their practice of
naming a wine after a village where it is produced.
	   They finally gave in, saying they would drop the name after a
transitional period of two years.
	   After Swiss voters rejected plans for a loose free trade deal
with the EU, the government in Bern was forced to open talks on a
series of bilateral agreements to gain access to crucial export
markets.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When researcher Ron Clarke
announced to the world he had discovered the oldest skeleton of a
human ancestor, top government officials rejoiced and called it a
victory for South African society.
	   But it emerged Friday that South Africa is losing Clarke, one of
the nation's foremost paleo-anthropologists. The University of the
Witwatersrand did not reappoint him for 1999, and he will go to
work for a German university.
	   Wits said that after seven years, Clarke's contract was not
renewed in a ``restructuring.''
	   It would not comment on negative remarks about Clarke by his
supervisor in Friday's Mail and Guardian weekly. The newspaper
quoted Lee Berger as saying Clarke ``has no great record'' or
special skills, and that the excavation site where Clarke made his
reputation needed a rest.
	   Berger, a 32-year-old American who heads the Wits
Paleo-Anthropology Research Group, did not immediately return a
phone message.
	   Clarke will continue to excavate some months of the year at the
site, the Sterkfontein caves near Johannesburg. But his move to a
foreign university will come as a blow to the government,
especially to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   Mbeki has been promoting the idea of an African cultural and
economic renaissance. He appeared at the Wednesday news conference
announcing Clarke's remarkable discovery and referred to him as a
national ``hero.''
	   Clarke ``is among a team of people who are very invaluable to
our country,'' Mbeki's spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa, said Friday.
``His departure, if true, would be a loss, but we hope it will not
be a loss to the human sciences as a whole.''
	   Wits spokeswoman Peggy Jennings called Clarke's find a
``monumental discovery for South Africa.'' She said his departure
was ``sad.''
	   In a telephone interview, Clarke said he took a research job
with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Institute in Frankfurt shortly
after hearing about six months ago he would not be reappointed.
	   ``I was told that because of operational changes my contract
would not be renewed. I don't want to get into any acrimony over
this,'' he said.
	   Wits said it was giving him an honorary appointment in the
Anatomy Department, and that he would continue working at
Sterkfontein. But the university does not have much say in who
manages the site. Only Clarke and his mentor, retired Wits
professor Phillip Tobias, have government permits to run
excavations at the cave, a major repository of human and animal
fossils.
	   On Wednesday, Clarke said the cave had yielded the oldest
complete skeleton of a human ancestor, a 4-foot-tall ape-man dating
back 3.2 to 3.6 million years. The find could shed crucial light on
the anatomy and activity of our earliest forebears.
	   The university's action ``does disturb me,'' said Clarke, an
unfailingly polite researcher who has spent nearly half his
53-years associated with the caves. He added: ``I thought they were
making a very big mistake.''

Turkish court release policemen in slain journalist case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AFYON, Turkey (AP) _ Drawing protests from human rights
activists, a court Friday released five policemen from jail during
their retrial in the beating death of a journalist.
	   The case is viewed as a test of Turkey's promise to crack down
on abuses by its security forces.
	   The officers were sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison in March
for kicking, punching and clubbing 27-year-old Metin Goktepe to
death on Jan. 9, 1996.
	   But an appeals court ordered a new trial, saying the initial
trial had failed to gather all the necessary testimony and
evidence.
	   On Friday, Judge Mustafa Birisik set the officers free ruling
that most of the evidence has been collected. They were ordered not
to leave the country.
	   The trial was adjourned until Jan. 29.
	   Human rights activists joined Goktepe's family outside the court
house to protest the decision to free the policemen.
	   A small leftist party, Freedom and Solidarity, accused the
judges of ``turning a blind eye'' to abuses by security forces by
releasing the policemen.
	   Lawyers for Goktepe's family have been pressing for a maximum
sentence of 15 years for the officers.
	   Goktepe's body was found in an Istanbul park a day after he and
hundreds of other people were detained during a mass funeral for
prisoners killed in jail riots. He was covering the funeral for a
left-wing daily, Evrensel.
	   Six other police officers are also on trial but were freed
earlier.

University students start hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Demanding better conditions in
dormitories and higher scholarships, 40 students from Tirana and
Shkodra universities have started a hunger strike, officials said
Friday.
	   ``This hunger strike is organized by the leader of the
Democratic Party, Sali Berisha,'' Minister of Information Musa
Ulqini was quoted as saying by the independent daily newspaper
Gazeta Shqiptare.
	   The hunger strike began late Thursday in a disco in the
dormitory complex in Tirana. Students from Shkodra University, in
northern Albania, joined in the protest.
	   Ulqini stressed that the government pledged two months ago to
improve the conditions in the dormitories, known informally as
Student City. About dlrs 70,000 will be invested in the buildings.
	   ``We are not concerned about this hunger strike. We are
determined to resolve all the students' problems. But in every
Albanian house it's the same: no power, no water,'' Ulqini said.
	   The students also want scholarships increased from their current
level of about dlrs 35 a month to dlrs 70.
	   According to the Information Ministry and the Democratic Party,
Berisha's son was interrogated by police Friday morning in
connection with the hunger strike. Shkelzen Berisha, 20, is thought
to be a key member of the group organizing the protest action.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes seven years ago were
instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist leader to call
multiparty elections, and the spread of organized student protests
significantly increased pressure on the government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Leaders of the breakaway Abkhazia region
on Friday accused the Georgian government of planning military
actions in a restive province that saw fierce fighting in May.
	   Abkhazian Interior Minister Amazbei Kchach claimed Friday that
the Georgian government had sent 300 fighters to Abkhazia's Ghali
province _ an allegation that was promptly dismissed by officials
in Tbilisi.
	   Georgian leaders countered that Abkhazian officials are
themselves guilty of fomenting tension in the region.
	   ``The Georgian government isn't preparing any military action
and the Abkhazian statement can only be called a provocation,''
said Avtandil Napetvaridze, a spokesman for Georgia's Foreign
Ministry.
	   Abkhazia, a lush region along the Black Sea coast, drove out
Georgian government troops during its 1992-1993 war for
independence. Abkhazia has run its own affairs since then, refusing
to allow return of more than 300,000 ethnic Georgian refugees.
	   The province has been plagued by frequent clashes despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers who have monitored the truce since
1994.

Survey: Vietnam remains the most stressful place for expatriates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Vietnam remains the most stressful country in
Asia for foreigners to work in because of its stubborn bureaucracy,
according to a survey released Friday by a Hong Kong-based think
tank.
	   The survey by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy was
based on the views of 600 expatriates, who were asked to grade the
level of stress they felt in the country where they worked.
	   It said Taiwan was the least stressful place because the
appearance of stability on the island when the rest of the region
was caught up in an economic crisis helped to ``fortify a mood of
confidence among both the local and expatriate population.''
	   South Korea was rated the second most stressful country for
expatriates because South Koreans were brought up in a rigid
society in which stress is a factor from an early age, the survey
said.
	   On a 10-point scale, conditions were most stressful for
expatriates in Vietnam (8.0), followed by South Korea (7.9),
Indonesia (7.8), Thailand (7.4), China (7.3), India (7.0), Malaysia
(6.6), Hong Kong (6.3), Singapore (6.1), Japan (5.9), the
Philippines (5.8) and least so in Taiwan (4.5).
	   Overall, stress levels have fallen almost everywhere since a
1997 survey, which the think-tank attributed to a better
understanding this year of ``the dramatic turn for the worse in
Asia's fortunes.''
	   But it said the improvement in Vietnam may ``reflect less an
improvement in the environment than a exodus of expatriates who
found doing business in Vietnam not worth the effort, leaving
behind a small pool of diehards who have a much higher tolerance
for stress.''
	   The stress in that communist country can be largely attributed
to a bureaucracy that views itself as the ``ultimate defender of an
ideology that is under attack on all sides,'' it said.

Taiwan beats China for women's team gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Janet Lee and Wang Shi-ting rebounded
for a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 doubles victory Friday that gave Taiwan a 2-1
victory over China and the women's team gold medal of the Asian
Games tennis tournament.
	   The victory over Li Fang and Chen Li came after Lee had beaten
China's Yi Jingqian 6-3, 6-4, but teammate Wang had lost to Li Fang
6-1, 6-2 in singles.
	   ``Going into the doubles finals, we were pretty confident on
paper,'' said Lee, `` but we knew that we needed to play well to
win.''
	   Li Fang dominated the court in the first set of the doubles with
her net play and drives down the sidelines, which made Lee scramble
in the back court.
	   ``But it all turned around for us when we were down 3-4 in the
second set,'' said Lee. ``We opened slow because we were tired from
earlier matches, but we got it together.''
	   They also had help from some weak lobbing by Chen Li.
	   Going into the deciding set, the crowd began cheering and
clapping, drawing requests from officials for silence during
points. But portable phones and pagers occasionally beeped, despite
warnings to turn them off.
	   The Chinese pair began to tire, and Lee's powerful ground
strokes gave Wang more chances to attack at the net. The match
ended with a backhand into the net by Li Fang.
	   Semifinal losers Japan and Indonesia shared the bronze.
	   In Saturday's men's final, Japan meets South Korea. Japan
eliminated India 3-0 and South Korea beat Uzbekistan 2-1 in
Friday's semifinals.
	   Singles and doubles start Sunday.

Battles between Angolan government and rebels spread into
</HEADLINE>
countryside &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Heavy fighting between the government army
and UNITA has spread from the rebel group's central highland
strongholds to other towns in the area, the two sides said Friday.
	   A government statement said the UNITA rebels had launched ``a
violent military offensive'' across the central highland provinces
of Bie and Huambo, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA representative contacted by telephone in
Lisbon, Portugal, confirmed the foes were engaged in ``intense
combat'' in various areas of the two provinces.
	   Morgado said battles also were taking place in the northern
province Uige, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of the
capital on the border with Congo.
	   The escalation of the fighting came after the army launched an
air and ground offensive against the UNITA headquarters at Andulo
and Bailundo, in Bie and Huambo provinces, Dec. 4.
	   The attack appeared to mark a definitive end to the ailing 1994
peace pact that halted a two-decade civil war between the foes,
though neither side openly acknowledges that the peace accord has
collapsed.
	   In breach of the peace deal, UNITA had refused to surrender
control of Andulo and Bailundo, where the group's leadership lives,
to the government.
	   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say UNITA
has rearmed over the past year and has a well-equipped guerilla
army of about 30,000 men.
	   The government army numbers some 100,000, though only about
30,000 are believed to be properly trained soldiers.
	   The drawn-out battle for the two small towns indicates the army
has met stronger resistance than expected, the diplomats said.
	   Despite the spread of fighting, aid agencies said Kuito, the
capital of Bie province, and Huambo, the capital of Huambo
province, were calm.
	   World Food Program spokeswoman Maria Flynn said the two cities
were tense and were receiving an influx of thousands of displaced
people.
	   However, the WFP ran two aid flights into the two cities'
airports early Friday, and the main road between them was still
open, she said.
	   WFP bases at nine other provincial capitals in the vast
southwest African nation were operating normally.
	   The civil war erupted after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal. The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace
deal, but the agreement collapsed a year later after UNITA rejected
its defeat in the country's first-ever elections.

Alleged mail bomber sent to jail for mental assessment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The man accused of waging a
nationwide letter-bombing campaign was sent to a psychiatric
hospital for prisoners on Friday amid concern he may try to commit
suicide.
	   Colin Dunstan, 43, is facing 28 counts of endangering life
through the use of an explosive device.
	   He was arrested at Canberra Hospital a week ago after being
admitted with a slashed wrist, climaxing three days of national
panic over letter bombs.
	   One letter bomb exploded at the Canberra mail center Dec. 2,
slightly injuring two postal workers. That led to a nationwide
alert in which 27 similar devices were discovered.
	   Dunstan appeared in the Canberra Magistrates Court on Friday for
a decision on where to carry out a mental health assessment of him.
	   Chief Magistrate Ron Cahill transferred Dunstan to Sydney's Long
Bay's psychiatric hospital and jail, where trained staff would be
able to keep him under observation around-the-clock.
	   Cahill said he was concerned about Dunstan's welfare after
initial psychiatric assessments found that he was at risk of
harming himself.
	   ``If we're wrong it could have fatal results,'' Cahill said.
	   Dunstan, who has made no plea or bail application, was ordered
to reappear in Canberra's Magistrates Court on Dec. 23 following
psychiatric assessment.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a female co-worker in 1990 and 1991,
according to court documents. He blamed this episode for the
breakup of his own marriage.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles. Police
said all of the 28 letter bombs were all addressed to such
authorities.

Three Altetico fans detained for questioning over murder of Real
</HEADLINE>
Sociedad supporter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police were holding three Atletico Madrid
fans for questioning Friday in relation to the fatal stabbing of
Real Sociedad fan Aitor Zabaleta.
	   Zabaleta, 28, died from stab wounds received outside Atletico's
Vicente Calderon, a few hours before Atletico and Real Sociedad
faced each other in a UEFA Cup game on Tuesday. Atletico won the
match 4-1.
	   Police chief Juan Cotino said on National Spanish Radio that the
three suspects, detained late Thursday, had were linked to ``the
criminal world'' and had a record of soccer-related violence.
	   ``They have a history of organizing these kind of incidents,
although nothing so serious, more like going to soccer matches,
breaking things and being violent,'' Cotino said.
	   Police refused to identify the detained trio or confirm reports
that they belonged to a particularly radical group of Atletico fans
known as ``The Bastion.''
	   Madrid-based daily El Mundo reported Friday that the search was
still on for a blond skinhead identified by Zabaleta's girlfriend
as involved in the attack.
	   Zabaleta, his girlfriend and several more Real Sociedad
supporters were drinking in a bar close to the stadium when they
were warned to leave, El Mundo said, quoting one of the group
identified as Juan Barragan.
	   According to the paper, an Atletico fan told Barragan, ``I can
see you're not looking for trouble but you are in the wrong
place.''
	   Taking the hint, the Real Sociedad supporters left the bar but
were followed and attacked, leaving Zabaleta stabbed in the chest,
El Mundo said.
	   Thousands attended a memorial service held for the Real Sociedad
fan Thursday, including the team's lineup and representatives from
Atletico Madrid.
	   The squads of Athletic Bilbao and Alaves - that like Real are
located in Spain's northern Basque region _ also went the service.
	   Zabaleta was due to be buried Friday.

BBC Journalist charged with false news reporting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A Sierra Leonean reporter for the
British Broadcasting Corporation was to appear in court Friday to
answer charges of publishing false news during a recent radio
report on rebel activities close to the capital.
	   Winston Ojukutu Macauley pleaded not guilty Thursday to the
charge of publishing false news likely to cause fear to the public,
in the magistrate court of Freetown.
	   He was granted bail, released and the case was adjourned until
Friday.
	   On Monday, the BBC aired a news report of Macauley's on fighting
between government forces and rebels in the Port Loko district in
the northern region.
	   Later the same day, special state security forces picked
Macauley up for questioning, detaining him until his Thursday
appearance.
	   Officials would not say what false material they believed was
broadcast.
	   His arrest came barely a week after President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah's government announced a clampdown on unapproved press
reports about Sierra Leone's civil war.
	   In a statement, the government said all press reports relating
to the conflict against the country's rebel alliance must be
cleared by the Ministry of Defense or the West African intervention
force, known as ECOMOG, that performs security and national
military functions throughout the country.
	   Unspecified harsh punishment would be meted out on offenders,
the government said.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of the
ousted military junta and its rebel allies since his reinstatement
early this year.
	   Fighting continues and thousands of people are believed to have
been killed, raped and maimed by the rebels in a sweeping revenge
campaign against the government.

`Private Ryan' dying in some Chinese cinemas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Private Ryan helped beat the Nazis on-screen but
couldn't survive in some Chinese cinemas.
	   Steven Spielberg's graphic World War II epic ``Saving Private
Ryan'' is being pulled from some Chinese screens after failing to
match its U.S. box-office success.
	   ``We were forced to finish showing the film five days ahead of
the 25-day schedule through lack of interest,'' Yang Siqing, an
official of the state-run film distributor in the eastern province
of Anhui, told the official Xinhua news agency.
	   Xinhua gave no figures for nationwide earnings but said that in
Anhui, ``Ryan'' failed to make even half its projected revenues of
4 million yuan (dlrs 500,000).
	   At the Huashi Cinema in Beijing, the picture brought in 150,000
yuan (dlrs 18,000) in three weeks, a manager who gave her name as
Miss Li told The Associated Press.
	   That was better than current Chinese releases but far below
earnings for ``Titanic'' and ``True Lies,'' the most successful
foreign films to date in China, Li said.
	   Eight cinemas in Beijing are still showing Spielberg's film, but
others were told by distributors to stop showing it two weeks ago
and start again on Monday, Li said.
	   ``Ryan,'' made by Spielberg's Dreamworks studio, tells the story
of a rescue mission during the invasion of Normandy. Noted for its
realistic battle scenes, it was the No. 1 movie in the United
States for four weeks during the summer, grossing dlrs 190 million
in its first 15 weeks of release.
	   Current Chinese titles in theaters include ``Zhou Enlai's
Diplomacy,'' about the late Chinese prime minister, and ``Days
Without a Hero,'' the latest in a string of movies about 1960s-era
model soldier Lei Feng.

Indonesian, Portuguese news agencies to sign agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's official news agency
Antara said Friday it plans to sign a cooperation agreement with
Portugal's LUSA news agency.
	   The announcement comes as the two countries continue to take
part in U.N.-sponsored negotiations on a possible peace settlement
for the troubled territory of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Antara's managing director Parni Hadi said cooperation between
the two organizations ``will hopefully help efforts to settle the
East Timor question through dialogs held under the aegis of the
U.N. Secretary General.''
	   Antara said the cooperation agreement is to be signed at a
ceremony hosted by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in Jakarta on
Saturday to mark Antara's 61st anniversary.
	   Parni said that under the agreement the two organizations would
share news and place correspondents respectively in each other's
capitals.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in
exchange for an end to a separatist guerrilla war and international
recognition of its sovereignty.

Ethnic Albanian party says Serbian regime reneging on international
</HEADLINE>
obligations
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian party
accused Serbian authorities Friday of reneging on international
commitments by blocking a European probe into atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``The Belgrade regime is in clear breach of its international
obligations,'' said Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the province's major ethnic Albanian political
party.
	   Serb police, using armored vehicles, Thursday prevented a team
of Finnish forensic experts from reaching the graves of 22
massacred ethnic Albanians at a site in central Kosovo.
	   In flak jackets and carrying machine guns, the police halted
their armored vehicles at a crossroads leading into the territory
controlled by ethnic Albanian rebels where the site is located.
	   The police and a Serb investigative team blocked the forensic
experts from driving on, insisting they accompany the Finnish
group.
	   ``Yesterday's events near Obrija are proof that the Serbian
regime is obstructing an international impartial investigation,''
Gashi said.
	   The Finnish team was to begin exhumations at the site _ the
first in a series of six locations in this strife-torn Serbian
province to which Belgrade authorities had previously granted
international access.
	   The spokesman told reporters that the ethnic Albanian side fully
supports international investigations into all cases of wartime
atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``We are not the ones blocking the probe,'' Gashi said, adding
the presence of Serb police and investigating officials ``came as a
surprise.''
	   ``If an investigation is to be impartial, it must be impartially
done,'' he added.
	   If the probe is to include Serb officials, ``we strongly request
there should also be (ethnic) Albanian experts present,'' Gashi
said.
	   Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said his group was
aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians.
	   The experts have no idea when they might be able to begin the
exhumations at Obrinje, which is known in Albanian as Obrija,
Lahelma said Friday.
	   ``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities
in trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' Lahelma said.
	   Lahelma added his team expects the matter to be raised Friday at
a two-day European Union summit in Vienna, and that they were
looking to the EU for guidance. The Finnish team is in Kosovo under
an EU mandate.
	   The Albanian side also accused the Serbian regime of preparing
for new offensives, claiming it had brought in new military and
police reinforcements in the past week.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   A tentative truce is just holding throughout Kosovo but
international officials worry new fighting could break out in the
spring if a peaceful settlement is not reached soon.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sun Tianni outdid her Chinese women
teammates Friday, breaking all three possible world records in
Asian Games 69-kilogram division weightlifting.
	   On the four previous days, Chinese women lifters all had won
gold medals and set world marks, but none had completely rewritten
the records in snatch, jerk and total.
	   Sun's 111 kilograms in the snatch broke the record of 110.5 set
by compatriot Tang Weifang last month, and her 135 in the jerk beat
the mark of 133.5 set by China's Shang Shichun in May. Her total of
245 erased Tang's 242.5, set in April.
	   She finished well ahead of silver medalist Win Win Maw of
Myanmar, who lifted a total of 227.5, and bronze winner Wu Mei-yi
of Taiwan, who hoisted 225. The two were tied after the snatch, in
which each lifted 97.5.
	   Next the 23-year-old Sun planned to phone her boyfriend in
Beijing to ask if he likes the sweater she knitted and sent him
before coming to Bangkok.
	   ``I was confident that I would win gold and make world records.
So it is not surprising,'' she said through an interpreter.
	   U Mya Nyunt, president of the Myanmar Weightlifting Federation,
said, ``We are very satisfied with the silver today. We knew that
we would never get the gold medal if we have to compete with
Chinese. ...
	   ``But who knows, we might get a new and big car as an award from
the government when we return home,'' he joked.
	   Win Win is among seven women weightlifters from Myanmar in the
games. They have won two silver medals and a bronze so far.
	   ``Myanmar did not send any males to compete in these games
because none of them is strong enough. Our girls are stronger than
boys,'' said U Mya Nyunt.

Kurdish rebel leader reportedly ready to quits as PKK president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome was quoted
Friday as saying he is preparing to give up his post as president
of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
	   ``In order to play my international role well, I have to free
myself from some burdens and responsibilities,'' Abdullah Ocalan
said in an interview published in the leftist newspaper Il
Manifesto.
	   ``This way I can give a better contribution to (finding) a
political solution to our crisis,'' Ocalan said.
	   He said he would make a formal announcement Friday on the
London-based Kurdish television station Med TV.
	   Ocalan gave no indication of a successor.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party has been fighting for Kurdish
autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984 in a war that has killed
37,000 and devastated the region.
	   Ocalan, however, fell short of renouncing armed struggle, a
promise he has made several times since his arrival from Moscow on
Nov. 12.
	   ``As far as armed struggle is concerned, there will be no
turning point unless there's some dialogue and a real peace
process,'' the Kurdish leader said.
	   Also on Friday, Italian magistrates questioned Ocalan in the
villa where he's being detained just outside Rome.
	   Later in the day the magistrates were also due to see Ramon
Mantovani, a Communist deputy who accompanied Ocalan on his flight
to Rome. Mantovani could face a charge of aiding illegal
immigration.
	   Ocalan is accused of crimes in both Turkey and Germany. Italy
has refused extradition to Turkey where he might face the death
penalty, and it is now considering the possibility of trying him
here on German charges, which include murder and arson.

German court OK's extradition of terrorist suspect to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court approved the
extradition Friday to the United States of a suspected top aide to
Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire accused of masterminding
deadly bombings at U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   The Federal Constitutional Court voted unanimously not to hear
an appeal by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who argued the extradition
violated his rights. The court called the appeal baseless.
	   Extradition of suspects also requires the approval of the
Foreign Ministry, however, and there was no immediate word on when
it might act.
	   Salim, 40, has been held in Germany since his arrest in Bavaria
three months ago on a U.S. warrant. A state court in Munich first
approved his extradition on Nov. 27.
	   U.S. officials claim he is Bin Laden's finance chief and have
charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of weapons
of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are jailed
in the United States.
	   The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer
collected her World Cup second victory of the weekend on Friday,
winning a women's giant slalom.
	   The 25-year-old Austrian flew down the classic Piste-G course in
a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, a massive .82
ahead of runnerup Deborah Compagnoni, the Olympic champion.
	   Meissnitzer, who won Thursday's Super-G, was quickest down the
first run before posting the second-fastest chrono in the second
for the victory.
	   Anita Wachter, Austria's 31-year-old former World Cup overall
champion, finished third.
	   Wachter, whose career appeared to be over after a crash at the
Olympics last season left her with severe knee injuries, crossed in
an aggregate time of 2:18.31.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course threw reigning World
Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl off course.

Two dailies printed in record numbers because of contests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Two national dailies have hit the
jackpot, selling about five times more newspapers than usual as
readers hope to cash in on contests.
	   When the newspapers reached kiosks Thursday evening, people were
already lined up _ despite freezing temperatures _ to buy dozens of
copies. Several kiosks quickly ran out of papers.
	   In their Friday editions, both Vecernji list and Jutarnji list
published cards with numbers that could be the winning combination
in the weeklong game, which has prizes worth up to dlrs 300,000.
	   Vecernji list, which is Croatia's largest paper with a
circulation of about 150,000, printed 720,000 copies for a country
of 4.7 million people.
	   Jutarnji list, the second best-selling daily, printed 400,000
copies, compared to about 80,000 normally sold.
	   Newspaper sales have rapidly decreased in recent years as Croats
face increased economic hardships and many cannot afford to buy
newspapers.
	   For the two newspapers, the contests are a matter of
competition. But for Croats, who are struggling to make ends meet
with an average monthly salary of dlrs 450, the games are seen as a
way to fulfill dreams.
	   One newspaper costs 4,80 kuna (80 cents). Purchasers have the
chance to win apartments worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,
expensive cars, television sets and other valuable prizes _ which
are necessities for many.
	   ``I need a new refrigerator, new VCR, new car ... the list is
long, and old,'' said 54-year-old factory worker Janica Zilic, who
bought 10 copies of each paper. ``I'm relying on luck now.''
	   Some psychologists say the euphoria over the contests is a
symptom of the economic crisis, while others claim it is the
influence of the West, where the lottery and similar games are
extremely popular.

Russian parliament seeks to control inflation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout with parliament approving bill that limits
money printing for this year. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With inflation at 70 percent and threatening to go
higher, parliament passed a bill Friday that limits the amount of
money the government can print to pay off its massive debts.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has been adding to the
money supply in recent months to help revive ailing banks and pay
off millions of state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   But increasing the money supply also stokes inflation.
Economists warn that printing too much money will spark the kind of
hyperinflation that plagued Russia for several years in the early
1990s.
	   Despite its huge obligations, the government may print only 25
billion additional rubles (dlrs 1.3 billion) in the final quarter
of this year, according to the bill that won overwhelming approval
in parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the
ruble,'' which has fallen sharply since the country's economic
crisis hit in August.
	   The Duma passed the bill on its second reading. It must be
approved one more time before going to parliament's upper chamber,
where its also expected to win passage.
	   In another development Friday, the government said that the
economic crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets
to private investors, and revenues this year were only a fraction
of those forecast.
	   The government had hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles (about dlrs
400 million) by auctioning off state property, but it has earned
only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 70 million) through October, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The cash-strapped government approved a draft budget Thursday
and sent it to parliament Friday. In previous years, the government
and parliament have wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions, and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year,
and has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

South Korea beats Kuwait but both advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea edged Kuwait 1-0 Friday in
a routine second-round match of Asian Games soccer, and both
advanced to the quarterfinals.
	   Earlier in the day in Group 2, United Arab Emirates topped Japan
1-0. Both games were listless affairs as the tournament's hectic
schedule took its toll on the players.
	   In Group 1, North Korea beat winless India 2-0. Uzbekistan,
already in the quarterfinals, topped Turkmenistan 1-0.
	   Uzbekistan finished at 3-0. Turkmenistan and North Korea each
had a win, a loss and a draw and Turkmenistan advanced with a goal
differential of zero.
	   The top two teams of each of four groups move into the final
eight, a knockout competition starting Monday.
	   South Korea finished unbeaten in three matches while Kuwait,
which featured the tournament's top two scorers, ended up 1-2.
	   Japan and the UAE also ended the second round at 1-2, but
because of its superior goal differential, Kuwait advanced even
without beating South Korea.
	   South Korea stayed unbeaten but didn't have to exert itself
after Japan's loss put it definitely in the quarterfinals. Kuwait
was all but assured of a berth.
	   After playing without much feeling and not penetrating, South
Korea finally scored 12 minutes into the second half on Choi
Yong-soo's seventh goal of the Asian Games, sending the
ever-exuberant South Korea fans into further chants of joy and drum
beating.
	   Choi found a long pass from midfield at his feet at the top of
the penalty area and fired it low in the net.
	   That brought him within one goal of the top two scorers, Jasem
Al-Huwaidi and Farj Laheeb, with eight apiece.
	   The Kuwaiti duo has been held to one goal in the last two
matches. Laheeb scored his country's only goal against Japan in a
2-1 loss Wednesday.
	   Midway through the second half, An Hyo-yeon challenged Kuwait
goalie Khalid Al Fadhli outside the penalty area, brought the ball
under control and fired into the net but the goal was disallowed
because he touched it with his hand. An was given a yellow card.
	   Korean coach Huh Jong-moo found his team fatigued.
	   ``It's very hard, very bad for the players. Very bad,'' Huh
said. ``Every team has the same problem.''
	   The UAE, although also tired, found its form against Japan after
defeats to Kuwait and South Korea.
	   Though the first half ended scoreless, the Gulf team, paced by
Hassan Saeed Rashid and Ali Saeed Rashid, showed flair and pierced
the Japanese defense.
	   Japan looked tired and sluggish after its upset of Kuwait
Thursday, which kept alive Japanese dreams of a quarterfinal for
two more days.
	   Japan brought a young team to the Asian Games but was hoping for
a good showing as preparation for the 2000 Olympics and the 2002
World Cup, for which it is co-host with South Korea.
	   Both sides fought for their goal but Hassan got there first, in
the 59th minute, scoring UAE's fourth goal in four matches.
	   A long free kick in the goal area dived into a jumble of heads
and feet before substitute Kazim Ali Abdulla gained control and
shipped a short cross to Hassan, who pushed the ball in from
point-blank range.
	   Falling behind lifted Japan's energy but it was unable to mount
a consistent attack.
	   Shinsuki Nakamura, Kazuyuki Toda, Toshiya Ishii and Kenji Fukuda
pressed the attack dangerously close but either shot wild or
crashed into a swarm of red shirts.
	   The first half was notable for six minutes of injury time,
mostly taken up by the bandaging of Japan goalkeeper Yuta Minami's
head after he was chopped down by a flying elbow from Mohammad
Ibrahim Alboloshi.
	   The rest came from a bizarre kick from behind by Japanese
captain Tsuneyau Miyamoto that connected with Alboloshi's face and
brought him down. Miyamoto drew his second yellow card of the
games.
	   Carlos de Queiroz of Portugal, who took over the UAE team three
months ago, complained that his team was fatigued after playing
four matches in nine days.
	   ``The players become tired and their reaction time is not the
same,'' de Queiroz said.
	   Like his counterpart for Japan, Frenchman Philippe Troussier, de
Queiroz brought a young team in preparation for the Olympics.
	   The intense pace of the Asian Games tournament, de Queiroz said,
was too much for young players to cope with.
	   ``From a physiological point of view, they can't recover,'' de
Queiroz said.
	   Troussier agreed.
	   ``In this weather and in this schedule, the players cannot
concentrate their efforts. With one more day, the players can
change their efforts 100 percent,'' Troussier said.
	   There are four matches that conclude the second round Saturday
and the first- and second-place teams of the other two groups
advance.

Museveni: withdrawal of Ugandan troops depends on border security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda is prepared to withdraw its troops
from neighboring Congo as long as security is assured along its
western frontier, President Yoweri Museveni said Friday.
	   ``Uganda may be ready to withdraw from the Congo any time, even
if it is tomorrow,'' the Ugandan leader told a news briefing. ``But
let's have a guarantee against insecurity.''
	   Uganda sent troops into Congo in August when a rebellion broke
out against President Laurent Kabila but claimed they were there
under a previous agreement with Kinshasa that allowed Uganda to
hunt down Ugandan rebels based in eastern Congo.
	   Only recently did Museveni acknowledge that Ugandan troops were
in eastern and northern Congo in support of the Congolese rebels.
	   ``We are after a peaceful settlement of the Congolese problem,''
Museveni said. ``But these two conditions must be fulfilled first:
do not endanger the security of Rwanda and Uganda and do not side
with the people bent on genocide, even within the Congo.''
	   Rwanda and Uganda helped Kabila take power after their combined
forces toppled longtime ruler Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 after an
eight-month rebellion.
	   Museveni said once in power, Kabila ignored Ugandan and Rwandan

militia who had carried out the government-orchestrated slaughter
of at least half a million minority Tutsis in 1994.
	   Museveni said Uganda had been pushing for a cease-fire in the
four-month Congolese rebellion, but he blamed recent attacks by
Zimbabwean fighter planes on rebel positions in eastern Congo for
thwarting peace efforts.

equipment to bolster Kabila's forces against the Ugandan and

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese swimmers Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan
repeated their world championship 1-2 finish in the final of the
200-meter medley at the Asian Games on Friday.
	   Wu, also the world record holder in the event, set up her
victory with a stunning third 50 meters of breaststroke after
lagging in fourth turning into the second half of the race.
	   China's Jiang Chengji also had a lightning lap Friday, becoming
the fourth fastest swimmer in the world this year in the frenzied
50-meter men's freestyle. Jiang, who was fourth at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics before a slump in form, clocked 22.38 seconds.
	   Only Brazil's Fernando Scherer (22.18), Russian Alexander Popov
(22.27) and American world champion Bill Pilczuk have gone faster
this year.
	   Chen, meanwhile, was returning to the pool after being struck by
a severe case of diarrhea, which kept her out of two events
following her bronze medal in the 400 medley earlier in the meet.
	   Wu was second in the 400 behind Japan's Yasuko Tajima, who was
fourth in the 200. South Korean Cho Hee-yeon made the early pace,
getting away with a strong butterfly and maintaining her lead after
the backstroke.
	   But Wu, who holds the world record at 2:09.72, stormed to the
lead and finished in 2:15.12, with Chen close behind in 2:15.54.
Cho took the bronze.
	   Chen, the world 400 medley champion and record holder, produced
a brave performance as team officials said she was considerably
weakened by her stomach illness.
	   Wu and Chen were China's standout swimmers at this year's world
championships in Perth after the team was demoralized by the
expulsion of six team members on drug charges.
	   Fu Yong, suspended for two years after a positive steroid test
as the 1994 Asian Games, was beaten into second place in the
100-meter backstroke Friday as Lim Keng Liat gave Malaysia its
first gold medal in the pool at these games.
	   Lim set a games record of 55.53 after converting a flying start
into a good victory over 200 backstroke winner Fu (56.40) and
Raymond Papa of the Philippines.
	   Japan's Takashi Yamamoto secured a men's butterfly double,
adding the 200 gold to his 100 victory earlier in the meet.
	   The 20-year-old from Osaka won easily in 1:56.75, finishing more
than a length in front of China's world shortcourse 400 medley
champion Xie Xufeng (1:59.67). South Korean Han Kyu-chul had the
bronze in 2:00.46.
	   The winning time also gave Yamamoto a second Asian Games record
and helped Japan maintain a lead on the swimming medals table.
	   The Japanese women's 4x100-meter relay team extended Japan's
dominance before China rallied again through Jiang.
	   After 25 events, and five of six Friday, Japan led China 12-10
with Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan holding one gold apiece.

Russian foreign minister meets with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister met U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Friday and they were expected
to discuss the flow of weapons technology to the Middle East.
	   No details were available concerning the closed-door meeting
between Talbott and Igor Ivanov. But one of Talbott's key concerns
with Russia in the past has been disarmament and arms control,
including U.S. fears that Russian is not doing enough to prevent
weapons technology from going to countries such as Iran.
	   Talbott arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night, leading a group of
officials planning to discuss a range of issues, including Russia's
economic crisis.
	   Talbott was expected to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
later in the day.
	   Also, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
traveling with Talbott, met with Russian Economics Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants.
	   They discussed Russia's economic problems and the possibility of
investments in Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.

Vieira to face police witnesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal's French midfielder Patrick Vieira will
face three police witnesses at an English Football Association
hearing Monday who will testify he had a physical confrontation
with a police officer in a Sept. 26 match at Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Vieira was charged with misconduct by the F.A. over the
incident.
	   Vieira was charged by the F.A. with inciting Sheffield Wednesday
supporters by making gestures as he left the field after the match
and of pushing a police officer at the entrance of the players'
tunnel.
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has also maintained nothing
happened in the alleged incident.
	   Vieira could face a fine and a playing ban if he's found guilty.
	   The match was marked by several confrontations between players
from both sides. Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was
banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,500) for
pushing referee Paul Alcock to the ground during the match.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Alexandra Meissnitzer won her second
race in as many days and her fourth this season on Friday,
capturing a giant slalom by nearly a full second.
	   The 25-year-old Austrian flew down the classic Piste-G course in
a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, .82 ahead of
runner-up Italy's Deborah Compagnoni.
	   Meissnitzer, who won Thursday's super-giant slalom, led after
the first run and posting the second-fastest time in the second for
the victory.
	   Anita Wachter, Austria's 31-year-old former World Cup overall
champion, finished third.
	   Wachter, whose career appeared to be over after a crash at the
Olympics last season left her with severe knee injuries, finished
in 2:18.31.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course threw reigning World
Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl off course.

Aid agencies say Senegal blocking supplies into Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers said Friday that Senegalese
troops were blocking convoys carrying food and medicine from
crossing the border into Guinea-Bissau where thousands of people
are in urgent need of supplies due to a five-month conflict.
	   ``The Senegalese won't let us through,'' said Serafim Jorge, a
spokesman for International Medical Assistance, or AMI, a
Portuguese relief group working in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Senegal deployed some 3,000 troops in the tiny West African
country and former Portuguese colony in June, sent to help
President Joao Bernardo Vieira contain a military rebellion.
	   ``It's faster and easier to fly (supplies) from Dakar or
Lisbon,'' Jorge said in Lisbon.
	   AMI recently flew six tons of food and medicines from Portugal's
capital, Lisbon, into the town of Gabu in eastern Guinea-Bissau,
some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Senegalese border, he said.
	   About Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were displaced by
the fighting triggered by the rebellion that ended in November when
Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane agreed to cease
hostilities and form a government of national unity.
	   Both sides have agreed that rebel candidate Francisco Fadul will
be the new Prime Minister, but have yet to reach a consensus on the
remaining cabinet.
	   The pact also called for the withdrawal of Senegalese troops and
the deployment of a west African peacekeeping force, due to arrive
later this month.
	   Civil war broke out June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime.
	   Under the peace agreement, presidential elections are to be held
by March 1999.

Scandal escalates as SLOC officials summoned to IOC meeting

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ In an escalating scandal, Salt Lake
City organizers were summoned by Olympic leaders Friday to explain
the scholarship payments made to relatives of IOC members during
the successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) were
ordered to appear Friday afternoon before the International Olympic
Committee executive board.
	   In a clear sign that the IOC views the matter as extremely
serious, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch sent the case
directly to the decision-making board _ the inner cabinet of the
Olympic movement.
	   Previously, the issue had been referred to the IOC juridical
commission, an advisory panel dealing with ethical and legal
issues.
	   ``This is a serious matter,'' IOC director general Francois
Carrard said. ``You have allegations which are serious, there is no
doubt. We want facts and evidence to take any action. The matter is
serious enough that the IOC executive board will take care of it.''
	   The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid
committee for the 2002 games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a ``bribe.''
	   Carrard said Samaranch had followed the case since news of the
fund was first revealed two weeks ago by a Salt Lake television
station.
	   ``Things in the meantime have accelerated with new developments,
new allegations,'' he said. ``It's normal for the executive board
to take it over.''
	   Carrard declined to speculate on what _ if any action _ could be
taken against Salt Lake or any IOC members.
	   ``We will want to know all the facts _ what, who, how,'' he
said. ``We want to be on sure ground to know what action we are
taking.''
	   Carrard said it's the most serious case of alleged ethical
misconduct investigated by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert
Helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick
eventually resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the
U.S. Olympic Committee.
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between IOC votes on the 1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' said Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the
IOC oversight panel for the 2002 gams.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne Friday,
welcomed the IOC investigation.
	   ``I think that's who the matter should be taken up by,'' he told
The Associated Press. `` Of course, we intend to collaborate fully
with the IOC and its investigation.''
	   Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's
image.
	   ``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he
said.
	   Asked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he
hadn't seen the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. But he
sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a
distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the
current organizing committee.
	   ``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the
bid commitee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing committee
certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would
stand any investigation. The facts were in the early 1990s when the
bid committee was operating.''
	   U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky
described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image
and preparations for the games.
	   ``It doesn't do us any good at all,'' he said. ``I hope we see a
speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be a
footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter.''
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Salt Lake organizers have refused to identify the other IOC
relatives who received scholarships.

APEC senior officials voice support for U.S. initiative on social
</HEADLINE>
safety net
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Senior officials from the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group have voiced initial support for a U.S. proposal
to strengthen social safety nets in the economically stricken
region.
	   ``There was strong support for the proposal'' among APEC
representatives who met in Singapore on Thursday and Friday, New
Zealand's senior official Maarten Wevers told reporters.
	   At the APEC summit in Malaysia last month, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright recommended that the 22-nation grouping
give high priority in the coming year to developing provisions for
people suffering from Asia's economic crisis.
	   During the two-day meeting in Singapore, the first formal
gathering of APEC officials since the Kuala Lumpur summit, there
was broad discussion about the initiative and wide support to
proceed with the proposal as soon as possible.
	   ``The United States indicated its general thinking, and they're
going to come back to us with a structured proposal,'' said Wevers.
	   The initiative, which focuses more on the mechanics of building
a social safety net than on funding one, could include provisions
for health services and increased access to food and housing.
	   ``There are a number of elements to this proposal, but we're
really looking at those groups of society that have been most
adversely impacted by the crisis,'' he added.
	   Wevers said that the senior officials accepted a U.S. offer to
lead a task force on the initiative. They hope to establish the
task force by February, when the APEC officials next meet in
Wellington, New Zealand.
	   The grouping also plans to hold its next summit in New Zealand,
which now effectively holds the APEC chair.
	   ``Clearly, the scale of the problem is enormous, and of course
the resources are limited, as they always are,'' said Wevers.
	   ``So its a matter of working out how we can best target our
efforts, but also ... how we can share our expertise in dealing
with these sorts of issues.''

British literary critic Tony Tanner dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Tony Tanner, a prolific literary
critic and popular professor who introduced the study of American
literature at Cambridge University, has died, according to British
news accounts. He was 63.
	   The news reports, which said Tanner died of cancer Dec. 5, did
not disclose the location of his death.
	   Born in Surrey, south London, Tanner graduated from Cambridge's
Jesus College with an English degree after spending two years of
military service in the Intelligence Corps.
	   His fascination with American literature led him next to the
University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University for a
prestigious Harkness Scholarship in the late 1950s.
	   He returned to Cambridge in 1960 with a passion for the subject.
His doctoral dissertation on wonder and naivete in American
literature became the first on an American subject to be accepted
by the Cambridge English faculty.
	   After the awarding of his doctorate in 1964, Tanner was almost
immediately appointed to a teaching position.
	   He eventually convinced the university to offer a master's
degree in American literature and, in 1989, was appointed to the
university's first chair in American literature.
	   His first book, ``The Reign of Wonder,'' a study of the work of
Henry James, Mark Twain and Ralph Waldo Emerson that grew out of
his dissertation, brought him prominence in America after its
publication in 1965.
	   He followed with ``City of Words,'' a study of contemporary
American literature, and also wrote about Saul Bellow, Thomas
Pynchon, Joseph Conrad and Jane Austen.
	   Tanner's last book, 1992's ``Venice Desired,'' included chapters
on Lord Byron, John Ruskin and Marcel Proust. Most recently, he
edited and wrote introductions for a series called ``Shakespeare
for Everyman.''
	   As a professor, Tanner was known as a gentle and generous
teacher, prompting occasional criticism from colleagues that he was
too soft on students.
	   He is survived by his wife, Nadia Fusini, a translator and
critic whom he married in 1979. No details were available about
funeral arrangements.

Rain delays work on plan to attach ``suspenders'' on Pisa tower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: WRITESTHRU with BACKGROUND throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ Heavy rain on Friday delayed the start of the
first steps in a plan to attach steel ``suspenders'' to the Leaning
Tower, the latest strategy aimed at ensuring the monument doesn't
topple over.
	   The engineer overseeing the work, Paolo Heiniger, said the two
sets of 50-millimeter (2-inch) thick cables had been moved to the
base of the 12th-century tower.
	   Workers were waiting to see if rain let up later in the day to
begin work.
	   The project has run into a series of obstacles, delaying its
start for months. Heiniger said he hoped the cables would be in
place by the end of the month.
	   The 103-meter (340-foot) long cables will be attached to anchors
placed behind the tower and connected to the monument at a height
of 26 meters (86 feet).
	   Heiniger said the cables would serve as a ``precaution,''
against any possible movement of the tower when work begins in 1999
to make it lean less.
	   That plan calls for removal of some soil from underneath one
side of the tower to allow it to settle better and lean one-half
degree less. It now leans six degrees or four meters (13 feet) off
the perpendicular.
	   If the soil removal appears to endanger stability, the
``suspenders'' would be pulled tight to hold up the tower. Heiniger
said the chances of this happening were minimal.
	   If all goes well, the braces will be removed.
	   Construction of the 55-meter (180-foot) high tower began in
1173. The soil underneath it gave way when it was just 10.5 meters
(34 feet) high, causing it to start leaning, but architects managed
to complete it in 1350.
	   Galileo is said to have used the tower to test his theories on
falling bodies.
	   The tower, which has eight stories of round arches and a spiral
staircase leading to the top, was closed to tourists in 1990 for
fear it might topple over.
	   After the closure, several steel bands were placed around the
tower to act as a kind of support girdle.
	   There has been no estimate on when the public would be allowed
to again make the dizzying climb up the tower steps.

Security tightened around Maasai Mara game Reserve

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Security has been tightened around the
world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve after a gang of three hooded
men attacked tourists headed there, Kenya Wildlife Service Director
Richard Leakey said Friday.
	   ``We have a massive operation going on. I have all my top people
in the district dealing with this, and I am very comfortable that
we will get this crowd of three,'' Leakey told a news conference.
	   ``I say this because there is a tendency of people to get
excited about insecurity when something like this happens.''
	   In two separate incidents Thursday on the same stretch of road,
bandits attacked six tourist vans and stole valuables and
passports. No one was reported injured. The attacks were the
seventh and eighth this year in the same place.
	   ``We know the exact identity of this gang of three, and it is my
honest belief that with the continued cooperation of the Kenya
police in the district, the combined forces of KWS and the police
will pick these people up,'' Leakey said, ``I hope this is an
incident I will be able to announce as closed.''
	   Police in Narok District where the reserve is located said
Friday they had arrested one of the bandits and recovered much of
the stolen property.
	   Leakey, who was the first director of the KWS when it was
launched in 1989, took over again last month. His swift appearance
before the press following the incidents was a break from past
practice.
	   It was not clear how many tourists were involved, but each van
can carry about seven. Police said most of the tourists involved
were British.
	   Most visitors to the Maasai Mara, one of Africa's major game
areas, travel by road from Nairobi.
	   It is also possible to fly into various landing strips inside
the reserve.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome was quoted
Friday as saying he is preparing to give up his post as president
of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
	   ``In order to play my international role well, I have to free
myself from some burdens and responsibilities,'' Abdullah Ocalan
said in an interview published in the leftist newspaper Il
Manifesto.
	   ``This way I can give a better contribution to (finding) a
political solution to our crisis,'' Ocalan said.
	   A formal announcement, initially scheduled for Friday on the
London-based Kurdish television station Med TV, was postponed to
Sunday, said Hikmet Tabak, the TV's managing editor.
	   Ocalan gave no indication of a successor, but Tabak suggested
that a small committee of PKK commanders could replace him, with
one being appointed as leader on a rotating basis.

Aid agencies say Senegal blocking supplies into Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers said Friday that Senegalese
troops were blocking convoys carrying food and medicine from
crossing the border into Guinea-Bissau where thousands of people
are in urgent need of supplies due to a five-month conflict.
	   ``The Senegalese won't let us through,'' said Serafim Jorge, a
spokesman for International Medical Assistance, or AMI, a
Portuguese relief group working in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Senegal deployed some 3,000 troops in the tiny West African
country and former Portuguese colony in June, sent to help
President Joao Bernardo Vieira contain a military rebellion.
	   ``It's faster and easier to fly (supplies) from Dakar or
Lisbon,'' Jorge said in Lisbon.
	   AMI recently flew six tons of food and medicines from Portugal's
capital, Lisbon, into the town of Gabu in eastern Guinea-Bissau,
some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Senegalese border, he said.
	   About half Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were displaced
by the fighting triggered by the rebellion that ended in November
when Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane agreed to cease
hostilities and form a government of ational unity.
	   Both sides have agreed that rebel candidate Francisco Fadul will
be the new Prime Minister, but have yet to reach a consensus on the
remaining cabinet.
	   The pact also called for the withdrawal of Senegalese troops and
the deployment of a west African peacekeeping force, due to arrive
later this month.
	   Civil war broke out June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime.
	   Under the peace agreement, presidential elections are to be held
by March 1999.

Iran blasts Palestinians for removing anti-Israeli clause
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian cleric on Friday criticized
the Palestinian Authority for removing an anti-Israeli clause from
a national charter, Iranian television reported.
	   In a Friday prayer sermon, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
who is now head of the Expediency Council, also ``called for
vigilance in the face of various conspiracies hatched by America in
the region'' state-run Tehran television reported.
	   On Thursday, the Palestine Central Council, a decision-making
body, voted to remove clauses in the Palestinian National Charter
that called for Israel's destruction. It was a step toward
fulfilling a peace deal with Israel.
	   Tehran television said Rafsanjani ``denounced the removal of (a
clause on) the campaign against the Zionists.'' It did not
elaborate.
	   The Iranian government does not recognize Israel and echoes
hard-line Palestinians' demand for the destruction of the Jewish
state.
	   Rafsanjani also denied that Iran had ever tried to obtain
nuclear or chemical weapons, even during its 1980-88 war with Iraq.
	   He accused the United States of trying to stop Iran from
obtaining nuclear and biological technology meant for peaceful use.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had successfully
lured five Russian scientists, and was trying to attract more from
research centers in Russia and Kazakstan, to develop germ-warfare
weapons for itself.
	   Mehdi Rezayat, an Iranian scientist identified in the report as
a key figure in the recruiting effort, also issued a denial, the
Times reported.
	   Rezayat insisted that he was only trying to obtain medicines and
information to make diagnostic kits, the Times said.
	   The Iranian Embassy in Moscow has already rejected the report,
saying that cooperation with Russia was transparent and meant only
for peaceful purposes.

Dozens of newly purchased tanks arrive in Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Most of the 90 tanks Uganda bought from
the Ukraine arrived this week after being delayed at port in
neighboring Tanzania, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
said Friday.
	   The 64 tanks arrived by rail from Tanzania and were driven by
truck to Masaka, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the capital
Kampala, where the army set up roadblocks to clear their passage,
the newspaper said.
	   The government and army have refused comment on the tanks.
	   It was unclear whether the 16 remaining tanks were still in the
port of Dar es Salaam.
	   The London-based newsletter Africa Confidential said in its Dec.
4 issue that the tanks were believed intended for operations
against the Sudanese-backed Lord's Resistance Army rebels operating
in northern Uganda or to assist the Sudan People's Liberation Army
carrying out a 15-year civil war against Khartoum in southern
Sudan.
	   Ugandan troops are also in eastern and northern Congo where they
are backing rebels attempting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   In a conference in Kampala this week, donor countries expressed
concern that international assistance for development projects was
being diverted to Uganda's military efforts.
	   The donors pledged dlrs 2.2 billion to Uganda for three years on
the condition the money reaches its target expenditures in the
areas of health, education, roads and agriculture.
	   Africa Confidential said it was not clear how much the tanks
cost or how they were paid for.

	   ``But I am determined to complete the remaining 21 days,''
Othman Ayeb, 31, insisted Friday, after having spent six days in a
glass case with the serpents.
	   Othman won the title of World Snake King in an international
snake-charming contest held earlier this year. But he's now eying a
record held by another snake charmer who lived in a cage for 20
days with 100 poisonous snakes.
	   Earlier, while posing for photographers with a dozen cobras
draped around his neck, one of them bit him on the thigh.
	   Without batting an eye, he took a knife, gouged out his flesh in
the affected area, and sucked out the venom.
	   His record-breaking attempt has drawn about 3,000 tourists to
Langkawi island in northern Malaysia, including Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who paid him a visit last week.
	   Ayeb is scheduled to crawl out of the snake pit on Jan. 2.

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Several hundred Protestant
hard-liners threw stones and fireworks at police lines overnight
near Portadown, where low-level clashes have persisted since
authorities blocked an Orange Order march this summer.
	   No one was injured, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said Friday.
	   Orangemen and their supporters have mounted occasional
late-night rallies in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) west of Belfast,
ever since July when police and British soldiers prevented their
annual march from passing near Catholic homes along the town's
Garvaghy Road.
	   Many Catholics resent the traditional Orange marches as
provocative. For the past four Julys, militant Garvaghy Road
residents have tried to block the march, forcing authorities to
decide which side's rights should prevail.
	   Orangemen have maintained a token picket for the past six months
in farm fields outside Drumcree Anglican church, where last July's
march was blocked. Last week, 10 officers and four protesters were
injured in skirmishes there.
	   The Orange Order _ which has institutional links with the Ulster
Unionist Party led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate David Trimble _ is
organizing mass protests in Portadown on Dec. 19, Dec. 23 and Jan.
2 in a bid to force authorities to reverse their decision.
	   Trimble, who received the Nobel honor along with Catholic
politician John Hume in Oslo, Norway, on Thursday, supports the
Orangemen's right to march.
	   But he has called for the protests to stop on the grounds they
have triggered violence across Northern Ireland, including the
burning to death of three Catholic boys in July and the slaying of
a policeman in Portadown in October.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top prosecutor, the man who was
investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, has
himself been abducted by unidentified assailants, officials said
Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said Tagirov was seized by
attackers, and they speculated that it was the work of an armed
band seeking the release of one of their colleagues from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man, and they claimed he had confessed
to kidnapping the four foreigners. The suspect was identified as
Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching Friday for
additional suspects as well as the the bodies of the four
foreigners.
	   Atgeriyev said he did not place any value in a videotape that
showed one of the four victims saying he was spying for Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been
sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the
breakaway republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the government
got it.
	   Great Britain's Embassy in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape,
spokesman Michael Haddock said on Friday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said the British
government agents could come to Chechnya to investigate the
slaying, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

China breaks diplomatic relations with Marshall Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China broke diplomatic ties with the Marshall
Islands on Friday, three weeks after the South Pacific nation
formally recognized the rival government of Taiwan.
	   China's ambassador to the Marshall Islands, Zhao Lianyi, lodged
a complaint with the Marshall Islands government and announced that
diplomatic relations were broken effective Friday, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The break was anticipated, but there was no indication why
Beijing waited to make it official.
	   China insists that all countries with whom it has diplomatic
ties must break relations with Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as a
renegade province with no right to international relations.
	   Taiwan and China have been separate entities since a civil war
ended in 1949. Beijing insists the island must eventually be
reunited with the mainland.
	   With the addition of the Marshall Islands, Taiwan's small pool
of diplomatic allies stands at 27. It lost four other allies this
year when South Africa, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and
Tonga switched sides to China.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The Slovak Football Association
board appointed Dusan Galis to coach the country's national soccer
team, Slovak papers reported Friday.
	   Galis, who also coaches the country's top league team, FC
Spartak Trnava, will be the national team's official coach until
the end of 1999. He will continue to coach both teams until his
contract with Trnava expires at the end of next June.
	   The previous national coach, Jozef Jankech, was dismissed last
October, after Slovakia lost to Portugal 3-0 in the qualifying
round of the European Championship.
	   Galis coached Slovak Bratislava team from 1992-96, leading them
to three Slovak league championships and one Czechoslovak league
crown, before the country split peacefully in 1993.

Ethnic Albanian party says Serbian regime reneging on international

obligations
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian party
accused Serbian authorities Friday of reneging on international
commitments by blocking a European probe into atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``The Belgrade regime is in clear breach of its international
obligations,'' said Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the province's major ethnic Albanian political
party.
	   Serb police, using armored vehicles, Thursday prevented a team
of Finnish forensic experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic
Albanians at the town of Obrinje, also known as Obrija, in central
Kosovo.
	   Wearing flak jackets and carrying machine guns, the police
halted the Finnish team at a crossroads leading into the area of
the alleged massacre, which is in territory controlled by militants
who are pushing for independence for the province's Albanian
majority.
	   Government forces cracked down on the militants in February, and
hundreds of people were killed in the offensive, and in periodic
violence since an October truce.
	   The Finnish team was to begin exhumations at the site _ the
first in a series of six locations in this strife-torn Serbian
province to which Belgrade authorities had previously granted
international access.
	   ``Yesterday's events near Obrija are proof that the Serbian
regime is obstructing an international impartial investigation,''
Gashi said.
	   Gashi said the ethnic Albanian side fully supports international
investigations into all cases of wartime atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``We are not the ones blocking the probe,'' he said, adding the
presence of Serb police and investigating officials ``came as a
surprise.''
	   ``If an investigation is to be impartial, it must be impartially
done,'' Gashi said.
	   If the probe is to include Serb officials, ``we strongly request
there should also be (ethnic) Albanian experts present,'' he said.
	   Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said his group was
aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians.
	   The experts have no idea when they might be able to begin the
exhumations at Obrinje, Lahelma said Friday.
	   ``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities
in trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' he said.
	   Lahelma added his team members expected the matter to be raised
Friday at a two-day European Union summit in Vienna, and that they
were looking to the EU for guidance. The Finnish team is in Kosovo
under an EU mandate.
	   The Albanian side also accused the Serbian regime of preparing
for new offensives, saying it has deployed new military and police
reinforcements in the past week.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   A tentative truce is just holding throughout Kosovo but
international officials worry new fighting could break out in the
spring if a peaceful settlement is not reached soon.

 &UR; Coca-Cola acquiring Cadbury Schweppes' drinks brands in 120
countries &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Coca-Cola Co. is buying Cadbury Schweppes'
soft drinks brands in 126 countries in a deal estimated at dlrs
1.85 billion, the companies announced Friday.
	   The deal covers Schweppes and Canada Dry mixers, Dr Pepper and
Crush, the companies said. The transactions, which do not apply to
the United States, France and South Africa, also include
acquisition of beverage plants in Ireland and Spain.
	   John Sunderland, chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes, said the
London-based company did not have the distribution systems
necessary to make a worldwide beverage operation succeed, and
wanted to focus instead on increasing its 15 percent carbonated
beverage market share in the United States, the world's largest
soft drinks market.
	   ``Outside the United States, we only have a 3 percent market
share,'' Sunderland said at a news conference in London.
	   He predicted that his company would use funds from the sale to
focus on expanding its remaining businesses and acquisitions.
	   Sunderland said the deal will create ``substantial value for our
shareowners and simultaneously enhance out ability to develop and
focus on our strong global confectionery and U.S. beverage
business.''
	   Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory review in a
number of countries, but is anticipated in the middle of next year,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced.
	   The deal will affect about 450 Cadbury Schweppes employees, who
will have the opportunity to take jobs with Coca-Cola, the company
said.
	   ``These agreements will allow The Coca-Cola Co. to participate
in segments of the beverage business where it currently does not
have meaningful entries,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, chairman of the
board and chief executive of Coca-Cola.
	   In February, Cadbury Schweppes PLC entered a joint venture with
U.S.-based Carlyle Group to acquire two soft-drink bottlers,
Beverage America and Select Beverages, for dlrs 724 million.
	   The deal was seen as an important step by Cadbury to secure its
distribution system for soft drinks like 7Up, Dr Pepper, Canada
Dry, Sunkist and A-and-W. Cadbury trails Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola
Co. in the dlrs 55 billion U.S. soft drink industry.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Analysis of a traditional Italian Christmas cake
sent to a news agency with a warning it was tainted found enough
rat poison to make consumers seriously sick, officials said Friday.
	   Two popular brands of ``panettone'' were being withdrawn from
stores throughout the country after an animal rights group said it
had injected them with rat poison.
	   The Italian distributor of Nestle products ordered the
approximately 1,000 stores that carry its brands ``Motta'' and
``Alemagna'' to stop their sale after the Italian news agency ANSA
on Thursday received a fruitcake accompanied with a note saying the
cakes had been poisoned.
	   The group Animal Liberation Front said it used syringes to
inject rat poison into the Christmas cakes, which are big sellers
in Italy in the weeks leading up to the holidays.
	   The group said they were protesting Nestle's use of genetic
engineering to develop its products, according to ANSA.
	   Testing of the cake sent to ANSA was carried out on orders of
the Florence prosecutors' office.
	   Prosecutors also ordered the testing of some of the cakes being
pulled off the shelves.
	   Experts interviewed by RAI state radio said there was no way to
inject a fatal quantity of rat poison into a panettone. They said
at worst people would get bad stomach cramps and diarrhea.

South Korea beats Kuwait but both advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Uzbekistan-Turkmenistan score and results &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea edged Kuwait 1-0 Friday in
a routine second-round match of Asian Games soccer, and both
advanced to the quarterfinals.
	   Earlier in the day in Group 2, United Arab Emirates topped Japan
1-0. Both games were listless affairs as the tournament's hectic
schedule took its toll on the players.
	   In Group 1, North Korea beat winless India 2-0. Uzbekistan,
already in the quarterfinals, drew with Turkmenistan 1-1.
	   Uzbekistan finished at 2-1-0. Turkmenistan ended with a win and
two draws and also advanced, with North Korea third at a win, a
loss and a draw.
	   The top two teams of each of four groups move into the final
eight, a knockout competition starting Monday.
	   South Korea finished unbeaten in three matches while Kuwait,
which featured the tournament's top two scorers, ended up 1-2.
	   Japan and the UAE also ended the second round at 1-2, but
because of its superior goal differential, Kuwait advanced even
without beating South Korea.
	   South Korea stayed unbeaten but didn't have to exert itself
after Japan's loss put it definitely in the quarterfinals. Kuwait
was all but assured of a berth.
	   After playing without much feeling and not penetrating, South
Korea finally scored 12 minutes into the second half on Choi
Yong-soo's seventh goal of the Asian Games, sending the
ever-exuberant South Korea fans into further chants of joy and drum
beating.
	   Choi found a long pass from midfield at his feet at the top of
the penalty area and fired it low in the net.
	   That brought him within one goal of the top two scorers, Jasem
Al-Huwaidi and Farj Laheeb, with eight apiece.
	   The Kuwaiti duo has been held to one goal in the last two
matches. Laheeb scored his country's only goal against Japan in a
2-1 loss Wednesday.
	   Midway through the second half, An Hyo-yeon challenged Kuwait
goalie Khalid Al Fadhli outside the penalty area, brought the ball
under control and fired into the net but the goal was disallowed
because he touched it with his hand. An was given a yellow card.
	   Korean coach Huh Jong-moo found his team fatigued.
	   ``It's very hard, very bad for the players. Very bad,'' Huh
said. ``Every team has the same problem.''
	   The UAE, although also tired, found its form against Japan after
defeats to Kuwait and South Korea.
	   Though the first half ended scoreless, the Gulf team, paced by
Hassan Saeed Rashid and Ali Saeed Rashid, showed flair and pierced
the Japanese defense.
	   Japan looked tired and sluggish after its upset of Kuwait
Thursday, which kept alive Japanese dreams of a quarterfinal for
two more days.
	   Japan brought a young team to the Asian Games but was hoping for
a good showing as preparation for the 2000 Olympics and the 2002
World Cup, for which it is co-host with South Korea.
	   Both sides fought for their goal but Hassan got there first, in
the 59th minute, scoring UAE's fourth goal in four matches.
	   A long free kick in the goal area dived into a jumble of heads
and feet before substitute Kazim Ali Abdulla gained control and
shipped a short cross to Hassan, who pushed the ball in from
point-blank range.
	   Falling behind lifted Japan's energy but it was unable to mount
a consistent attack.
	   Shinsuki Nakamura, Kazuyuki Toda, Toshiya Ishii and Kenji Fukuda
pressed the attack dangerously close but either shot wild or
crashed into a swarm of red shirts.
	   The first half was notable for six minutes of injury time,
mostly taken up by the bandaging of Japan goalkeeper Yuta Minami's
head after he was chopped down by a flying elbow from Mohammad
Ibrahim Alboloshi.
	   The rest came from a bizarre kick from behind by Japanese
captain Tsuneyau Miyamoto that connected with Alboloshi's face and
brought him down. Miyamoto drew his second yellow card of the
games.
	   Carlos de Queiroz of Portugal, who took over the UAE team three
months ago, complained that his team was fatigued after playing
four matches in nine days.
	   ``The players become tired and their reaction time is not the
same,'' de Queiroz said.
	   Like his counterpart for Japan, Frenchman Philippe Troussier, de
Queiroz brought a young team in preparation for the Olympics.
	   The intense pace of the Asian Games tournament, de Queiroz said,
was too much for young players to cope with.
	   ``From a physiological point of view, they can't recover,'' de
Queiroz said.
	   Troussier agreed.
	   ``In this weather and in this schedule, the players cannot
concentrate their efforts. With one more day, the players can
change their efforts 100 percent,'' Troussier said.
	   There are four matches that conclude the second round Saturday
and the first- and second-place teams of the other two groups
advance.

Arms industry workers protest layoffs, late salary payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Workers at one of Poland's cash-strapped
airplane makers occupied the management building Friday to protest
layoffs and late salary payments.
	   The 80 protesters at PZL Mielec, 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Warsaw, demand overdue monthly salaries. The average
payments of 700 zlotys (dlrs 200) have not been paid on time for
the last 18 months, according to Krystyna Blaszczyk, one of the
protest organizers.
	   She said the salaries eventually were paid in installments or
after repeated delays.
	   The workers also protested planned layoffs as part of a
restructuring plan for the company. Blaszczyk said 1,800 of the
company's 3,000 workers could be laid off this month from the
factory that employed 20,000 people during the communist era.
	   Another aircraft producing plant in Swidnik, 150 kilometers (90
miles) southeast of Warsaw, ran out of cash to pay its workers
Thursday, the PAP state news agency reported. It said 1,000 workers
went on a forced leave this month and got only 75 percent of their
regular salaries.
	   Under communism, Poland's weapons industry supplied arms for the
former Warsaw Pact countries. It lost much business and a large
portion of government financial support under 1990 economic reforms
after the end of communist rule.
	   With Poland planning to join NATO next year, it must make its
weapons system integrate with Western systems rather than its
former Soviet bloc partners.
	   Poland's government is preparing a restructuring plan for the
arms sector, under which the state would keep control of crucial
factories and sell off others.

Yeltsin goes to Kremlin to meet several top aides

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin
office on Friday to meet with several top aides and sign orders,
and then retreated again to a country residence, his spokesman
said.
	   It was the first time Yeltsin had gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   On Friday, the president met with his new chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's
work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said at a news
conference.
	   Yeltsin also met with Vladislav Sherstyuk, new chief of
government's agency in charge of classified communications, or
FAPSI, whose previous boss was fired in the reshuffle last week.
	   The president on Friday spoke by telephone with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the next year's budget, which was to be
sent to the parliament Friday.
	   Yeltsin also recorded a radio address to the nation that was to
air Saturday to mark the 5th anniversary of the approval of
Russia's constitution, and signed a decree awarding a medal to
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn _ a former Soviet dissident and Nobel
laureate who turns 80 on Friday.
	   The president ``had a very active day today, which demonstrates
properly the state of his health,'' said.
	   Yeltsin has been at the Rus country residence, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) north of Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released
from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
After his trip to the Kremlin on Friday, Yeltsin went to the
Gorky-9 residence just west of the capital, Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and
doctors believe this can be done at a country residence ... with
periodic examinations at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' Yakushkin
said.
	   He refused to speculate how long the recuperation will last,
however, saying only it would take ``as long as necessary.''
	   Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and
Belarusian presidents, Yakushkin said.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of
various illnesses. He has handed over responsibility for solving
the country's economic problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

Israel: no PNC vote, no West Bank withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with marches by Palestinian militants, U.S. comment on
PNC session, quotes from Al Aqsa sermon &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel affirmed Friday that it will not
withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian
decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel
also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian
prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council
meets on Monday in Clinton's presence.
	   With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown
with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering
in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he
helped negotiate.
	   Under the accord, the annulment of the offending provisions by
the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton
is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task because
that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected a vote from
the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that
nullification has taken place,'' he said.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clauses calling
for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in
favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   The PLO charter was drawn up three decades ago, long before
Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps to revoke
the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996.
	   However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed the job.
During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a compromise
to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to Gaza to
hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided with the
Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, they
don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister
during the PNC vote in 1996.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have also accused each other of
violating other elements of the Wye agreement. A key point of
contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners in three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians have said Israel broke a promise to release
prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities. Israel said it never
made such a pledge, and accused the Palestinian Authority of
incitement over the prisoner issue.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the Islamic militant Hamas
movement marched through the West Bank town of Nablus to press for
the release or prisoners. ``We want prisoners, not Clinton,'' the
crowd chanted.
	   At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, the
prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out sharply against the
U.S.-brokered peace agreement. ``America supports a peace agreement
that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian
lands,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese swimmers Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan
repeated their world championship 1-2 finish in the final of the
200-meter medley at the Asian Games on Friday.
	   Wu, also the world record holder in the event, set up her
victory with a stunning third 50 meters of breaststroke after
lagging in fourth turning into the second half of the race.
	   China's Jiang Chengji also had a lightning lap Friday, becoming
the fourth fastest swimmer in the world this year in the frenzied
50-meter men's freestyle. Jiang, who was fourth at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics before a slump in form, clocked 22.38 seconds.
	   Only Brazil's Fernando Scherer (22.18), Russian Alexander Popov
(22.27) and American world champion Bill Pilczuk have gone faster
this year.
	   Chen Hua won the 800 freestyle to give China three of the six
golds on offer Friday. Japan clung to a 12-11 lead through 26 of 32
events with golds by Takashi Yamamoto in the 200 butterfly and the
women's 4x100 medley relay team. Malaysia's Lim Keng Liat won his
county's first gold in the pool, putting it equal with Taiwan and
Thailand.
	   Chen Yan, meanwhile, was returning to action after being struck
by a severe case of diarrhea, which kept her out of two events
following her bronze medal in the 400 medley earlier in the meet.
	   South Korean Cho Hee-yeon made the early pace, getting away with
a strong butterfly and maintaining her lead after the backstroke.
	   But Wu, who holds the world record at 2:09.72, stormed to the
lead and finished in 2:15.12, with Chen close behind in 2:15.54.
Cho took the bronze.
	   Chen, the world 400 medley champion and record holder, produced
a brave performance as team officials said she was considerably
weakened by her stomach illness.
	   While Wu had a pedestrian time, her coach, Wu Jicai, said, ``I'm
satisfied with her performance even though the time is not too good
because she's in the relay.''
	   Wu and Chen were China's standout swimmers at this year's world
championships in Perth after the team was demoralized by the
expulsion of six team members on drug charges.
	   Fu Yong, suspended for two years after a positive steroid test
at the 1994 Asian Games, was beaten into second place in the
100-meter backstroke Friday as Lim, a student in Jacksonville,
Florida, won a gold that seemed to take him completely by surprise.
	   ``I feel like I'm making history for my country,'' Lim said. ``I
didn't expect to win the gold _ I just wanted to finish in the top
three.''
	   Lim set a games record of 55.53 after converting a flying start
into a good victory over 200 backstroke winner Fu (56.40) and
Raymond Papa of the Philippines.
	   Yamamoto secured a men's butterfly double, adding the 200 gold
to his 100 victory earlier in the meet.
	   The 20-year-old from Osaka won easily in 1:56.75, finishing more
than a length in front of China's world shortcourse 400 medley
champion Xie Xufeng (1:59.67). South Korean Han Kyu-chul had the
bronze in 2:00.46.
	   Chen Hua won her third gold, adding the distance event to the

Russia's economic crisis puts privatization efforts on hold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis has virtually halted the
sale of major state assets to private investors, and revenues this
year are only a fraction of those forecast, the government said
today.
	   The government had hoped to earn $400 million by auctioning off
state property, but it has earned only $70 million through October,
the Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has frightened away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to postpone auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The delay in selling state assets has contributed to the
government's chronic cash shortages. It owes billions of dollars to
workers, pensioners and foreign creditors.
	   The government is currently working out an austere budget for
next year, when the economy is expected to continue shrinking. The
economy is likely to contract by 5 percent this year and has been
shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst depressions
ever suffered by an industrialized nation.
	   Russia's draft budget provides for repaying only $9.5 billion of
the $17.5 billion in foreign debt that falls due next year. That
means the government will seek to stretch out repayments of the
additional $8 billion.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   But creditors have not yet expressed a willingness to rework the
debts Russia already has, and the prospect for more foreign loans
is hazy at best.
	   A $22.6 billion loan package put together by the International
Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt default and ruble
devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign loans that had yet to materialize.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who has frequently been ill in recent
months and has not been involved in the day-to-day business of
government.

African organization pondering military intervention in Comoros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A military delegation of the
Organization of African Unity was considering Friday whether to
recommend military intervention in the Comoros Islands, which has
been hit by secessionist violence.
	   Comoros interim President Tadjiddine Ben Said Massonde and Prime
Minister Abbas Djousof have repeatedly appealed for OAU
intervention to end violence which erupted Saturday on the island
of Anjouan.
	   Reports have been sketchy but some sources said fighting between
rival groups on the separatist island had killed between 30 and 40
people by midweek.
	   The OAU delegation, comprising a dozen military and security
officials from Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and South
Africa, was expected to return to South Africa on Friday night,
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni.
	   The delegation would make its recommendation directly to the
OAU, which is based Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Boni said.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim told reporters in South
Africa this week that military interverntion was ``the last
possible consideration.''
	   Without giving specifics, Salim said many people have been
killed or injured and thousands more displaced in Anjouan, one of
the four Comoros Islands, located in the Indian Ocean off
Mozambique.
	   Anjouan declared independence from Comoros on Aug. 3, 1997. The
government on Grand Comore sent troops to the breakaway island a
month later in an abortive attempt to put down the secession.
	   The OAU mission left for Moroni, the capital of the Comoros and
located on Grande Comore island, on Wednesday.
	   Despite the violence, tourists continued to travel during this
peak holiday season from South Africa to resorts on Grande Comore,
140 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Anjouan.
	   Every scheduled flight from Johannesburg to Moroni remained
fully booked through the middle of December, travel agent Bruce
Hutchinson was quoted as saying in Johannesburg's The Star
newspaper.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rival groups of demonstrators confronted each
other Friday outside the court where former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet faced his first public appearance since his arrest
nearly two months ago on a Spanish extradition warrant.
	   ``Free Pinochet'' supporters chanted from behind police lines
outside Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, 10 miles (15 kms) from the
city center, while others shouted back and waved placards declaring
``Don't let this butcher go!''
	   Many of the several hundred protesters chanted ``murderer!'' in
Spanish as Pinochet's car swept into the court complex, but his
supporters tried to drown them out with cheers.

Koirala recommends early elections

 &UR; By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's opposition sought a no-confidence
vote against the government Friday, hours after the prime mininster
urged the King to dissolve parliament and call new elections.
	   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's ruling Nepali Congress
party lost its majority in parliament on Thursday when all 13
ministers from the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, the
junior coalition partner, resigned from the government.
	   ``We don't trust Koirala to work for the people and the nation.
We can't trust this government to hold free and fair elections,''
said Bam Dev Gautam, leader of the Communist Party.
	   A no-trust vote could allow the opposition a chance to form a
new government before elections.
	   Since polls in Nov. 1994 left no single party with a clear
majority in the lower house of parliament, Nepal has had five
governments. A statement issued by the prime minister's secretariat
said that Koirala has recommended elections be held by March 3.
Normally, the election would be held in November.
	   Koirala is likely to lead a caretaker government until the
election if the king dissolves the house.
	   Hours after the prime minister's announcement, 62 lawmakers
demanded he face a no-confidence motion.
	   King Birendra, who has final say on whether to call elections,
is scheduled to fly back to Katmandu on Monday from London, where
he was being treated for a heart condition.
	   Koirala's coalition fell apart after his Communist partners
charges he had violated an agreement to fire Nepal's police chief.
	   Communists accuse the chief of using unnecessary force against
Maoists rebels who have been fighting a guerrilla war for nearly
three years. The Communists have no direct links with the rebels
but have shown sympathy with them in the past.

EU leaders salute Kohl with award of Honorary Citizen of Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European leaders paid tribute to Helmut
Kohl Friday, hailing the former German chancellor for the vision
and commitment with which he guided Germany and Europe through
years of historic and peaceful change.
	   The leaders took a break from a year-end summit to declare Kohl,
68, an Honorary Citizen of Europe for managing Germany's painful
unification in 1990 and anchoring it in the European Union.
	   Moved to tears, Kohl thanked Europe's leaders for the tribute
and injected a light note into the solemn event.
	   ``I am not a monument yet,'' said Kohl. ``What happens when the
party is over is that birds come and sit on you and do something
and then other animals come and do something.''
	   The honor was awarded for only the second time. The first was in
1976 when it went to former French Foreign Minister Jean Monnet, a
driving force for European integration in the 1950s.
	   ``Helmut Kohl made a crucial contribution to the further
development of Monnet's construction,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima said at a ceremony in the National Library, part of the
spectacular former imperial Hofburg Palace in the heart of Vienna.
	   ``He has often spoken of the opportunity for this generation of
politicians to build a peaceful and stable Europe together,'' said
Klima, the chairman of the summit that debated plans for the
biggest expansion in the EU's history _ admitting a dozen newcomers
in the next decade.
	   Kohl was chancellor for 16 years. His last day in office was
Oct. 26, a month after his Christian Democratic Party lost in
general elections to the social democrats of his successor, Gerhard
Schroeder.
	   Kohl took office in 1982, when Germany and its western neighbors
were locked in a Cold War debate about deploying ever more nuclear
missiles aimed at the Soviet Union.
	   When he left, the Berlin Wall had vanished, Germany had been
reunited and the EU had agreed to issue a single currency.
	   During the Kohl years, the EU twice enlarged its ranks, thrice
rewrote its founding treaty and took the road to membership talks
with Cyprus and 10 East European neighbors.
	   These events bear the Kohl imprint, especially the euro that
becomes legal tender in 11 of the 15 EU nations next month.
	   If he failed anywhere, it was in pushing Germany's partners into
a coherent political union. The consequences of that failure became
visible in the Balkan wars and crises of recent years.
	   As German leader, Kohl was at pains to present Germany as a
trusted ally, committed to European integration. He showed himself
to be an inveterate supporter of trans-Atlantic ties, who developed
a close relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Malaysia welcomes Tanzanian president

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting with Mahathir and speeches

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Tanzanian President Benjamin
William Mkapa began a three-day visit to Malaysia on Friday to
discuss trade and investment with officials here.
	   The president, accompanied by his wife, Anna Mkapa, and other
senior government officials, received an official welcome at
Parliament Square from Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar and Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mkapa later inspected an honor guard of 107 mounted army
officers.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad met Mkapa for two hours in the
afternoon and the leaders discussed ways to strengthening trade and
investment ties between their countries.
	   Malaysia expressed its desire to increase exports of palm oil
and Malaysian-made cars to Tanzania and explore buying raw
materials from the east African country, Foreign Ministry official
Ghazzali Sheikh Abdul Khalid told reporters.
	   ``While Malaysia, in its current economic circumstances, has
limited capacity to invest in Tanzania, the opportunity for an
increase in trade is there and needs to be explored,'' said
Ghazzali.
	   Malaysia has been hit hard by the Asian economic crisis.
	   Mkapa said his meeting with Mahathir was very successful and
launched a new era of cooperation.
	   Friday night, Malaysia's king, Tuanku Ja'afar, told attendees of
a banquet for the African leader that the two countries should seek
partnerships in science, trade, economy and sports.
	   ``We trust that during this visit, new areas for collaborations
will be explored and built upon,'' the king said.
	   Over the next two days, Mkapa will visit government agencies,
including the Economic Planning Unit, the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority and the Palm Oil Research Institute of
Malaysia.
	   The Tanzanian leader will also meet with local businessmen and
visit the world's tallest skyscraper, the 88-floor Petronas Twin
Towers.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's gold to Indonesia; ADDS byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women beat defending champion
South Korea for the Asian Games badminton team gold Friday,
avenging a humiliating defeat four years ago.
	   Indonesia won a surprisingly easy victory over China to take the
men's gold and hold on to the crown it won four years ago.
	   In the women's competition, China's world No. 3, Gong Zhichao,
secured the gold with an 11-4, 11-1 trouncing of Lee Joo-hyun in
the third match of the best-of-five team final.
	   The final score was 3-1. With the outcome already certain, the
fifth match was scrapped.
	   Chinese coach Li Yongbo said the team, expected to remain
unchanged for the 2000 Olympics, has matured and improved since
South Korea's 5-0 semifinal whitewash of China on its way to gold
at the last Asian Games in 1994.
	   ``We've gone from losing to winning,'' he said. ``Our team
members have played pretty well. What makes me happy is that
they've shown maturity.''
	   Ye Zhaoying, the 1997 singles world champion, got China off to a
solid start with a hard-earned 11-9, 13-10 victory over Korea's Kim
Ji-hyun, the world No. 8.
	   ``Now that I've won the first match, the remaining matches
should not be a problem,'' the 24-year-old world No. 1 said after
her victory. ``I played well.''
	   Kim had clawed her way back from a 5-0 deficit in the first game
to level the score, only to falter and let Ye close out the game.
After fighting her way back from 5-10 down to win the second game
and the match, a delighted Ye went over to the stands to high-five
her coaches and teammates.
	   Gu Jun and Ge Fei, the Olympic and world doubles champions,
built on Ye's victory with a closely fought 15-13, 15-11 victory
over La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee.
	   Gu said the team had hoped to face South Korea in the final
following their crushing loss in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Gu and
Ge also had a two-year record of no defeats to defend.
	   Gu described the win as ``completing the duty of four years
ago.''
	   Trailing 3-0, the Koreans saved some pride when Kim Shin-young
and Yim Kyung-jin beat Zhang Ning and Tang Hetian 15-11, 15-7.
	   Indonesia, which lost to Korea 4-1 in the semis, and Japan,
which was trounced 5-0 by China, shared bronze.
	   In the men's event, world No. 5 Hendrawan, using quick footwork
and a vicious smash, got Indonesia off to a solid start with a
15-7, 15-6 victory over a lackluster Sun Jun of China, the No.
2-ranked player in the world.
	   Hendrawan threw his arms in the air after his victory, while
Indonesian supporters banging drums and rattling maracas shouted
and sang in the stands.
	   The Indonesian team mamager attributed the victory to a new
wrist movement that he called a ``devil trick'' that Handrawan has
developed in the last few months.
	   ``It's very difficult to predict which way the shuttlecock will
go,'' said Agus Wirahadikusumah. ``Sun Jun was quite confused.''
	   Indonesia's Olympic gold medalists and world No. 1 pairing Ricky
Achmad-Subagdja and Rexy Ronald-Mainaky followed up with a 15-11,
15-11 win over China's Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei, the world's No. 4.
The Indonesian players scored slowly but surely and made it very
difficult for the Chinese to score.
	   Ronald-Mainaky said the Chinese need to vary their game if they
are going to beat Indonesian, Danish and Malaysian players.
	   ``The Chinese players have to have more variation,'' he said.
	   Taufik Hidayat, ranked 19th in the world, made short work of
China's Luo Yigang to seal the gold with a 15-6, 15-5 win.
	   He came off court to hugs from his coaches and rapturous cheers
from Indonesian fans.
	   The bronze medals go to South Korea, which lost to China 3-1 in
the semis, and to Malaysia, which was downed by Indonesia.

Shareholders drop lawsuits against DaimlerChrysler merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Five Daimler-Benz shareholders have
dropped lawsuits challenging last month's merger that created
DaimlerChrysler, the transportation conglomerate said Friday.
	   The shareholders had sued Daimler-Benz in a Stuttgart court,
requesting copies of the full minutes of a Sept. 18 Daimler
shareholders before agreeing to swap their shares for new
DaimlerChrysler ones.
	   Shareholders who swapped their shares before the actual merger
received one bonus share for every 200 they exchanged. In settling
with the plaintiffs, DaimlerChrysler said it will give them the
same deal in exchange for their dropping the lawsuits.
	   The legal complaints had not hindered the merger, which took
effect Nov. 17 with the posting of the new DaimlerChrysler shares
on the New York and Frankfurt stock exchanges. The new company
ranks fifth in worldwide car and truck sales and third in total
revenues.

Meissnitzer wins giant slalom for second straight win

 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with second leg

	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer won
her second World Cup race of the week on Friday, with a convincing
victory in the women's giant slalom.
	   After winning Thursday's super-G by a wide margin, the
25-year-old Austrian this time dominated the women's technical
field, including Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni and reigning
World Cup champion Martina Ertl.
	   Flying down the foggy, bumpy Piste-G course in a two-run
combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, Meissnitzer built up a
massive .82 ahead of runner-up Compagnoni.
	   Quickest down the opening run in 1:08.53, Meissnitzer's
second-fastest time of 1:08.81 in the final leg was enough to
secure her the win.
	   It was the Austrian's fourth win of the season, her second in
the giant slalom.
	   Meissnitzer, who also won a pair of super-G races, has
reinforced her lead at the top of the overall World Cup standings
where she sits with 625 points.
	   Compagnoni, who won four World Cup giant slalom races last year
as well as the Olympic gold, has yet to win a race this season.
	   The 28-year-old Italian finished third in the season-opening
giant slalom in Soelden, Austria, her best result so far this year.
	   In a successful comeback from injury, Austria's 31-year-old
former World Cup overall champion Anita Wachter finished third.
	   Wachter, whose career appeared to be over after a crash at the
Olympics last season left her with severe knee injuries, crossed in
an aggregate time of 2:18.31.
	   Norway's Andrine Flemmen, who won the season-opener in Austria,
finished fourth in 2:18.59, ahead of France's Leila Piccard.
	   Seventeenth after the first leg, Piccard delighted the home fans
crowded at the foot of the course as she posted the fastest
second-run. Blistering down in 1:08.48 for a total time of 2:18.62,
Piccard held the lead until Flemmen beat her chrono.
	   In her first season on the World Cup circuit, the 16-year-old
Croatian sensation Janica Kostelic finished a respectable sixth,
crossing in 2:18.73, a mere .01 ahead of Switzerland's Corinne
Rey-Bellet.
	   Second after the opening leg, Liechtenstien's Birgit Heeb
squandered her chance for a first World Cup win, a cautious second
run leaving her tied for eighth with Sweden's Anna Ottosson in
2:19.26.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course threw reigning World
Cup giant slalom champion Ertl off course.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Another round of voter
registration for national elections next year will take place in
January, the body organizing South Africa's second all-race polls
said on Friday.
	   Voters will be able to register in all nine of the country's
provinces on the last weekend of the month from Jan. 29 to Jan. 31,
said the Independent Electoral Commission.
	   It had originally hoped to conduct the entire registration on a
single weekend in November, but amid major confusion _ even
President Nelson Mandela went to the wrong registration office _
and poor turnout it was decided to add more dates.
	   Of South Africa's estimated 24.7 million voters, only 8.4
million have registered so far. A third round of registration dates
will be announced once the date of the election is decided.
	   The election has to be held within three months of the end of
April 1999.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Six men received amnesty on
Friday for apartheid era crimes, but five others were refused for
acts ranging from armed robbery to murder.
	   In order to qualify for amnesty applicants have to prove they
acted out of a political motive and told the whole truth about
their crimes.
	   In rejecting five applications the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission decided there was no political motive for Phillip
Malefane, who robbed a cash van at a mine in 1991, or Borowsky
Masilela and George Sapele who killed a prison guard in 1992.
	   Amnesty was also refused for Michael Mofokeng and Nkosinathi
Nkabinde who killed a man whose house they were robbing in 1994.
	   All five had claimed to be members of the armed wing of the
radical black nationalist party the Pan-Africanist Congress.
	   Andile Shiceka, Falibango Thanda and Gcinekhaya Makoma, who were
involved in a 1992 bombing in a black township near Cape Town, were
all granted amnesty.
	   The other successul applicants were Thabelo Maseko, for a 1990
murder; Thulasizwe Cele, who killed a fellow member of the African
National Congress who had defected to a rival group; and Sonkalana
Mabhena who tried to kill a policeman in 1992.
	   --
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two senior Sudanese military officers
were killed when a government vehicle struck a landmine near the
northeastern border town of Kassala, Sudanese rebels said.
	   The chief government operational officer in Kassala and an
intelligence unit officer were killed in the incident near the
border with Eritrea, according to a statement issued Thursday by
the National Democratic Alliance, the umbrella group for Sudanese
dissidents and rebel groups.
	   The statement the mine had been planted by the Beja Congress,
one of several opposition groups fighting the Sudanese government.
	   Meanwhile, an Asmara-based spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army fighting in southern Sudan said 84 government
troops had been killed since the SPLA launched an offensive Nov. 18
in the central Nuba Mountains.
	   SPLA spokesman Yasir Arman said only nine rebels were killed.
	   No independent confirmation was available on either report.
	   An estimated 1.9 million Sudanese have died in south and central
Sudan since 1983 when fighting erupted between rebels from the
Christian and animist south and the government in the Arab and
Islamic north.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Most of the 90 tanks Uganda bought from
the Ukraine arrived this week after being delayed at port in
neighboring Tanzania, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
said Friday.
	   The 64 tanks arrived by rail from Tanzania and were driven by
truck to Masaka, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the capital
Kampala, where the army set up roadblocks to clear their passage,
the newspaper said.
	   The government and army have refused comment on the tanks.
	   It was unclear whether the 16 remaining tanks were still in the
port of Dar es Salaam.
	   The London-based newsletter Africa Confidential said in its Dec.
4 issue that the tanks were believed intended for operations
against the Sudanese-backed Lord's Resistance Army rebels operating
in northern Uganda or to assist the Sudan People's Liberation Army
carrying out a 15-year civil war against Khartoum in southern
Sudan.
	   Ugandan troops are also in eastern and northern Congo where they
are backing rebels attempting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   In a conference in Kampala this week, donor countries expressed
concern that international assistance for development projects was
being diverted to Uganda's military efforts.
	   The donors pledged dlrs 2.2 billion to Uganda for three years on
the condition the money reaches its target expenditures in the
areas of health, education, roads and agriculture.
	   Africa Confidential said it was not clear how much the tanks
cost or how they were paid for.

Israel: no PNC vote, no West Bank withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with marches by Palestinian militants, U.S. comment on
PNC session, quotes from Al Aqsa sermon &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel affirmed Friday that it will not
withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian
decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel
also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian
prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council
meets on Monday in Clinton's presence.
	   With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown
with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering
in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he
helped negotiate.
	   Under the accord, the annulment of the offending provisions by
the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton
is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task because
that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected a vote from
the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that
nullification has taken place,'' he said.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clauses calling
for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in
favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization charter was drawn up three
decades ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians started their
peace process in 1993.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps to revoke
the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996.
	   However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed the job.
During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a compromise
to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to Gaza to
hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided with the
Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, they
don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister
during the PNC vote in 1996.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have also accused each other of
violating other elements of the Wye agreement. A key point of
contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners in three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians have said Israel broke a promise to release
prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities. Israel said it never
made such a pledge, and accused the Palestinian Authority of
incitement over the prisoner issue.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the Islamic militant Hamas
movement marched through the West Bank town of Nablus to press for
the release or prisoners. ``We want prisoners, not Clinton,'' the
crowd chanted.
	   At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, the
prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out sharply against the
U.S.-brokered peace agreement. ``America supports a peace agreement
that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian
lands,'' he said.

Aid agencies say Senegal blocking supplies into Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers said Friday that Senegalese
troops were blocking convoys carrying food and medicine from
crossing the border into Guinea-Bissau, where thousands of people
were in need of relief aid due to a five-month conflict.
	   Some 3,000 Senegalese troops have been deployed in the tiny West
African country of Guinea-Bissau since June, when they arrived to
help President Joao Bernardo Vieira contain a military rebellion.
	   ``The Senegalese won't let us through,'' said Serafim Jorge, a
spokesman for International Medical Assistance, or AMI, a
Portuguese relief group working in Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``It's faster and easier to fly (supplies) from Dakar or
Lisbon,'' Jorge said in Lisbon.
	   AMI recently flew six tons of food and medicines from Portugal's
capital, Lisbon, into the town of Gabu in eastern Guinea-Bissau,
some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Senegalese border, he said.
	   About Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were displaced by
fighting which started in June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime.
	   Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane recently agreed to
cease hostilities and form a government of national unity.
	   The pact also called for the withdrawal of Senegalese troops and
the deployment of a West African peacekeeping force, due to arrive
later this month.

Japanese baseball team finds no evidence of sign-stealing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; ADDS Oh, league chairman comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese baseball team accused of stealing
catchers' signs said Friday it found no evidence of wrongdoing, but
the club's league is planning a separate investigation.
	   Daiei Hawks manager and home run king Sadaharu Oh said he was
relieved that the team's 10-day internal investigation had turned
up nothing.
	   ``It is good that what the team has been asserting all along was
backed up,'' he said in a nationally televised interview.
	   The Hawks said Friday that they ``could not confirm'' the
sign-stealing after viewing videotapes and questioning the three
accused players along with other team employees.
	   But Pacific League Chairman Kazuo Harano said an emergency
meeting of top league officials was called for Monday to discuss
the scandal and a league investigation was in the works.
	   According to the charges, a Daiei employee monitored a TV camera
in Fukuoka Dome that was focused on the opposing catcher.
	   The employee picked up his signs and relayed them by
walkie-talkie to a youngster in the stands, who used a megaphone to
tell the Daiei batter what pitches were coming.
	   Holding a megaphone in front of his face signaled a fastball.
Holding it to the right meant a curve or a slider, and to the left
a forkball.
	   The team said it recreated the scenario and found that it was
extremely difficult to pull off.
	   ``We must do our utmost to never allow such suspicions to emerge
again in professional baseball, whose mission is to offer dreams
and hope to the young, as well as joy to the work place and
families,'' it said in a statement.
	   Oh, who hit a record 868 home runs, was not directly implicated
in the scandal. But he has also said he feared a lifetime ban if
his team was found to be behind the scandal.
	   The three players have all denied wrongdoing.
	   Sign-stealing is common in Japanese baseball, but the reported
scheme is so elaborate and blatant officials are taking the
allegations seriously.

EU leaders salute Kohl with award of Honorary Citizen of Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European leaders paid tribute Friday to
Helmut Kohl, hailing the former German chancellor for the vision
and commitment with which he guided Germany and Europe through
years of historic and peaceful change.
	   The leaders took a break from a year-end summit to declare Kohl,
68, an Honorary Citizen of Europe for managing Germany's painful
unification in 1990 and anchoring it in the European Union.
	   Moved to tears, Kohl thanked Europe's leaders for the tribute
and injected a light note into the solemn event.
	   ``I am not a monument yet,'' said Kohl. ``What happens when the
party is over is that birds come and sit on you and do something
and then other animals come and do something.''
	   The honor was awarded for only the second time. The first was in
1976 when it went to former French Foreign Minister Jean Monnet, a
driving force for European integration in the 1950s.
	   ``Helmut Kohl made a crucial contribution to the further
development of Monnet's construction,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima said at a ceremony in the National Library, part of the
spectacular former imperial Hofburg Palace in the heart of Vienna.
	   ``He has often spoken of the opportunity for this generation of
politicians to build a peaceful and stable Europe together,'' said
Klima, the chairman of the summit that debated plans for the
biggest expansion in the EU's history _ admitting a dozen newcomers
in the next decade.
	   Kohl was chancellor for 16 years. His last day in office was
Oct. 26, a month after his Christian Democratic Party lost in
general elections to the Social Democrats of his successor, Gerhard
Schroeder.
	   Kohl took office in 1982, when Germany and its western neighbors
were locked in a Cold War debate about deploying ever more nuclear
missiles aimed at the Soviet Union.
	   When he left, the Berlin Wall had vanished, Germany had been
reunited and the EU had agreed to issue a single currency.
	   During the Kohl years, the EU twice enlarged its ranks, thrice
rewrote its founding treaty and took the road to membership talks
with Cyprus and 10 East European neighbors.
	   These events bear the Kohl imprint, especially the euro that
becomes legal tender in 11 of the 15 EU nations next month.
	   If he failed anywhere, it was in pushing Germany's partners into
a coherent political union. The consequences of that failure became
visible in the Balkan wars and crises of recent years.
	   As German leader, Kohl was at pains to present Germany as a
trusted ally, committed to European integration. He showed himself
to be an inveterate supporter of trans-Atlantic ties, who developed
a close relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Fresh in power, once-radical German Greens seek internal reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Green party, born out of protest
against establishment politics, wants to become more professional
now that they're in power.
	   The party opened a three-day convention Friday aimed at
overhauling the party's structure so it can hold its own as the
junior partner in the new Social Democratic-led government. Another
goal is to avoid public squabbles over policy.
	   ``People expect the Greens to show professionalism and
consistency as a governing party, and rightly so,'' party co-leader
Gunda Roestel told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper.
	   Still, many Greens cherish the party's traditionally loose
style, and proposals to give national leaders more power to direct
policy are expected to trigger controversy at the convention in the
eastern city of Leipzig.
	   Party leaders are asking delegates to approve creating a new
21-member body to coordinate among Greens lawmakers, the national
leadership and local activists. For the new council, leaders also
want to waive a time-honored Greens rule excluding lawmakers and
ministers from holding party posts.
	   Once radical, the Greens won power at the national level for the
first time in September elections, snaring three Cabinet posts when
they agreed to join the Social Democrats in a coalition.
	   Leaders say the Greens must bolster their success by
strengthening internal organization and discipline. Antje Vollmer,
a top Green lawmaker, said the party in recent years had ``tended
to lose punch because of our complicated rules.''
	   Some 750 delegates also are choosing a new party leadership,
including an executive council slimmed down to five members from
nine.
	   A new party co-chair will be elected to replace Juergen Trittin,
who became environment minister in the new government. Antje
Radcke, a party left-winger like Trittin, is running for the post.

Jordan said to be blocking hard-liners from Syria meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Authorities are preventing supporters of
hard-line Palestinians from leaving for neighboring Syria to attend
a meeting aimed at countering Yasser Arafat's peacemaking efforts
with Israel, a hard-line official said Friday.
	   Authorities have turned back at the border at least 15 of the 67
Jordanians who had announced plans to attend the meeting in
Damascus, Bahat Abu-Gharbiyeh, a spokesman for delegation, said.
	   He said officials at the Ramtha border checkpoint ``have been
turning away our colleagues,'' claiming they are banned from
leaving the country because of various charges pending against
them.
	   Government officials were not immediately available for
comments.
	   Abu-Gharbiyeh said less than five managed to cross the border.
	   Among those blocked was Layla Khaled, a Palestinian woman
activist who had hijacked several civilian planes in the 70s in an
attempt to bring the world's attention to the plight of the
Palestinian people.
	   Most of the delegates from Jordan are Jordanian hard-liners who
also opposed King Hussein's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   The Saturday meeting in Damascus was called by 10 hard-line
Palestinian factions opposed to a settlement with Israel.
	   The meeting will urge other Palestinian officials to boycott the
Monday session of the Palestinian National Council, or parliament,
in Gaza City at which mainstreams Palestinians are expected to
nullify those parts of the Palestinian National Charter that call
for the destruction of Israel.
	   On Thursday, another decision-making body, the Palestine Central
Council, voted to remove the clauses.
	   The amendment is required by the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord of Wye River between Palestinian leader Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met
with Russia's prime minister and other top officials Friday to
discuss the flow of weapons technology to the Middle East.
	   One of Talbott's key concerns with Russia in the past has been
disarmament and arms control, including U.S. fears that Russia is
not doing enough to prevent weapons technology from going to
countries such as Iran.
	   The issue was raised during Talbott's meeting with the chief of
Russia's Security Council and of President Boris Yeltsin's staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Non-proliferation of weapons technology was also expected to be
discussed during Talbott's meeting Friday with Russia's Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov. But no details were available about the
closed-door talks.
	   Later in the day, Talbott met with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   ``We understand what place the United States occupies in the
modern world,'' Primakov said at the start of the talks.
	   ``We would like for our partners also to know more about modern
Russia, to know more about our intentions,'' Primakov said.
	   Talbott arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night, leading a group of
officials planning to discuss Russia's economic crisis and other
issues.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was
traveling with Talbott, met Friday with Russian Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants.
	   They discussed Russia's economic turmoil and investments in
Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.

New Champions League in place, but financial details pending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee wrapped
up a two-day meeting Friday with a revamped Champions League in
place but final details of its financing still unclear.
	   The committee on Thursday unanimously approved the start next
season of a new 32-team Champions League and a single competition _
called the UEFA Cup _ to merge the existing UEFA Cup and Cup
Winners Cup.
	   ``It makes the rich richer, but the poor are not getting poorer,
and that's quite a good result,'' UEFA President Lennart Johansson
told a news conference.
	   As UEFA's plans stand, a major club winning the new Champions
League would earn a maximum of between 65 and 70 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 46.5 million and 50 million).
	   The competitions were restructured to counter the threat of a
breakaway Super League, proposed by Milan-based marketing firm
Media Partners, which said new pay-per-view TV rights would boost
annual revenues for Europe's leading clubs.
	   UEFA set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European club competitions.
	   It came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Although that falls far short of the Super League's promised
jackpot, the European governing body insists it is confident of the
projected revenue from television and sponsoring.
	   But it left unclear to what extent the new format will involve
pay-per-view television.
	   ``We have always said that priority will be with free TV; we may
and will make use in certain countries of the pay TV market,'' UEFA
General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said.
	   ``I don't see at the moment that pay-per-view is on the agenda
but I wouldn't exclude that,'' he added.
	   Of the 600 million francs (dlrs 430 million) that would be
distributed to clubs, some 30 million francs (dlrs 21 million)
would go to the leagues of participating clubs, Aigner said.
	   ``There are more meetings to come'' over the next two to three
months regarding finances, Aigner said.
	   Each club in the first phase, where teams will pay in eight
groups of four, would receive a starting fee of 1.5 million francs
(dlrs 1.1 million).
	   Further payments would be made for matches played and won, with
the winner getting 10 million francs (dlrs 7.2 million).
	   That would leave 250 million francs (dlrs 180 million) to be
distributed according to a system of market values which hasn't yet
been finalized, Aigner said.
	   UEFA's share of the money will go on running costs and a variety
of other payments, among others to teams which fail in the
qualifying rounds.
	   Aigner said UEFA is ``not particularly worried'' of further
pressure on the European body from the clubs in future.
	   ``It is not so much the clubs who have developed the ideas, it
is the television market which has developed ideas,'' he said.
	   ``I think the clubs are very comfortable to stay with us.''
	   The new Champions League will involve some teams who finish
fourth in the major European leagues, but UEFA kept its ``very good
branding.''
	   ``I think we are playing for the European champion and therefore
it is the Champions League,'' Aigner said.

President preparing new bill to open communist files
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski said in a
letter made public Friday he will propose a new bill on opening
communist era files to replace the controversial measure he vetoed
last week.
	   In the letter sent to political leaders Thursday, Kwasniewski
said he wanted to correct ``legal errors'' in the bill passed by
parliament in September that would allow victims of the former
secret police to see their files.
	   His veto brought heavy criticism from rightist Solidarity
politicians, who accused Kwasniewski, a former communist, of trying
to protect former communist agents.
	   The Solidarity-led governing alliance lacks the necessary 60
percent support in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, to
override Kwasniewski's veto. If it fails to get additional support
from other parties, Solidarity leaders intend to resubmit the
measure next year.
	   The bill calls for setting up an Institute of National
Remembrance to manage communist files from 1944-89, as well as
documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The institute would make
the files available to victims and reveal who informed on them.
	   It also would have the power to launch investigations intended
to establish those responsible for persecution or political
murders.
	   Kwasniewski's letter said he would propose his own version,
which would allow all Poles to see their secret police files and
change the way the members of the institute are chosen.
	   His draft would have the institute's nine-member board elected
to seven-year terms by both chambers of parliament _ the Sejm and
the Senate _ as well as the National Judicial Council. Under the
parliament bill, the Sejm would choose board members to nine-year
terms.
	   Solidarity leaders say secret files should be open to victims to
ensure historical justice and make sure criminals of the past no
longer hold power, even if that forces out top political leaders.
They also warn that former agents could be blackmailed by criminal
gangs or foreign governments if the truth remains hidden.
	   Former communists say the files are incomplete and unreliable, a
result of uncontrolled work by the dreaded Security Service of the
communist era.
	   Some also argue opening the files could cause political turmoil,
like the first attempt to deal with the matter. In 1992, the
rightist government of Jan Olszewski was toppled on a no-confidence
vote after it released an unconfirmed list of alleged communist
agents.
	   In October, Kwasniewski signed another law that requires
government officials, judges and others to declare if they ever
worked for or collaborated with the former security service. Under
the law, which took effect last month, those making false
declarations can lose their jobs.
	   Solidarity leaders say opening the files to everyone would allow
former agents now in positions requiring a declaration to check
their files beforehand.

German court OK's extradition of terrorist suspect to U.S.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Justice Ministry saying final decision could come
next week &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court approved the
extradition Friday to the United States of a suspected top aide to
Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire accused of masterminding
deadly bombings at U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   The Federal Constitutional Court voted unanimously not to hear
an appeal by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who argued the extradition
violated his rights. The court called the appeal baseless.
	   Extradition of suspects also requires federal government
approval. Bernhard Boehm, spokesman for the Justice Ministry, said
he expected a decision next week once the court papers are reviewed
and the U.S. government gives its assurance that Salim will not
face the death penalty.
	   Germany's constitution forbids extradition if the suspect could
face the death penalty _ but Boehm said he did not expect that
would be the case for Salim.
	   Salim, 40, has been held in Germany since his arrest in Bavaria
three months ago on a U.S. warrant. A state court in Munich first
approved his extradition on Nov. 27.
	   U.S. officials claim he is Bin Laden's finance chief and have
charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of weapons
of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are jailed
in the United States.
	   The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.

Lomu offered film role as a bad guy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand rugby superstar Jonah
Lomu has been offered a role as a bad guy in the next James Bond
movie, according to his manager Phil Kingsley-Jones.
	   Lomu, the world's most recognizable rugby player, was visiting
Britain last month when he was invited to meet producers planning
the 19th Bond movie.
	   After a 10-minute meeting at Pinewood Studios, Kingsley-Jones,
received a call offering Lomu the part opposite Pierce Brosnan.
	   Kingsley-Jones said Lomu was interested in the role but could
not agree to a film deal before consulting the New Zealand Rugby
Football Union.
	   ``Jonah is a big James Bond fan and it is very exciting news.
But until we talk to the rugby union nothing has been decided,''
Kingsley-Jones said. ``Jonah's main goal is to play for the All
Blacks in next year's World Cup and nothing comes before that.
	   `But the Bond people are dead keen to give him a major part.
It's a lovely feeling and will do wonders for promoting rugby
around the world. If it goes ahead he will play a big baddy.''
	   Kingsley-Jones said Lomu kept a cool head while meeting movie
bosses and was not nervous about playing opposite Brosnan, despite
never having acted. He would first have to join the British actors'
union to get an Equity card.
	   The movie, tentatively called The World is Not Enough, will also
feature Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane. American actress Denise
Richards, who starred in the space epic Starship Troopers, is
tipped to be the next Bond girl.

Blair, Ahern push for breakthrough in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES quotes from Blair, Ahern; EDITS to conform
 &UR; BC-Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said they would push ahead Friday
with efforts to persuade parties in Northern Ireland to overcome
differences holding up the peace process.
	   ``We will obviously work as hard as we can to get the parties
together,'' Blair told reporters. ``The people in Northern Ireland
want progress to be made, and it can be made.''
	   Blair and Ahern met for head-to-head talks in the Austrian
capital ahead of the year-end summit of European Union leaders.
Blair planned to take time out from the EU talks to phone Northern
Irish leaders.
	   Ahern and Blair expressed frustration that the Northern Irish
parties could not over come the last hurdles to a political
solution to the conflict.
	   ``We've lost an enormous amount of very valuable time,'' Ahern
told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``We've been negotiating for
four, five weeks and there's been so little progress _ quite
frankly it's astonishing.''
	   Hopes of a deal have snagged on details of power-sharing
arrangements between Protestant and Catholic parties, the powers of
cross-border institutions that will give the Irish government in
running the North, and when, if ever, the outlawed IRA will give up
its weapons.
	   Reflecting the British and Irish government's attempt to wrap up
a deal by Christmas, Ahern said the Northern Irish parties ``should
be coming back on Monday with some hard thinking concluded, rather
than just playing this back and forward. It's too serious for
that.''

Report blasts Swiss dealers, collectors over looted art
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHIAS BRUELLMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss dealers and collectors played a
major part in World War II trafficking in Nazi-looted art, but no
one was ever punished, a government-commissioned report said
Friday.
	   In fact, some prominent collectors and dealers were even
compensated by the Swiss government when, in a fraction of the
cases, they were forced to return the art, said the report.
	   ``What happened during and after the war in the art-trading
world is a scandal,'' said historian Thomas Buomberger, who for two
years coordinated the report on Switzerland's role in the dealings.
	   The report was commissioned long before plans were laid for the
U.S.-sponsored conference in Washington earlier this month to gain
an overview of what happened to the art, much of which was stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   Buomberger said that his view of the Swiss involvement was
limited mainly because many vital archives _ including that of the
highest Swiss court _ remained closed to him.
	   But he said what he was able to examine made it clear that
hundreds if not thousands of art objects passed through
Switzerland. A 1946 U.S. government report listed more than 2,000
people in a number of countries who trafficked in Nazi-looted art.
	   Buomberger said he found Switzerland's handling of victims'
claims for the stolen art after the war was similar to the
treatment of the heirs of Holocaust victims who tried to recover
bank deposits: great obstacles were placed in their way.
	   Under a special law that lapsed in 1947, the Federal Tribunal,
Switzerland's supreme court, reviewed 77 cases that grew out of a
report by the victorious Allies who had searched Europe for an
estimated 200,000 looted artworks.
	   ``In every case the Federal Tribunal accepted that the buyers of
looted property acted in good faith,'' said Buomberger. No one was
ever charged with theft, extortion or receiving stolen property.
	   As a result, the Swiss government compensated the Fischer
Gallery in Lucerne, the dealer that handled the most looted art in
Switzerland, with some 200,000 Swiss francs (then about dlrs
50,000), he said.
	   Buomberger said he was convinced that Theodor Fischer and his
main buyer, industrialist and weapons dealer Emil Georg Buehrle,
had known exactly where the artworks came from.
	   He said it was ``the crowning touch'' that the court awarded
Buehrle two-thirds of what he had paid near the end of the war for
a looted picture.
	   A prime source for Fischer's purchases was Walter Andreas Hofer,
head of the art collection of top Nazi Reichsmarshal Hermann
Goering, added Buomberger.
	   He praised the current management of the Fischer Gallery for
giving him full access to its archives, but he said the Buehrle
family let him see nothing and that he also encountered some
problems with Swiss museums.
	   The Swiss government announced that in mid-January it will open
a claims office in Bern. It has been instructed to provide
sensitive help to heirs of Holocaust victims looking for art looted
from their families.

Three Macedonian climbers killed, one more feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Rescue workers found the bodies of
three mountain climbers, and were still searching for a fourth, who
went missing in an avalanche in central Macedonia, police said
Friday.
	   The four Macedonians were training for a Himalayan expedition,
when they disappeared in a blizzard last Sunday on Mount Jakupica,
2,540 meters (8333 feet), near the town of Veles.
	   After an extensive helicopter search, the bodies of Ognjen
Filipovski, 38, Vlatko Gocevski, 31, and Branislav Kistovski, 38,
were found buried under deep snow.
	   The search for Predrag Tomasev, 19, was continuing despite heavy
snow, but he is also feared dead, police said.
	   All four were experienced mountain climbers.

New Champions League in place, but financial details pending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee wrapped
up a two-day meeting Friday with a revamped Champions League in
place but final details of its financing still unclear.
	   The committee on Thursday unanimously approved the start next
season of a new 32-team Champions League and a single competition _
called the UEFA Cup _ to merge the existing UEFA Cup and Cup
Winners Cup.
	   ``It makes the rich richer, but the poor are not getting poorer,
and that's quite a good result,'' UEFA President Lennart Johansson
told a news conference.
	   As UEFA's plans stand, a major club winning the new Champions
League would earn a maximum of between 65 and 70 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 46.5 million and 50 million).
	   The competitions were restructured to counter the threat of a
breakaway ``Super League,'' proposed by Milan-based marketing firm
Media Partners, which said new pay-per-view TV rights would boost
annual revenues for Europe's leading clubs.
	   UEFA set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European club competitions.
	   It came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Although that falls far short of the Super League's promised
revenues, the European governing body insists it is confident of
the projected revenue from television and sponsors.
	   But it left unclear to what extent the new format will involve
pay-per-view television.
	   ``We have always said that priority will be with free TV; we may
and will make use in certain countries of the pay TV market,'' UEFA
General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said.
	   ``I don't see at the moment that pay-per-view is on the agenda
but I wouldn't exclude that,'' he added.
	   Of the 600 million francs (dlrs 430 million) that would be
distributed to clubs, some 30 million francs (dlrs 21 million)
would go to the leagues of participating clubs, Aigner said.
	   ``There are more meetings to come'' over the next two to three
months regarding finances, Aigner said.
	   Each club in the first phase, where teams will pay in eight
groups of four, will receive 1.5 million francs (dlrs 1.1 million).
	   Additional payments would be made for matches played and won,
with the winner getting 10 million francs (dlrs 7.2 million).
	   That would leave 250 million francs (dlrs 180 million) to be
distributed according to a system of market values which hasn't yet
been finalized, Aigner said.
	   UEFA's share of the money will go to administrative costs and a
variety of other payments, including those to teams which are
eliminated in the qualifying rounds.
	   Aigner said UEFA is ``not particularly worried'' about further
pressure on the European body from the clubs in future.
	   ``It is not so much the clubs who have developed the ideas, it
is the television market which has developed ideas,'' he said. ``I
think the clubs are very comfortable to stay with us.''
	   The new Champions League will involve some teams who finish
fourth in the major European leagues, but UEFA kept its ``very good
branding.''
	   ``I think we are playing for the European champion and therefore
it is the Champions League,'' Aigner said.

Russian parliament passes bill to control inflation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with parliament approving bill that
limits money printing for this year; No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Parliament passed a bill today limiting
the amount of money the government can print to pay off its massive
debts, an effort to halt inflation that is at 70 percent and
threatening to go higher.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has been adding to the
money supply in recent months to help revive ailing banks and pay
off millions of state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   But increasing the money supply also stokes inflation.
Economists warn that printing too much money will spark the kind of
hyperinflation that plagued Russia for several years in the early
1990s.
	   Despite its huge obligations, the government can print only 25
billion additional rubles ($1.3 billion) in the final quarter of
this year, according to the bill that won overwhelming approval in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the
ruble,'' which has fallen sharply since the country's economic
crisis hit in August.
	   The Duma passed the bill on its second reading. It must be
approved one more time before going to parliament's upper chamber,
where it also is expected to win passage.
	   In another development today, the government said the economic
crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets to
private investors, and revenues this year were only a fraction of
those forecast.
	   The government had hoped to earn $400 million by auctioning off
state property, but it has earned only $70 million through October,
the Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The cash-strapped government approved a draft budget Thursday
and sent it to parliament today. In previous years, the government
and parliament have wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year and
has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

Minister: 30 percent of Russia's military hardware unfit for
</HEADLINE>
combat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Highlighting the moribund state of the
cash-strapped and disorganized military, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Friday said at least 30 percent of Russia's weapons
were no longer fit for combat.
	   The situation is especially alarming in the air force, where
only one third of aircraft can now take to the air, Sergeyev said
in a speech before the parliament.
	   The inadequate repairs and lack of training have contributed to
an increasing number of crashes of military aircraft. Earlier this
week, an Su-27 fighter jet crashed in the Far East, killing its
pilot.
	   ``The state of airfields continues to deteriorate and the
potential to defend the nation's airspace has substantially
decreased,'' Sergeyev said in the parliament's lower house, the
State Duma.
	   In the Russian navy, over 70 percent of ships need repairs, he
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The military modernization program has been crippled by the
government's severe cash shortage, further exacerbated by the
economic crisis that hit in August.
	   So far this year, the armed forces haven't received a ``single
new nuclear submarine, tank, combat plane, helicopter or cannon,''
Sergeyev said.
	   As a result, only 28 percent of all military hardware in the
armed forces inventories are of modern design, he said. He did not
explain what weapons the military considers state-of-the-art.
	   In the Strategic Missile Force, 60 percent of missiles on combat
duty have already served twice their service time, Sergeyev told
the lawmakers.
	   The military periodically test-fires the missiles to check their
condition and insists they remain combat-ready.
	   Sergeyev and other military leaders have called on parliament to
speed up long-stalled ratification of the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States that would allow Russia to reduce its
stockpiles and save money for new weapons.
	   However, Communists who dominate the Duma together with their
hard-line allies have balked at ratification, claiming the treaty
would hurt Russia's security. No date for the ratification debate
has been set yet, despite strong pressure from the government.

Reports: Major Japanese bank to be put under state control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that NCB will be nationalized
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese finance officials plan to put a major
lender, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., under state control after judging
the bank to be insolvent, media reports said Friday.
	   Japan's central bank and the Financial Supervisory Agency have
determined that Nippon Credit cannot overcome massive bad-debt
problems on its own and have decided they must nationalize the
bank, state-run NHK television reported.
	   The government will tell bank executives Saturday and make a
formal announcement the day after, Kyodo News agency said.
	   Nippon Credit would be only the second bank in Japan to be put
under state control since World War II. The government took over
the operations of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct.
23.
	   Spokesmen for both the Bank of Japan and the Financial
Supervisory Agency, which regulates the finance industry, denied a
takeover is imminent. And a spokesman for Nippon Credit said he was
not aware of such a plan.
	   Several other media agencies, including the mass-circulation
newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, also reported that the government was
mobilizing a takeover of the bank.
	   Nippon Credit was recently reported to have been in merger talks
with Japan's Chuo Trust and Banking Co., but earlier this week Chuo
said it was not considering a buyout of the ailing bank.
	   The reports said government regulators have determined that the
bank was hiding the size of its problems and that its debts exceed
its assets. The bank must be declared insolvent before the
government can legally assume control of its operations.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the
fifty largest in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune
magazine. NCB has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106
billion), but some 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) of its loans
were at risk of going bad, according to Kyodo.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate and stock prices early this
decade.
	   Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's so-called long-term
credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding of Japanese
industry following World War II by providing companies long-term,
low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies to
raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have
failed to find a new role.
	   The government has stepped in to aid NCB before. Last April,
finance officials asked a group of financial institutions and the
central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai airliner with 146 persons aboard
crashed near an airport in southern Thailand Friday night, police
said.
	   Officers in Surat Thani province said there were some survivors
from the crash, three to five kilometers (two to three miles) from
the Surat Thani airport, but they did not know how many or what
condition they were in.
	   A report from the Thai television station ITV said there were
eight to nine survivors, including the pilot, but this could not be
independently confirmed.
	   A spokesman for the airline said most of the 132 passengers on
the plane were Thai but that there were also some Japanese aboard
and a number of people with German-sounding names whose nationality
was not immediately known. The information came from the passenger
manifest.
	   The spokesman said the plane was an Airbus 310-200 with 245
seats, although another spokesman said it was a different model
Airbus.
	   Thai Airways flight 261 had been on its way to Surat Thani from
Bangkok when it crashed in Boon Pin district at 6:45 p.m. (1145
GMT), said police.
	   An officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plane
made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land.
	   Visibility remained bad on the final approach, he said.
	   Initial reports said one engine had exploded, but police said it
was unclear if the plane had engine trouble before it crashed.

China's Sun breaks three world marks, Iran takes men's gold

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sun Tianni outdid her Chinese women
teammates Friday, breaking all three possible world records in
Asian Games 69-kilogram division weightlifting.
	   But male teammate Zhang Yong, Asian record holder in the
85-kilogram division, failed completely in the snatch. Iran's
Shahin Nassiri-Nia won the gold, with China's Yuan Aijun second.
	   On the four previous days, Chinese women lifters all had won
gold medals and set world marks, but none had completely rewritten
the records in snatch, jerk and total.
	   Sun's 111 kilograms in the snatch broke the record of 110.5 set
by compatriot Tang Weifang last month, and her 135 in the jerk beat
the mark of 133.5 set by China's Shang Shichun in May. Her total of
245 erased Tang's 242.5, set in April.
	   She finished well ahead of silver medalist Win Win Maw of
Myanmar, who lifted a total of 227.5, and bronze winner Wu Mei-yi
of Taiwan, who hoisted 225. The two were tied after the snatch, in
which each lifted 97.5.
	   Next the 23-year-old Sun planned to phone her boyfriend in
Beijing to ask if he likes the sweater she knitted and sent him
before coming to Bangkok.
	   ``I was confident that I would win gold and make world records.
So it is not surprising,'' she said through an interpreter.
	   U Mya Nyunt, president of the Myanmar Weightlifting Federation,
said, ``We are very satisfied with the silver today. We knew that
we would never get the gold medal if we have to compete with
Chinese. ...
	   ``But who knows, we might get a new and big car as an award from
the government when we return home,'' he joked.
	   Win Win is among seven women weightlifters from Myanmar in the
games. They have won two silver medals and a bronze so far.
	   ``Myanmar did not send any males to compete in these games
because none of them is strong enough. Our girls are stronger than
boys,'' said U Mya Nyunt.
	   Iran's Nassiri-Nia lifted a total of 380, with a snatch of 170
and jerk of 210. Yuan took the silver with 370, and Uzbekistan's
Bahtiyar Nurullaev won the bronze with 347.5.
	   The snatch of 170 matched Zhang's Asian record, while Zhang
failed in three attempts at 130. He lifted 200 in the jerk, short
of his world record of 218, but had no total result. Zhang holds
the Asian record of 387.5 for total.

International police attacked in Bosnian Croat town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A team of international
police officers had to briefly be evacuated from the southern
Bosnian Croat city of Stolac after a hostile crowd attacked them
with sticks, international officials said Friday.
	   During an inspection at Stolac's police station Thursday
afternoon, representatives from the U.N.'s international police
force were told an area was off-limits because it belonged to the
Ministry of Defense, said Kelly Moore, spokeswoman for the U.N.
mission in Sarajevo.
	   The 24-person U.N. team was deployed Monday to Stolac, 115
kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Sarajevo, to monitor and
evaluate the performance of local police in preventing and solving
crime against returning refugees.
	   This year, more than 70 explosions and other incidents have been
directed against non-Croat refugees who have tried to return to
homes they fled in the Stolac area during the Bosnian war. No
arrests have been made.
	   After the team's requests to enter the restricted facility were
rejected, members called the NATO-led peace force to conduct a
weapons inspection.
	   Ammunition and other contraband was discovered and confiscated,
said NATO spokeswoman Sheena Thomson.
	   Meanwhile, a hostile crowd gathered in front of the police
station and blocked peace force vehicles, preventing the
confiscated goods from being removed.
	   ``The crowd attacked members of the IPTF (international police
force) with sticks, stormed the police station and threatened to
burn it down, giving IPTF monitors five minutes to evacuate,''
Moore said.
	   Members of the police force left with the help of NATO troops
and headed to nearby Mostar. No one was injured in the incident.
	   Police force members began returning Thursday evening to Stolac.
	   Following the incident, Minister of Interior Dragan Mandic fired
Stolac Police Chief Mirko Boskovic, Moore said.
	   Stolac continues to be run by Bosnian Croat hard-liners, who
have made the city one of the most problematic in Bosnia. Nearly
every effort to return Muslims to their pre-war homes has been met
with an explosion or harassment.
	   International officials say Stolac leaders remain defiant
because the city is located along the main route connecting Bosnia
with the Adriatic coast in nearby Croatia. Whoever controls the
area controls the main link between Bosnia and the sea.
	   Stolac is also a haven for smugglers. Goods cross the border
nearby and end up on the black market in Bosnia. Local authorities
are thought to be deeply involved in smuggling.
	   When asked how things might improve in Stolac, Simon Haselock, a
spokesman for Bosnia's top international official, Carlos
Westendorp, said: ``God only knows.''
	   The Peace Implementation Council, an international body that
deals with implementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, will
meet in Madrid next week to discuss progress.
	   The council has the authority to grant Westendorp powers to
solve outstanding problems in Bosnia, including firing and hiring
local officials.
	   ``Possibly the sorts of things that we will discuss in Madrid
may enfranchise the international community to be more robust in
these matters,'' Haselock said.

China, Mongolia sign oil refinery deal during state visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Nachagyn Bagbandy of Mongolia began a
six-day official visit to China on Friday, and the two countries
signed a pact pledging Chinese help to build his country's first
oil refinery.
	   Bagbandy, who is making his first visit to China since being
elected last year, met with President Jiang Zemin and other top
Chinese leaders to discuss trade, cross-border smuggling and other
issues.
	   The dlrs 39.7 million refinery agreement calls for Chinese and
Mongolian oil companies to build the facility near Dzuunbayan in
southeastern Mongolia, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The refinery is to process 500,000 tons of oil annually, while
another 500,000 tons is to be exported to China beginning next
October. China's Huafu Oil Co. is to have a 70 percent stake in the
refinery.

Blair, Ahern push for breakthrough in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said they would push ahead Friday
with efforts to persuade parties in Northern Ireland to overcome
differences holding up the peace process.
	   ``We will obviously work as hard as we can to get the parties
together,'' Blair told reporters. ``The people in Northern Ireland
want progress to be made, and it can be made.''
	   Blair and Ahern met for head-to-head talks in the Austrian
capital ahead of the year-end summit of European Union leaders.
Blair planned to take time out from the EU talks to phone Northern
Irish leaders.
	   Ahern and Blair expressed frustration that the Northern Irish
parties could not overcome the last hurdles to a political solution
to their conflict.
	   ``We've lost an enormous amount of very valuable time,'' Ahern
told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``We've been negotiating for
four, five weeks and there's been so little progress _ quite
frankly it's astonishing.''
	   Hopes of a deal have snagged on details of power-sharing
arrangements between Protestant and Catholic parties, the powers of
cross-border institutions that will give the Irish government in
running the North, and when, if ever, the outlawed IRA will give up
its weapons.
	   Reflecting the British and Irish government's attempt to wrap up
a deal by Christmas, Ahern said the Northern Irish parties ``should
be coming back on Monday with some hard thinking concluded, rather
than just playing this back and forward. It's too serious for
that.''

	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's fast bowlers
demolished the West Indies batting lineup Friday, dismissing them
for 121 in reply to South Africa's first innings 245 on the second
day of the second test.
	   Shaun Pollock was the man who did the damage at St. George's
Park. His haul of five for 43 was supported by some superb
line-and-length bowling by rookie David Terbrugge, who took three
for 27, and by some genuine pace by Allan Donald, who finished with
two for 33.
	   South Africa snatched four early wickets to have the West Indies
in trouble at 63 for four at lunch. It was Terbrugge who struck two
vital blows just before lunch, bowling opener Stuart Williams and
Carl Hooper in successive overs. Pollock had started the ball
rolling by dismissing Clayton Lambert for a duck in his first over.
Donald got in on the act by having Brian Lara caught at first slip
by Darryll Cullinan for four.
	   After lunch, it was one-way traffic, except for a breezy innings
of 31 by
	   Nixon McLean, who hit 31, including four towering sixes. He fell
to Donald, and Terbrugge and Pollock finished off the rest between
them.
	   South Africa had resumed their innings with Donald and Pat
Symcox at the wicket, and added just 22 runs to their overnight 223
for eight. Donald finished on 33, to equal his highest test score.
He perished to Hooper's fourth catch in the slips, giving Courtney
Walsh his fourth wicket in the innings.
	   South Africa were soon in trouble in their second innings, at 11
for two at tea, with Herschelle Gibbs gone for four, and Gary
Kirsten for two.

EU leaders endorse euro representation plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders agreed Friday on
who should speak on the world stage for the 11-nation ``euro-zone''
economic bloc to be formed on Jan. 1 by the launch of the EU common
currency.
	   The EU summit endorsed a compromise by finance ministers that
resolved months of deadlock between big and small euro-zone nations
over representation at the G-7 group of world economic powers and
other international bodies.
	   European Union Commission President Jacques Santer Friday said
he will present the proposal to U.S. President Bill Clinton when
they meet in Washington next week.
	   ``It was essential to resolve this question,'' Santer said,
adding the euro-zone could now speak with once voice
internationally.
	   Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he did not expect any
problems from the United States or the other non-European G-7
nations Japan and Canada, although the plan will give Europeans
extra seats at G-7 finance meetings.
	   Under the compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 members
- Germany, France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns
to represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside
them at G-7 meetings, when they hold the rotating euro-zone
presidency.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niniisto, for second half of the
year.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the new European Central Bank, will
get a G-7 seat.
	   The launch of the euro is meant to create a single bloc that
will rival the United States and Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world economic situation, nobody was sure whom to call
when they want to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The EU hopes the rotating system of euro-zone presidencies will
go some way to meeting that need.
	   Britain, a member of the EU and the G-7, has decided not to swap
the pound for the euro, but Prime Minister Tony Blair backed the
euro-zone representation plan.

Report blasts Swiss dealers, collectors over looted art
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHIAS BRUELLMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss dealers and collectors played a
major part in World War II trafficking in Nazi-looted art, but no
one was ever punished, a government-commissioned report said
Friday.
	   Some prominent collectors and dealers even were compensated by
the Swiss government when, in a fraction of the cases, they were
forced to return the art, the report said.
	   ``What happened during and after the war in the art-trading
world is a scandal,'' said historian Thomas Buomberger, who for two
years coordinated the report on Switzerland's role in the dealings.
	   The report was commissioned long before plans were laid for the
U.S.-sponsored conference in Washington earlier this month to gain
an overview of what happened to the art, much of which was stolen
from Holocaust victims.
	   Buomberger said that his view of the Swiss involvement was
limited mainly because many vital archives _ including that of the
highest Swiss court _ remained closed to him.
	   But he said what he was able to examine made it clear that
hundreds if not thousands of art objects passed through
Switzerland. A 1946 U.S. government report listed more than 2,000
people in a number of countries who trafficked in Nazi-looted art.
	   Buomberger said he found Switzerland's handling of victims'
claims for the stolen art after the war was similar to the
treatment of the heirs of Holocaust victims who tried to recover
bank deposits: great obstacles were placed in their way.
	   Under a special law that lapsed in 1947, the Federal Tribunal,
Switzerland's supreme court, reviewed 77 cases that grew out of a
report by the victorious Allies who had searched Europe for an
estimated 200,000 looted artworks.
	   ``In every case the Federal Tribunal accepted that the buyers of
looted property acted in good faith,'' Buomberger said. No one was
ever charged with theft, extortion or receiving stolen property.
	   As a result, the Swiss government compensated the Fischer
Gallery in Lucerne, the dealer that handled the most looted art in
Switzerland, with some 200,000 Swiss francs (then about dlrs
50,000), he said.
	   Buomberger said he was convinced that Theodor Fischer and his
main buyer, industrialist and weapons dealer Emil Georg Buehrle,
had known exactly where the artworks came from.
	   He said it was ``the crowning touch'' that the court awarded
Buehrle two-thirds of what he had paid near the end of the war for
a looted picture.
	   Buomberger said that a prime source for Fischer's purchases was
Walter Andreas Hofer, head of the art collection of top Nazi
Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering.
	   Buomberger praised the current management of the Fischer Gallery
for giving him full access to its archives, but he said the Buehrle
family let him see nothing and that he also encountered some
problems with Swiss museums.
	   The Swiss government announced that in mid-January it will open
a claims office in Bern. It has been instructed to provide
sensitive help to heirs of Holocaust victims looking for art looted
from their families.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A breakdown in a central heating system has left
2,400 people in Russia's Far East with no heat in their apartments,
a news report said Friday.
	   Repairs are expected to take more than a month. The
administration of the Jewish autonomous region, north of the
Chinese border, have mobilized local Emergency Situations Ministry
staff and army units to help, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Authorities have offered to move people into kindergartens and
other non-residential, heated buildings while the repairs are
underway, but only 148 people have taken up the offer, the report
said.
	   Others have remained in their frozen apartments and are using
portable heaters, it said.
	   The breakdown affected 40 large apartment buildings. They still
had electricity.

Price war broadens in recently liberalized German telephone market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: o.tel.o is cq &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Price wars in Germany's recently
liberalized telephone market heated up Friday with a small company
announcing drastic cuts and former monopoly Deutsche Telecom
winning permission to slash prices by 63 percent.
	   Deutsche Telekom lost its monopoly a year ago with the
liberalization of Germany's telecommunications market in keeping
with European Union standards. Since then, the partially privatized
Telekom has been competing against upstarts such as o.tel.o, which
announced it would cut prices by 61 percent starting Feb. 1.
	   It was the third price cut declared in recent weeks. In addition
to Telekom and o.tel.o, Mannesman Arcor plans a 54 percent price
cut for Jan. 1.
	   Telekom's cuts were announced earlier but approved Friday by
Germany's telecommunications regulatory committee, a watchdog on
Telekom because of its dominant market share. The smaller companies
do not need approval for cuts.
	   Telekom will sink prices to 36 pfennigs (22 U.S. cents) per
minute for long-distance calls within Germany during office hours.
Weekend calls will drop to 12 pfennigs (7.5 U.S. cents.)
	   O.tel.o plans to offer customers who switch companies on a
call-by-call basis 9.5 pfennigs (6 U.S. cents) a minute on weekends
and holidays, and 20 pfennigs (just over 12 U.S. cents) in the week
during business hours.
	   It also announced a deal for the 11 countries launching the
European common currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   The special rate, called the ``Euro-Tarif,'' means that calls to
any of the other 10 countries from Germany will cost 54 pfennigs
(34 U.S. cents) a minute, 24-hours a day. The move will sink the
cost of calling France, Italy or Spain by about 22 percent.
	   With competition like this, Deutsche Telekom has found the open
market painful. Since Jan. 1, the launch of the market
liberalization, Telekom has cut 40,000 jobs and plans to trim
20,000 more by 2000. It also said recently it will seek possible
mergers.
	   Meanwhile, Telekom is being investigated by Germany's antitrust
watchdog, which suspects the company is charging competitors unfair
fees for use of its directory data, compiled when it was still a
monopoly.
	   According to the cartel office, Deutsche Telekom charges an
unfair fixed rate of up to 170 million marks, or dlrs 100 million,
for competitors who want to offer customers the same full-range
directory assistance Telekom does. The cartel office wants Telekom
to adopt a sliding fee scale, based on directory use and market
share.

Spartak Trnava coach gets national team job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ FC Spartak Trnava coach Dusan Galis
will add the Slovak national team to his duties, taking over the
side while still managing his club team, Slovak newspapers reported
Friday.
	   Galis will be the national team coach through 1999 and will
continue to run both teams until his contract with Trnava expires
at the end of June.
	   Former national team coach Jozef Jankech was dismissed in
October after Slovakia lost to Portugal 3-0 in the qualifying round
of the European Championship.
	   Galis coached Slovak Bratislava team from 1992-96, leading them
to three Slovak league championships and one Czechoslovak league
crown, before the country split peacefully in 1993.

Privatization minister resigns over corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The minister in charge of the
privatization of Uganda's bloated public sector has resigned after
parliament released a wide-ranging report on corruption in the sale
of state enterprises, President Yoweri Museveni said Friday.
	   The announcement followed the resignation Sunday of Museveni's
only brother, Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, from his position as special
presidential military adviser, after it was revealed that Saleh had
secretly purchased 49 percent of the shares in a recently
privatized bank.
	   Asked by reporters whether he had been aware of the activities
of Matthew Rukikaire, who had been in charge of Uganda's ambitious
privatization program since 1995, Museveni replied:
	   ``In the past, lepers wore bells which made people know that
they were around. But now you can't know people who are good and
those who are bad. Even those who tell you that they are good and
criticize government policies later turn out to be bad.''
	   Museveni, who came to power in 1986 after a five-year rebellion,
called his younger brother's behavior ``disobedience'' and said he
was ready to ``put people behind bars'' following ``proper
investigation, prosecution and judgment.''
	   It was not immediately clear what legal action, if any, would be
taken against either Rukikaire or Saleh.
	   Saleh has admitted he channeled funds through the local
Greenland Bank to buy 49 percent of the shares in the Uganda
Commercial Bank Ltd, which the government sold earlier this year to
the Malaysian holding company, Westmont.
	   Westmont is technically insolvent and has been granted court
protection from creditors.
	   Museveni said his government had warned Westmont against selling
the bank to another party.
	   ``They know that government had told them that 49 percent of the
shares in UCB shall not be sold to anybody else before the end of
three years,'' he said. ``Inspire of the warning, they went ahead
and continued with the sale without telling us.''
	   Uganda, which has been the darling of multinational lending
agencies and donors, has enjoyed an average 6.2 percent growth over
the past several years, although 50 percent of its budget is
supported by outside funds.
	   Since its inception in 1992, Uganda's privatization program has
incurred charges of corruption in the form of kickbacks,
under-pricing, bogus buyers and intentional vandalism of state
property before its sale at bargain prices to senior government
officials.
	   On Thursday international donors voiced concern about Museveni's
ability to control corruption and increased military spending but
went ahead and endorsed dlrs 2.2 billion in financial aid to Uganda
through 2001.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Making his first public appearance since his
arrest almost two months ago on a Spanish warrant, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet said Friday that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of
any country but his native Chile to try him ``against all the lies
of Spain.''
	   Magistrate Graham Parkinson set a Jan. 18 hearing date for the
formal start of proceedings to extradite Pinochet to Spain, which
wants to try the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture committed by his security forces during his 17-year
regime.
	   Outside Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, hundreds of ``Free
Pinochet'' supporters chanted and waved Chilean flags from behind
police lines, while rival groups shouted back and waved placards
declaring ``Don't let this butcher go!''
	   Pinochet, arrested Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery,
entered the heavily guarded courtroom in a wheelchair, his hands
clasping the top of a walking stick.
	   The 83-year-old general wore a brown striped suit and spoke in a
husky voice when asked to identify himself.
	   ``I was the commander in chief of the army, the captain of
Chile, president of the republic and, actually, I am at the moment
a senator of the republic,'' he said in Spanish.
	   Reading from a card, he continued, also in Spanish, ``With
respect to your honor, I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any
other court but in my country to try me against all the lies of
Spain.''
	   He waved his hand and added, ``That is all I want to say.''
	   Parkinson, who said Pinochet would not have to appear at the
January hearing, varied the conditions of his bail to allow him to
use the grounds of the rented mansion he moved to southwest of
London on Dec. 1 _ provided the general remains under police guard
while outside.
	   ``I certainly think it would be inhumane to stop the senator
walking in the garden as and when necessary,'' Parkinson said.
	   Pinochet's appearance was the latest step in what could be years
of legal wrangling over his extradition.
	   Due to the expected crush of interest, court officials scheduled
the hearing at suburban Belmarsh, a high-security magistrate's
court once used to indict Irish Republican Army gunmen, instead of
in central London. Belmarsh is 10 miles (15 kms) from the city
center.
	   Also Friday, the House of Lords planned to announce how it will
proceed on a highly unusual appeal by the general's lawyers asking
it to overturn its 3-2 decision that Pinochet does not have
immunity from arrest as a former foreign head of state. British
newspapers reported that a hearing on the appeal was expected
Tuesday.
	   The grounds of the appeal were not disclosed, but the lawyers
had complained that one of the law lords who ruled against Pinochet
is the unpaid director of the fundraising arm of Amnesty
International, the human rights group that has played a key role in
a long campaign to have Pinochet put on trial.
	   Amnesty International says Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann did not
take part in the campaign.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw discounted any possible bias in
Britain's highest court when he decided Wednesday to let Spain's
extradition request proceed.
	   The Times of London reported Friday that the only previous
challenge to a House of Lords ruling was attempted in 1823 over a
land ownership case. The challenge failed, the newspaper said.
	   In Spain, Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a 300-page criminal
indictment Thursday, charging Pinochet with genocide, terrorism and
torture. Straw had ruled that Pinochet could not be indicted on a
charge of genocide, but let the other charges stand.
	   The indictment lists thousands of alleged victims, including
Spaniards, Argentines, Paraguayans, Bolivians and Mexicans. Garzon
also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's assets and for his
continued detention in Britain.
	   Pinochet's lawyers announced Thursday that they are considering
appealing Straw's decision, which was denounced in Chile as a
violation of its national sovereignty and a threat to the fragile
democracy set up in 1990 when Pinochet relinquished power.

Polish president preparing new bill to open communist files
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski said in a
letter made public Friday he will propose a new bill on opening
communist era files to replace a controversial measure he vetoed
last week.
	   In the letter sent to political leaders Thursday, Kwasniewski
said he wanted to correct ``legal errors'' in the bill passed by
parliament in September that would allow victims of the former
secret police to see their files.
	   His veto brought heavy criticism from rightist Solidarity
politicians, who accused Kwasniewski, a former communist, of trying
to protect former agents.
	   The Solidarity-led governing alliance lacks the necessary 60
percent support in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, to
override Kwasniewski's veto. If it fails to get additional support
from other parties, Solidarity leaders intend to resubmit the
measure next year.
	   The bill supported by Solidarity calls for setting up an
Institute of National Remembrance to manage communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The
institute would make the files available to victims and reveal who
informed on them.
	   It also would have the power to launch investigations intended
to establish those responsible for persecution or political
murders.
	   Kwasniewski's letter said he would propose his own version,
which would allow all Poles to see their secret police files and
change the way the members of the institute are chosen.
	   His draft would have the institute's nine-member board elected
to seven-year terms by both chambers of parliament _ the Sejm and
the Senate _ as well as the National Judicial Council. Under the
parliament bill, the Sejm would choose board members to nine-year
terms.
	   Solidarity leaders say secret files should be open to victims to
ensure historical justice and make sure criminals of the past no
longer hold power, even if that forces out top political leaders.
They also warn that former agents could be blackmailed by criminal
gangs or foreign governments if the truth remains hidden.
	   Former communists say the files are incomplete and unreliable, a
result of uncontrolled work by the feared communist-era Security
Service.
	   In October, Kwasniewski signed another law that requires
government officials, judges and others to declare if they ever
worked for or collaborated with the former security service. Under
the law, which took effect last month, those making false
declarations can lose their jobs.

Russian parliament seeks to control inflation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with additional details on inflation
and the Russian money supply. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament moved Friday to limit the amount of
money the government can print, part of an effort to rein in
inflation that's at 70 percent this year and threatening to spiral
out of control.
	   As Russia wrestles with its economic crisis, one of the
trickiest questions is how much money President Boris Yeltsin's
government should inject into the economy. More money helps
stimulate the weak economy, but it also stokes inflation.
	   Since a financial meltdown in August, the government has pumped
billions of rubles into the economy in a bid to revive ailing banks
and pay off state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   Despite these huge obligations, the government may print only 25
billion additional rubles (dlrs 1.3 billion) in the final quarter
of this year, according to the bill that won overwhelming approval
in parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the
ruble,'' which has fallen sharply over the past four months.
	   Many economists predicted the government would flood the economy
with additional cash, and the country's money supply has gone from
about 160 billion rubles (dlrs 8 billion) when the crisis struck to
more 190 billion rubles (dlrs 9.5 billion) today, according to
government figures.
	   Still, the increase is less than many economists had forecast
and so far has not been a major contributor to inflation, according
to some analysts.
	   However, the economists say it will be more difficult for Russia
to rein in spending in coming months because it faces ever larger
debts and shrinking revenues.
	   The Duma passed the bill Friday on its second reading. It must
be approved one more time before going to parliament's upper
chamber, where it's also expected to win passage.
	   In another development Friday, the government said that the
economic crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets
to private investors, and revenues this year were only a fraction
of those forecast.
	   The government had hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles (about dlrs
400 million) by auctioning off state property, but it has earned
only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 70 million) through October, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month.
	   One possible buyer is the German gas distributor Ruhrgas, which
delivers Gazprom's gas to German consumers.
	   Russia's Cabinet approved a draft budget Thursday and planned to
send it to parliament Friday. In previous years, the government and
parliament have wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions, and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year,
and has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Forty-seven people froze to death in an
Arctic cold wave that has hit Hungary in the past 10 days, police
said Friday.
	   The majority of the cold-related deaths occurred in northeastern
part of the country, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy, of the national police
told the Associated Press. Almost all the casualties were men and
most of them were homeless or suffered from alcoholism, he said.
	   Temperatures in Hungary have dropped as low as minus 15-20
degrees Celsius (5 to minus 4 Fahrenheit) at night for over a week.
The average low in Hungary for this time of year hover around
freezing.
	   Weather forecasters predict milder temperatures early next week.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out
searches again Friday, despite a dispute with the authorities over
entry to an office of the ruling party.
	   At least three inspection teams drove out of the U.N.
headquarters on Baghdad's outskirts in white, four-wheel drive
vehicles adorned with the U.N. logo.
	   Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said there were fewer
inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim sabbath. But, she
added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of work''
and would conduct searches through the weekend.
	   This week's searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
work last month.
	   Visiting teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct
the more intrusive searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath Party, to which a
team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday.
	   A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco
building, has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try
to return. The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is
private property and contains no materials wanted by the
inspectors.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. Richard
Butler, the chief weapons inspector, has said the office in the
neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials of significance.''
	   In a dispute that ended better on Thursday, U.N. inspectors
tried to search what Iraqis called a private home, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported. The Iraqis insisted, however, that the
inspectors first get permission from the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, the agency said, quoting
Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring
Directorate.
	   Eight U.N. teams checked 12 sites on Thursday, with two teams
using helicopters, Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors resumed work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus after Iraq banned them from visiting any new
suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed down on Nov. 14 and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes.
	   The United States has said the disputes over the inspections
could lead it to attack Iraqi without warning.

Olympic organizers fill more key posts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The organizing committee of the 2004
Olympic filled more key positions, including construction and
planning overseers, officials announced Friday.
	   The appointments could help deflect allegations that the
organizers have been slow in putting together a team to prepare for
the Games.
	   Concern also has been expressed regarding the acquisition of
land for the Olympic village and athletic venues and the shortage
of top-class hotel accommodations in the Athens area.
	   But organizers counter that more than two-thirds of the Olympic
facilities are done and important projects _ including the subway,
a new airport and a ring road _ are due for completion by 2001.
	   The new appointments include the general director of planning,
Giorgos Benekos, and the general director for construction, Giorgos
Leventis.
	   Leventis worked at New Jersey-based Langan Engineering and
Environmental Services and was responsible for such projects as the
dlrs 1 billion expansion of New York Hospital.
	   Benekos was the chief financial officer for Athens' airport.
	   Another former fiscal manager at the airport, Nikos Pefanis, was
named the economic director for the Olympic organizing effort.
	   Other appointments were: Dimitra Boura, communications director;
Spiros Pappas, hospitality director, and Vasilis Kotsovilis, legal
advisor.
	   The managing director of the organizing committee, Costas
Bakouris, hopes to fill the remaining top positions _ including
transportation, technology and marketing directors _ by the end of
the year.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ A court ordered Prince Ernst August of
Hanover on Friday to pay 15,000 marks (dlrs 9,000) to a
photographer he beat with an umbrella for trying to snap pictures
of him with Princess Caroline of Monaco.
	   The personal injury fine is on top of 90,000 marks (dlrs 54,200)
the prince already paid in exchange for the dropping of criminal
assault charges. In addition, the Hanover regional court ordered
Ernst August to pay court costs of 3,400 marks (dlrs 2,050).
	   Photographer Karsten Thuernau suffered a broken nose, a
concussion and bruises when the prince beat him for seven minutes
at his Pattensen estate, near Hanover, on the night of Jan. 11.
	   Thuernau had been waiting outside the estate to take a picture
of the royal couple. The prince has claimed he was not trying to
hit Thuernau, but only his camera.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Making his first public appearance since his
arrest almost two months ago on a Spanish warrant, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet said Friday that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of
any country but his native Chile to try him ``against all the lies
of Spain.''
	   Magistrate Graham Parkinson set a Jan. 18 hearing date for the
formal start of proceedings to extradite Pinochet to Spain, which
wants to try the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture committed by his security forces during his 17-year
regime.
	   Outside Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, hundreds of ``Free
Pinochet'' supporters chanted and waved Chilean flags from behind
police lines, while rival groups shouted back and waved placards
declaring ``Don't let this butcher go!''
	   Pinochet, arrested Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery,
entered the heavily guarded courtroom in a wheelchair, his hands
clasping the top of a walking stick.
	   The 83-year-old general wore a brown striped suit and spoke in a
husky voice when asked to identify himself.
	   ``I was the commander in chief of the army, the captain of
Chile, president of the republic and, actually, I am at the moment
a senator of the republic,'' he said in Spanish.
	   Later, reading from a card, also in Spanish, he said, ``With
respect to your honor, I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any
other court but in my country to try me against all the lies of
Spain.''

China women still dominate table tennis

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Playing without veteran star Deng
Yaping, China's women's table tennis team took gold Friday and
retained its title with a victory over North Korea at the Asian
Games.
	   All of China's players were competing in their first Asian Games
but they still managed to down North Korea 3-1
	   Wang Nan kicked off China's victory with a 21-13, 21-11 win over
North Korea's Tu Jong Sil but North Korea's Kim Hyon Hui leveled
the match by beating China's Yang Ying 21-17, 21-17.
	   China's Li Ju took the next match against Wi Pok Sun 14-21,
21-18, 21-14 before Wang Nan clinched the gold with a 21-14, 21-10
win over Kim Hyon Hui.
	   Li Ju said the team still felt good about itself even though
Deng stopped playing with the team about a year ago to study.
	   ``We're quite confident,'' she said.
	   ``We have to get used to the fact that she isn't here,'' said
Wang Nan, ``Players come one generation after another.''
	   But coach Lu Yuansheng sounded relieved. He said the North
Koreans were improving technically every year.
	   ``In the Deng Yaping era we got the championship easily,'' he
said. ``This victory wasn't easy. I'm very satisfied.''
	   Semifinal losers Hong Kong and South Korea received bronzes.
	   In the men's team event, China and South Korea won semifinal
matches to set up a meeting for the title Saturday.
	   China beat Japan, and South Korea defeated Taiwan.

South African bowlers grab initiative against WIndies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES reference to South Africa's batting at tea; CORRECTS
that results are from tea, sted end of day's play

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa had a
lackluster batting performance at tea Friday after its bowlers
demolished the West Indies lineup on the second day of the second
test.
	   South Africa had resumed their innings with Allan Donald and Pat
Symcox at the wicket, and added just 22 runs to their overnight 223
for eight. Donald finished on 33, to equal his highest test score.
He perished to Carl Hooper's fourth catch in the slips, giving
Courtney Walsh his fourth wicket in the innings.
	   South Africa were soon in trouble in their second innings, at 11
for two at tea, with Herschelle Gibbs gone for four, and Gary
Kirsten for two.
	   Earlier, South Africa's fast bowlers dismissed the West Indies
batting lineup for 121 in reply to South Africa's first innings 245
	   Shaun Pollock was the man who did the damage at St. George's
Park. His haul of five for 43 was supported by some superb
line-and-length bowling by rookie David Terbrugge, who took three
for 27, and by some genuine pace by Donald, who finished with two
for 33.
	   South Africa snatched four early wickets to have the West Indies
in trouble at 63 for four at lunch. Terbrugge struck two vital
blows just before lunch, bowling opener Stuart Williams and Hooper
in successive overs. Pollock had started the ball rolling by
dismissing Clayton Lambert for a duck in his first over. Donald got
in on the act by having Brian Lara caught at first slip by Darryll
Cullinan for four.
	   After lunch, it was one-way traffic, except for a breezy innings
of 31 by
	   Nixon McLean, who hit 31, including four towering sixes. He fell
to Donald, and Terbrugge and Pollock finished off the rest between
them.

Rover auto workers approve deal to keep plant afloat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rover auto workers voted Friday to
accept a radical restructuring deal that will cut 2,500 jobs but
keep Birmingham's huge Longbridge assembly plant open, the company
and union leaders said.
	   The deal will lead to hundreds of millions of pounds (dollars)
of new investment by Rover's owners BMW, including the building at
the Longbridge factory of a new Mini, a compact model that had been
the company's biggest-selling car.
	   Ratification of the deal calmed fears that Longbridge could
close, causing the loss of 14,000 jobs at the plant and thousands
of others across England.
	   ``This decision is a milestone,'' BMW chairman Bernd
Pischetsrieder said. ``The workers themselves and the union
representatives have made a most important contribution in order to
secure a successful future for Rover.''
	   Employees voted 17,784 to 7,045 to accept the agreement, which
was hashed out by national union leaders and company bosses, union
sources told Press Association, the British news agency.
	   Under the deal, workers will have a 35-hour week, down from the
current 37, for the first time in the British motor industry. The
company will be granted flexibility and efficiency improvements
that are commonplace at BMW-run factories.
	   Since it emerged last month that voluntary job cuts would be
sought, thousands of workers have contacted the company asking for
details of the severance package, and about 600 already have left
Rover.

Russian parliament passes bill to control inflation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with parliament approving bill that

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Parliament passed a bill today limiting
the amount of money the government can print to pay off its massive
debts, an effort to halt inflation that is at 70 percent and
threatening to go higher.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has been adding to the
money supply in recent months to help revive ailing banks and pay
off millions of state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   But increasing the money supply also stokes inflation.
Economists warn that printing too much money will spark the kind of
hyperinflation that plagued Russia for several years in the early
1990s.
	   Despite its huge obligations, the government can print only 25
billion additional rubles ($1.3 billion) in the final quarter of
this year, according to the bill that won overwhelming approval in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the
ruble,'' which has fallen sharply since the country's economic
crisis hit in August.
	   The Duma passed the bill on its second reading. It must be
approved one more time before going to parliament's upper chamber,
where it also is expected to win passage.
	   In another development today, the government said the economic
crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets to
private investors, and revenues this year were only a fraction of
those forecast.
	   The government had hoped to earn $400 million by auctioning off
state property, but it has earned only $70 million through October,
the Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The cash-strapped government approved a draft budget Thursday
and sent it to parliament today. In previous years, the government
and parliament have wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year and
has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

Police arrest third suspect linked to burger joint attacks

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Police said Friday they arrested a
third suspect this week in connection with a recent spate of arson
attacks against fast-food outlets in Belgium carried out by a
militant animal rights group.
	   Police arrested two women last month on suspicion of complicity
in the attacks, and Wednesday they picked up a 35 year-old man on
the same charge. He is due to appear in court on Monday.
	   The Belgian Animal Liberation Front has claimed responsibility
for nine attacks this year against McDonald's and Quick outlets.
Trucks transporting meat were also damaged.
	   Other attacks have taken place since September for which no one
has claimed responsibility. All of them occurred in northern
Belgium. In the worst of these incidents, a McDonald's outlet was
burnt to the ground, causing an estimated dlrs 1.75 million worth
of damage.
	   McDonald's and Quick refuse to comment on the case until the
investigation is over.
	   In a letter to the Dutch magazine Ravage on Sep. 7, the Belgian
branch of the ALF claimed responsibility for the attacks. They said
``our actions are a reaction against ... the violence that
McDonald's uses against animals, the lies that McDonald's spreads
and the damage it does to people's health.''
	   ``We wish McDonald's to burn in hell, and that is what we are
doing. Action speaks louder than words!'' the letter ended.
	   The ALF denied responsibility for the dumping of a rubbish bag
filled with human bones outside a Brussels McDonald's outlet last
September. The bones had been dug up from a cemetery.
	   This incident ``had nothing to do with the ALF. There has never
been any ALF action of this type,'' Robin Webb, a spokesman for the
British branch of the ALF said in a telephone interview.
	   The ALF is a loose grouping of activists campaigning for animal
rights. They are particularly active in the United States and
Britain. To join, one only needs to carry out a punitive act
against those believed to be violating animal rights.
	   Webb insists that ALF ethics prohibit physical violence. ``No
ALF action has ever harmed anyone,'' he said. No one has been
injured in the Belgian arson attacks.
	   The point of attacking McDonald's is ``economic sabotage. It is
intended to price them out of business,'' Webb said.
	   Other animal defense groups have distanced themselves from ALF's
use of violence.
	   ``We do not believe that the defense of animal rights is served
by fighting the violence that is inflicted on innocent animals with
violence,'' said Michel Vandenbosch, who heads the Global Action in
the Interest of Animals, a Belgian group.

Finance minister vows Pakistan will pay its bills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's finance minister promised
Friday that his cash-strapped government would meet its debt
payments despite financial troubles that he said have been
exacerbated by international economic sanctions.
	   Pakistan has to make a dlrs 300 million payment on a variety of
loans from international lenders and import bills by mid-January to
stave off default, something it will do, Ishaq Dar said.
	   ``We will make all our payments,'' Dar said.
	   It's expected the money will come from the International
Monetary Fund, which has negotiated a dlrs 5.5 billion loan to
Pakistan.
	   The first installment of that loan will come after the agreement
gets its final approval from the IMF board of directors, which is
to meet in January, said Dar.
	   Pakistan is also expecting dlrs 800 million from the Asian
Development Bank, however that money also will await the IMF board
meeting in January.
	   In November Pakistan paid dlrs 128 million in outstanding
payments. Cash-poor Pakistan has received a 60-day grace period on
the repayment of several loans and Dar said the payments will be
made before the grace period ends next month.
	   Pakistan's financial crunch, according to the government, is the
fault of international sanctions that were imposed on both Pakistan
and India following last May's underground nuclear tests. The two
uneasy neighbors conducted a series of tests and declared
themselves nuclear powers.
	   That brought international condemnation and sanctions. The
United States later relented and agreed to support a one-time deal
for IMF money to Pakistan.
	   India's robust economy has made it less susceptible to the
sanctions. Pakistan, however, is largely dependent on international
aid and has been struggling.
	   Dar told reporters that the worst was over and once the
international financing resumes Pakistan's financial house will be
in order.
	   He anticipated increased agricultural production. He also said
industrial growth in the last four months has shown an increase of
4.1 percent and inflation has dropped to six percent from an
earlier 10 percent.
	   However Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain at a low
dlrs 480 million, barely enough to cover the cost of one month's
import bill.

Iranian embassy denies report that it recruited Russian scientists

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Iranian Embassy and a senior Iranian scientist
have denied a report that they actively recruited Russian
scientists who previously worked on Russia's germ warfare program.
	   In a statement, the Iranian Embassy said Thursday that the
Iranian government ``has not and will not try under any
circumstances to get access to such types of (biological) arms.''
	   Iran is conducting peaceful biological research programs that
are ``directed at combating AIDS and lung diseases, tuberculosis in
particular,'' the statement added.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had successfully
lured five Russian scientists and was trying to attract more from
research centers in Russia and Kazakstan.
	   An Iranian scientist identified in the report as a key figure in
the recruiting effort also issued a denial, the Times reported
today.
	   Mehdi Rezayat insisted that his overtures were peaceful and that
he was only trying to obtain medicines and information to make
diagnostic kits, the Times reported.
	   Rezayat, whose business card identifies him as a pharmacologist,
said he was ``astonished'' by the Tuesday report.
	   The Iranian Embassy statement said that the relationship between
Russia and Iran is fully open and that both countries were meeting
their commitments concerning the nonproliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Meanwhile, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
called Thursday for tightened control over the export of equipment
and expertise to Iran.
	   After meeting with visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, Maslyukov said the United States had expressed
concern about apparent unauthorized supplies of Russian missile
expertise and equipment to Iran.
	   Maslyukov demanded specific evidence before Russia would take
any action but added that ``control over exports should be
tightened,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At the start of talks today with Talbott, Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said, ``We understand what place the United States
occupies in the modern world. We would like for our partners also
to know more about modern Russia, to know more about our
intentions.''
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor, and both
countries insist the reactor will only be used to generate power.
	   However, the United States and Israel say that the technology
may help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no plans to
develop such weapons.
	   The United States also has been providing aid to Russian
scientists in recent years in hopes that they will not be tempted
to sell their expertise to countries that want to build weapons of
mass destruction.

After Kazakstan's shining moment, China breaks more records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swimming, weightlifting, other late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan's canoeing team brought a
short pause Friday to China's rapid-fire gold medal collection,
before Chinese weightlifter Sun Tianni did the most thorough job so
far at the Asian Games of smashing world records.
	   Malaysian Lim Keng Liat also slowed the Chinese onslaught,
winning a swimming gold medal that seemed to take him by surprise.
	   It was Malaysia's first gold of these games, and it later added
a second in doubles snooker, where Sam Chong and Ooi Chin-kay beat
Thailand's Phaithan Phonbun and Noppadon Noppachorn.
	   Indonesia also won its first gold here, in badminton.
	   ``I feel like I'm making history for my country,'' said Lim, who
said he had hoped just to finish in the top three.
	   But China still took the bulk of the day's golds _ 11 of 25 _
and led the standings with 61 in all. Japan had 23, South Korea 21
and Kazakstan 11.
	   Kazakstan won five gold medals in canoes and kayaks in less than
an hour _ before China took the final two women's race.
	   In other victories against China, Taiwan beat its women's tennis
team for a gold, Indonesia defeated its men's badminton team for
another, a South Korean beat a Chinese fencer in a championship
match, and North Korea stopped a Chinese sweep of the day's four
golds in shooting.
	   China's biggest setback came in men's 85-kilogram class
weightlifting, where Asian record holder Zhang Yong failed on all
three tries at 130 kilograms in the snatch, and had only a result
from the jerk _ 200.
	   Iran's Shahin Nassiri-Nia won gold with a total lift of 380 _ a
snatch of 170 and jerk of 210. China's Yuan Aijun took silver with
370.
	   But in the women's 69-kilogram class, Sun Tianni outdid her
Chinese women teammates Friday.
	   On the four previous days, Chinese women lifters all had won
gold medals and set world marks, but none had completely rewritten
the records in snatch, jerk and total.
	   Sun's 111 kilograms in the snatch broke the record of 110.5 set
by compatriot Tang Weifang last month, and her 135 in the jerk beat
the mark of 133.5 set by China's Shang Shichun in May. Her total of
245 erased Tang's 242.5, set in April.
	   She finished well ahead of silver medalist Win Win Maw of
Myanmar, who lifted a total of 227.5.
	   Next the 23-year-old Sun planned to phone her boyfriend in
Beijing to ask if he likes the sweater she knitted and sent him
before coming to Bangkok.
	   ``I was confident that I would win gold and make world records.
So it is not surprising,'' she said through an interpreter.
	   In the pool, Japan won two races and clung to a 12-11 lead after
26 of the games' 32 swimming events. Its winners Friday were
Takashi Yamamoto in the men's 200-meter butterfly and the women's
4x100 medley relay team.
	   China closed the gap when Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan repeated their
world championship 1-2 finish in the women's 200-meter medley,
Jiang Chengji became the fourth fastest swimmer in the world this
year in the men's 50-meter freestyle, and Chen Hua won the women's
800 freestyle by 1.21 seconds over Japan's Sachiko Yamada.
	   Malaysia's Lim beat China's Fu Yong in the 100-meter backstroke.
Lim set a games record of 55.53 and Fu, back from a two-year
suspension after a positive steroid test at the 1994 Asian Games,
took silver in 56.40.
	   While China's men lost in badminton, the women's team beat
defending champion South Korea 3-1 for gold, avenging a humiliating
5-0 defeat four years ago in a semifinal.
	   In other good news for the Chinese, their women's table tennis
team _ all players competing in their first Asian Games _ downed
North Korea 3-1 for gold without the help of veteran star Deng
Yaping, who has stopped table tennis for academic studies.
	   In shooting, China won the individual and team events of men's
50-meter free rifle competition, and the individual title of men's
standard pistol shooting. But North Korea won the pistol gold.
	   South Korea's fencing winner was Ko Jung-sun, who beat China's
Shen Weiwei.

Six arrested; ancient figurines, coins confiscated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities arrested six people and seized
bronze figurines and hundreds of ancient coins in three separate
cases of suspected antiquities smuggling, police announced Friday.
	   Experts from the Athens National Archaeological Museum said the
confiscated items are ``rare ancient objects of inestimable
archaeological and commercial value,'' a police announcement said.
	   All the arrests occurred Tuesday, but were not immediately made
public.
	   In one case, police seized 340 ancient bronze coins, 34 silver
coins and another 23 objects, most small bronze figurines dating
from between 7000 B.C. and 3000 B.C.
	   Two men were arrested in a department store 34 kilometers (21
miles) north of Athens when they attempted to sell the objects to
an undercover police officer, authorities said.
	   One of the suspects, Loukas Dimitoulis, 40, had been arrested in
March in another antiquities smuggling case and was free pending
court proceedings.
	   In a similar case, two men were arrested in the southern city of
Tripoli when they attempted to sell a Mycenian gold necklace dating
from between the 16th and 12th centuries B.C. to an undercover
policeman.
	   A search of one of the men's houses revealed 31 photographs
depicting other antiquities that police believe were also intended
for sale. Authorities were searching for the objects, the
announcement said.
	   Also in Tripoli, police arrested another two men on suspicion of
attempting to sell the marble head of an ancient statue and 24
bronze coins.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders struggled Friday
to overcome differences that threaten to delay their next big
project _ expanding the EU eastward.
	   The two-day summit opened with little sign of any narrowing of
the rift between rich and poor EU members over how to pay for the
plan to bring in new members from the former Soviet Bloc and end
Europe's postwar divisions.
	   There was more unity over calls plans to forge a common defense
strategy less dependent on the United States. The 15 leaders, who
include 11 socialists, also agreed to do more to get the Union's
16.6 million unemployed back to work, although how diverged on how
best to do it.
	   Meeting amid the imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from
where Austrian emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the
leaders are sure to restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate
nations can join the Union someday.
	   The EU has already opened membership talks with the frontrunners
_ Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
_ who hope to join early next decade.
	   To applicants' chagrin, the EU won't set a timetable for
expansion. Its reluctance is over differences in the pace and
scale, and over who covers the costs of accepting poor neighbors.
	   Before the enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, over 80 percent of which goes to subsidies for
farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, over half the
number in the whole of the current EU. All the eastern European
candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _ Greece.
	   Germany and other rich EU nations want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more for the enlargement.
Other nations are also defending their corners to ensure they don't
have to pick up the tab for expansion.
	   ``We don't want to solve Europe's problem with a German check
book,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters. Schroeder said
there was ``growing understanding'' for Germany's position. But he
ran into determined Spanish opposition.
	   Spain is leading other poorer EU members who fear they will lose
out when EU funds start flowing eastward. They insist on an
increase that will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006 to
ensure a continuing flow of funds from rich to poor nations.
	   ``Spain has a solid position: This will reduce community funding
and we're against it,'' said Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato,
expressing reservations about eastward expansion without extra
cash.
	   Schroeder acknowledged agreement in Vienna was impossible, but
officials said without some progress at the summit, the Union
risked missing a March deadline for wrapping up the budget review
and be forced to delay the enlargement.
	   Complicating the issue are divergences over how many should be
allowed in. Britain, Denmark and Austria support a review that
could see Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta open formal
membership talks next year. Germany and France disagree.
	   There's more unity on defense, following Britain's decision to
back plans for cooperation so Europe can respond to crises like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo without having to rely on the United
States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Jacques Chirac planned
to explain the recent Franco-British agreement to develop defense
ties and seek support for widening the ideas on an EU level.
	   Blair and his Spanish counterpart Jose-Maria Aznar appealed for
other leaders to join them in cutting red tape on business,
overhauling welfare and simplifying hiring and firing.
	   Chirac and Schroeder presented a rival paper calling for fixed
job-creation targets that nations should strive to meet.

U.N. inspectors begin final days of current inspections

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out
searches again Friday, despite a dispute with Iraqi authorities
over entry to an office of the ruling party.
	   At least three inspection teams drove out of the U.N.
headquarters on Baghdad's outskirts in white, four-wheel drive
vehicles adorned with the U.N. logo.
	   Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said there were fewer
inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim Sabbath. But, she
added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of work''
and would conduct searches through the weekend.
	   This week's searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
work last month.
	   Visiting teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct
the more intrusive searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath Party, to which a
team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday.
	   A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco
building, has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try
to return. The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is
private property and contains no materials wanted by the
inspectors.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. Richard
Butler, the chief weapons inspector, has said the office in the
neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials of significance.''
	   In a dispute that ended better on Thursday, U.N. inspectors
tried to search what Iraqis called a private home, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported. The Iraqis insisted, however, that the
inspectors first get permission from the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, the agency said, quoting
Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring
Directorate.
	   Eight U.N. teams checked 12 sites on Thursday, with two teams
using helicopters, Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors resumed work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus after Iraq banned them from visiting any new
suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed down on Nov. 14 and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes.
	   The United States has said the disputes over the inspections
could lead it to attack Iraqi without warning.

Two Palestinians killed in West Bank clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with two Palestinians killed in clashes
with Israeli troops; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
arrival, Israeli troops opened fire Friday on hundreds of
Palestinian stone throwers, killing two and injuring 27 during a
protest against Israel's refusal to release prisoners.
	   The violence and Israel's tough positions concerning the Wye
River peace agreement Clinton is coming to promote raised new
concerns that the presidential visit will be plagued by problems.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on the release
of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making
body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Friday's violence erupted just outside the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya. Witnesses said about 400 Palestinians threw stones at
Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets
and live ammunition to disperse the crowd.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said officials at a U.N.
clinic in Qalqiliya. Another 25 were hurt by rubber bullets and two
were wounded by live fire, clinic officials said.
	   The Palestinian protesters had gathered after Friday noon
prayers to press for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a key
point of contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israel has pledged to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three
stages by the end of January. The Palestinians have said Israel
broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli
activities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused
the Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   The other point of contention is Monday's meeting of the
Palestine National Council in Gaza City. Clinton is to address the
PNC which, under the Wye agreement, is to reaffirm earlier
decisions by lesser bodies to revoke PLO charter clauses.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote as Israel has demanded.
	   With its insistence on a vote, Israel may be setting itself up
for a showdown with Clinton. Under the Wye agreement, the annulment
of the offending provisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an
Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has
not completed its task because that would mean his high-profile
visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected a vote from
the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that
nullification has taken place,'' he said.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clauses calling
for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in
favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   The PLO charter was drawn up three decades ago, long before
Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps to revoke
the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996.
	   However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed the job.
During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a compromise
to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to Gaza to
hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.

French soccer chiefs suspend Charbonnier for two games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier was suspended
for two international matches on Friday for walking out of the
team's training camp before a recent match against Russia.
	   Before the match in Moscow, Charbonnier was angered that French
coach Roger Lemerre called experienced goalkeeper Bernard Lama into
the squad after first-choice goalkeeper Fabien Barthez sustained an
injury.
	   Charbonnier who plays in Scotland for Glasgow Rangers, had
initially been selected as deputy to Barthez for the match in
Moscow.
	   The former Auxerre goalkeeper was third choice goalkeeper in the
French World Cup squad, but never played a match during the
competition.
	   His near term chances of playing again for France continue to
look grim, because Lemerre prefers to bring in Lama when Barthez in
unavailable.

Meissnitzer triumphs in giant slalom for second straight win
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ After dominating the women's speed
skiers, Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer overwhelmed the World Cup's
technical field Friday, taking the giant slalom to collect her
fourth win of the week.
	   Just 24 hours after winning the super-G by a wide margin, the
25-year-old Austrian proved her superiority over the circuit's
strongest giant slalom skiers, including Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni and reigning World Cup champion Martina Ertl.
	   Flying down the foggy, bumpy Piste-G course in a two-run
combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, Meissnitzer built up a
massive .82 lead ahead of runner-up Compagnoni down the opening run
in 1:08.53. Meissnitzer's second-fastest time of 1:08.81 in the
final leg was enough to secure her fourth win of the season, her
second in giant slalom.
	   ``I knew I had to risk everything,'' said Meissnitzer. ``I only
had a .20 lead after the first run so I couldn't be too tactical
about it. I just went for it and it worked.''
	   Meissnitzer, who also won a pair of super-G races, has
reinforced her lead atop the overall World Cup standings where she
sits with 625 points.
	   Winner of four out of nine women's races so far this season,
Meissnitzer's results have only served to fuel her ever growing
confidence.
	   ``When I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,''
said Meissnitzer, who also doubled in Park City last month, winning
a super-G and a giant slalom. ``My confidence is thriving. I have
no doubts in my head.''
	   ``There's only one way to go when I'm in this state and that's
by taking all the risks,'' Meissnitzer added. ``I can't explain it.
I'm just on a roll.''
	   Compagnoni, who won four World Cup giant slalom races last year
as well as the Olympic gold, has yet to win a race this season.
	   The 28-year-old Italian finished third in the season-opening
giant slalom in Soelden, Austria, her best result so far this year.
	   ``I'm happy with my result as I was aiming for top five,'' said
Compagnoni, who had a troubled pre-season training program due to
serious back problems. ``To be second behind Alexandra is a good
result.''
	   ``But she is not unbeatable,'' insisted Compagnoni. ``I know I
can improve a lot. Right now I'm not in my best shape and I know I
can do better as the next races will be more technical.''
	   In a successful comeback from injury, Austria's 31-year-old
former World Cup overall champion Anita Wachter finished third.
	   Wachter, whose career appeared to be over after a crash in
Cortina, Italy last season left her with severe knee injuries,
crossed in an aggregate time of 2:18.31.
	   ``My last podium finish was a year and a half ago so this result
makes me very happy,'' said Wachter. ``It was especially satisfying
as these kind of difficult weather conditions where the visability
is low make me a little scared.''
	   Norway's Andrine Flemmen, who won the season-opener in Austria,
finished fourth in 2:18.59, ahead of France's Leila Piccard.
	   Seventeenth after the first leg, Piccard delighted the home
crowd at the foot of the course as she posted the fastest
final-run. Blistering down in 1:08.48 for a total time of 2:18.62,
Piccard held the lead until Flemmen beat her chrono.
	   In her first season on the World Cup circuit, the 16-year-old
Croatian sensation Janica Kostelic finished a respectable sixth,
crossing in 2:18.73, a mere .01 ahead of Switzerland's Corinne
Rey-Bellet.
	   Second after the opening leg, Liechtenstein's Birgit Heeb
squandered her chance for a first World Cup win, a cautious second
run leaving her tied for eighth with Sweden's Anna Ottosson in
2:19.26.
	   A costly mistake mid-way down the course threw reigning World
Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl off course.
	   Despite her fall, Ertl remains second in the chase for the
overall title _ her goal this season _ with 383 points, followed by
Austria's Renate Goetschl, third with 344.

EU leaders endorse euro representation plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders agreed Friday on
who should speak on the world stage for the 11-nation ``euro-zone''
economic bloc to be formed on Jan. 1 by the launch of the EU common
currency.
	   The EU summit endorsed a compromise by finance ministers that
resolved months of deadlock between big and small euro-zone nations
over representation at the G-7 group of world economic powers and
other international bodies.
	   European Union Commission President Jacques Santer Friday said
he will present the proposal to U.S. President Bill Clinton when
they meet in Washington next week.
	   ``It was essential to resolve this question,'' Santer said,
adding the euro-zone could now speak with once voice
internationally.
	   Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he did not expect any
problems from the United States or the other non-European G-7
nations Japan and Canada, although the plan will give Europeans
extra seats at G-7 finance meetings.
	   Under the compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 members
- Germany, France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns
to represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside
them at G-7 meetings, when they hold the rotating euro-zone
presidency.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niniisto, for second half of the
year.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the new European Central Bank, will
get a G-7 seat.
	   The launch of the euro is meant to create a single bloc that
will rival the United States and Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world economic situation, nobody was sure whom to call
when they want to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The EU hopes the rotating system of euro-zone presidencies will
go some way to meeting that need.
	   Britain, a member of the EU and the G-7, has decided not to swap
the pound for the euro, but Prime Minister Tony Blair backed the
euro-zone representation plan.

Foreign ministers discuss Cambodian admission

 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodia's prospects for joining ASEAN in
time for next week's summit all but vanished Friday as foreign
ministers said no immediate consensus was likely on the issue.
	   ``The timing is not opportune, and we should not be rushed to
meet an artificial deadline because the summit is taking place,''
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said as foreign
ministers held a working dinner that dragged on for more than three
hours.
	   ``The goal for Cambodia now is an effective government, a
working government, and we don't want to stall or unravel that
process with instant recognition. After sounding out the various
views, there is no consensus about Cambodia's admission,'' he said.
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in 1997, but political turmoil led to its application
being put on hold until a stable government was in place.
	   An agreement between two major factions was reached late last
month, and the country was given back its seat at the United
Nations this week. But some ASEAN members, notably Singapore, said
it is too soon to admit the long-troubled country.
	   Kobsak tried to reassure Cambodia that it will be admitted and
said a special foreign ministers' meeting could be held in the
coming months to deal with the issue.
	   ``It's simply a question of timing,'' he said.
	   Summit host Vietnam has been pressuring fellow ASEAN members to
admit Cambodia in time for the summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, a longtime Vietnam ally, will
make a state visit Sunday and Monday in hopes that he can stay for
the summit.
	   Kobsak and Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon tried to
steer attention back to the summit's stated goal: how to foster
financial recovery in the region.
	   Kobsak said the key issues were ASEAN unity at a time of crisis,
immediate short-term measures to deal with the crisis and its
social impact and encouragement of equitable development to prevent
ASEAN from becoming a two-tiered group of less and more developed
countries.
	   ``This summit is about the economic crisis in Asia, not
Cambodia,'' Siazon said.
	   ASEAN economic ministers, at a separate dinner, were discussing
how to fast-track previous agreements on an ASEAN Free Trade Area
and an ASEAN Investment Area.
	   ``We hope to have our leaders come up with bold measures that
will bring in capital from the West, Japan and the United States,''
Philippine Trade Minister Jose Pardo said.
	   He also said ASEAN expects to see some concrete proposals from
Japan next week on how it will distribute its dlrs 30 billion aid
package for the region.

Scandal escalates over Salt Lake payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no meeting held Friday; new comments from Joklik;
edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ In an escalating scandal, Salt Lake
City organizers were summoned by Olympic leaders Friday to explain
the scholarship payments made to relatives of IOC members during
the successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) were called
to appear before the International Olympic Committee executive
board to address allegations of bribery.
	   However, SLOC president Frank Joklik left IOC headquarters
Friday afternoon without having met with the board. He said he
wasn't sure when the meeting would take place.
	   ``The IOC is really the responsible party to look into this,''
Joklik said. ``The inquiry hasn't really begun yet. When it does,
we intend to be fully cooperative.'
	   In a clear sign that the IOC views the matter as extremely
serious, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch sent the case
directly to the decision-making executive board _ the inner cabinet
of the Olympic movement.
	   Previously, the issue had been referred to the IOC juridical
commission, an advisory panel dealing with ethical and legal
issues.
	   ``This is a serious matter,'' IOC director general Francois
Carrard said. ``You have allegations which are serious, there is no
doubt. We want facts and evidence to take any action. The matter is
serious enough that the IOC executive board will take care of it.''
	   Carrard declined to speculate on what _ if any action _ could be
taken against Salt Lake or any IOC members.
	   ``We will want to know all the facts _ what, who, how,'' he
said. ``We want to be on sure ground to know what action we are
taking.''
	   The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid
committee for the 2002 games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a ``bribe.''
	   Asked about Hodler's statement, Joklik said, ``I've already
stated I do not regard what was done as a bribe. I recognize there
have been perceptions contrary to that. I regret those perceptions,
but I don't feel they are justified.''
	   Joklik said SLOC has provided the IOC with documentation on the
scholarship program but hasn't provided a list of the names of
people who received the funds.
	   Carrard said it's the most serious case of alleged ethical
misconduct investigated by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert
Helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick
eventually resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the
U.S. Olympic Committee.
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between IOC votes on the 1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' said Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the
IOC oversight panel for the 2002 games.
	   Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's
image.
	   ``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he
said.
	   Joklik sought to distance himself from the bribery allegations
by making a distinction between the actions of the bidding
committee and the current organizing committee.
	   ``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the
bid commitee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing committee
certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would
stand any investigation. The facts were in the early 1990s when the
bid committee was operating.''
	   U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky
described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image
and preparations for the games.
	   ``It doesn't do us any good at all,'' he said. ``I hope we see a
speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be a
footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter.''
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Salt Lake organizers have refused to identify the other IOC
relatives who received scholarships.

Turkish police detain 73 illegal immigrants heading for Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YALOVA, Turkey (AP) _ Police detained 73 illegal immigrants on
Friday who were heading for a cargo ship that was to take them to
for Italy and Greece, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The groups included Indians, Pakistanis, South Africans,
Gambians, Rwandans, Bangladeshis and Iranians. They were picked up
in the small coastal town of Yalova, some 100 kilometers (60 miles)
southwest of Istanbul, as they headed in two minibuses toward the
port of Foca, Anatolia said.
	   They told police they each had paid dlrs 3,000 to smugglers who
promised to get them to Italy or Greece aboard the cargo ship.
	   Turkey, a crossroads between Europe and Asia, is under pressure
from European nations to stop the flow of illegal immigrants across
its borders.

Top politician receives special protection after threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The head of Flanders' regional
government was given special police protection Friday following an
anonymous threat that his house would be blown up if the
authorities continue with the demolishing of illegally built houses
and villas.
	   Over the past two weeks, the regional authorities have moved in
with bulldozers to raze a half dozen homes that had been illegally
built in protected and farm zones. The demolition often ended years
of legal wrangling.
	   A letter, allegedly from ``a group of affected families and
symphatizers,'' warned Flemish Minister President Luc Van den
Brande that his house ``can suddenly become the target of TNT.
Beware.''
	   But Van den Brande warned he would continue to back the policy.
``It's a court decision and the overwhelming majority of the
population respects the rules. In any case, we will not be
blackmailed,'' Van den Brande said Friday.

Al Fayed returns to Diana judge to argue conspiracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed returned to see the judge in the
Princess Diana case Friday, saying he wanted to talk to him about
alleged British and American surveillance of his son, Dodi, and the
princess before their deaths.
	   Al Fayed said he'd made the request himself to see Judge Herve
Stephan.
	   Asked why he had come, Al Fayed told The Associated Press that
``The CIA and British secret services were following Dodi and
Diana.''
	   Al Fayed arrived at about 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT) to speak to the
judge. He spoke before entering the judge's office.
	   Diana, Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul were killed in a car
crash in the Alma traffic tunnel Aug. 31, 1997. Paul was drunk at
the time.
	   Stephan hopes to wrap up the case by the end of the year. Speed
and alcohol are still considered the main causes of the accident.

Malaysia wins snooker doubles gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Malaysia's Sam Chong and Ool Chin-Kay
beat Phaithoon Phonbun and Noppadon Noppachorn of Thailand 6-4 in
the gold medal playoff game at the Asian Games snooker competition
Friday.
	   Ali Shokat, who won the individual gold medal, and Saleh
Mohammad of Pakistan beat another Thai pair, James Wattana and
Chuchart Trirattanapradit, 5-1 for the bronze medal.
	   Wattana, the former world No.3 ranked player who made a tearful
exit after his first-round loss in the individual event, said he
would likely withdraw from the teams' event, starting Saturday,
because he was playing so poorly.
	   The gold medal game took well over four hours. Chong and Ooi
prevailed in a tight 10th frame. Phonbun took charge early but Ooi
answered back with 12 points to close in on Thailand's 51-25 lead.
Chong responded well and was able to pull Malaysia ahead 62-51. In
the end, an easy set up from Phonbun allowed Malaysia to finish off
Thailand and take the gold. The jubilant Malaysian contingent
huddled around the two champions.
	   ``I am very, very happy,'' said Chong.

Lucic signs with Bologna and joins two fellow Swedes in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Defender Teddy Lucic, a member of the
Swedish squad that finished third in the 1994 World Cup, has signed
a free agent contract with Bologna, the news agency TT said Friday.
	   Lucic's contract with former two-time UEFA Cup champion IFK
Goteborg expires Dec. 31. No terms of the contract were announced.
IFK Goteborg will receive no compensation.
	   Lucic will join two former IFK Goteborg stars, striker Kennet
Andersson and midfielder Klas Ingesson, on the Italian Serie A
team. They also played in the World Cup in the United States.
	   ``That's definitely a big advantage to play with them again,''
Lucic said.
	   Lucic's father is Croatian and his mother Finnish. He became a
Swedish citizen in 1991.
	   ``He called this morning and told us that he had signed a
contract,'' Goteborg's vice president Thomas Gertmo said.
	   ``We have been negotiating with him throughout the year, but we
couldn't reach an agreement.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
arrival, Israeli troops opened fire Friday on hundreds of
Palestinian stone throwers, killing two and injuring 27 during a
protest against Israel's refusal to release prisoners, hospital
officials said.
	   The violence and Israel's tough positions concerning the peace
agreement Clinton is coming to promote raised new concerns that the
presidential visit will be plagued by problems.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on the release
of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making
body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Friday's violence erupted just outside the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya. Palestinian witnesses said about 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas, rubber-coated steel
pellets and live ammunition to disperse the crowd.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said officials at a U.N.
clinic in Qalqiliya. Another 25 were hurt by rubber bullets and two
were wounded by live fire, the Palestinian clinic officials said.
	   The Palestinian protesters had gathered after noon prayers to
press for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a key point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israel has pledged to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three
stages by the end of January. The Palestinians have said Israel
broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli
activities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused
the Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   The other point of contention is Monday's meeting of the
Palestine National Council in Gaza City. Clinton is to address the
PNC which, under the Wye River peace agreement, is to reaffirm
earlier decisions by lesser bodies to revoke PLO charter clauses.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote as Israel has demanded.
	   With its insistence on a vote, Israel may be setting itself up
for a showdown with Clinton. Under the Wye agreement, the annulment
of the offending provisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an
Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has
not completed its task because that would mean his high-profile
visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley was evasive Thursday on whether the United States expected a
vote from the PNC. He said the procedures needed to be clear enough
that nullification has taken place.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clauses calling
for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in
favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   The PLO charter was drawn up three decades ago, long before
Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993.
	   The Palestinians say they took all the required steps to revoke
the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996.
	   However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed the job.
During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a compromise
to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to Gaza to
hear Clinton and Arafat speak.
	   The Wye accord says delegates should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat
letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women beat defending champion
South Korea for the Asian Games badminton team gold Friday,
avenging a humiliating defeat four years ago.
	   Indonesia won a surprisingly easy victory over China to take the
men's gold and hold on to the crown it won four years ago.
	   In the women's competition, China's world No. 3, Gong Zhichao,
secured the gold with an 11-4, 11-1 trouncing of Lee Joo-hyun in
the third match of the best-of-five team final.
	   The final score was 3-1. With the outcome already certain, the
fifth match was scrapped.
	   Chinese coach Li Yongbo said the team, expected to remain
unchanged for the 2000 Olympics, has matured and improved since
South Korea's 5-0 semifinal whitewash of China on its way to gold
at the last Asian Games in 1994.
	   ``We've gone from losing to winning,'' he said. ``Our team
members have played pretty well. What makes me happy is that
they've shown maturity.''
	   Ye Zhaoying, the 1997 singles world champion, got China off to a
solid start with a hard-earned 11-9, 13-10 victory over Korea's Kim
Ji-hyun, the world No. 8.
	   ``Now that I've won the first match, the remaining matches
should not be a problem,'' the 24-year-old world No. 1 said after
her victory. ``I played well.''
	   Kim had clawed her way back from a 5-0 deficit in the first game
to level the score, only to falter and let Ye close out the game.
After fighting her way back from 5-10 down to win the second game
and the match, a delighted Ye went over to the stands to high-five
her coaches and teammates.
	   Gu Jun and Ge Fei, the Olympic and world doubles champions,
built on Ye's victory with a closely fought 15-13, 15-11 victory
over La Kyung-min and Chung Jae-hee.
	   Gu said the team had hoped to face South Korea in the final
following their crushing loss in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Gu and
Ge also had a two-year record of no defeats to defend.
	   Gu described the win as ``completing the duty of four years
ago.''
	   Trailing 3-0, the Koreans saved some pride when Kim Shin-young
and Yim Kyung-jin beat Zhang Ning and Tang Hetian 15-11, 15-7.
	   Indonesia, which lost to Korea 4-1 in the semis, and Japan,
which was trounced 5-0 by China, shared bronze.
	   In the men's event, world No. 5 Hendrawan used quick footwork
and a vicious smash to give Indonesia a solid start with a 15-7,
15-6 victory over a lackluster Sun Jun of China, the No. 2-ranked
player in the world.
	   Hendrawan threw his arms in the air after his victory, while
Indonesian supporters banging drums and rattling maracas shouted
and sang in the stands.
	   The Indonesian team manager attributed the victory to a new
wrist movement he called a ``devil trick'' that Hendrawan developed
in the last few months.
	   ``It's very difficult to predict which way the shuttlecock will
go,'' said Agus Wirahadikusumah. ``Sun Jun was quite confused.''
	   Indonesia's Olympic gold medalists and world No. 1 pairing Ricky
Achmad-Subagdja and Rexy Ronald-Mainaky followed up with a 15-11,
15-8 win over China's Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei, the world's No. 4.
The Indonesian players scored slowly but surely and made it very
difficult for the Chinese to score.
	   Ronald-Mainaky said the Chinese ``have to have more variation''
if they are going to beat Indonesian, Danish and Malaysian players.
	   Taufik Hidayat, ranked 19th in the world, made short work of
China's Luo Yigang to seal the gold with a 15-6, 15-5 win.
	   He came off court to hugs from his coaches and rapturous cheers
from Indonesian fans. Chandra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan sweetened the
title with a 15-0, 15-11 win over Liu Yong and Yu Jinhao for a
match score of 4-0.
	   The bronze medals go to South Korea, which lost to China 3-2 in
the semis, and to Malaysia, which was downed 4-1 by Indonesia.

 &UR; Ukrainian prime minister orders probe of corruption charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko ordered a probe Friday into allegations that 10
senior government officials were involved in corruption.
	   The charges came up after the arrest in Switzerland last week of
former Ukrainian premier Pavlo Lazarenko, who was charged last
Friday with money-laundering operations.
	   Ukraine's former acting prosecutor Oleh Lytvak then said in a
broadcast interview that the main prosecutor's office has materials
on about 10 senior officials in the current Cabinet, which
allegedly show their involvement in corruption.
	   Lytvak gave no further details.
	   On Friday, Pustovoitenko said he ordered a probe into the
allegations, and that a report from the Cabinet's State Service
Department would be submitted at the next government session.
	   The department will give an account of ``who is involved in what
cases,'' he told a Cabinet meeting. He did not give any names.
	   Pustovoitenko also said he telephoned Lytvak to receive more
information about his charges, but added that Lytvak refused to do
so, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   Many foreign businesses operating in Ukraine have complained of
pervasive corruption in the former Soviet republic. Lazarenko, who
served as premier in 1996-97 and is now a centrist opposition
legislator, is the highest-ranking former or acting official
suspected of corruption.

Plane with 146 aboard crashes in southern Thailand

on manifest, comments of transport minister whose sister was on
plane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai airliner with 146 persons aboard
crashed near an airport in heavy rain Friday night near Surat Thani
in southern Thailand, police said.
	   There was no official confirmation on how many people were
killed and how many survived, or in what condition. The television
station ITV said the survivors included the pilot, but this could
not be independently confirmed.
	   Thai television footage from the crash site, three to five
kilometers (two to three miles) from the Surat Thani airport,
showed at least eight survivors, all conscious. There were
television reports of as many as 50 survivors, but this could not
be confirmed.
	   One of those shown in footage was a boy, aged about 10, who had
wounds on his forehead. He and other shaken and injured survivors
were helped into vehicles and driven away from the crash scene.
Thai television reported that at least 20 injured passengers were
taken to hospital.
	   Rain was heavy in Surat Thani and rescuers were having
difficulty sending ambulances to the crash site, which was in a
swampy area.
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list the nationalities of
the passengers. They would not have been required to show their
passports when checking in.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban,
speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, said his sister Siriwan
had been on the flight. He had also had originally been scheduled
to fly it but canceled to attend a wedding elsewhere.
	   Suthep, who said he did not know the fate of his sister,
expressed dismay that he learned about the crash first from his
relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the airline, which is
mostly owned by the government and which he supervises.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, though another spokesman said it was a different model
Airbus.
	   Thai Airways Flight TG261 had been on its way to Surat Thani
from Bangkok, a distance of 503 kilometers (330 miles), when it
crashed in Boon Pin district at 6:45 p.m. (1145 GMT), Surat Thani
police said.
	   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land. Visibility remained bad on the final approach.
	   Initial reports said one engine had exploded, but police said it
was unclear if the plane had engine trouble before it crashed.

<SLUG> Jaguar announces recall of 4,000 cars due to fault </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 4,000 Jaguar cars will be recalled
because of a possible fault that could cause engines to over-rev,
the company announced Friday.
	   The recall involves Jaguar XJ12 and Daimler Double Six models
built between December 1992 and June 1994.
	   The felt on the underside of the car hoods of those models
possibly could sag and come into contact with the throttle linkage,
causing an over-revving of the engine, the company said. Dealers
will replace the hood lining at no charge, it said.
	   Jaguar, formerly British-owned, was bought in 1989 by the U.S.
giant Ford Motor Co., based in Dearborn, Michigan.

Roussel, Voet banned for role in Festina doping affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bruno Roussel and Willy Voet will be banned from
professional cycling for five and three years respectively for
their part in the Festina doping affair that overshadowed the Tour
de France, the French Cycling Federation said on Friday.
	   The FFC banned Roussel, Festina's former sporting director, and
ex-physiotherapist Voet after the team admitted to systematic
doping of cyclists.
	   The bans cover competition in France, but will likely be
endorsed by the International Cycling Union (UCI), federation
spokesman Christophe Lavagne told The Associated Press.
	   That means Roussel and Voet would not be able to take part in
professional cycling anywhere in the world.

Syria warns against a US strike on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria warned Friday against a
U.S.-British strike on Iraq, saying it might kill innocent people
and disturb the region.
	   The warning was delivered by Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam who spoke in Damascus hours before U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters in Washington that if Iraq does
not cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors, ``the military option
remains on the table.''
	   Speaking after talks with Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi,
Khaddam said: ``We hope that no one will be involved in a military
action against Iraq as this might cause serious damage to the Iraqi
people and have negative repercussions on the whole situation in
the region.''
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are charged with dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, were refused entry to offices of the
ruling Baath Party in Baghdad on Wednesday. Albright told a White
House briefing that the United States would reserve judgement until
the chief inspector, Richard Butler, files his report on Iraqi
cooperation next week.
	   In separate remarks to reporters, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said his government and Syria's could not ``stand idle
vis-a-vis current developments'' in Iraq.
	   He did not elaborate, but said that Iran believed in the unity
of Iraq.
	   Kharrazi spoke after a two-hour meeting with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
	   The Iranian officials arrived in Damascus on Thursday for a
three-day visit to Syria.
	   Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian
state during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

China wins three from four shooting medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's shooters continued their
brilliant form at the Asian Games by claiming three of the four
gold medals on offer Friday.
	   The squad won 12 gold medals at this year's world championships
and has 14 golds so far at the Asian games.
	   Ning Lijia broke Asian Games record in the free rifle three
positions title while compatriot Jin Yongde won the men's standard
pistol.
	   Asian champion Ning scored 1,256.9 points to better the old mark
of 1,253.2 set in 1990 by South Korean Lee Eun-Chul. Lee was
seventh. ``I shot very smoothly today,'' Ning said.
	   Kyrgyzstan's Yury Lomov pocketed the silver at 1,248 while South
Korea's Park Bong-Duk won the bronze at 1,247. The Chinese also
triumphed in the team event with a winning score of 3,453, followed
by South Korea at 3,432.
	   Host Thailand, which notched 3,419 points, edged Kyrgyzstan by
one point to win the bronze medal.
	   In the non-Olympic event of standard pistol, world championship
bronze medalist Jin beat Dilshod Mukhtarov of Uzbekistan in a
shoot-out. Jin, a policeman from northern Hebei Province, scored
135 points against Mukhtarov's 131 after both registered 574 in
their regulation 60 shots.
	   Mukhtarov won the silver medal while the bronze medal, also
decided by a shootout after three competitors scored 573, went to
Thailand's Wirat Karndee.
	   ``Before the shootout there would be no problem for me,'' said
Jin. ``I was very confident for a win.''
	   North Korea won the team gold, scoring 1,707, followed by
Kazakstan which was three points behind at the second place. China
won the bronze at 1,695.

Organization forms to fight discrimination against homosexuals in

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A new organization has formed in
Jamaica to fight the country's ``intense homophobia'' and challenge
laws that discriminate against gays and lesbians, a spokesman for
the group said Friday.
	   The goal of the Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays,
called JFLAG, is to win general public acceptance for homosexuals.
	   ``We have to deal with the mindset first,'' said the spokesman
for the group, who asked not to be identified because of fear of
discrimination.
	   Eventually, the organization hopes to challenge discriminatory
laws and police actions against gays, which are common, said the
spokesman.
	   ``For example they (police) will find two gay men on a beach
miles away from anyone holding hands, looking up at the moon, and
charge them with immoral behavior, indecent exposure or some such
nonsense, which cannot be proven in court,'' he said.
	   Many defendants refuse to fight the charges for fear of losing
their jobs or facing even more discrimination, he said.
	   ``In almost every aspect of life gay people come under
prejudice,'' said the JFLAG spokesman. ``It's not spoken of a
lot.''
	   Lawyer Lloyd Barnett, chairman of a commission appointed to
examine constitutional reform, said the Jamaica Constitution bans
discrimination for reasons of race or gender, but not sexual
orientation. JFLAG would have to lobby legislators to change the
laws or amend the constitution, he said.

Six arrested for smuggling antiquities in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek authorities have arrested six people
and seized bronze figurines and hundreds of ancient coins in three
separate cases of suspected antiquities smuggling.
	   Experts from the Athens National Archaeological Museum said the
confiscated items are ``rare ancient objects of inestimable
archaeological and commercial value,'' police said.
	   All the arrests occurred Tuesday but were not announced until
Friday.
	   In one case, police seized 340 ancient bronze coins, 34 silver
coins and another 23 objects, most small bronze figurines dating
from between 7000 B.C. and 3000 B.C.
	   Two men were arrested in a department store 30 kilometers (20
miles) north of Athens when they attempted to sell the objects to
an undercover police officer, authorities said.
	   One of the suspects, Loukas Dimitoulis, 40, had been arrested in
March in another antiquities smuggling case and was free pending
court proceedings.
	   In a similar case, two men were arrested in the southern city of
Tripoli when they attempted to sell a Mycenaean gold necklace
dating from the 16th to 12th centuries B.C. to an undercover
policeman.
	   A search of one of the men's houses revealed 31 photographs
depicting other antiquities that police believe were also intended
for sale. Authorities are searching for the objects.
	   Also in Tripoli, police arrested two men on suspicion of
attempting to sell the marble head of an ancient statue and 24
bronze coins.

EU summit confronts rift over EU's shift to the east

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with little sign of compromise, difference on
unemployment. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders attempted Friday
to map out the next big steps on the path to greater unity.
	   The two-day summit opened with little sign of any narrowing of
the rift between rich and poor EU members over how to pay for the
plan to bring in new members from the former Soviet Bloc and end
Europe's postwar divisions.
	   There was more unity over plans to forge a common defense
strategy less dependent on the United States. The 15 leaders, who
include 11 socialists, also agreed to do more to get the EU's 16.6
million unemployed back to work, although they diverged on how best
to do it.
	   Meeting amid the imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from
where Austrian emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the
leaders were sure to restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate
nations can join the union someday.
	   The EU has already opened membership talks with the
front-runners who hope to join early in the next decade: Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
	   To the applicants' chagrin, the EU won't set a timetable for
expansion. Its reluctance is due to differences over the pace and
scale of the expansion and, crucially, over who covers the costs of
welcoming in so many poor neighbors.
	   Before the enlargement can go ahead, the EU must overhaul its
annual $100 billion budget, more than 80 percent of which is spent
on subsidies for farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, more than half
the number in the whole of the current EU. All the eastern European
candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member, Greece.
	   Germany and other rich EU nations want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more for the expansion.
	   ``We don't want to solve Europe's problem with a German
checkbook,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar promised to resist this
assault ``on the bastion of solidarity'' between rich and poor
nations within the EU. Spain is leading other poorer EU members who
fear they will lose out when EU funds start flowing eastward. They
insist on an increase that will add $24 billion to the EU budget by
2006.
	   Schroeder acknowledged that agreement in Vienna would be
impossible, but officials said that without some progress at the
summit, the union risked missing a March deadline for wrapping up
the budget review and would be forced to delay the enlargement.
	   Complicating the issue are differences over how many nations
should be allowed to join. Britain, Denmark and Austria support a
review that could see Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta open
formal membership talks next year. Germany and France disagree.
	   There's more EU unity on defense, following Britain's decision
to back plans for improved cooperation so Europe can respond to
crises like those in Bosnia and Kosovo without having to rely on
the United States.
	   As always, unemployment will feature prominently on the agenda.
Aznar and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have appealed to other
leaders to join them in cutting red tape on business, overhauling
welfare systems and making it easier for European companies to hire
and fire workers.
	   ``Reform is essential if Europe is to maximize the positive
employment effects of growth,'' Blair and Aznar wrote.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders hacked their way
through the jungle of EU budget reform Friday, but made no real
headway at their year-end summit in readying the Union's finances
for enlargement over the next decade.
	   Prospects were better for progress on plans for a common defense
strategy, which would permit Europeans to assume a greater role in
continental defense independent from the United States but still in
the NATO framework.
	   The heart of the talks on the first day of their two-day summit,
however, was how the 15-nation EU will finance its expansion by as
many as a dozen new countries over the next decade. Rich countries
like Germany and Britain already feel they are paying too much into
EU coffers.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country is still
paying the costs of absorbing East Germany, made it clear that
Europe's enlargement problems are not going to be solved with a
German checkbook.
	   ``There ... is a growing understanding that fairness in payments
also has something to do with strengthening European integration,''
Schroeder said in a television interview.
	   The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries -
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
Preliminary talks are also underway with Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and possibly Malta, but they are
considered far from ready.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget already goes
to farm subsidies. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries along with their millions of uneconomical farmers in the
next five or six years would break the budget unless serious
reforms are undertaken.
	   ``There must be compensation for farmers, but they can't be
compensated forever,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman for
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``We'll be focusing on very much
on stabilization of spending.''
	   Germany and the other rich countries want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more. Poorer EU
countries, for their part, don't want to see their subsidies cut in
favor of even poorer new members.
	   ``There is no new money here,'' said German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer. ``The same goes for the budget question. It's not
a matter of finding more money but doing more with the money you
have.''
	   Spain is leading a group of poorer EU members who want to see
the budget expanded. That group is insisting on an increase that
will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the EU for six
months, starting Jan. 1. Leaders hope to have the entire budget
question resolved under the German presidency.
	   Less contentious are plans for a common defense strategy,
launched by France and Britain earlier this month at a mini-summit
in St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The two countries, Western
Europe's only nuclear powers, issued a statement saying the EU
should have the ability to act independently with a ``credible
military force.''
	   Any such military action would come within the framework of
NATO, the French and British leaders insisted, but would allow
Europeans to launch military action without waiting for the United
States to take the lead.
	   The United States says it favors any European action that will
strengthen security on the continent.

Convalescing Yeltsin makes another appearance at Kremlin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Yeltsin speaking to Primakov,
leaving Kremlin, scheduled to meet Swiss, Belorussian presidents
next week, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured out of
convalescence into his Kremlin office today to meet with top aides,
and then retreated again to a country residence, his spokesman
said.
	   It was the first time Yeltsin had gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he left his hospital bed to make a surprise appearance
at his office and fire his chief of staff along with several other
aides.
	   Yeltsin, who has been only a part-time president for weeks, has
been convalescing at a country residence 60 miles north of Moscow
since his release from the hospital on Wednesday after two weeks of
treatment for pneumonia.
	   During his several hours in the Kremlin today, the president met
with the successors of the aides who were axed on Monday, including
new chief of staff Nikolai Bordyuzha, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said at a news conference.
	   Yeltsin spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
to discuss the next year's budget.
	   The Russian leader has handed Primakov nearly full
responsibility for salvaging the country's collapsing economy and
the budget was drawn up almost completely in his absence.
	   Yeltsin also recorded a radio address to the nation due to air
Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of Russia's constitution,
and signed a decree awarding a medal to writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn _ a former Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate who
turned 80 today.
	   The president ``had a very active day today, which demonstrates
properly the state of his health,'' said spokesman Yakushkin.
	   After his trip to the Kremlin, Yeltsin went to his Gorky-9
residence just west of the capital, Yakushkin said.
	   Yakushkin refused to speculate on how long Yeltsin's
recuperation would last, saying only it would take ``as long as
necessary.''
	   ``The president needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and
doctors believe this can be done at a country residence, with
periodic examinations at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' he said.
	   Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and
Belorussian presidents, Yakushkin said. But according to Polish
officials, Yeltsin postponed a trip to Warsaw scheduled for this
week.
	   Yeltsin insists he is still fit to lead the country, but has
spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of
various illnesses.

Premier: Ukrainian government will insist on realistic budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The government will insist on a realistic
1999 budget and raise the deficit projection to 1 percent despite
objections from parliament, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
said Friday.
	   ``The government's future fate depends on the budget being
realistic,'' Pustovoitenko told a Cabinet session.
	   The Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, on Thursday ignored the
government's arguments and approved the first reading of a budget
that raised projected revenues by nearly 50 percent and has a zero
deficit.
	   Cabinet ministers sharply opposed such a version of the draft,
and President Leonid Kuchma on Thursday called it ``populist and
destructive.''
	   The draft now goes back to the government, which must submit it
for the second reading by Dec. 22, when legislators are to vote on
each individual figure in the document.
	   That still gives the government a chance to defend its own
projections. Pustovoitenko, in particular, said the Cabinet would
raise the planned deficit to 1 percent to provide for more social
spending _ which could signal an even tougher battle in parliament.
	   The version approved by parliament cannot be fulfilled,
Pustovoitenko said, calling on his ministers to ``carefully balance
all the calculations,'' according to the UNIAN news agency.

Sides hold secret five-hour meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Top negotiators for club owners and the players
union held a secret five-hour meeting to try to end the 5
1-2-month-old lockout that threatens to cancel the entire American
National Basketball Association season.
	   ``We agreed not to discuss any of the details, and I don't want
to break that pledge,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
Friday.
	   A spokesman for the union said he had no knowledge of the
details of Thursday's session, which was the first secret meeting
since Oct. 28.
	   There have been no bargaining sessions involving the clubs
owners' and players' full negotiating committees in eight days, but
it's likely there will be another one next week.
	   The participants in Thursday's secret meeting were commissioner
David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik, union director Billy
Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing and attorneys for both sides.
They discussed details of some of the specific proposals that each
side has put forth.
	   Asked if the sides plan to meet again soon, Granik would only
say: ``I hope we will.''
	   Meanwhile, organizers of an exhibition game in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, involving the locked out players changed their previous
position said they'll donate all proceeds to charity.
	   ``Because of the cancellation of the NBA All-Star game, the
players want to do this for the fans in Philadelphia and the
world,'' said Curtis Polk, president of Falk Associates Management
Enterprises.
	   Atlantic City is about an hour's drive southeast of
Philadelphia.
	   Any profits from the exhibition game will be donated to UNICEF
and other charities. But that's assuming there are profits to give
away.
	   Ticket sales have been delayed twice, casinos have been slow to
support it and experts say the hurried scheduling of the Dec. 19
event _ which was announced Monday _ could spell trouble.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is money. The owners
have insisted on maximum salary costs and the union has refused to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.

Supreme Courts halts trial of 2 priests, 25 civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Supreme Court has suspended the
military trial of two Christian priests and 25 civilians until it
is determined whether a bomb plot case against them is
constitutional.
	   Deputy chief justice Mohammed Mahmoud Abu-Cisaisa, who deals
with constitutional cases, ruled the trial should be temporarily
halted until the attorney general responds to the defense
objection, the official Sudan News Agency reported Friday.
	   The court was acting on a plea by defense lawyer Abel Alier, a
former vice-president of Sudan, that since his clients were
civilians, their trial in a military court was unconstitutional.
	   The main accused, Roman Catholic priests Rev. Hilary Boma and
Rev. Lino Sebit, are accused of planning and carrying out several
bombings in Khartoum June 30. The attacks did not claim any lives.
	   Judge Abu-Cisaisa accepted the defense argument that since the
military court's verdict cannot be appealed or overturned, the
trial should stop _ pending the attorney general's report, due on
Dec. 28.
	   Defendants convicted by military courts can only appeal to the
president for clemency.
	   The accused, who are mostly Christians from the south, were
arrested in August and went on trial Oct. 6 at the Sudanese air
force headquarters.
	   Christians in Sudan have often complained that they suffer
discrimination. Rebels in the predominantly Christian and animist
south have been fighting for autonomy for the last 15 years against
the Muslim and Arab-dominated north. Some 1.5 million people have
been killed in the fighting and resulting famines.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Rival political factions clashed in
eastern India while workers staged a nationwide strike to protest
the government's plan to further open the economy to foreign
investment. At least two people were killed.
	   At least four people also were injured in the clash between
members of the Communist party of India Marxist and the Trinamul
Congress, a member of the ruling coalition, police said in
Calcutta, capital of the eastern state.
	   The violence in West Bengal state broke out in Bhaktinagar
village, as angry workers in other parts of the country staged
protests as part of a one-day general strike called by leftist
political parties.
	   Protesters in New Delhi marched to the parliament building,
where leftist politicians held an hour-long morning sit-in. Later,
business in both houses was interrupted by shouts from members
whose demands to discuss the strike were refused.
	   Politicians also clashed in parliament Friday over plans to set
aside a third of parliamentary seats for women, making it uncertain
the bill will ever come to a vote.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government,
but has never come to a vote. Women accuse male politicians of
being unwilling to surrender any power in a country where religious
practice and tradition often keep women in the shadows.
	   Though the strike appeared only partially observed Friday in the
capital, where shops and offices were open and traffic relatively
normal, local news agencies reported most shops, banks, offices and
the commuter railroad were shut down in the eastern city of
Calcutta.
	   The state-owned airline canceled service for the day in and out
of Calcutta, the state capital of West Bengal, which is controlled
by Communists. The city's stock market and major commodities
markets were closed.
	   In Bombay, India's financial hub, the Reserve Bank of India said
business was normal.
	   ``There are two unions in the RBI, one for the officers and
another for the clerical staff and neither have joined the
strike,'' central bank spokesperson Alpana Killawala told Dow Jones
News Wires from Bombay, India's financial hub.
	   Factories, shops and government offices were closed across the
southwestern state of Kerala and the northeastern state of Tripura,
news agencies added, saying protests were peaceful across the
country.
	   The strike was sparked by a bill opening up the Indian insurance
sector. The bill is expected to be presented to parliament for
debate next week and is expected to pass. Both the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party and the main opposition Congress party support the
bill allowing up to 40 percent foreign investment in Indian
insurance companies.
	   Leftists, whose influence has waned in recent years, argue
working people will be hurt because foreigners will destroy
indigenous businesses, while reformers say the Indian economy will
be strengthened by new ideas and entrepreneurs.

Contact Group presses for peace talks, says time running out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Saying the clock is ticking, the Contact Group of
nations concerned with the Balkans urgently called for talks
between Serbs and ethnic Albanian Kosovo leaders to avoid a new
outbreak of fighting, according to a statement released Friday.
	   ``It is imperative and urgent that the parties comply with the
obligations imposed on them'' by U.N. resolutions that call for
peace talks, the French Foreign Ministry said a day after a Contact
Group meeting in Paris.
	   The Contact Group ``met in its determination to bring about
negotiations without delay, and to act in that direction. Time is
running out,'' the statement said.
	   The meeting of the group's political experts called on both
sides to ``assume their responsibilities by quickly reaching a
political accord, which alone can guarantee peace and stability in
the region.''
	   Proposals by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill ``contain the essential
elements of substantial autonomy for Kosovo,'' the statement said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   International officials worry a shaky truce could give way to
new fighting if a peaceful settlement is not reached soon.

Generosity backfire for Good Samaritan with bad conscience
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ An anonymous Norwegian mailed 193,000 kroner
(dlrs 25,730) in old bills to his town treasurer last month, with a
note asking that the donation be used to care for the elderly.
	   Unfortunately for the man, police thought he was being generous
to a fault, tracked him down and arrested him, news reports said
Friday.
	   It turned out that the Good Samaritan, from southern Norway's
Songdalen area, was a taxpayer with a bad conscience. Over the
years, he had routinely accepted under the table payments for his
services, without paying tax.
	   According to the reports, the man, whose name was not published,
decided to clear the slate by giving the town the amount he figure
he owed in taxes.
	   Now, he faces possible legal fees, fines, interest and back
taxes, possibly needing a donation himself.

Researchers say Dutch sea captain discovered the icy continent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ It's an ice place, but you
wouldn't want to live there.
	   A Dutch sea captain's ominous descriptions of a gigantic icy
land mass four centuries ago have some scholars convinced that he's
the man who really discovered Antarctica, 221 years before the
Russian and the Englishman credited with the discovery.
	   Notes penned in 1622 by the Amsterdam merchant who bankrolled
the voyage mention how Dirck Gerritsz described seeing the land
mass in 1599, a year after he sailed from Rotterdam, Dr. Wim
Ligtendag of Groningen University's Arctic Center said Friday.
	   The merchant, Issac Le Maire, wrote how Gerritsz's weatherbeaten
ship, The Flying Heart, had been driven far south of Cape Horn by a
strong north wind that had blown for weeks.
	   ``At 64 degrees south of the Strait of Magellan, he saw a
mountainous land, like Norway, entirely white with snow and so
extensive that it seemed as if it stretched as far as the Solomon
Islands,'' Le Maire wrote.
	   If true, it means that Antarctica wasn't discovered by Edward
Bransfield, an Englishman, and Thaddeus von Bellingshausen, a
Russian admiral, who share the credit for making the continental
discovery two centuries later in 1820. An American seal hunter,
Nathaniel Palmer, also claimed a sighting that year.
	   In the past, Le Maire's account was brushed aside as hearsay by
historians who didn't find it convincing enough. Ligtendag said his
research has established that Le Maire and Gerritsz were probably
in close personal contact, adding weight to the writings.
	   The Flying Heart, also called The Glad Tidings in some
documents, was one of six ships Le Maire commissioned in 1598 to
search for a sea route to India. Gerritsz probably was hired as one
of the captains because of his previous expeditions for the
Portuguese in India from 1568 to 1590.
	   Though Britons joke about discovering Antarctica as a source for
ice for their gin-and-tonics, experts don't think much of the
notion that a Dutchman may have beaten them to the punch.
	   ``One can't completely dismiss it, but one puts it on the
`extremely unlikely' list,'' said Robert Headland, archivist and
curator of the University of Cambridge's Scott Polar Research
Institute.
	   ``There's nothing to corroborate it,'' he said Friday. ``I'm
inclined to dismiss it as another one of those South Pole rumors.''
	   The Dutch study, commissioned by the Netherlands Organization
for Scientific Research, will be published in ``The Discovery of
the Far South: The History of Antarctica as Revealed by Old Maps
and Charts,'' a new book by Ligtendag.
	   That a Dutchman could have discovered Antarctica isn't out of
the question, considering that the Netherlands was a world power in
the 16th and 17th centuries and the Dutch East India Company
dominated ocean trade.
	   It was a Dutchman, explorer Abel Tasman, who discovered New
Zealand in 1642 and named it after his home province of Zeeland.
	   Gerritsz and six of his crew were captured by the Spanish not
long after their sighting and were held as prisoners for several
years, making no mention of their discovery to the Spaniards who
considered them ``dangerous and exceptionally intelligent,''
Ligtendag said.
	   After the Spanish released Gerritsz in 1604, he became a
merchant in the Dutch town of Enkhuizen, next door to Hoorn where
Le Maire was based. Merchants in the neighboring towns were
well-acquainted with one another and frequently collaborated on
expeditions, Ligtendag said.

Minor earthquake rattles southern Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A minor earthquake shook southern
Bulgaria Friday, but there were no reports of injuries or damage,
the civil defence reported.
	   The tremor, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3, occurred at
17:10 (15:10 GMT) some 170 kilometers (106 miles) southeast of
Sofia, the agency said. The quake was felt as far away as the
northern Greek port city of Salonica, media there reported.
	   Scores of small earthquakes occur every year in Bulgaria, but
usually cause no damage.

Dutch colonel recounts fall of Srebrenica in new book
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch officer vilified worldwide
after his troops stood by helplessly as rebel Serbs overran the
U.N. safe area of Srebrenica in 1995 has published a book about the
fall of the enclave.
	   Col. Thom Karremans' book, titled ``Srebrenica, Who Cares?,''
includes diary snippets and other documents relating to events
surrounding one of the worst military debacles of the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict, his Dutch publishers announced Friday.
	   Thousands of Muslims were massacred by Serb forces following the
fall of Srebrenica. Karremans and his troops serving as United
Nations peacekeepers in the eastern Bosnian region have been blamed
for not doing anything to prevent the slaughter.
	   ``Karremans has broken his silence to let the public share in
his truth, his dilemmas and his experiences,'' the Arko publishing
house said in a press release. The book goes on sale Saturday.
	   Apart from testifying at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The
Hague in 1996, Karremans has until now said nothing publicly about
the enclave's fall.
	   His book repeats the claims of many of the 400 Dutch troops
under his command in Srebrenica who insisted they were outmanned
and outgunned by the Serbs and were not given enough support by
their U.N. superiors to hold the region.
	   A month before the fall, ``it was clear to me that as a
battalion we could do nothing more,'' Karremans said in an
interview published in Friday's edition of the Dutch newspaper NRC
Handelsblad.
	   ``That's when your raise the alarm. I wrote a five-page report
to the upper echelons: `Help! Someone must do something,''' he
said.
	   Karremans says he repeatedly asked for airstrikes to repel the
Serbs but was denied them.
	   The gray-haired officer with the drooping mustache became
world-famous when he was pictured glass in hand with Bosnian Serb
Army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic after Mladic's men had taken
control of Srebrenica.
	   Karremans denies he drank a toast and says the wine glass he was
holding contained water.
	   Mladic, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Gen.
Radislav Krstic have been indicted by U.N. prosecutors for
masterminding the Srebrenica killings. Only Krstic, arrested
recently by U.S. forces, is in custody.

Dolphins have big game before the big game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Forget about looking ahead to next week's
potentially historic meeting with Denver. If the Miami Dolphins do
that, they just might have to kiss first place goodbye.
	   Maybe the playoffs, too.
	   The Dolphins, whose 1972 edition was the only undefeated team in
modern American National Football League history, would like to
stop Denver from equaling that feat. The Broncos are 13-0 and
heavily favored to win at the New York Giants on Sunday.
	   But before Miami can think about spoiling Denver's perfect
record, the Dolphins must deal with the New York Jets. The Dolphins
and Jets sit atop the AFC East Division at 9-4, and the Jets have
the edge in several tiebreakers over their hosts for Sunday night's
game.
	   Just a game behind are Buffalo, which is at home against
Oakland, and New England, which visits St. Louis.
	   Ask the Dolphins how much attention they are paying to the
pending Monday night matchup with the Broncos, and you get silence.
But ask them about the Jets ...
	   ``They beat up on us up there, and it hurt,'' said Dolphins star
middle linebacker Zach Thomas, referring to a 20-9 loss at the
Meadowlands in October. ``Everybody's going to have a grudge when
you get beat like that.''
	   The Dolphins are annoyed about what they perceive as derogatory
remarks from several Jets, particularly wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson and cornerback Otis Smith.
	   ``They're already talking about the road to the playoffs all the
way to Denver, and having home-field advantage,'' Thomas said.
``That's overlooking us.''
	   Johnson and cornerback Terrell Buckley engaged in several verbal
bouts in the previous game.
	   ``Every time I get ready to play against a corner, they want to
start to talk and hype things up to get attention,'' said Johnson,
who is as hot as any receiver in the league. ``I'm not into that.
I'm not into trying to hype them up to piggyback on me.''
	   The Dolphins have the stingiest defense in the league, having
allowed just 185 points. The way the Jets offense has been
performing _ its 347 points rank third in the AFC, one behind
Jacksonville _ overshadows the fact it is second in points yielded
with 230.
	   Still, the outcome figures to depend on how well Vinny
Testaverde throws and Curtis Martin runs against Miami, which is
6-0 at home.
	   ``They have a very formidable defense,'' Testaverde said. ``They
don't give up much at home.''
	   Also Sunday, the Jaguars would clinch the AFC Central by beating
Tennessee in Jacksonville, and Dallas would take the NFC East by
winning at Kansas City. Green Bay would reach the playoffs with a
victory at home against Chicago.
	   Also, it's Arizona at Philadelphia, Atlanta at New Orleans,
Cincinnati at Indianapolis, Pittsburgh at Tampa Bay, Washington at
Carolina, San Diego at Seattle and Minnesota at Baltimore.
	   On Monday night, it's Detroit at San Francisco.
	   The Broncos could be caught looking beyond the underachieving
Giants (5-8). But even a mediocre performance by Denver might be
good enough Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we'll win and embarrass them,'' Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan said. ``You never know.''

Germany says hostages in Yemen are in good health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Four Germans being held hostage by
tribesmen in Yemen are in good health and being treated well, the
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   Three German women and one man were kidnapped Monday by three
gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe in Marib province, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital San'a.
	   German Ambassador Helga Strachwitz talked to one of the female
hostages by telephone and was told that all the captives were
healthy, supplied with food and being treated well, ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   He said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has sent a note to his
Yemeni counterpart, Abdulkader Ba-Jammal, urging Yemen to continue
efforts to negotiate freedom for the hostages and not to use force.
	   Yemeni security officials say the tribe abducted the Germans to
force the government to pay them for the land on which it built a
dam.

Russian man charged with anti-Semitic slurs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian man has been charged with making an
anti-Semitic speech in front of a burning synagogue after a bomb
explosion at the temple last spring, officials said Friday.
	   The May 13 blast at the Maryina Roshcha Orthodox synagogue in
Moscow took place shortly after 70 children and their teachers left
a holiday celebration. The explosion also shattered windows and
cause a wall to partially collapse.
	   Russian television later aired footage in which a masked man
read a speech full of anti-Semitic slurs as he stood near the
burning synagogue, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Investigators have identified the man and charged him with
incitement of ethnic, racial or religious strife, ITAR-Tass
reported, citing the Moscow prosecutor's office. The man who
videotaped the speech was also investigated but was apparently not
charged.
	   The man who made the speech is a Moscow resident, prosecutors
said, but no other details were released.
	   Prosecutors had also opened a terrorism investigation into the
explosion, but no progress has been reported. Nobody claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   The collapse of the Soviet Union eliminated tacit discrimination
against Jews, but anti-Semitism has been growing increasingly
virulent in Russia in recent years. Russia's Communist Party caused
an uproar this fall when it refused to condemn anti-Semitic slurs
by a Communist lawmaker.

Plane with 146 aboard crashes in southern Thailand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Westerners among survivors, legislator reported
dead, musician in hospital.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai airliner with 146 people aboard
crashed Friday in heavy rain near an airport in southern Thailand,
killing at least 14 people, among them two Westerners, officials
said.
	   A large number of people appeared to have survived. Thai
television said there were about 50 survivors, including the pilot,
but this could not be independently confirmed.
	   Police said people were still being pulled from the wreckage in
the swampy, rain-battered area where Thai Airways Flight TG261
crashed about five kilometers (three miles) from the Surat Thani
airport about 6:45 p.m. local time (1145 GMT).
	   Television footage from the crash site showed at least eight
survivors, all conscious. One was a boy, aged about 10, who had
wounds on his forehead.
	   At least four were rain-soaked, bloodied Westerners, apparently
two couples, being led to a pickup truck and driven from the crash
scene. Thai television reported that at least 20 injured passengers
were taken to hospital.
	   One survivor, popular musician Reungsak Loychusak, said in a
phone interview with a television station from his hospital bed:
``My whole left side is in pain, I can barely more.''
	   Rain was heavy in Surat Thani, 503 kilometers (330 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, and rescuers were having difficulty sending
ambulances to the crash site.
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list nationalities.
Passengers would not have been required to show their passports
when checking in.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban,
speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, said his sister Siriwan
had been on the flight. He had also had originally been scheduled
to fly it but canceled to attend a wedding elsewhere.
	   Suthep, who said he did not know the fate of his sister,
expressed dismay that he learned about the crash first from his
relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the airline, which is
mostly owned by the government and which he supervises.
	   Suthep boarded a subsequent flight to Surat Thani to supervise
the rescue, but it and about 100 reporters on board were diverted
by the bad weather to the resort island of Phuket, a three-hour
overland bus journey from Surat Thani.
	   Suthep was unable to confirm television reports that his sister
had died. Television also reported that Thawat Wichaidig, 58, a
member of parliament from Surat Thani, died in the crash.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats. It crashed in Boon Pin district at 6:45 p.m. (1145 GMT),
Surat Thani police said.
	   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land. Visibility remained bad on the final approach.
	   Initial reports said one engine had exploded, but police said it
was unclear if the plane had engine trouble before it crashed.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would pay financial indemnity to the
families of anyone who was dead or injured.

Italian Christmas cake withdrawn from shelves after poison found

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two Italian Christmas cakes sent to a news agency
with a warning from an animal rights group were tainted found
enough rat poison to make consumers seriously sick, officials said
Friday.
	   Two popular brands of ``panettone'' were being withdrawn from
stores throughout the country after an animal rights group said it
had injected them with rat poison.
	   The Italian distributor of Nestle products ordered the
approximately 1,000 stores that carry its brands ``Motta'' and
``Alemagna'' to stop their sale after the Italian news agency ANSA
offices in Bologna and Florence on Thursday received fruitcakes
along with notes saying the cakes had been poisoned.
	   The group Animal Liberation Front said it used syringes to
inject rat poison into the Christmas cakes, which are big sellers
in Italy in the weeks leading up to the holidays.
	   The group said they were protesting Nestle's use of genetic
engineering to develop its products, according to ANSA.
	   Prosecutors ordered the cakes sent to ANSA tested and also tests
on some of the cakes being pulled off the shelves.

South Korea edges Taiwan 5-4, stays unbeaten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Major Leaguer Park Chan-ho pitched
the last 1 2/3 innings in relief Friday, helping South Korea edge
Taiwan 5-4 in Asian Games baseball.
	   The Los Angeles Dodgers' Park came on after Taiwan had narrowed
the gap to one run in the eighth. A fielder's choice and a failed
attempt to steal ended that inning, and he allowed one two-out
single in the ninth before a force at second ended the game.
	   Taiwan (0-3) had gone ahead 3-1 in the third inning on a two-run
homer by Pan Chung-wei, but Korea (3-0) leveled the score in the
sixth on a double by Kim Dong-joo and three two-out singles, by

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Making his first public appearance since his
arrest almost two months ago on a Spanish warrant, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet said Friday that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of
any country but his native Chile to try him ``against all the lies
of Spain.''
	   Magistrate Graham Parkinson set a Jan. 18 hearing date for the
formal start of proceedings to extradite Pinochet to Spain, which
wants to try the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture committed by his security forces during his 17-year
regime.
	   Outside Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, hundreds of ``Free
Pinochet'' supporters chanted and waved Chilean flags from behind
police lines, while rival groups shouted back and waved placards
declaring ``Don't let this butcher go!''
	   Pinochet, arrested Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery,
entered the heavily guarded courtroom in a wheelchair, his hands
clasping the top of a walking stick.
	   The 83-year-old general wore a brown striped suit and spoke in a
husky voice when asked to identify himself.
	   ``I was the commander in chief of the army, the captain general
of Chile, president of the republic and, actually, I am at the
moment a senator of the republic,'' he said in Spanish, his remarks
translated by a court interpreter.
	   Later, reading from a card, also in Spanish, he said, ``With
respect to your honor, I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any
other court but in my country to try me against all the lies of
Spain.''
	   He waved his hand and added, ``That is all I want to say.''
	   Parkinson, who said Pinochet would not have to appear at the
January hearing, varied the conditions of his bail to allow him to
use the grounds of the rented mansion he moved to southwest of
London on Dec. 1 _ provided the general remains under police guard
while outside.
	   ``I certainly think it would be inhumane to stop the senator
walking in the garden as and when necessary,'' Parkinson said.
	   The hearing had been rescheduled for suburban Belmarsh, a
high-security magistrate's court once used to indict Irish
Republican Army gunmen, instead of in central London, because of
the big crush, including demonstrators, hundreds of policemen and
camera crews. Belmarsh is 10 miles (15 kms) from the city center.
	   Pinochet's appearance was the latest step in what could be years
of legal wrangling over his extradition.
	   On Tuesday and Wednesday next week, the House of Lords,
Britain's highest court, will hear a highly unusual appeal by the
general to overturn its 3-2 decision that he does not have immunity
from arrest as a former foreign head of state.
	   Pinochet's lawyers have complained that one of the law lords who
ruled against Pinochet is the unpaid director of the fundraising
arm of Amnesty International, the human rights group that has
played a key role in a long campaign to have Pinochet put on trial.
	   Amnesty International says Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann did not
take part in the campaign.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw discounted any possible bias in
Britain's highest court when he decided Wednesday to let Spain's
extradition request proceed.
	   Pinochet's lawyers may also, in a separate move, ask the a judge
to review the Lords' decision on grounds it infringes Chilean
sovereignty.
	   In Spain, Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a 300-page criminal
indictment Thursday, charging Pinochet with genocide, terrorism and
torture. Straw had ruled that Pinochet could not be indicted on a
charge of genocide, but let the other charges stand.

E. Timorese resistance reports abuses by Indonesian troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of exiled East Timorese
pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked
unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian
territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
	   The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the
pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
	   Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and
killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement
claimed.
	   Jose Pau Lelo, 38, Rosito Borges, 35, and Leao Soares, 50, were
in a coma due to injuries they sustained in the attack, according
to the statement which cited resistance sources in East Timor's
capital Dili.
	   The statement, released in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, also
said 19 men were wounded, eight seriously, and 26 others were
missing. The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were
listed.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the attack, and
Indonesian officials were was not immediately available for
comment.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in Dec. 1975, following Portugal's
colonial rule, and annexed it a month later. Indonesian troops have
since then been fighting a small band of pro-independence
guerillas.
	   Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the Socialist Party of
Timor, another pro-independence group, said he also had
corroborated the report with six sources inside East Timor and said
he had ``no reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement.
	   The United Nations, which is brokering talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regards
Portugal as the administering power in East Timor.
	   The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) southeast of Jakarta.

Government dismisses entire board of state-run airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The boardroom drama at India's state-run
international carrier and the domestic airline took a new turn
Friday as the government fired the board of the two companies and
made fresh appointments, domestic news agencies reported.
	   P.V. Jayakrishna was named the new chairman of Air India, and
Anil Baijal will be chairman and managing director of Indian
Airlines, Press Trust of India and United News of India reported.
Both are senior bureaucrats in the federal Civil Aviation ministry.
	   The announcement is seen as part of government efforts to
streamline management and plug huge losses in both airlines.
	   Friday's decision came days after the ministry announced that
the two companies would be controlled by a common holding company,
a step away from a possible merger. That decision was taken by the
board sacked Friday.
	   Air India last month asked for a 10-billion-rupee (dlrs 238
million) government bailout as well as official help in finding a
private investor to pour in another 7.7 billion rupees (dlrs 183
million). The airline's managing director, Michael Mascarenhas, had
then said this was only way out of the airline's resource crunch.
	   Mascarenhas has not been removed from his position.
	   The two companies together employ 52,000 employees, according to
the Air India Officials Union, whose officials warn a merger would
mean the end of the road for the airlines. Indian Airlines is
facing fierce competition from private airlines on domestic routes.
	   Air India's management has blamed the airline's losses,
estimated at 1.47 billion rupees (dlrs 35 million) in the quarter
ending in August, on high wage bills and other ``non-operating''
costs.
	   The federal government said in September it planned to sell
stock of the two loss-making airlines.
	   The government has announced it is likely to accept the
recommendations of an official privatization agency that it divest
60 percent of the stock in Air-India to a private joint venture and
to the public.
	   The government has announced plans to sell 51 percent of Indian
Airlines as well.

Chechnya's top prosecutor missing, believed kidnapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top prosecutor, the man who was
investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, has
himself been abducted by unidentified assailants, officials said
today.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city of Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said the kidnapping was
probably the work of an armed band seeking the release of one of
their colleagues from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreign telephone
workers whose severed heads were found Tuesday on a road in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man, Apti Abitayev, who had confessed to
kidnapping the four foreigners, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching today for
additional suspects as well as the bodies of the four foreigners.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said British
officials could come to Chechnya to investigate the slaying,
Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

Court: further detention for ex-Ukrainian PM, bail possible

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko must
remain in jail for another month pending a money-laundering trial
unless he meets conditions for a multimillion-dollar bail next
week, his lawyer said Friday.
	   Paul Gully-Hart said the Geneva criminal court ruled in a
hearing Friday that it will accept the as yet unspecified bail if
Lazarenko, a former prime minister, can prove he got the money
legitimately.
	   Gully-Hart has proposed to the court a bail of 4 million to 5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.8 million-3.6 million).
	   ``The court isn't convinced about the origin of the money so I
am going to do what is necessary,'' said Gully-Hart.
	   Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet issued a statement saying he
planned to question Lazarenko next week on the basis of what he
learned during a trip to Ukraine and on the basis of evidence
collected in Geneva.
	   He stressed that legal cooperation between Switzerland and
Ukraine could be enhanced by the case.
	   In Kiev, meanwhile, Ukraine's Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko ordered an investigation into allegations that 10
senior government officials were involved in corruption.
	   Gully-Hart said his client is ready to cooperate with the Swiss
authorities, but that he didn't want information he gives them to
be transmitted to the Ukrainian capital Kiev because he believes it
would be used against him for political purposes.
	   Three Swiss cantons (states) are investigating Lazarenko, and
the Geneva investigating judge is in the Ukraine this week.
	   Gully-Hart said he had already made arrangements for Lazarenko
to be interviewed by the Zurich investigating judge next week.
	   ``Mr. Lazarenko must answer the questions as soon as possible,
and I think the situation can be sorted out very quickly,'' he
said.
	   ``I am personally convinced that he has not committed any crime
in Switzerland.''
	   Lazarenko, detained last week as he entered Switzerland, has
admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but claims he can prove it
has no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko was charged last Friday in connection with a
``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   His supporters in Ukraine claim he is the victim of a political
campaign.
	   Lazarenko, prime minister from 1996 to 1997, was dismissed by
President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say he use the office to reap huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet
republic, but he and his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko maintains Ukrainian officials want to discredit him
before presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even
accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's centrist Hromada party fared well in parliamentary
elections this year and he was widely considered a top contender in
the future presidential race.

U.N. inspectors begin final days of current inspections

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out
searches again Friday, despite a dispute with Iraqi authorities
over entry to an office of the ruling party.
	   At least three inspection teams drove out of the U.N.
headquarters on Baghdad's outskirts in white, four-wheel drive
vehicles adorned with the U.N. logo.
	   Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said there were fewer
inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim Sabbath. But, she
added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of work''
and would conduct searches through the weekend.
	   This week's searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
work last month.
	   Visiting teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct
the more intrusive searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath Party, to which a
team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday.
	   A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco
building, has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try
to return. The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is
private property and contains no materials wanted by the
inspectors.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. Richard
Butler, the chief weapons inspector, has said the office in the
neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials of significance.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that
``the military option remains on the table'' if Iraq violates its
promise to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   But Albright and National Security Council Adviser Sandy Berger
said the United States was reserving judgment until Butler makes
his report on Iraqi compliance early next week to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
	   At a White House briefing with Albright, Berger said the best
option would be that U.N. inspectors would be allowed to do their
job. If they can't, ``Then we're left to take our own action.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Researcher Ron Clarke's
university and the South African government hailed him as a hero
when he announced the discovery of the oldest skeleton of a human
ancestor.
	   But on Friday, two days after the announcement, the University
of the Witwatersrand confirmed his contract had not been renewed in
a ``restructuring.''
	   Clarke, one of the nation's foremost paleo-anthropologists, said
he was taking up a position next year in Germany.
	   His departure for foreign lands was somewhat of an embarrassment
to the government, and especially to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   Mbeki, who has been promoting the idea of an African cultural
and economic renaissance, appeared at the Wednesday news conference
announcing Clarke's remarkable discovery and called him a national
``hero.''
	   Clarke ``is among a team of people who are very invaluable to
our country,'' Mbeki's spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa, said Friday.
``His departure, if true, would be a loss, but we hope it will not
be a loss to the human sciences as a whole.''
	   University spokeswoman Peggy Jennings called Clarke's find a
``monumental discovery for South Africa'' and said his departure
was ``sad.''
	   But she could not say why Clarke had to go in the restructuring.
Nor would she comment on negative remarks about Clarke by his
supervisor, which were quoted in Friday's Mail and Guardian weekly.
	   The newspaper quoted his supervisor, Lee Berger, as saying
Clarke ``has no great record'' or special skills, and that the
excavation site where Clarke made his reputation needed a rest.
	   Berger, a 32-year-old American who heads the Wits
Paleo-Anthropology Research Group, did not immediately return a
phone message.
	   In a telephone interview, Clarke said he took a research job
with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Institute in Frankfurt shortly
after hearing about six months ago he would not be reappointed.
	   ``I was told that because of operational changes my contract
would not be renewed. I don't want to get into any acrimony over
this,'' he said.
	   Clarke said he will continue to excavate some months of the year
at the Sterkfontein caves near Johannesburg, where he found the
skeleton.
	   The university said it was giving him an honorary appointment in
the Anatomy Department. Only Clarke and his mentor, retired Wits
professor Phillip Tobias, have government permits to run
excavations at the cave, a major repository of human and animal
fossils.
	   On Wednesday, Clarke said the cave had yielded the oldest
complete skeleton of a human ancestor, a 4-foot-tall ape-man dating
back 3.2 to 3.6 million years. The find could shed crucial light on
the anatomy and activity of our earliest forebears.
	   The university's action ``does disturb me,'' said Clarke, an
unfailingly polite researcher who has spent nearly half his
53-years associated with the caves, the past seven as a member of
Berger's group.
	   ``I thought they were making a very big mistake.''

Meissnitzer triumphs in giant slalom for second straight win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS fact that Meissnitzer didn't win double at Park City
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ After dominating the women's speed
skiers, Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer overwhelmed the World Cup's
technical field Friday, taking the giant slalom to collect her
fourth win of the week.
	   Just 24 hours after winning the super-G by a wide margin, the
25-year-old Austrian proved her superiority over the circuit's
strongest giant slalom skiers, including Olympic champion Deborah
Compagnoni and reigning World Cup champion Martina Ertl.
	   Flying down the foggy, bumpy Piste-G course in a two-run
combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, Meissnitzer built up a
massive .82 lead ahead of runner-up Compagnoni down the opening run
in 1:08.53. Meissnitzer's second-fastest time of 1:08.81 in the
final leg was enough to secure her fourth win of the season, her
second in giant slalom.
	   ``I knew I had to risk everything,'' said Meissnitzer. ``I only
had a .20 lead after the first run so I couldn't be too tactical
about it. I just went for it and it worked.''
	   Meissnitzer, who also won a pair of super-G races, has
reinforced her lead atop the overall World Cup standings where she
sits with 625 points.
	   Winner of four out of nine women's races so far this season,
Meissnitzer's results have only served to fuel her ever growing
confidence.
	   ``When I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,''
said Meissnitzer, who also won at Park City last month, winning a
super-G and a giant slalom. ``My confidence is thriving. I have no
doubts in my head.''

Two Palestinians killed in West Bank clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution on deaths, army spokesman &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
arrival, Israeli troops opened fire on hundreds of Palestinian
stone throwers Friday during a protest against Israel's refusal to
release prisoners, witnesses said. Two were killed and 32 injured.
	   The violence and Israel's tough positions concerning the peace
agreement Clinton is coming to promote raised new concerns that the
presidential visit will be plagued by problems.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on the release
of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making
body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Friday's violence erupted just outside the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya. Palestinian witnesses said about 500 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas, rubber-coated steel
pellets and live ammunition to disperse the crowd.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman
at the U.N. clinic in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by
rubber bullets, two by live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas
inhalation, hospital officials said.
	   The Israeli army said a preliminary investigation indicated that
soldiers did not use live rounds, but that the circumstances of the
two deaths would be checked further.
	   The Palestinian protesters, most of them supporters of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, had gathered
after Muslim noon prayers to press for the release of Palestinian
prisoners _ a key point of contention between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority.

Roussel, Voet banned for role in Festina doping affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS background, and quotes from Voet, ADDS byline.
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bruno Roussel and Willy Voet will be banned from
professional cycling for five and three years respectively for
their part in the Festina doping affair that overshadowed the Tour
de France, the French Cycling Federation said on Friday.
	   The FFC banned Roussel, Festina's former sporting director, and
ex-physiotherapist Voet after the team admitted to systematic
doping of cyclists.
	   The bans cover competition in France, but will likely be
endorsed by the International Cycling Union (UCI), federation
spokesman Christophe Lavagne told The Associated Press.
	   That means Roussel and Voet would not be able to take part in
professional cycling anywhere in the world.
	   The decision came after a meeting Thursday of the federations'
five-man disciplinary committee.
	   ``I am disgusted. I am really mad,'' Voet told French sports
newspaper L'Equipe. ``I am 53 years old and it is not easy to find
a job at my age. I have been the scapegoat since the start of this
affair.''
	   The scandals surrounding the Tour de France began July 8, three
days before the first leg, when French customs officials caught
Voet was a stash of anabolic steroids and erythropoietin (EPO).
	   Festina was expelled from the race after Roussel admitted to
systematic use of banned drugs.
	   By the end of the famous race, six out of the 21 teams had
pulled out of the Tour, citing police tactics, leaving fewer than
100 riders from the original 189.
	   Richard Virenque, who split with Festina after being the team's
top cyclist, was recently forced to quit the sport after being
unable to find a new team.
	   But Roussel and Voet have in general been treated more harshly
than the cyclists themselves.
	   The Swiss federation only handed out eight month bans to Alex
Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier - allowing them to compete
in next year's Tour - and fines of 3,000 Swiss franc (dlrs 2,164)
fines.

E. Timorese resistance reports abuses by Indonesian troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS affiliation of resistance spokesman in 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of exiled East Timorese
pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked
unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian
territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
	   The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the
pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
	   Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and
killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement
claimed.
	   Jose Pau Lelo, 38, Rosito Borges, 35, and Leao Soares, 50, were
in a coma due to injuries they sustained in the attack, according
to the statement which cited resistance sources in East Timor's
capital Dili.
	   The statement, released in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, also
said 19 men were wounded, eight seriously, and 26 others were
missing. The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were
listed.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the attack, and
Indonesian officials were was not immediately available for
comment.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in Dec. 1975, following Portugal's
colonial rule, and annexed it a month later. Indonesian troops have
since then been fighting a small band of pro-independence
guerillas.
	   Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of
Timorese Resistance, said he also had corroborated the report with
six sources inside East Timor and said he had ``no reasons to doubt
the truth'' of the statement.
	   The United Nations, which is brokering talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regards
Portugal as the administering power in East Timor.
	   The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) southeast of Jakarta.

Ukraine's parliament gives tax breaks for Chernobyl closure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday granted tax
breaks for the Chernobyl nuclear plant and introduced measures to
ease the effects of the plant's planned closure on its workers.
	   A total of 273 deputies in the 450-seat legislature voted to
approve a bill that would exempt funds allocated for Chernobyl's
closure from profit tax.
	   Ukraine pledged to close Chernobyl by 2000 following
international concerns that its further operation could lead to
another accident, like the 1986 explosion at one of the plant's
reactors, the world's worst nuclear disaster.
	   However, Chernobyl needs hundreds of millions of dollars to
safely shut down its three reactors for good, and to prevent the
spread of radiation from beneath the concrete shelter built hastily
over the destroyed reactor soon after the 1986 accident.
	   Ukraine says it will not be able to close Chernobyl in time
unless the West comes up with promised aid funds to help complete
two new nuclear reactors in Ukraine and provide social protection
to thousands of Chernobyl workers.
	   The measure approved Friday also introduced five-year tax breaks
for businesses that would be started in the Chernobyl area to
provide former plant employees with new jobs.
	   In addition, foreign-made equipment needed for the plant's
closure may be imported tax-free until 2004.
	   Former Chernobyl workers would be eligible for special financial
assistance from the state for more than a year while they are
looking for new jobs, the law said.
	   The Chernobyl plant has operated only one reactor since 1996,
when another reactor was shut down. A third reactor has remained
inactive since it was damaged in a 1991 fire.

Nicaragua files suit against tobacco companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Nicaragua has filed suit against
U.S. tobacco companies in federal court, modeled after the lawsuit
filed by U.S. state attorneys general.
	   The suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the U.S.
commonwealth of Puerto Rico, names several cigarette companies
including Philip Morris, Liggett Group and British American
Tobacco.
	   Guatemala, represented by the same Houston law firm that
represents Nicaragua, has filed a similar suit and a Brazilian
official said Thursday his country is also considering legal
action.
	   ``This is very similar to cases filed by the U.S. attorneys
general and we anticipate using a number of documents used
throughout the United States in (related) litigation matters and
many of the witnesses we anticipate using at trial are in U.S.
jurisdiction,'' said lawyer D'Lisa Simmons of the Houston-based law
firm of Fleming, Hovenkamp and Grayson, which is representing
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
	   Simmons said the lawsuit did not seek a specific amount because
Nicaraguan officials were still working on an estimate of how much
the Central American country has spent on treating smoking-related
illnesses.
	   The suit filed in May for Guatemala in Washington, D.C., seeks
about dlrs 300 million.
	   In Brazil, a health ministry official said Thursday that his
country was also consulting with lawyers about filing a suit in
U.S. federal court.
	   Brazil's National Institute of Cancer says the South American
country has approximately 31 million smokers, or 33 percent of the
population over age 15. The institute estimates that smoking kills
80,000 people each year and is responsible for 90 percent of lung
cancer deaths.
	   Last month 46 states agreed to a dlrs 206 billion settlement
with the tobacco industry over health claims. The settlement ended
a suit filed by attorneys general for several of the 50 U.S.
states.

Blair battles to save to save travelers duty-free perks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair battled
Friday to persuade his European Union colleagues to overturn the
planned abolition of tax-free shopping in the EU.
	   At a year-end summit dominated by weighty issues like defense
and reform of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget, Blair lobbied to
reprieve the duty-free perks which the 15-nation Union is due to
scrap June 30.
	   Duty-free shopping is immensely popular among Britons who flock
in their millions to ferry boats crossing the English Channel to
buy cheap supplies of liquor, cigarettes and perfume. Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook this week called the proposed ban ``the most
visible and high-profile (EU) decision'' for the British public.
	   In continental nations with lower domestic taxes on alcohol, the
duty-free issue is less contentious. However, support for saving it
is growing among EU nations, although Blair does not have the
required backing of all 15.
	   ``I think it is going our way, but it requires unanimity to get
it changed,'' Blair said. ``That's a pretty tall order and that's
why I don't give any promises or guarantees.''
	   France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg expressed support
for a stay of execution. Denmark and the Netherlands stood firmly
behind the abolition plan, backed by Belgium and Italy.
	   Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson reflected a commonly held
view among other nations. ``I've nothing against duty-free being
abolished, but there are better causes to fight for,'' he told
reporters.
	   The EU voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free shopping,
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU
market. Since then, governments have changed in many EU nations and
airlines, shipping companies and labor unions have lobbied
intensely to save it.
	   They claim scrapping the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty-free
industry will push up the cost of travel and throw some 150,000
people out of work.
	   Supporters of abolition counter that duty-free operators
effectively enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not
paying duties on their sales, giving them an unfair advantage over
other retailers.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin
office Friday to meet with several top aides and sign orders, and
then retreated again to a country residence, his spokesman said.
	   It was the first time Yeltsin had gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   On Friday, the president met with his new chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's
work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said at a news
conference.
	   Yeltsin also met with Vladislav Sherstyuk, new chief of the
government's agency in charge of classified communications, or
FAPSI, whose previous boss was fired in the Monday reshuffle.
	   Brief television footage of Friday meetings showed Yeltsin
alternately smiling and gesticulating animatedly, and staring
glumly at his aides. Like most footage of Kremlin meetings, the
Friday tape had no sound of the president speaking.
	   The president on Friday spoke by telephone with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the next year's budget, which was to be
sent to the parliament Friday.
	   Yeltsin also recorded a radio address to the nation that was to
air Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the approval of
Russia's constitution, and signed a decree awarding a medal to
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn _ a former Soviet dissident and Nobel
laureate who turned 80 on Friday.
	   The president ``had a very active day today, which demonstrates
properly the state of his health,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has been at the Rus country residence, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) north of Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released
from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia.
After his trip to the Kremlin on Friday, Yeltsin went to the
Gorky-9 residence just west of the capital, Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and
doctors believe this can be done at a country residence ... with
periodic examinations at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' Yakushkin
said.
	   He refused to speculate how long the recuperation will last,
however, saying only it would take ``as long as necessary.''
	   Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and
Belarusian presidents, Yakushkin said.
	   The president, who insists he is still fit to lead the country,
has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of
various illnesses. He has handed over responsibility for solving
the country's economic problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

E. Timorese resistance reports abuses by Indonesian troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of exiled East Timorese
pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked
unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian
territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian
officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the
pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
	   Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and
killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement,
which cited resistance sources in East Timor's capital, Dili.
	   The statement, released in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon,
also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing. The
names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed.
	   Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the Socialist Party of
Timor, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated the
report with six sources inside East Timor and said he had ``no
reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement.
	   The United Nations, which is brokering talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regards
Portugal as the administering power in East Timor.
	   The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) southeast of Jakarta.

300,000 children fighting in wars, say churches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The World Council of Churches said
Friday 300,000 children are fighting in wars around the globe and
appealed to African churches in particular to help end the
recruitment of child soldiers.
	   Most of the children engaged in armed conflicts were from poor
or ``marginalized'' communities, said the group, which represents
450 million non-Catholic Christians from more than 300 churches.
	   The WCC, which is holding a conference here, said many children
were lawfully recruited but others were kidnapped or coerced into
fighting in wars. Child soldiers fight or assist front-line
fighters in most African conflicts.
	   In a statement, the WCC appealed to churches to press their
governments to ratify and enforce the African Charter on children's
rights that prohibits children under 18 being recruited for
military duties.
	   The world council also asked churches to assist in the
rehabilitation of child soldiers, especially young girls,
traumatized by their experiences in national armies or irregular
armed forces or rebel groups.
	   Christian doctrine condemned war and sought the overall
``delegitimization of war and violence and...to overcome the
spirit, logic and practice of war,'' the churches said.
	   Children have fought in conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Congo,
Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan in the
past decade.

Bulgaria's Soccer Union reelects Slavkov as president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist strongman Todor Zhivkov, was reelected Friday as head
Bulgaria's Soccer Union.
	   Slavkov defeated Sofia's popular mayor, Stefan Sofiyanski,
283-128 in a ballot at a Union congress Friday.
	   Despite increasing criticism following Bulgaria's poor
performance at the World Cup finals in France last July, Slavkov _
who was married to Zhivkov's late daughter Lyudmila _ still had
enough supporters in the soccer establishment to retain his post.
He also heads his country's Olympic Committee.
	   Bulgaria's team of aging stars and inexperienced youngsters has
been disappointing since it qualified fourth in the world in 1994
after defeating former world champions Germany and Argentina.
	   The Soccer Union is currently locked in a legal battle with the
government committee on sports, to repeal a September ban on it
running the soccer teams. The ban came as a result of a doping
scandal, that the committee blamed the Union of mishandling.
	   In June, the Union suspended league player Ilia Gruev from
competition for three months, after he tested positive of a banned
drug in April. The committee says the punishment was delayed and
insufficient.
	   Sofiyanski has pledged to help overcome the setback in
Bulgaria's soccer and warm up strained relations between the Union
and the government.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Heavy fighting between the government army
and UNITA has spread from the rebel group's central highland
strongholds to other towns in the area, the two sides said Friday.
	   A government statement said the UNITA rebels had launched ``a
violent military offensive'' across the central highland provinces
of Bie and Huambo, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA representative contacted by telephone in
Lisbon, Portugal, confirmed the foes were engaged in ``intense
combat'' in various areas of the two provinces.
	   Morgado said battles also were taking place in the northern
province Uige, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of the
capital on the border with Congo.
	   The Radio Eclesia correspondent in Huambo reported that
reinforcements from the army's 14th regiment arrived by plane in
the city Friday from Congo where they had been supporting President
Laurent Kabila's fight against rebels.

EFG Eurobank to merge with Bank of Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ EFG Eurobank, one of Greece's biggest
banks, will merge with the smaller Bank of Athens, it was announced
Friday.
	   A number of Greek banks have been consolidating in recent months
to better prepare for Greece's expected entry into European
Monetary Union on Jan. 1, 2001.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.
	   Eurobank, an unlisted bank, bought the Bank of Athens, which is
listed, last summer.
	   Under a proposal by both banks' boards of directors, unlisted
Eurobank will be absorbed by the Bank of Athens. The new bank will
be named EFG Eurobank S.A.

East Timorese resistance reports abuses by Indonesian troops

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of exiled East Timorese
pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked
unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian
territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian
officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the
pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
	   Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and
killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement,
which cited resistance sources in East Timor's capital, Dili.
	   The statement, released in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon,
also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing. The
names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed.
	   Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of
Timorese Resistance, another pro-independence group, said he had
corroborated the report with six sources inside East Timor and said
he had ``no reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement.
	   The United Nations, which is brokering talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regards
Portugal as the administering power in East Timor.
	   The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) southeast of Jakarta.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders hacked their way
through the jungle of EU budget reform Friday, but made no real
headway at their year-end summit in readying the Union's finances
for enlargement over the next decade.
	   Prospects were better for progress on plans for a common defense
strategy, which would permit Europeans to assume a greater role in
continental defense independent from the United States but still in
the NATO framework.
	   The heart of the talks on the first day of their two-day summit,
however, was how the 15-nation EU will finance its expansion by as
many as a dozen new countries over the next decade. Rich countries
like Germany and Britain already feel they are paying too much into
EU coffers.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country is still
paying the costs of absorbing East Germany, made it clear that
Europe's enlargement problems are not going to be solved with a
German checkbook.
	   ``There ... is a growing understanding that fairness in payments
also has something to do with strengthening European integration,''
Schroeder said in a television interview.
	   The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries -
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
Preliminary talks are also underway with Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and possibly Malta, but they are
considered far from ready.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget already goes
to farm subsidies. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries along with their millions of uneconomical farmers in the
next five or six years would break the budget unless serious
reforms are undertaken.
	   ``There must be compensation for farmers, but they can't be
compensated forever,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman for
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``We'll be focusing on very much
on stabilization of spending.''
	   Germany and the other rich countries want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more. Poorer EU
countries, for their part, don't want to see their subsidies cut in
favor of even poorer new members.
	   ``There is no new money here,'' said German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer. ``The same goes for the budget question. It's not
a matter of finding more money but doing more with the money you
have.''
	   Spain is leading a group of poorer EU members who want to see
the budget expanded. That group is insisting on an increase that
will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the EU for six
months, starting Jan. 1. Leaders hope to have the entire budget
question resolved under the German presidency.
	   Less contentious are plans for a common defense strategy,
launched by France and Britain earlier this month at a mini-summit
in St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The two countries, Western
Europe's only nuclear powers, issued a statement saying the EU
should have the ability to act independently with a ``credible
military force.''
	   Any such military action would come within the framework of
NATO, the French and British leaders insisted, but would allow
Europeans to launch military action without waiting for the United
States to take the lead.
	   The United States says it favors any European action that will
strengthen security on the continent.

The Mirror fires Shane Warne as columnist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shane Warne, embroiled in a betting scandal in
Australia, was fired Friday as a columnist for the British tabloid
The Mirror.
	   Warne, hired to write columns during the current Ashes series,
was dismissed because the paper said he had brought the sport in to
``disrepute.''
	   In its top sports story of the day, The Mirror said the spin
bowler had lost credibility with its audience.
	   ``We believe millions of our readers could not stomach the
hypocrisy of Warne taking cash from disreputable bookies with one
hand, and trying to nail charges of corruption against a fellow
professional, Pakistan captain Salim Malik, with the other,'' the
paper said.
	   Sports Editor Des Kelly said the split had immediate effect.
	   ``Shane Warne's reputation will remain irrevocably tarnished in
the eyes of the public,'' he wrote. ``We cannot give a platform to
a player who has admitted taking money in these circumstances.''
	   Warne admitted Wednesday he had accepted dlrs 5,000 Australian
(dlrs 3,200) and teammate Mark Waugh dlrs 6,000 Australian (dlrs
3,840) in 1994 from Indian bookmakers for supplying weather and
field conditions during matches in Pakistan.
	   The two were fined in 1995 by the Australian Cricket Board,
although the matter was kept secret until it was broken by an
Australian newspaper.
	   Waugh was fined 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and
Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100).

Israeli politicians to Clinton: release Pollard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli legislators said Friday they will stage
a street protest during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
press for the release of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard who
is serving a life term in a U.S. jail.
	   Dozens of demonstrators, including a Cabinet minister and four
legislators, will wait for Clinton outside the residence of Israeli
President Ezer Weizman in Jerusalem, organizers said.
	   Clinton is to meet with Weizman on Sunday afternoon as part of
his three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Pollard has been imprisoned for 13 years. Successive U.S.
administrations have turned down Israeli requests for Pollard's
release. After Israel had claimed for years that Pollard was part
of a rogue operation run without the knowledge of the government,
Pollard was recognized as an Israeli agent several months ago.
	   In October, the wrangling over Pollard led to a last-minute
crisis in the Wye River Mideast summit. On the last day of the
summit, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded
Pollard's release as a condition for release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. CIA Director George Tenet threatened
to resign if Pollard were freed.
	   Clinton promised he would review the Pollard case, but said at
the time he was not making promises to Israel about the outcome.
	   A Clinton administration official said Wednesday the Pollard
case would not be on the agenda during Clinton's visit.
	   The support in Israel for the release of Pollard cuts across
political divides.
	   Ofir Pines, a Labor Party lawmaker and enthusiastic supporter of
the Mideast peace process, said Israelis cannot understand why
Pollard is still in jail when Washington has released other
American spies after shorter periods.
	   ``It is hard to believe that Pollard still possesses secrets
after all this time,'' said Pines who plans to join the protesters.
``We think that the real motive of the American intelligence
community is pure revenge.''

South African bowlers grab initiative against WIndies

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of day's play

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ Although their batsment
struggled, South Africa lead the West Indies by 267 runs at the end
of the second day of
	   the second test at St. George's Park Friday.
	   South Africa was on 143 for five wickets when bad light stopped
play. Earlier, they had dismissed the West Indies for 121 in reply
to their own first innings of 245. It was nearly a different story
for the home team, however, as their brittle top order was once
again exposed. At 11 for three, and Gary Kirsten (2), Hershelle
Gibbs (4) and Jacques Kallis (3) all out, it appeared as if the
West Indies might bowl their way back into the match.
	   And when Hansie Cronje (24) and Darryll Cullinan (10) joined
their teammates back in the dressing room, it was clear a
superhuman effort was needed to keep the test match within South
Africa's grasp.
	   Jonty Rhodes and Shaun Pollock supplied the true grit required,
and their
	   battling partnership worth 90 runs might eventually make the
difference between winning and losing.
	   South Africa's fast bowlers demolished the West Indies batting
line up, and, once again in this series Pollock was the man who did
the damage. He took five in the first innings in the Johannesburg
test.
	   His haul of five for 43 was supported by some superb
line-and-length bowling by rookie David Terbrugge, who took three
for 27, and by some genuine pace and hostility by Allan Donald, who
finished with two for 33.
	   South Africa snatched four early wickets to have the West Indies
in trouble at 63 for four at lunch. It was Terbrugge who struck two
vital blows just before lunch, bowling opener Stuart Williams and
Carl Hooper in successive overs. Pollock had started the ball
rolling by dismissing Clayton Lambert for a duck in his first over.
Donald got in on the act by having Brian Lara caught at first slip
by Cullinan for four.
	   After lunch, it was one-way traffic, except for a breezy innings
of 31 by
	   Nixon McLean, who hit 31, including four towering sixes. He fell
to Donald, and Terbrugge and Pollock finished off the rest between
them.
	   South Africa had resumed their innings with Donald and Pat
Symcox at the wicket, and added just 22 runs to their overnight 223
for eight. Donald finished on 33, to equal his highest test score.
He perished to Hooper's fourth catch in the slips, giving Courtney
Walsh his fourth wicket in the innings.
	   South Africa were soon in trouble in their second innings, at 11
for two at tea, with Herschelle Gibbs gone for four, and Gary
Kirsten for two.

	   But Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee,a Democrat, said the charge that
Clinton had abused his presidential powers was ``preposterous'' and
urged her colleagues to instead vote to censure Clinton, saying it
was ``right, punitive and just.''
	   Clinton met late Thursday with his advisers to discuss the
possibility of delivering another statement of contrition to help
stave off impeachment.
	   ``That's something that he's mulling,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said Friday He added that as of midday, Clinton had no
plans to speak out Friday.
	   A staff draft of a proposed presidential statement calls his
conduct ``terribly wrong'' and says, ``I understand today how
reasonable people could read from my testimony in the (Paula) Jones
case and conclude I crossed the line. I tried not to, but that is
no excuse.'' The draft, first obtained by MSNBC, is ``not something
that the president considered or saw,'' Lockhart said.
	   The White House and House Republicans pressed undecided
lawmakers in the Northeast. Eleven former Democratic House members
from the 1974 Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach Nixon sent
a letter urging the current panel to take action to allow a House
floor vote on censure as an alternative to impeachment.
	   During the debate, Rep. Bob Barr, a Republican, argued Friday
that Clinton, ``through his conduct and his arrogance,'' had
``thrown a gauntlet at the feet of the Congress'' that required an
impeachment vote.

Le Pen further punishes Megret, pleads with rank-and-file

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on
Friday further punished his longtime lieutenant and heir apparent
for defying him, suspending his party membership.
	   The National Front leader also appealed to his party's
rank-and-file not to fall into the ``trap'' his rival, Bruno
Megret, has laid with his appeal for an urgent congress to decide
the party's future.
	   ``I have never lied to you, never abandoned you, never betrayed
you,'' Le Pen said in the message to his followers, delivered at a
news conference at party headquarters just outside Paris.
	   He asked National Front members across the country not to sign
petitions calling for the congress.
	   Already this week, Le Pen had dismissed Bruno Megret from his
job as No. 2 man, stripping his title of general delegate.
	   On Friday, he announced: ``At my request, the executive bureau
has suspended the membership (of Megret and four others), and is
waiting for them to appear before our disciplinary institution.''
	   He said he had suspended them not for calling the congress,
``but for disobeying.''
	   The bitter leadership feud has split the National Front into two
warring camps.
	   Megret's camp _ which has moved into its own building _ claims
it has almost all the 10,000 signatures necessary to hold a
congress. According to party rules, 20 percent of the 50,000 or so
members is enough.
	   ``This is not just about the National Front _ this is about
France,'' Le Pen said. ``France is in danger. Yes, France is in
grave danger.''
	   Among the others Le Pen suspended Friday was Serge Martinez, a
former Le Pen loyalist who on Monday made the original call for a
party congress _ and was immediately fired as chief of personnel.
	   Martinez launched a lawsuit against Le Pen Friday for allegedly
blocking the post office box he was using to receive signed
petitions in favor of the congress.
	   Also suspended was Philippe Olivier, the companion of Le Pen's
daughter, Marie-Caroline Le Pen, who has been accused by her father
of betraying him.
	   Another member suspended Friday _ Jean-Yves Gallou, a National
Front official of the Paris region _ struck back, at one of what
has become a series of dueling news conferences.
	   Gallou called Le Pen a ``chief whose time has passed,'' and said
he had only rejected the call for an emergency congress because he
doubted his own legitimacy.

Sri Lanka censorship shifted from military to civilian official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga shifted censorship of the news of the country's civil
war from the military and appointed a civilian official to screen
reports, the government announced Friday.
	   Analysts interpreted the appointment of Arya Rubasinghe,
director of the government information department, as new censor as
signaling an attempt to placate critics ahead of next month's local
elections.
	   Censorship has been in force since June 5 and journalists have
had to submit their stories to a military official for clearance.
	   ``This looks like an attempt by her to show a softer approach
before the elections,'' said Gamini Weerakoon, editor of the
independent Island newspaper.
	   Provincial elections scheduled for next month in northwest Sri
Lanka will be a popularity test for Kumaratunga in a region
governed by the main opposition.
	   The opposition has complained that the ruling People's Alliance
is concealing defeat suffered in the battlefield at the hands of
Tamil guerrillas by using emergency powers.
	   Kumaratunga's People's Alliance and the United National Party
are the key parties contesting the 52-seat provincial legislature
in the northwest province.
	   Tamil guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast
for the country's minority ethnic Tamils, who claim discrimination
from the majority Sinhalese.

Trade Minister criticizes steep increase in cement prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ An 18 percent price increase by
the country's sole supplier of cement was criticized by Minister of
Trade and Industry Mervyn Assam as ``scandalous.''
	   In a radio interview broadcast Thursday, Assam joined others in
criticizing Trinidad Cement Ltd. for the price hike. The company's
chief executive officer Rollin Bertrand said the increase was
necessary to pay greater dividends to shareholders.
	   Assam called the increase ``totally and completely inimical to
the interests of Trinidad and Tobago.''
	   Meanwhile, a group of local business owners responded to the
price hike by contracting to buy 15,000 tons of cement from
Thailand and bypass Trinidad Cement's monopoly.
	   In a newspaper advertisement, Bertrand attacked the quality of
the Thai cement, calling it inferior.
	   But the Cement Users Group, the group formed to buy the cement,
said the quality was a red herring raised as a ``sour grapes''
tactic by Bertrand.

Coca-Cola acquiring Cadbury Schweppes' drinks brands in 120
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL;

 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seeking to diversify and strengthen its worldwide
soft drinks business, Coca-Cola Co. said Friday it is buying
Cadbury Schweppes' beverage brands in more than 120 countries in a
deal estimated at dlrs 1.85 billion.
	   Both companies said that the transaction, which covers Schweppes
and Canada Dry mixers, Dr Pepper and Crush, does not apply to the
United States, where Cadbury Schweppes will still produce Dr
Pepper, 7UP and other brands.
	   The deal means that a Schweppes mixer ordered in a New York or
Los Angeles bar will still be made by England-based Cadbury
Schweppes PLC, but the same mixer bought in London will be made by
Coke.
	   The businesses being sold to Coca-Cola generated 56 million
pounds (dlrs 89 million) in trading profits, around 9 percent of
the group's total, in 1997, and include two concentrate plants in
Ireland and Spain.
	   ``These agreements will allow the Coca-Cola Co. to participate
in segments of the beverage business where it currently does not
have meaningful entries,'' M. Douglas Ivester, chairman of the
board and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said in a statement.
	   Completion of Friday's deal is subject to regulatory review in a
number of countries, but is anticipated by the middle of next year,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced.
	   Traders in London approved the deal, with Cadbury Schweppes
stock climbing higher than other shares on the blue-chip Financial
Times Stock Exchange 100-Index of leading companies Friday. The
company's shares closed up 5.8 percent, or 54.5 pence (dlrs 0.87),
to finish at 989 pence (dlrs 15.82).
	   Coca-Cola shares on the New York Stock Exchange fell dlrs 2.25 a
share to dlrs 63.81 at midday, although the drop in share price was
likely linked to lower earnings forecast.
	   John Sunderland, chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes, said the
company may use the funds from the sale for acquisitions.
	   ``It creates immediate and substantial value for shareholders
and gives us enormous flexibility at a time of uncertainty in world
markets,'' he said.
	   Sunderland said the company had decided to sell the brands
because it lacked distribution systems needed to make a
multinational beverage operation succeed, and wanted to focus
instead on expanding its worldwide candy interests and improving
its 15 percent share of the dlrs 55 billion U.S. soft drink
industry.
	   ``Outside the United States, we only have a 3 percent market
share,'' Sunderland said at a news conference in London.
	   Cadbury also said Friday that it wanted to sell its non-U.S.
bottling operations worldwide, estimating their value at 500
million pounds (dlrs 800 million).
	   ``Critical mass is very important in the soft drink business.
Cadbury Schweppes has some very good brands outside the U.S., but
their business is very small,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest.
	   The deal, said Sicher, ``gives them a substantial amount of
money and it gives Coke the opportunity to build some good brands
through its worldwide bottler system.''
	   In February, Cadbury Schweppes PLC entered a joint venture with
U.S.-based Carlyle Group to acquire two soft-drink bottlers _
Beverage America and Select Beverages _ for dlrs 724 million.
	   Cadbury Schweppes will not sell its drinks business in South
Africa and France, due to regulatory problems.
	   The deal will affect approximately 450 Cadbury Schweppes
employees, who will have the opportunity to take jobs with
Coca-Cola, the company said.

Vatican official: no easy solution to priest shortage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A top Vatican official said Friday there was
no easy solution to the shortage of priests in remote places but
didn't directly address the latest calls by some Roman Catholic
clergy to ordain married man.
	   One of the most pressing issues raised at a gathering at the
Vatican of bishops from the far-flung dioceses of Oceania was how
to minister to the faithful when there aren't enough priests to go
around.
	   Oceania includes Australia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands,
Fiji and Papua New Guinea and spans some 25,000 islands.
	   Wrapping up the three-week-long synod, bishops said Friday that
they have asked the Vatican to study the possibility of ordaining
married men to ease the priest shortage.
	   ``It's only one of the possible suggestions,'' said Perth's
bishop, Barry James Hickey. ``Others are to redouble efforts for
vocations for the celibate priesthood'' or find ways to make it
easier for priests to travel from one remote parish to the next.
	   Pope John Paul II has insisted that priests be celibate. The
Vatican contends that sex and family obligations can distract a
priest from his spiritual duties.
	   A top Vatican official, Australian Cardinal Edward Cassidy,
skirted the issue when asked about married priests.
	   The priest shortage ``needs certainly a lot of study but easy
solutions there aren't,'' he said at the synod's closing news
conference.
	   But the bishops seemed intent on pressing the Vatican for help.
The shortage ``needs to be resolved,'' Hickey insisted.
	   One possibility raised during the synod was special dispensation
from the celibacy rule in certain situations.
	   Bishops said Pope John Paul II listened to all their speeches
during the synod and invited frankness.
	   When confronted with appeals in past years from other remote
places short of priests, including in Africa and Latin America, the
Vatican responded by proposing to send in priests from Europe or
North America.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin granted Alexander
Solzhenitsyn the country's top cultural honor Friday, the 80th
birthday of Russia's most famous living writer.
	   Solzhenitsyn, a longtime critic of Yeltsin, thanked the
president but turned down the award, Russia's RTR television
reported. Yeltsin's press service said it had no information about
a rejection.
	   Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service before the fatherland and great contributions
to world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   The award, named after a Christian missionary, is one of
Russia's highest honors.
	   Solzhenitsyn is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet
Union's gulags, or prison camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   On Friday, Solzhenitsyn was expected to attend a play,
``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First
Circle.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work. He had already become
internationally famous when Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974.
He lived a secluded existence in Vermont before returning to Russia
in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet regime.

French soccer chiefs suspend Charbonnier for two games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES that FFF wants the player banned for Scottish games as
well as international matches.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier was suspended
for two matches on Friday for walking out of the team's training
camp before a recent match against Russia.
	   But the ban, which begins Monday, could be contested by
Charbonnier's club, Scotland's Glasgow Rangers, because the FFF
wants it to include national league games as well as international
matches.
	   The FFF has no jurisdiction over the Scottish league, but the
ban is intended to cover the first two matches - national or
international - that Charbonnier is able to participate in, FFF
spokesman Nicolas Maingot told The Associated Press.
	   The ban begins Monday.
	   To further complicate matters, the player is currently injured.
	   Before the match in Moscow, Charbonnier was angered that French
coach Roger Lemerre called experienced goalkeeper Bernard Lama into
the squad after first-choice goalkeeper Fabien Barthez sustained an
injury.
	   Charbonnier had initially been selected as deputy to Barthez for
the match in Moscow.
	   The former Auxerre goalkeeper was third choice goalkeeper in the
French World Cup squad, but never played a match during the
competition.
	   A purely international ban would have little impact, because
Charbonnier's near term chances of playing again for France
continue to look grim.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin granted Alexander
Solzhenitsyn the country's top cultural honor Friday, the 80th
birthday of Russia's most famous living writer.
	   Solzhenitsyn, a longtime critic of Yeltsin, thanked the
president but turned down the award, Russia's RTR television
reported. Yeltsin's press service said it had no information about
a rejection.
	   Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service before the fatherland and great contributions
to world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   The award, named after a Christian missionary, is one of
Russia's highest honors.
	   Solzhenitsyn is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet
Union's gulags, or prison camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   On Friday, Solzhenitsyn was expected to attend a play,
``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First
Circle.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work. He had already become
internationally famous when Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974.
He lived a secluded existence in Vermont before returning to Russia
in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet regime.

Rat poison in Christmas cakes; animal rights groups claims

 &UR; EDs: recasts for AM with new material.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two popular brands of Italian Christmas cakes were
pulled off the shelves Friday after an animal rights group said it
injected them with rat poison. Tests confirmed the contamination.
	   The Animal Liberation Front sent cakes to the ANSA news agency
in Bologna and Florence on Thursday along with messages saying it
was protesting genetic engineering.
	   Both cakes tested positive on Friday for enough rat poison to
make someone seriously ill, ANSA said. Additional tests were being
run on some of the cakes that authorities ordered pulled off the
shelves in about 1,000 stores nationwide.
	   Both brands of ``panettone'' _ Motta and Alemagna _ are make by
Nestle Italia. The president, Yves Barbeiux, told a news conference
that Nestle does not use genetically engineered ingredients in any
of the products the multinational sells in Italy.
	   According to ANSA, it was the second attack on Nestle attributed
to the Animal Liberation Front this year. In May, several delivery
vehicles were set on fire in Florence and slogans against genetic
engineering were scrawled on nearby walls.

Wife of U.N. diplomat murdered in Chile, says Pinochet should face
</HEADLINE>
history &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Augusto Pinochet must face up to what he
did during his 17-year dictatorship in Chile, the widow of one of
his best known alleged victims said Friday after watching
television coverage of him being driven to a London court.
	   ``When people have power over a society they should take
responsibility for the consequences of their power,'' said Laura
Gonzalez, whose Spanish husband, a United Nations official, was
allegedly killed by Gen. Pinochet's secret police, known as the
DINA.
	   As Gonzalez told how her husband Carmelo Soria was kidnapped,
tortured and murdered in 1976, Pinochet was in court being informed
of Spain's petition to extradite him for crimes committed during
his 1973-1990 regime.
	   ``I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any other court but one
in my country to try me against the lies of Spain,'' the former
Chilean dictator told the court.
	   After his appearance, the 83-year-old general was taken back to
the English countryside mansion where he is under house arrest
pending the development of extradition proceedings.
	   Pinochet has been under guard since Oct. 16 at the instigation
of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that
extradition proceedings could move forward, and on Thursday Garzon
completed the indictment of Pinochet on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   ``Pinochet is being offered a fair trial, something that he
never gave to his victims,'' Gonzalez said.
	   ``He is being held in good conditions, and that's the way it
should be. They are conditions that are not at all comparable to
DINA's clandestine jails,'' she added.
	   Gonzalez, a Chilean, lost her job as a medical doctor for
political reasons soon after Pinochet installed a virulently
anti-Communist regime by overthrowing the elected Marxist President
Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup. She left Chile in 1978 and has
lived in Spain ever since, visiting Chile where her three grown
children now live.
	   ``For us this judicial process is hugely important because it is
breaking down judicial barriers...Spain, or any other country, has
the right to try these crimes that offended all humanity,'' she
said.
	   Gonzalez said she had given up hope that the Chilean courts
would ever give her, or any other victim's case a fair hearing.
	   The body of her husband, a 54-year-old diplomat for the U.N.
Economic Commission for Latin America, was found inside his car
after it plunged into a canal in a Santiago suburb in 1976.
Garzon's evidence alleges that DINA agents made the killing look
like a car accident.
	   The evidence alleges Soria was targeted because he was believed
to have helped several people leave Chile to escape persecution by
the regime. The case went to court twice, but was blocked by the
amnesty law passed by Pinochet to protect himself and his
subordinates from trial.
	   Gonzalez said the failure of her husband's case _ despite ample
evidence, his Spanish nationality and status as a U.N. official
with diplomatic immunity _ demonstrates how impossible it is for
just ordinary Chileans to get justice in Chilean courts.
	   Garzon's 285-page indictment holds Pinochet's regime responsible
for at least 3,000 cases of disappearance and murder, possibly up
to 5,000. The document also mentions 100,000 people forced into
exile and 50,000 people tortured.
	   For Gonzalez, the attempt to bring Pinochet to trial affords
Chile a chance to ``come to terms with its past, its brutal past,
for a more dignified future.''

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Heavy fighting between the government army
and UNITA has spread from the rebel group's central highland
strongholds to other towns in the area, the two sides said Friday.
	   A government statement said the UNITA rebels had launched ``a
violent military offensive'' across the central highland provinces
of Bie and Huambo, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of
Luanda, the capital.
	   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA representative contacted by telephone in
Lisbon, Portugal, confirmed the foes were engaged in ``intense
combat'' in various areas of the two provinces.
	   Morgado said battles also were taking place in the northern
province Uige, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) northeast of the
capital on the border with Congo.
	   The Radio Eclesia correspondent in Huambo reported that army
reinforcements flew into the city Friday from Congo, where they had
been supporting President Laurent Kabila against a rebel
insurgency.

Ukraine's Communist lawmakers to vote against international
</HEADLINE>
agreements &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian parliament's dominant
Communist Party will not support any of the several dozen
international agreements submitted by the government for
ratification, the faction's top official said Friday.
	   Many of the agreements were signed with foreign lending
institutions, such as the World Bank or the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and these cannot be supported
because the government ``often squanders'' foreign loans,
parliament's first deputy speaker Adam Martyniuk said.
	   Communist lawmakers and their allies blame the country's
economic difficulties on the government's reliance on foreign aid,
and instead propose subsidizing major domestic industries with
Ukrainian government funding.
	   Martyniuk, speaking at a meeting with visiting EBRD President
Horst Koehler, said the 125-member Communist faction in the
450-seat Verkhovna Rada had enough votes to block ratification of
all the 50-some agreements the Cabinet wants approved.
	   Besides lending deals, these agreements also include pacts
signed with other countries' governments.
	   Martyniuk said his faction decided on the move to protest the
Rada's recent failure to join the Commonwealth of Independent
States' Interparliamentary Assembly, a body formed to coordinate
the legislatures of 12 former Soviet republics.
	   The Communists are nostalgic for the Soviet Union and support
most of the steps that bring its former republics closer together.
	   An average 100 lawmakers are absent from any given session,
which might give Communists and their allies a fair chance of
carrying out their threat.
	   The vice speaker's statement is likely to further hamper the
attitude of foreign creditors towards Ukraine, as some of them are
already expressing concerns over parliament's obstruction of
foreign loans.
	   World Bank regional director Paul Siegelbaum said earlier this
week that the bank would cut its aid to Ukraine if parliament
continues to reject its projects for Ukraine.
	   He said the World Bank already had lost dlrs 1 million after
preparing two projects that had to be canceled because of
parliament's failure to ratify them.
	   The list of rejected World Bank projects has grown recently,
after lawmakers failed to approve an agreement on risk guarantees
for foreign loans to the agricultural sector. President Leonid
Kuchma submitted the agreement to parliament again Friday but the
legislature has not yet discussed it.

since a 50 percent hike in registration fees was repealed by the
government a week ago.
	   In October, Finance Minister Brian Kuei Tung announced an
increase in the registration fee for imported used cars. For those
with engine displacement up to 1599cc the fee rose from dlrs 20,000
TT (dlrs 3,250 US) to dlrs 30,000 TT (dlrs 4,875 US).
	   On Dec. 4, the government repealed the increase, causing an
instant boom in sales, dealers said.
	   Imports of used cars have become very popular in many Caribbean
and Latin American countries where high taxes on vehicles put new
cars out of the reach of many buyers. Also, the growing popularity
of leases in the United States, Japan and other industrialized
countries has created a glut of used cars, and many of them are
shipped to other countries.

Prosecutors abandon patient-killing case against Halifax doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Canadian prosecutors on Friday
abandoned efforts to try a Halifax doctor accused of killing a
terminally ill cancer patient.
	   Nineteen months after filing first-degree murder charges,
Prosecutor Craig Botterill said his office decided not to appeal a
Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruling last month which dismissed an
attempt to revive a criminal case against Dr. Nancy Morrison.
	   The case made headlines across Canada in May 1997 when dozens of
police officers swept into the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences
Center in Halifax, arresting Morrison and seizing potential
evidence.
	   Morrison was charged with murder in the 1996 death of cancer
patient Paul Mills. She was alleged to have put potassium chloride
into his intravenous tube after massive doses of painkillers failed
to alleviate his agony.
	   In February, a provincial court judge threw out the case, saying
no jury would convict Morrison. Prosecutors appealed that ruling to
the provincial Supreme Court, which rebuffed them last month.
	   The case sparked debate among legal experts over whether
Canada's laws should recognize the difference between crimes
committed by cold-blooded killers and those of well-meaning
individuals.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed returned to see the judge in the
Princess Diana case Friday, saying he wanted to talk to him about
alleged British and American surveillance of his son, Dodi, and the
princess before their deaths.
	   Al Fayed said he'd made the request himself to see Judge Herve
Stephan.
	   Asked, upon his arrival, why he had come, Al Fayed told The
Associated Press that ``The CIA and British secret services were
following Dodi and Diana.''
	   After meeting with Stephan for about an hour and a half, he
emerged to elaborate on his claim.
	   ``The CIA had a secret dossier of 1,056 pages on Diana and
Dodi,'' he said. He added he had given the judge articles from the
British press that bolstered his claim.
	   ``The British secret services asked for CIA help to follow the
couple for the three months before the accident,'' he said.
	   Diana, Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul were killed in a car
crash in the Alma traffic tunnel Aug. 31, 1997. Paul was drunk at
the time.
	   Stephan hopes to wrap up the case by the end of the year, or
early next year. Speed and alcohol are still considered the main
causes of the accident.

Scandal escalates over Salt Lake payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new investigative panel named; new comments
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Salt Lake City organizers have been
told to defend themselves against bribery allegations before the
top leadership of the Olympics.
	   Leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee will be called
before the International Olympic Committee's executive board
investigating payments to IOC members' families during the
successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Games.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik met Friday with IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information
and documents related to the case.
	   Late Friday, the IOC announced it had appointed a special ad-hoc
panel to investigate. The panel will be headed by IOC vice
president Dick Pound and include executive board members Keba
Mbaye, Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach.
	   ``We're going to begin work while we're here in Lausanne,''
Pound said. ``We have no facts at this time. The executive board
takes this matter very seriously.''
	   Pound said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there
may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the
IOC or their families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.''
	   Asked whether this amounted to bribery allegations, he said, ``I
am not prepared to characterize them as yet.''
	   Pound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could
be taken against Salt Lake.
	   Asked whether he could rule out the games being taken away from
Salt Lake City, he said, ``We're not going to make any conclusions
or any speculations as to what we may decide until we know what the
facts are.''
	   It's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct
investigated by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert Helmick was
accused of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick eventually
resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
	   This is the first time the IOC has ever investigated possible
bribery by bidding cities. Joklik said SLOC would cooperate fully
with the inquiry.
	   ``Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support
rumors that have been floating around, we have never had anything
come forward,'' Pound said. ``Specific allegations have now been
made. The executive board acted very quickly to investigate.''
	   The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid
committee for the 2002 games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a bribe.
	   ``I've already stated I do not regard what was done as a
bribe,'' Joklik said Friday. ``I recognize there have been
perceptions contrary to that. I regret those perceptions, but I
don't feel they are justified.''
	   In a clear sign that the IOC views the matter as extremely
serious, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch sent the case
directly to the decision-making board _ the inner cabinet of the
Olympic movement.
	   ``This is a serious matter,'' IOC director general Francois
Carrard said. ``You have allegations which are serious, there is no
doubt. We want facts and evidence to take any action. The matter is
serious enough that the IOC executive board will take care of it.''
	   Joklik said SLOC has provided the IOC with documentation on the
scholarship program but hasn't provided a list of the names of
people who received the funds.
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' said Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the
IOC oversight panel for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's
image.
	   ``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he
said.
	   Joklik also sought to distance himself from the bribery
allegations by making a distinction between the actions of the
bidding committee and the current organizing committee.
	   ``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the
bid committee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing
committee certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards
that would stand any investigation. The facts were in the early
1990s when the bid committee was operating.''
	   Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time, the No. 2
official behind Welch. Welch resigned as SLOC president last year
after being charged with domestic violence against his wife. He is
currently a consultant to SLOC.
	   USOC deputy secretary general John Krimsky described the
controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image and
preparations for the games.
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.

Americans call on Russians to block weapons technology to Iran

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A high-level U.S. delegation on Friday pressed
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to do more to halt the
transfer of weapons technology to Iran, an ongoing point of
friction between Washington and Moscow.
	   The Americans have been raising the issue for the past two
years, and say Russia has taken some steps, but has not done enough
to satisfy U.S. officials.
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the head of the
American delegation in Moscow, told Primakov that Washington
believes the Russians could take additional measures, a senior U.S.
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The official did not specify what steps Russia should take, but
described the issue as ``unfinished business.''
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear power plant, but insists
the project is only for generating electricity. Moscow is not
providing Iran with any technology to build weapons of mass
destruction, Russia says.
	   ``We are not interested in anybody acquiring biological, nuclear
or chemical weapons or missiles for their delivery, and this
naturally applies to all countries in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
	   Iranian weapons pose a much greater danger to nearby Russia than
the distant United States, the Russians argue.
	   Iran, meanwhile, denies U.S. charges that it is trying to
develop weapons of mass destruction.
	   However, the Americans believe that individual Russians may be
acting without government authorization to assist the Iranians,
U.S. officials said.
	   Russia has thousands of underpaid scientists and the Americans
fear they may be tempted to sell their expertise to countries such
as Iran. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars
in recent years to keep Russian scientists employed in peaceful
projects.
	   The two sides also discussed prospects for Russian ratification
of the START II arms reduction treaty. After delaying for years,
Russia's hard-line parliament is showing signs to taking up the
issue soon.
	   Russian officials told the American delegation that the
parliament could act before the end of the month, but many such
pledges have come and gone in the past.
	   The U.S. Senate has already ratified the treaty, which cuts
warheads on both sides to between 3,000 and 3,500.
	   The U.S. delegation, which also included U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, discussed Russia's economic crisis with
members of the cabinet and parliament.
	   The Americans urged Russia to press ahead with economic reforms,
but there was no indication that Washington was prepared to offer
Russia additional financial assistance.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders have
frozen loans to Russia since the country's financial meltdown this
summer.

Minister: 30 percent of Russia's weapons unusable for combat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 30 percent of Russia's weapons are no
longer fit for combat and over 70 percent of the ships in its navy
need repairs, the defense minister said Friday,
	   The report highlighted the moribund state of Russia's
cash-strapped and disorganized military.
	   The situation is especially alarming in the air force, where
only one-third of its aircraft can now fly, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev told parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Inadequate repairs and a lack of training have contributed to an
increasing number of military aircraft crashes. Earlier this week,
an Su-27 fighter jet crashed in the Far East, killing its pilot.
	   ``The state of airfields continues to deteriorate and the
potential to defend the nation's airspace has substantially
decreased,'' Sergeyev said in his speech.
	   The military modernization program has been crippled by the
government's severe cash shortage.
	   So far this year, the armed forces haven't received a ``single
new nuclear submarine, tank, combat plane, helicopter or cannon,''
Sergeyev said.
	   As a result, only 28 percent of all military hardware in the
armed forces inventories are of modern design, he said. He did not
explain what weapons the military considers state-of-the-art.
	   In the Strategic Missile Force, 60 percent of missiles on combat
duty have already served twice their service time, Sergeyev told
the lawmakers.
	   The military periodically test-fires the missiles to check their
condition and insists they remain combat-ready.
	   Sergeyev and other military leaders have urged parliament to
speed up the long-stalled ratification of the START II arms
reduction treaty with the United States. The move would allow
Russia to reduce its stockpiles and save money for new weapons.
	   However, Communists who dominate the Duma together with their
hard-line allies have balked at ratification, claiming the treaty
would hurt Russia's security.
	   No date for the ratification debate has been set yet, despite
strong pressure from the government.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of President Bill Clinton's arrival,
Israeli troops opened fire Friday on hundreds of Palestinian stone
throwers during a protest against Israel's refusal to release
prisoners, witnesses said. Two were killed and 27 were injured.
	   The violence and Israel's tough positions concerning the peace
agreement Clinton is coming to promote raised new concerns that the
presidential visit will be plagued by problems.
	   A senior White House official said Clinton is going ahead with
his trip despite the violence.
	   ``I do not think the president has had second thoughts for a
minute about going on this trip,'' Sandy Berger, his assistant for
national security affairs, said at a White House briefing for
reporters.
	   Leaving Saturday morning, Clinton will try to smooth out
differences between Israel and the Palestinians on implementing the
Wye peace accords he helped work out in October.
	   Earlier Friday, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on the release
of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making
body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Violence erupted just outside the West Bank town of Qalqiliya.
Palestinian witnesses said about 500 Palestinians threw stones at
Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets
and live ammunition to disperse the crowd.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman
at the U.N. clinic in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by
rubber bullets, two by live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas
inhalation, clinic officials said.
	   The Israeli army said a preliminary investigation indicated that
soldiers did not use live rounds, but that the circumstances of the
two deaths would be checked further.
	   The Palestinian protesters had gathered after noon prayers to
press for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a key point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israel has pledged to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three
stages by the end of January. The Palestinians have said Israel
broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli
activities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused
the Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States
offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of
prisoners one by one and determine who will be released.
	   But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a
proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel has not been offered such a
compromise, and there will not be such a compromise,'' Naveh said.
	   The other point of contention is Monday's meeting of the
Palestine National Council in Gaza City. Clinton is to address the
PNC, which, under the Wye River peace agreement, is to reaffirm
earlier decisions by lesser bodies to revoke PLO charter clauses.
	   The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by
acclamation, not by a vote as Israel has demanded.
	   With its insistence on a vote, Israel may be setting itself up
for a showdown with Clinton. Under the Wye agreement, the annulment
of the offending provisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an
Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has
not completed its task because that would mean his high-profile
visit has been a failure.
	   However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand
for a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will
not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians
because ``transfer of territory is irreversible.''
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley was evasive Thursday on whether the United States expected a
vote from the PNC. He said the procedures needed to be clear enough
that nullification has taken place.
	   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
	   On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a
smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central
Council, declared the charter clauses revoked.
	   The 95 members present were asked whether they approved a letter
in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clauses calling
for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in
favor, seven against and seven abstained.
	   Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a
very important and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader
also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep
its obligations under the Wye agreement.
	   The PLO charter was drawn up three decades ago, long before
Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko ordered a probe Friday into allegations that 10
senior government officials were involved in corruption.
	   The charges came up after the arrest in Switzerland last week of
former Ukrainian premier Pavlo Lazarenko, who was charged last
Friday with money-laundering operations.
	   Ukraine's former acting prosecutor Oleh Lytvak then said in a
broadcast interview that the main prosecutor's office has materials
on 10 state officials, which allegedly show their involvement in
corruption.
	   Lytvak gave no further details.
	   On Friday, he told the Interfax news agency there were ``certain
facts'' showing abuses of power by officials at several ministries
and other state institutions involved in privatization. Other
corruption suspicions involve ``famous gas traders, the transit of
ammonia through Ukraine, the state of the Cabinet's reserve
funds,'' Lytvak said.
	   Pustovoitenko said Friday he ordered a probe into the
allegations, and that a report from the Cabinet's State Service
Department would be submitted at the next government session.
	   The department will give an account of ``who is involved in what
cases,'' he told a Cabinet meeting. He did not give any names.
	   Pustovoitenko also said he telephoned Lytvak to receive more
information about his charges, but added that Lytvak refused to do
so, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   Many foreign businesses operating in Ukraine have complained of
pervasive corruption in the former Soviet republic. Lazarenko, who
served as premier in 1996-97 and is now a centrist opposition
legislator, is the highest-ranking former or acting official
suspected of corruption.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jetliner with 146 people
aboard crashed during heavy rain and burst into flames Friday night
in southern Thailand. Police said there were scores of dead and at
least 43 confirmed survivors.
	   By midnight local time (1700 GMT), police and rescuers
struggling in thigh-high water at the swamp crash site had managed
to pull 26 bodies from the charred wreckage.
	   Two were identified as Westerners. Scores more bodies were still
trapped in the plane, many of them burned beyond recognition,
police said.
	   At least 43 people survived, said a police official on condition
of anonymity. About 10 of them were Westerners, probably tourists,
and had checked into a local hospital.
	   Police said bodies were still being pulled from the wreckage in
the area where Thai Airways Flight TG261 crashed about five
kilometers (three miles) from the Surat Thani airport about 6:45
p.m. local time (1145 GMT).
	   A large number of people appeared to have survived. Thai
television said that one of them was the pilot, but this could not
be independently confirmed.
	   Television footage from the crash site showed at least 12
survivors, all conscious. One was a boy, aged about 10, who had
wounds on his forehead.
	   At least four were rain-soaked, bloodied Westerners, two men and
two women, being led to a pickup truck and driven from the crash
scene.
	   One survivor, popular musician Reungsak Loychusak, said in a
phone interview with a television station from his hospital bed:
``My whole left side is in pain, I can barely move.''
	   Rain was heavy in Surat Thani, 503 kilometers (330 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, and rescuers had difficulty sending
ambulances to the crash site. But the thigh-high water that
hampered rescuers may have cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list nationalities.
Passengers would not have been required to show their passports
when checking in.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban,
speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, said his sister Siriwan
had been on the flight. He had also originally been scheduled to
fly it but canceled to attend a wedding elsewhere.
	   Suthep, who said he did not know the fate of his sister,
expressed dismay that he learned about the crash first from his
relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the airline, which is
mostly owned by the government and which he supervises.
	   Suthep boarded a subsequent flight to Surat Thani to supervise
the rescue, but it and about 100 reporters on board were diverted
by bad weather to the resort island of Phuket, a three-hour
overland bus journey from Surat Thani.
	   Suthep said that two Westerners were among the dead but was
unable to confirm reports that his sister had died. Television also
reported that Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from
Surat Thani, died in the crash.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in Thai's fleet.
	   Surat Thani police said it crashed in Boon Pin district near the
airport. An officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land. Visibility remained bad on the final approach.
	   Initial reports said one engine had exploded, but police said it
was unclear if the plane had engine trouble before it crashed.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would pay financial indemnity to the
families of anyone who was killed or injured.
	   In the past 15 months there have been two other Airbus crashes,
both in Asia. On Feb. 16, 203 died when an Airbus A300 owned by
China Airlines crashed and burst into flame in a neighborhood near
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek airport. A crash by a Garuda airlines
A300B4 in Indonesia in September 1997 killed 234 people.

Negotiations over disputed border halted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders are
demanding Croatian border police pull out of a disputed border
town, before negotiations to resolve border disputes can continue,
officials in Sarajevo said Friday.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim leader of Bosnia's three-member
joint presidency, said in a statement issued Friday he was halting
border negotiations with Croatia until the Croats pull out of the
border town of Martin Brod.
	   In Zagreb, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said in a
statement Friday he regretted Izetbegovic putting conditions on the
negotiations, but requested an official position from the joint
presidency _ including leaders of Bosnia's Croats and Serbs.
	   ``Croatia has no territorial aspirations towards the friendly
neighboring country Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Granic said.
	   On Thursday, Bosnian radio reported tensions between NATO-led
peace troops deployed in Bosnia and the Croatian border police.
	   NATO dismissed the report saying its patrol only parked cars
facing Croatia and someone was offended because the weapons mounted
on tops of NATO's vehicles were also turned towards the border.
	   Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define the
border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220
kilometers (150 miles) west of Sarajevo.
	   Martin Brod was considered part of Bosnia before the 1991-95
war, but since fighting ended in this area, Croatian border police
have moved deeper into Bosnian territory.
	   Earlier this week, Bosnia's top international official, Carlos
Westendorp, sent a letter to both countries saying he considers the
pre-war border valid until the two sides resolve the problem.

German hostages contact embassy, say one hostage is sick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Germany-Yemen; ADDS one hostage ill

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Four German hostages contacted their embassy
Friday, saying their kidnappers were treating them well but one
hostage was ill, security officials said.
	   The hostages _ three women and a man _ called the German Embassy
through a mobile telephone provided by their kidnappers, said the
officials.
	   It was the embassy's first contact with the hostages since three
gunmen of the Bani Dhabyan tribe abducted them Monday near Serwah,
Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the
capital, San'a.
	   In Bonn, the German Foreign Ministry said Ambassador Helga
Strachwitz talked to one of the female hostages and was told that
all the captives were healthy, supplied with food and being treated
well.
	   But Yemeni officials said a German diplomat had told them one of
the female hostages was sick and the embassy had been asked to be
provide medicine.
	   The officials said the woman's illness appeared to be related to
the weather.
	   The hostages had also asked the embassy to send clothes, food
and an English-Arabic dictionary to help them communicate with
their kidnappers, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The officials confirmed the German Foreign Ministry's remark
that the hostages said they were being treated well.
	   The Yemeni government has said the tribe abducted the Germans to
force it to pay for land on which a dam has been built.
	   A spokesman for the Bani Dhabyan tribe said Thursday that the
government's efforts to mediate the hostages' release had failed
because the authorities have not honored their previous pledges.
	   In April, members of the same tribe released British hostages
after the government promised to build more roads in the area and
return a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized in March.
	   Government sources said Thursday that the authorities would not
review the earlier undertakings until the Germans were released.
	   More than 250 troops in armored vehicles are reported to be
circling the mountainous area where the Germans are thought to be
held.
	   Security forces have detained several members of the Bani
Dhabyan tribe in an apparent bid to gain leverage with the tribal
elders.
	   Kidnappings frequently occur in Yemen, large parts of which are
lawless and controlled by armed tribesmen. The hostages _ often
oil-industry workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated
well and released unhurt.

Kazakstan's grain harvest down 44 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's grain harvest was down 44 percent this
year, to 6.9 million metric tons (7.6 million short tons) _ a drop
the Agriculture Ministry attributed to a severe drought, a news
report said Friday.
	   Kazakstan's grain exports this year are estimated to plummet
even more sharply: down to 600,000 to 700,000 metric tons, from 3.5
million tons in 1997, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The central Asian nation is a leading grain producer among
former Soviet republics. A major buyer of Kazakstan's grain is
Russia, whose 1998 grain harvest was its worst in 40 years.
	   The Kazak Agricultural Ministry blamed a severe drought for the
small grain harvest, Interfax reported.

Court: further detention for ex-Ukrainian PM, bail possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Kuchma, edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By NAOMI KOPPEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko must
remain in jail for another month pending a money-laundering trial
unless he meets conditions for a multimillion-dollar bail next
week, his lawyer said Friday.
	   Paul Gully-Hart said the Geneva criminal court ruled in a
hearing Friday that it will accept the as yet unspecified bail if
Lazarenko, a former prime minister, can prove he got the money
legitimately.
	   Gully-Hart has proposed to the court a bail of 4 million to 5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.8 million-3.6 million).
	   ``The court isn't convinced about the origin of the money so I
am going to do what is necessary,'' said Gully-Hart.
	   Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet issued a statement saying he
planned to question Lazarenko next week on the basis of what he
learned during a trip to Ukraine and on evidence collected in
Geneva.
	   In Kiev, meanwhile, Ukraine's Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko ordered an investigation into allegations that 10
senior government officials were involved in corruption.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said the prosecutor-general's
office was probing the case and would likely ask parliament soon to
lift his immunity from prosecution.
	   ``It is a quite complicated, difficult issue, especially that
(the arrest) is connected to passports of another country,'' Kuchma
said. Lazarenko was carrying a Panamanian passport when he was
arrested.
	   Gully-Hart said his client was ready to cooperate with the Swiss
authorities, but that he didn't want information to be passed on to
the Ukrainian capital Kiev because he believes it would be used
against him for political purposes.
	   ``As far as the Swiss side tells us, Pavel Ivanivich Lazarenko
categorically refuses any contacts with Ukrainian diplomats,''
Kuchma said in remarks carried by the Interfax newsagency.
	   Lazarenko, prime minister from 1996 to 1997, was dismissed by
Kuchma. Critics say he use the office to reap huge profits from the
distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet republic, but he
and his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko maintains Ukrainian officials want to discredit him
before presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even
accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's centrist Hromada party fared well in parliamentary
elections this year and he was widely considered a top contender in
the future presidential race.
	   Lazarenko, detained last week as he entered Switzerland, has
admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but claims he can prove it
has no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko was charged Dec. 4 in connection with a ``relatively
large'' sum of money.
	   Three Swiss cantons (states) are investigating Lazarenko, and
the Geneva investigating judge is in the Ukraine this week.
	   Gully-Hart said he had already made arrangements for Lazarenko
to be interviewed by the Zurich investigating judge next week.
	   ``Mr. Lazarenko must answer the questions as soon as possible,
and I think the situation can be sorted out very quickly,'' he
said.
	   ``I am personally convinced that he has not committed any crime
in Switzerland.''

Global conference on millennium bug opens at UN headquarters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with conference opening &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS ALLBRITTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Cyberspace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The first global conference on the
so-called ``Year 2000 bug'' opened Friday with the acknowledgment
that not all of the computer problems will be fixed on time and
that nations must start planning to contain the damage.
	   Addressing delegates at the United Nations from more than 120
member-states, Under-Secretary-General for Management Joseph E.
Connor said it was impossible to predict the full effect of the
problem, also known by its shorthand Y2K, on the world's computer
systems _ and the global economy that depends on them.
	   ``All we know for sure is the timing,'' he said of the Y2K bug.
``The scope ... is simply daunting.''
	   Also called the millennium bug, the Y2K problem is expected to
occur because some programs, especially older ones, may fail when
the date changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize
only the last two digits of a year, such programs could read the
digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.
	   Assessments of what might happen vary wildly, especially in
developing countries. They tend to use much less sophisticated
technology relying on software that cannot be updated. In the
developed world, troubleshooters are daunted by the sheer number of
computer systems needing to be checked and corrected .
	   Even though there are thousands of programmers around the world
working on Y2K, many experts say there is not enough time to solve
all of the problems. Connor said Friday's meeting would need to
focus on contingency planning to contain the damage from the
inevitable failures.
	   ``We have to get used the fact that some factors will not be
addressed,'' he said. But with proper planning ``we should be able
to limit the millennium bug to an inconvenience rather than a major
disaster.''
	   Conference organizers walked a fine line between grave warnings
and cautious optimism.
	   ``We all know we are in a race against time,'' said Ahmad Kamal,
the Pakistan ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the
U.N. Economic and Social Council's Working Group on Informatics.
``Hopefully, we will reach some conclusions by the end of the day
on how to proceed.''
	   Kamal is the United Nations' point-man for the Y2K problem, and
organized the conference along with John A. Koskinen, chairman of
the United States' presidential council on the Y2K bug.
	   After remarks by Connor the delegates closed the meeting to the
news media. Kamal said barring reporters was aimed at encouraging
frank discussion of countries' preparedness on the problem.
	   David P. Roundy, a commander in the U.S. Coast Guard who is
helping direct the agency's Y2K efforts, said he was glad the world
had finally decided to look at the problem.
	   ``This really needed to happen,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it
really needed to happen a year ago.''
	   There are 386 days remaining until Jan. 1, 2000. Global
estimates for fixing the problem run as high as dlrs 600 billion,
according to the Gartner Group, a technology research firm. The
costs of potential Y2K lawsuits have been estimated as high as dlrs
4.6 trillion.

Turkish Premier announces incentives to boost economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The caretaker government announced a
package of emergency measures on Friday aimed at tackling Turkey's
economic slowdown and lifting manufacturing out of its slump.
	   Turkish exports have been hit by the Russian and Asian financial
crises, which have shrunk their market and cut their profits.
	   Acting Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said dlrs 120 million would
be allocated to the state-owned Turkish Eximbank for credits for
exporters. The bank's capital will also be raised to dlrs 1.25
billion to meet later credit requests, he said.
	   In addition, the government will end a 6 percent levy on
corporate borrowing from foreign banks, and reduce the cost of
other loans.
	   Turkey's business leaders have been especially concerned about
the flagging textile industry and have urged government action.
Yilmaz said Friday that textile manufacturers would get no-interest
loans to buy cotton currently in stock.
	   Turkey's economy and finance ministers are expected to announce
additional measures on Monday.
	   Yilmaz was ousted last month in a no-confidence vote over a
mafia scandal and Turkey now faces a period of uncertainty as the
search for a new government continues.

Russian parliament tries to control inflation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament moved Friday to limit the amount of
money the government can print, hoping to rein in inflation that
now stands at 70 percent this year and is threatening to spiral out
of control.
	   As Russia wrestles with its economic crisis, one of the
trickiest questions is how much money President Boris Yeltsin's
government should inject into the economy. More money helps
stimulate the weak economy, but it also stokes inflation.
	   Since a financial meltdown in August, the government has pumped
billions of rubles into the economy in a bid to revive ailing banks
and pay off state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   Despite these huge obligations, the government may print only
$1.3 billion more in rubles in the final quarter of this year,
according to the bill that won overwhelming approval Friday in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the
ruble,'' which has fallen sharply over the past four months.
	   Many economists had predicted the government would flood the
economy with additional cash. Russia's money supply has gone from
about $8 billion when the crisis struck to more $9.5 billion today,
according to government figures, but the increase is less than many
had forecast.
	   However, the economists say it will be more difficult for Russia
to rein in spending in coming months because it faces ever larger
debts and shrinking revenues.
	   The Duma passed the bill Friday on its second reading. It must
be approved one more time before going to parliament's upper
chamber, where it's also expected to be approved.
	   In another development Friday, the government said the economic
crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets to
private investors. The government had hoped to get $400 million by
auctioning off state property but it earned only $70 million
through October, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Russia's economic downturn has chased away foreign investors,
and the government has decided to put off auctions of two large
companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm. The government still plans to auction off a
2.5 percent stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month.
	   Russia's Cabinet approved a draft budget Thursday and planned to
send it to parliament shortly. In previous years, the two sides had
wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions, and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year,
and has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Countries criticized for human rights
abuses used the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights to defend their records and pledge adherence to the
document's lofty goals.
	   Myanmar, Libya and Iran on Friday joined China, Algeria and
Chile _ whose rights record has come under scrutiny with the recent
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet _ in backing the declaration at a
special General Assembly session to mark the anniversary.
	   The session continued until midnight Thursday and resumed
Friday, with more than half the 126 scheduled speakers still
waiting to deliver their addresses.
	   Late Thursday, Luciano Pavarotti and Wynton Marsalis gave a gala
concert in the assembly hall _ capping a day of appearances by
celebrities such as Michael Douglas and Vanessa Redgrave.
	   ``Our music, jazz music, is the music of freedom,'' Marsalis
told the audience before he began.
	   Speakers at the special session and at a parallel conference in
Paris noted that hundreds of millions of people throughout the
world are still deprived of the most basic political, social and
economic rights _ despite the declaration and the ratification of
60 treaties inspired by it.
	   Among the human rights violations cited: the lack of health care
and education for women and girls in Afghanistan; mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia; the murders and disappearances of
thousands of people under Pinochet.
	   Myanmar's U.N. ambassador, Win Mra, didn't mention Nobel
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi or her party's struggle for democracy and
human rights.
	   He reaffirmed the military government's commitment ``to strive
constructively towards the common standard of achievement set by
the declaration'' but called on the international community ``to
treat human rights in a fair, understanding and constructive
spirit.''
	   Similarly, Libya envoy Abdussalam Sergiwa said his country is
committed to human rights, including the eradication of poverty,
and noted that Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi awards human rights
prizes annually.
	   Sergiwa stressed that Libya is also a victim of ``gross
violations'' of human rights as a result of economic sanctions and
an air embargo, and he urged the United Nations to lift the
coercive measures. The Palestinians are also ``subject to the most
horrendous practices of torture,'' he said.
	   Chile's deputy U.N. ambassador, Juan Larrain, didn't refer to
Pinochet's 1973 coup in his speech, but said his country realized
the fragility of the idea of human rights when its democratic
history was ``interrupted.''
	   ``It was in these difficult circumstances of our life as a
nation that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights took on even
more meaning for the Chilean people, serving as a permanent guide
for those who believed that the dignity and respect for human
beings couldn't be trampled in any way, under any pretext,'' he
said.
	   China and Algeria, meanwhile, defended their human rights
records and stated their adherence to the declaration's values.
	   ``As a country under the rule of law, China gives equal
importance to the individual rights of its people,'' China's U.N.
ambassador, Qin Huasun said. ``It respects and protects civil
rights and political rights and opposes the activities that violate
the legitimate rights of its people.
	   Algeria's ambassador, M. Abdallah Baali, said his country had
seen ``major advancements'' in democracy and the field of human
rights, despite efforts to thwart them _ a reference to a Muslim
insurgency that has wracked the country for seven years.
	   At the start of the session, the General Assembly adopted a
nonbinding resolution reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations
in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small.''
	   Despite such symbolic efforts _ and more concrete ones,
including the creation of international tribunals to prosecute war
crimes suspects _ the world's record in responding to and
preventing gross human rights abuses ``does not give ground for
encouragement,'' said the top U.N. human rights official, Mary
Robinson.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jetliner with 146 people
aboard crashed during heavy rain and burst into flames Friday night
in southern Thailand. Police said there were scores of dead and at
least 43 confirmed survivors.
	   By midnight local time (1700 GMT), police and rescuers
struggling in thigh-high water at the swamp crash site had managed
to pull 26 bodies from the charred wreckage.
	   Two were identified as Westerners. Scores more bodies were still
trapped in the plane, many of them burned beyond recognition,
police said.
	   At least 43 people survived, said police official said who spoke
on condition of anonymity. About 10 of them were Westerners,
probably tourists, and had checked into a local hospital.
	   Police said bodies were still being pulled from the wreckage in
the swamp where Thai Airways Flight TG261 crashed about five
kilometers (three miles) from the Surat Thani airport about 6:45
p.m. local time (1145 GMT).
	   A large number of people appeared to have survived. Thai
television said that one of them was the pilot, but this could not
be independently confirmed.
	   Television footage from the crash site showed at least 12
survivors, all conscious. One was a boy, aged about 10, who had
wounds on his forehead.
	   At least four were rain-soaked, bloodied Westerners, two men and
two women, being led to a pickup truck and driven from the crash
scene.
	   From a hospital bed with blankets up to his neck, Akadek
Pudemha, a flight attendant who survived, described the crash to
Thai television.
	   ``The plane was circling around the airport, going up and
down,'' Akadek said. ``We figured that if we couldn't land on the
third try, we would return to Bangkok. The plane was shaking the
whole time and we crashed on the third try. Then the plane was on
fire and I urged the passengers to jump out. They were reluctant to
jump.''
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in Thai's fleet. Initial reports said one
engine had exploded, but police said it was unclear if the plane
had engine trouble before it crashed.
	   One survivor, popular musician Reungsak Loychusak, said in a
phone interview with a television station from his hospital bed:
``My whole left side is in pain, I can barely move.''
	   Rain was heavy in Surat Thani, 503 kilometers (330 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, and rescuers had difficulty sending
ambulances to the crash site. But the thigh-high water that
hampered rescuers may have cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list nationalities.
Passengers would not have been required to show their passports
when checking in.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban,
speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, said his sister Siriwan
had been on the flight. He had also originally been scheduled to
fly it but canceled to attend a wedding elsewhere.
	   Suthep, who said he did not know the fate of his sister,
expressed dismay that he learned about the crash first from his
relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the airline, which is
mostly owned by the government and which he supervises.
	   Suthep said that two Westerners were among the dead. Television
also reported that Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament
from Surat Thani, died in the crash.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would pay financial indemnity to the
families of anyone who was killed or injured.
	   In the past 15 months there have been two other Airbus crashes,
both in Asia. On Feb. 16, 203 died when an Airbus A300 owned by
China Airlines crashed and burst into flame in a neighborhood near
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek airport. A crash by a Garuda airlines
A300B4 in Indonesia in September 1997 killed 234 people.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders hacked their way
through the jungle of EU budget reform Friday, but made no real
headway at their year-end summit in readying the Union's finances
for enlargement over the next decade.
	   Prospects were better for progress on plans for a common defense
strategy, which would permit Europeans to assume a greater role in
continental defense independent from the United States but still in
the NATO framework.
	   The heart of the talks on the first day of their two-day summit,
however, was how the 15-nation EU will finance its expansion by as
many as a dozen new countries over the next decade. Rich countries
like Germany and Britain already feel they are paying too much into
EU coffers.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country is still
paying the costs of absorbing East Germany, made it clear that
Europe's enlargement problems are not going to be solved with a
German checkbook.
	   ``There ... is a growing understanding that fairness in payments
also has something to do with strengthening European integration,''
Schroeder said in a television interview.
	   The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries -
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
Preliminary talks are also underway with Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and possibly Malta, but they are
considered far from ready.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget already goes
to farm subsidies. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries along with their millions of uneconomical farmers in the
next five or six years would break the budget unless serious
reforms are undertaken.
	   ``There must be compensation for farmers, but they can't be
compensated forever,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman for
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``We'll be focusing on very much
on stabilization of spending.''
	   Germany and the other rich countries want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more. Poorer EU
countries, for their part, don't want to see their subsidies cut in
favor of even poorer new members.
	   ``There is no new money here,'' said German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer. ``The same goes for the budget question. It's not
a matter of finding more money but doing more with the money you
have.''
	   The EU has set itself a March deadline for reaching agreement on
budget reform. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said agreement must be
reached by then.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' he said. ``If this bogs down you'll see a serious crisis
situation, and that you cannot do to people whose expectations of
Europe we have raised.''
	   Spain is leading a group of poorer EU members who want to see
the budget expanded. That group is insisting on an increase that
will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Abel Matutes, Spain's foreign minister, said Madrid is
``radically opposed'' to stabilization.
	   ``The final solution has to respect rigor and solidarity,'' he
said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the general view was,
however, that stabilization of expenditures would win the day.
	   ``There is going to be less money anyway,'' Ahern said. ``This
really opens the real discussions, moving from stating wish-lists
to biting bullets.''
	   Less contentious are plans for a common defense strategy,
launched by France and Britain earlier this month at a mini-summit
in St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The two countries, Western
Europe's only nuclear powers, issued a statement saying the EU
should have the ability to act independently with a ``credible
military force.''
	   Any such military action would come within the framework of
NATO, the French and British leaders insisted, but would allow
Europeans to launch military action without waiting for the United
States to take the lead.
	   The United States says it favors any European action that will
strengthen security on the continent.

	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ Shaun Pollock took five
wickets for 43 runs and South Africa's fast bowlers dismissed the
West Indies for 121 Friday, leaving itself with a 267-run lead
midway through its second innings at the close of play on the
second day of the second test.
	   South Africa was 143 for five wickets when fading light stopped
play, adding to its first innings total of 245.
	   Pollock's heroics and those of David Terbrugge and Allan Donald
put South Africa in good position to take firm control of the
contest.
	   But early hopes were dashed and had to be rebuilt when South
Africa lost its first three second-innings wickets for 11.
	   The West Indies appeared to bowl itself back in the match when
it eliminated Gary Kirsten for two, Hershelle Gibbs for four and
Jacques Kallis for three.
	   When Hansie Cronje (24) and Darryll Cullinan (10) joined their
teammates, South Africa was tetering at 53 for five. But Jonty
Rhodes and Pollock came to the rescue with a 90-run sixth-wicket
partnership and carried South Africa until stumps were drawn.
	   Pollock carried the day early with his five wickets, but he
received help from Terbrugge, playing in his second test, with his
three for 27 and Allan Donald with his two for 33.
	   After finishing its first innings, South Africa snatched four
early wickets to have the West Indies in trouble at 63 for four at
lunch. It was Terbrugge who struck two vital blows just before the
break, bowling opener Stuart Williams and Carl Hooper in successive
overs. Pollock started the rout by dismissing Clayton Lambert for a
duck in his first over. Donald got Brian Lara caught at first slip
by Darryll Cullinan for four.
	   After lunch, it was one-way traffic, except for a breezy innings
of 31 by Nixon McLean, including four towering sixes. He fell to
Donald, and Terbrugge and Pollock finished off the rest between
them.
	   South Africa had resumed their innings with Donald and Pat
Symcox at the wicket, and added just 22 runs to their overnight 223
for eight. Donald finished on 33, to equal his careet test high. He
perished to Hooper's fourth catch in the slips, giving Courtney
Walsh his fourth wicket in the innings.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top prosecutor, the man who was
investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, has
himself been abducted by unidentified assailants, officials said
Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said Tagirov was seized by
attackers, and they speculated that it was the work of an armed
band seeking the release of one of their colleagues from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ had been abducted Oct. 3
by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man, and they claimed he had confessed
to kidnapping the four foreigners. The suspect was identified as
Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching Friday for
additional suspects as well as the the bodies of the four
foreigners.
	   Atgeriyev said he did not place any value in a videotape that
showed one of the four victims saying he was spying for Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been
sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the
breakaway republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the government
got it.
	   Britain's Embassy in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape,
spokesman Michael Haddock said Friday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said the British
government agents could come to Chechnya to investigate the
slaying, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during the war has
been released, capping a year of efforts to free him, ITAR-Tass
said Friday. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996. Only
a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in
captivity.
	   The report gave no details of his release.

	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on
Friday further punished his longtime lieutenant and heir apparent
for defying him, suspending his party membership.
	   The National Front leader also appealed to his party's
rank-and-file not to fall into the ``trap'' his rival, Bruno
Megret, has laid with his call for an urgent congress to decide the
party's future.
	   ``I have never lied to you, never abandoned you, never betrayed
you,'' Le Pen told his followers, in a speech delivered at a news
conference at party headquarters.
	   He asked National Front members across the country not to sign
petitions calling for the congress.
	   Megret, for his part, called Le Pen's decision to kick him out
of the party ``meaningless,'' and repeated his call for Le Pen to
stop his ``purges'' and agree to the congress.
	   ``He must recover his senses,'' Megret said on France Info
radio.
	   Already this week, Le Pen had dismissed Megret from his job as
general delegate, or the No. 2 man in the party widely viewed as
racist and anti-Semitic.
	   On Friday, Le Pen went further, suspending Megret and four
others from the party not for calling the congress, ``but for
disobeying.''
	   ``This is not just about the National Front _ this is about
France,'' Le Pen said. ``France is in danger. Yes, France is in
grave danger.''
	   The bitter leadership feud has split the National Front into two
warring camps.
	   Megret's camp _ which has moved into its own building _ claims
it has almost all the 10,000 signatures necessary to hold a
congress. According to party rules, 20 percent of the 50,000 or so
members is enough.
	   Among the others Le Pen suspended Friday was Serge Martinez, a
former Le Pen loyalist who on Monday made the original call for a
party congress _ and was immediately fired as chief of personnel.
	   Martinez launched a lawsuit against Le Pen Friday for allegedly
blocking the post office box he was using to receive signed
petitions in favor of the congress.
	   Also suspended was Philippe Olivier, the companion of Le Pen's
daughter, Marie-Caroline Le Pen, who has been accused by her father
of betraying him.

authorities had arrested a man, and they claimed he had confessed
to kidnapping the four foreigners. The suspect was identified as
Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were still searching Friday for
additional suspects as well as the the bodies of the four
foreigners.
	   Atgeriyev said he did not place any value in a videotape that
showed one of the four victims saying he was spying for Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been
sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the
breakaway republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the government
got it.
	   Britain's Embassy in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape,
spokesman Michael Haddock said Friday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said the British
government agents could come to Chechnya to investigate the
slaying, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during the war has
been released, capping a year of efforts to free him, ITAR-Tass
said Friday. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996. Only
a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in
captivity.
	   The report gave no details of his release.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin granted Alexander
Solzhenitsyn the country's top cultural honor Friday, the 80th
birthday of Russia's most famous living writer.
	   Solzhenitsyn, a longtime critic of Yeltsin, thanked the
president but turned down the award, said Yeltsin's deputy chief of
staff, Oleg Sysuyev, who met with Solzhenitsyn on Friday to tell
him about the award.
	   ``It is well-known that (Solzhenitsyn's) attitude to authority
has always been complicated; his attitude to awards has always been
complicated,'' Sysuyev told Russia's ORT television station. ``It
is well-known that he regards critically many aspects of our
life.''
	   ``It is his right to accept or decline an award, but the duty of
the president ... is to not fail to honor such an outstanding
person on his birthday.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service before the fatherland and great contributions
to world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   The award, named after a Christian missionary, is one of
Russia's highest honors.
	   Solzhenitsyn accepted another award Friday, the Lomonosov Medal
from the Russian Academy of Sciences on Friday, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   Solzhenitsyn is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet
Union's gulags, or prison camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   On Friday, Solzhenitsyn was expected to attend a play,
``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First
Circle.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work. He had already become
internationally famous when Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974.
He lived a secluded existence in Vermont before returning to Russia
in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet regime.

Study cites more effective contraceptives for lower abortion rate

last week, background, methodology of study, more detail on
contraceptive use by teen-agers, TRIMS; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By VERENA DOBNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. abortion rate reached a two-decade low
largely because of more effective contraceptive methods, including
new techniques such implants and injections, according to a study.
	   But the rate was still higher than that in many other developed
Western countries, according to the study by the Guttmacher
Institute, a research organization that receives some funding from
the pro-family planning group Planned Parenthood.
	   The decline in the U.S. rate was accompanied by a drop in the
number of abortion providers, some of whom may have been frightened
by violence, according to the study.
	   ``When providers face harassment or violence from anti-abortion
groups, and abortion is a very small part of their revenue, it may
not be worth doing it,'' said Stanley Henshaw, author of the
analysis published in the November/December issue of the
institute's journal Family Planning Perspectives.
	   The U.S. abortion rate in 1995 and 1996 among women ages 15-44
was 23 per 1,000, the lowest rate since 1975, when it was 22 per
1,000, according to the study.
	   In its own survey, the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention last week reported the rate for 1995 and 1996 was 20 per
1,000, also the lowest it has found in two decades.
	   Still, the U.S. rate was higher than in many other Western
countries, according to the Guttmacher study. It said the rate in
Sweden in 1995 was 18 per 1,000, Canada 16, Wales and England 15
and The Netherlands six.
	   Henshaw said much of the drop in the U.S. figures reflects more
effective contraceptive methods that are being used by an
increasing number of teen-agers. In 1995, he said, 10 percent of
contraceptive users ages 15-19 were using a birth-control injection
system of synthetic hormones that provides protection for months
and 3 percent used a hormone-release device implanted in the arm.
The implant's effectiveness can last years.
	   These methods weren't available when the institute conducted its
last such survey in 1992.
	   The study was based on a survey of abortion providers. The
researchers attempted to contact every abortion provider in the
United States. Henshaw said he was able to obtain data for about 95
percent of the facilities where abortions are performed.
	   During the four years through 1996, the number of U.S.
facilities providing abortions dropped from 2,380 to 2,042, a
decline of 14 percent. For last year, with data still incomplete,
that trend appears to have continued, according to the study.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A favorite of prime ministers and
paupers, father figure of Hindi poetry Pradeep who wrote more than
1,500 songs, died Friday. He was 83.
	   Pradeep, whose real name was Ramchandra Narayanji Dwivedi, used
only one name. He died Friday at his home in Bombay after an attack
of acute bronchitis, according to United News of India.
	   He was the favorite poet of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
who conferred on him this year India's highest honor for lifetime
contribution to cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Pradeep's death
was a ``personal loss,'' the news agency quoted Vajpayee as saying
Friday.
	   Pradeep's Hindi ballad ``O my countrymen'', written in response
to the Chinese attack on India in 1962, brought tears to the eyes
of the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at a
concert.
	   His soulful film lyrics, many sung by him, stirred the hearts of
millions of others for decades and became classics.
	   Pradeep was deeply influenced by the struggle of Indian
revolutionaries against colonial British rule, and many of his
lyrics were very patriotic. India gained independence from Britain
in 1947.
	   Pradeep once had to go underground to avoid arrest and
punishment after one of his Hindi film songs against colonial
rulers, ``Go Away World, India is Ours,'' became a symbol of
defiance at freedom rallies.
	   Pradeep is survived by his wife and two daughters. A funeral was
planned Saturday in Bombay.

Moscow Mayor imposes Christmas spirit by decree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It's Christmas spirit Moscow-style _ imposed by
decree.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has ordered all stores and restaurants
around the capital to put up Christmas and New Year's decorations,
and has the city's consumer market and services department
enforcing the order, the daily Moscow Times reported Friday.
	   The report didn't say what punishment might be in store for
those who disobey. But hardly anyone has dared to, anyway: Stores
around the city gleam and glitter with Christmas lights and
sparkling garlands.
	   ``Of course, (decoration) is a must for everybody,'' a top city
trade official, Alexander Nikolayev, was quoted as saying.
	   ``It can't be that one store is shining with lights and another
one has gaping black windows.''
	   Luzhkov's office couldn't be reached for comment on the report
Friday evening.
	   Most stores seem to be eagerly embracing the commercial spirit
of Christmas and New Year's, which is widely considered Russia's
biggest holiday.
	   ``It's great for sales. People need to buy gifts even more,''
the marketing manager of Vesna department store, Nadezhda Folomova,
was quoted as saying.
	   Luzhkov didn't mention Hannukah. Russia has seen a rise in
anti-Semitism in recent months, and few stores have put up
decorations for the Jewish holiday.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The organizing committee of the 2004
Olympic filled more key positions, including construction and
planning oversight, officials announced Friday.
	   The appointments could help deflect allegations that the
organizers have been slow in putting together a team to prepare for
the Games.
	   Concern also has been expressed regarding the acquisition of
land for the Olympic Village and competition venues and the
shortage of first class hotel accommodations in the Athens area.
	   But organizers counter that more than two-thirds of the Olympic
facilities are completed and important projects _ including a
subway, new airport and ring road _ are due for completion by 2001.
	   The new appointments include the general director of planning,
Giorgos Benekos, and the general director for construction, Giorgos
Leventis.
	   Leventis worked at U.S.-based Langan Engineering and
Environmental Services and was responsible for such projects as the
dlrs 1 billion expansion of New York Hospital.
	   Benekos was the chief financial officer for Athens' airport.
	   Another former fiscal manager at the airport, Nikos Pefanis, was
named the economic director for the Olympic organizing effort.
	   Other appointments were: Dimitra Boura, communications director;
Spiros Pappas, hospitality director, and Vasilis Kotsovilis, legal
advisor.
	   The managing director of the organizing committee, Costas
Bakouris, hopes to fill the remaining top positions _ including
transportation, technology and marketing directors _ by the end of
the year.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Defender Teddy Lucic, a member of the
1994 World Cup bronze-medal winning Swedish squad, has signed a
free agent contract with Bologna, the news agency TT said Friday.
	   Lucic's contract with former two-time UEFA Cup champion IFK
Goteborg expires Dec. 31. No terms of the contract were announced.
IFK Goteborg will receive no compensation.
	   Lucic will join two former IFK Goteborg stars, striker Kennet
Andersson and midfielder Klas Ingesson, on the Italian Serie A
team. They also played in the World Cup in the United States.
	   ``That's definitely a big advantage to play with them again,''
Lucic said.
	   Lucic's father is Croatian and his mother Finnish. He became a
Swedish citizen in 1991.
	   ``He called this morning and told us that he had signed a
contract,'' Goteborg's vice president Thomas Gertmo said. ``We have
been negotiating with him throughout the year, but we couldn't
reach an agreement.''

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ It's an ice place, but you
wouldn't want to live there.
	   A Dutch sea captain's ominous descriptions of a gigantic icy
land mass four centuries ago have some scholars convinced that he's
the man who really discovered Antarctica, 221 years before the
Russian and the Englishman credited with the discovery.
	   Notes penned in 1622 by the Amsterdam merchant who bankrolled
the voyage mention how Dirck Gerritsz described seeing the land
mass in 1599, a year after he sailed from Rotterdam, Dr. Wim
Ligtendag of Groningen University's Arctic Center said Friday.
	   The merchant, Isaac Le Maire, wrote how Gerritsz's weatherbeaten
ship, The Flying Heart, had been driven far south of Cape Horn by a
strong north wind that had blown for weeks.

Kosovo Albanians vow to rebuild from the ruins

	   LODJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Overcoming fears of more violence,
Kosovo Albanians are cautiously returning in greater numbers to
damaged or abandoned homes in the war-scarred Serbian province.
	   But for a group of refugees who came back Friday to begin
resettling their nearly flattened village, home no longer exists.
	   Likely nowhere in Kosovo does a more shocking scene of
destruction exist than the one that greeted 15 ethnic Albanians who
rode back into this western village on the back of a truck,
escorted by humanitarian aid workers.
	   ``This is the most difficult moment of my life,'' said
56-year-old Hegrige Morina, her voice quavering as she gazed with
moist eyes at the stone skeleton of the house where she was born.
	   Shelled, bombed, mortared, looted, burned and bulldozed into
near-oblivion by Serbian and Yugoslav forces on a vengeance spree
last summer, Lodja _ once a prosperous farming village _ looks like
old footage of Hiroshima.
	   Virtually the only buildings left fully standing from a village
of population 2,800 are a half-dozen on the edge of town which
belonged to non-Albanians.
	   The ruins are graphic testimony to the ethnic hatreds that tore
Kosovo apart _ but even this breathtaking level of destruction
can't extinguish Albanians' fierce will to stay.
	   After touring the devastation, the shocked refugees promptly
went about cleaning up the shattered but intact school so eight
displaced families can move into it.
	   ``They're extremely brave,'' said Morgan Morris, office head in
neighboring Pec for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. The agency is assisting in the resettlement along with
diplomatic observers and the Swiss agency Medair.
	   ``They wanted to come back,'' she said. ``They were just too
scared to do it without us.''
	   Across Kosovo, other villages are slowly starting to revive
after a quarter-million or more people fled during seven months of
fighting between Serb forces and separatist rebels that killed
hundreds.
	   In nearby Junik on the Albanian border, an estimated 1,300
ethnic Albanians have come back in the last two weeks from
neighboring Montenegro, Albania or villages in Kosovo.
	   Some are returning out of desperation after suffering appalling
conditions elsewhere _ miserable or unwelcome after months packed
into other homes, or without sufficient protection from the harsh
Balkan winter.
	   But for many, like those in Lodja, the question was not whether
to reclaim their village but when.
	   ``It's our dream to return here, all of us,'' said Tenzile
Ademi, a 29-year-old teacher.
	   Lodja, the wealthiest village around, boasted huge homes made of
brick or stone with intricate designs on a rich agricultural plain
that abuts towering, snowcapped mountains.
	   Its woes began after Kosovo Liberation Army rebels found it a
welcome haven for their fight against Serb forces on an offensive
against separatists. The KLA tortured and killed two Serb policemen
and hung their bodies from a tree, according to diplomats citing
photographs of the victims, and that brought down the wrath of
Yugoslav and Serb planes, tanks and shells in an all-out blitz in
August.
	   Now cabbages rot in the fields and apples lie frozen on the
ground in the rubble that was a village. Taunting Serb graffiti
welcomes arrivals to ``Cafe Leveled Lodja'' at the edge of town.
	   The returnees trudged numbly through the wreckage, some crying,
others blinking in disbelief.
	   Nimon Morina, 75, a cousin of Hegrige, pointed his cane in
anguish to a leveled home _ one of six he owned, inhabited by his
six sons.
	   ``This was my oldest house. It was built in 1872 by my
great-grandfather,'' he said, his voice breaking.
	   His agonizing walk continued _ he must see all the damage.
	   ``I remember World War II, and even the Nazis didn't destroy
mosques and medical clinics,''
	   Still, he added later, he must return.
	   ``I was born here. It was my home and I have to come back,'' he
declared. ``I would like to die in my own house.''
	   A bittersweet moment brings smiles to the refugees' faces _
against all odds, one of the men's dogs is sitting faithfully on
the desolate lawn next to his wrecked house.
	   Mahmut Morina, 63, who also is a cousin of Hegrige and Nimon,
walked joyfully toward his beloved Cub, but the dog was jittery and
refused to let him get close.
	   ``Take care of my house for me. I'll be back!'' Morina shouted
to him cheerfully.
	   After walking away he stopped suddenly, wiping away tears.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist strongman Todor Zhivkov, was re-elected Friday as head of
the Bulgaria soccer federation.
	   Slavkov defeated Sofia's popular mayor, Stefan Sofiyanski,
283-128 in a ballot at a Bulgarian Football Union congress Friday.
	   Despite increasing criticism following Bulgaria's poor
performance at the World Cup finals in France last July, Slavkov _
who was married to Zhivkov's late daughter Lyudmila _ still had
enough supporters in the soccer establishment to retain his post.
He also heads his country's Olympic committee.
	   Bulgaria's team of aging stars and inexperienced youngsters has
been disappointing since it finished fourth at the World Cup in
1994 by defeating former world champions Germany and Argentina.
	   The federation is currently locked in a legal battle with the
government committee on sports to repeal a September ban that
prohibited it from exercising athority over the Bulgarian league.
The ban came as a result of a doping scandal that the committee
blamed the federation of mishandling.
	   In June, the BFU suspended Ilia Gruev from league play for three
months after he tested positive for a banned substance in April.
The committee says the punishment was delayed and insufficient.
	   Sofiyanski has pledged to help overcome the setback in Bulgarian
soccer and improved strained relations between the BFU and the
government.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss court on Friday cleared alleged Russian
mafia boss Sergei Mikhailov of charges that he belonged to an
illegal organization.
	   The outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who had said
that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and should be
jailed. He faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   The defense had demanded his acquittal.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago.

Pinochet says he's innocent, expresses pain for victims in a
</HEADLINE>
letter &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ In a so-called letter to Chileans, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet on Friday declared himself ``absolutely innocent''
of all the accusations against him, and expressed ``sincere pain
for all the Chileans who lost their lives'' during his regime.
	   In the 13-page letter, sent from London, where he is under house
arrest, and released by his supporters in Chile, Pinochet called
his arrest in London and threat of extradition to Spain ``the most
difficult and unjust experience in my life.''
	   He proclaimed he was ``absolutely innocent of all the crimes and
all the facts of which I am accused'' and charged he was ``the
victim of a cowardly political-judicial plot.''
	   The letter was read at the Pinochet Foundation as the
83-year-old former dictator went before a British court, his first
public appearance since his arrest almost two months ago.
	   Pinochet's appearance was broadcast live on Chilean television
and followed closely both by foes and supporters of the former
ruler.
	   ``I have never desired death to anybody and I feel a sincere
pain for all Chileans who have lost their lives during these
years,'' Pinochet wrote.
	   At the Pinochet Foundation, dozens of supporters followed the
transmissions in an atmosphere of frustration and rage.
	   ``Traitors, communists, rats,'' shouted a woman who identified
herself only as Patricia when Chilean exiles appeared on screen
holding anti-Pinochet banners.
	   When pro-Pinochet demonstrators in London appeared, most with
Chilean flags, there was a round of applause and cheer.
	   Across town, at the headquarters of an association of relatives
of people who disappeared under Pinochet, many opponents also
expressed frustration.
	   ``He went to court, accompanied by relatives, in an opportunity
that was denied to our relative,'' associastion vice president
Viviana Diaz said. ``Our loved ones were tortured instead of being
taken to court.''
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet in 1990, more than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared
for political reasons under his regime.
	   He referred to violence and deaths during his regime: ``Those
who think or claim that pain for the blood shed in our fatherland
is the monopoly of one side, are wrong.''
	   But, Pinochet claimed, many soldiers and police were also
killed, and many civilians were the victims of terrorism.
	   He said he did not seek power and that the military toppled the
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende in 1973 only
because ``everything had been destroyed.''
	   He repeated his strong criticism of communism, which he called
``an anti-religion'' and claimed his regime accomplished ``the
exploit of defeating that empire of lie and hatred.''

Wife of U.N. diplomat murdered in Chile, says Pinochet should face

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Augusto Pinochet must face up to what he
did during his 17-year dictatorship in Chile, the widow of one of
his best known alleged victims said Friday after watching
television coverage of him being driven to a London court.
	   ``When people have power over a society they should take
responsibility for the consequences of their power,'' said Laura
Gonzalez, whose Spanish husband, a United Nations official, was
allegedly killed by Gen. Pinochet's secret police, known as the
DINA.
	   As Gonzalez told how her husband Carmelo Soria was kidnapped,
tortured and murdered in 1976, Pinochet was in a London court being
informed of Spain's petition to extradite him for crimes committed
during his 1973-1990 regime.
	   ``I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any other court but one
in my country to try me against the lies of Spain,'' the former
Chilean dictator told the court.
	   After his appearance, the 83-year-old general was taken back to
the English countryside mansion where he is under house arrest
pending the extradition proceedings.
	   Pinochet has been under guard since Oct. 16 at the instigation
of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that
extradition proceedings could move forward, and on Thursday, Garzon
completed the indictment of Pinochet on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   ``Pinochet is being offered a fair trial, something that he
never gave to his victims,'' Gonzalez said.
	   ``He is being held in good conditions, and that's the way it
should be. They are conditions that are not at all comparable to
DINA's clandestine jails,'' she added.
	   Gonzalez, a Chilean, lost her job as a medical doctor for
political reasons soon after Pinochet installed a virulently
anti-Communist regime by overthrowing the elected Marxist President
Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup. She left Chile in 1978 and has
lived in Spain ever since, visiting Chile where her three grown
children now live.
	   ``For us this judicial process is hugely important because it is
breaking down judicial barriers...Spain, or any other country, has
the right to try these crimes that offended all humanity,'' she
said.
	   Gonzalez said she had given up hope that the Chilean courts
would ever give her, or any other victim's case a fair hearing.
	   The body of her husband, a 54-year-old diplomat for the U.N.
Economic Commission for Latin America, was found inside his car
after it plunged into a canal in a Santiago suburb in 1976.
Garzon's evidence alleges that DINA agents made the killing look
like a car accident.
	   The evidence alleges that Soria was targeted because he was
believed to have helped several people leave Chile to escape
persecution by the regime. The case went to court twice, but was
blocked by the amnesty law passed by Pinochet to protect himself
and his subordinates from trial.
	   Gonzalez said the failure of her husband's case _ despite ample
evidence, his Spanish nationality and status as a U.N. official
with diplomatic immunity _ demonstrates how impossible it is for
just ordinary Chileans to get justice in Chilean courts.
	   Garzon's 285-page indictment holds Pinochet's regime responsible
for at least 3,000 cases of disappearance and murder, possibly up
to 5,000. The document also mentions 100,000 people forced into
exile and 50,000 people tortured.
	   For Gonzalez, the attempt to bring Pinochet to trial affords
Chile a chance to ``come to terms with its past, its brutal past,
for a more dignified future.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jetliner carrying 146
people crashed into a swamp in southern Thailand Friday as it tried
to land in a heavy rain. Police said scores of people were killed
but at least 43 survived.
	   By midnight local time (1700 GMT), police and rescuers
struggling in thigh-high water had managed to pull 26 bodies from
the charred wreckage.
	   Two were identified as Westerners. Scores more bodies were still
trapped in the plane, many of them burned beyond recognition,
police said.
	   At least 43 people survived, said police official said who spoke
on condition of anonymity. About 10 of them were Westerners,
probably tourists, and had checked into a local hospital.
	   Police said bodies were still being pulled from the wreckage in
the swamp where Thai Airways Flight TG261 crashed about 6:45 (1145
GMT) five kilometers (three miles) from the airport in Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for nearby vacation resorts.
	   Rain was heavy in Surat Thani, 503 kilometers (330 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, and rescuers had difficulty sending
ambulances to the crash site. But the thigh-high water that
hampered rescuers may have cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land. Visibility remained bad on the final approach.
	   Flight attendant Akadek Pudemha described the crash to Thai
television from his hospital bed.
	   ``The plane was circling around the airport, going up and
down,'' Akadek said. ``We figured that if we couldn't land on the
third try, we would return to Bangkok. The plane was shaking the
whole time and we crashed on the third try. Then the plane was on
fire and I urged the passengers to jump out. They were reluctant to
jump.''
	   One of the survivors shown on television was a boy, about 10,
who had wounds on his forehead. Another survivor, popular musician
Reungsak Loychusak, told a television station from his hospital
bed: ``My whole left side is in pain, I can barely move.''
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list the passengers'
nationalities.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in the airline's fleet.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told
reporters in Bangkok that his sister Siriwan had been on the
flight, and he had been scheduled to take it until he canceled at
the last minute.
	   Suthep, who did not know the condition of his sister, expressed
dismay that he learned about the crash first from relatives in
Surat Thani, rather than from the mostly government-owned airline,
which he supervises.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would compensate the families of anyone
who was killed or injured.
	   In the past 15 months, there have been two other Airbus crashes,
both in Asia.
	   On Feb. 16, 203 died when an Airbus A300 owned by China Airlines
crashed and burst into flame in a neighborhood near Taiwan's Chiang
Kai-shek airport. Taiwan's government ordered the airline's nine
remaining planes of the same type temporarily grounded.
	   A crash by a Garuda airlines A300B4 in Indonesia in September
1997 killed 234 people. The plane slammed into a jungle slope while
trying to land in a thick smog.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out
searches again Friday, despite a dispute with the authorities over
entry to an office of the ruling party.
	   Three inspection teams drove out of the U.N. headquarters on
Baghdad's outskirts in white, four-wheel drive vehicles adorned
with the U.N. logo.
	   Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring
Directorate, said the three teams ``carried out 14 surprise visits
to sites,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported Friday night.
	   Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said there were fewer
inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim sabbath. But, she
added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of work''
and would conduct searches through the weekend.
	   This week's searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
work last month.
	   Visiting teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct
the more intrusive searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath Party, to which a
team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday.
	   A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco
building, has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try
to return. The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is
private property and contains no materials wanted by the
inspectors.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. Richard
Butler, the chief weapons inspector, has said the office in the
neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials of significance.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Iraq Friday
that if it did not honor its promise to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors, ``the military option remains on the table.''
	   But Albright told reporters in Washington that the United States
was reserving judgment until Butler files his report on Iraqi
cooperation to the U.N. secretary general early next week.
	   In a dispute that ended better on Thursday, U.N. inspectors
tried to search what Iraqis called a private home, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported. The Iraqis insisted, however, that the
inspectors first get permission from the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, the agency said, quoting
Gen. Amin of the monitoring directorate.
	   Eight U.N. teams checked 12 sites on Thursday, with two teams
using helicopters, Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors resumed work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus after Iraq banned them from visiting any new
suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed down on Nov. 14 and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes.
	   The United States has said the disputes over the inspections
could lead it to attack Iraqi without warning.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders hacked their way
through the jungle of EU budget reform Friday, but made no real
headway at their year-end summit in readying EU finances for
absorbing up to 12 new members.
	   Prospects were better for progress on plans for a common defense
strategy, which would permit Europeans to assume a greater role in
continental defense independent from the United States but still in
the NATO framework.
	   The heart of the talks on the first day of their two-day summit,
however, was how the 15-nation EU will finance its expansion by as
many as a dozen new countries over the next decade. Rich countries
like Germany and Britain already feel they are paying too much into
EU coffers.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country is still
paying the costs of absorbing East Germany, made it clear that
Europe's enlargement problems are not going to be solved with a
German checkbook.
	   ``There ... is a growing understanding that fairness in payments
also has something to do with strengthening European integration,''
Schroeder said in a television interview.
	   The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries -
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
Preliminary talks are also underway with Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and possibly Malta, but they are
considered far from ready.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget already goes
to farm subsidies and aid to poor regions. Taking on half a dozen
poor East European countries along with their millions of
uneconomical farmers in the next five or six years would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   ``There must be compensation for farmers, but they can't be
compensated forever,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman for
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``We'll be focusing on very much
on stabilization of spending.''
	   Germany and the other rich countries want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more. Poorer EU
countries, for their part, don't want to see their subsidies cut in
favor of even poorer new members.
	   ``There is no new money here,'' said German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer. ``The same goes for the budget question. It's not
a matter of finding more money but doing more with the money you
have.''
	   The EU has set itself a March deadline for reaching agreement on
budget reform. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said agreement must be
reached by then.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' he said. ``If this bogs down you'll see a serious crisis
situation, and that you cannot do to people whose expectations of
Europe we have raised.''
	   Spain is leading a group of poorer EU members who want to see
the budget expanded. That group is insisting on an increase that
will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   Abel Matutes, Spain's foreign minister, said Madrid is
``radically opposed'' to stabilization.
	   ``The final solution has to respect rigor and solidarity,'' he
said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the general view was,
however, that stabilization of expenditures would win the day.
	   ``There is going to be less money anyway,'' Ahern said. ``This
really opens the real discussions, moving from stating wish-lists
to biting bullets.''
	   Less contentious are plans for a common defense strategy,
launched by France and Britain earlier this month at a mini-summit
in St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The two countries, Western
Europe's only nuclear powers, issued a statement saying the EU
should have the ability to act independently with a ``credible
military force.''
	   Any such military action would come within the framework of
NATO, the French and British leaders insisted, but would allow
Europeans to launch military action without waiting for the United
States to take the lead.
	   The United States says it favors any European action that will
strengthen security on the continent.

Belarus, Ukraine sign 10-year economic pact

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The presidents of Belarus and Ukraine signed a
treaty Friday on economic cooperation for the next 10 years and
discussed ways of lessening the impact of Russia's economic crisis
on their countries.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Belarusian President
Alexander Lukashenko did not settle differences over Ukraine's dlrs
170-200 million debt to Belarus. They said they plan to work those
out in February.
	   At meetings in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, the presidents
signed a treaty on economic cooperation in various sectors,
including trade, energy and agriculture, through 2008.
	   Many of the products traded between the two countries are made
from Russian raw materials, which have been hurt by Russia's latest
economic troubles.
	   ``Leonid Danilovich (Kuchma) and myself believe that relations
between Ukraine and Belarus directly depend on stability in
Russia,'' Lukashenko said after Friday's meetings.
	   Lukashenko stressed the need for coordinated their efforts to
lessen the effects of the Russian crisis on Ukraine and Belarus.

Hugo Chavez says his coup attempt was legitimate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said
Friday his 1992 attempt to overthrow the government was ``without a
doubt legitimate.''
	   ``Here we are standing tall, all of us vindicated,'' Chavez
declared in a speech at the National Electoral Council after he was
officially declared president-elect.
	   Chavez won the presidency by a landslide last Sunday. His
Patriotic Pole coalition, which includes many people who helped
Chavez stage his coup attempt, won a plurality of Congress in
regional elections last month.
	   The elections were a devastating blow to the political and
economic establishment that has ruled Venezuela during 40 years of
democracy. Chavez, the first person from outside the old-style
party elite to become president, rode a wave of public anger over
poverty and corruption.
	   ``A people with hunger does not live in democracy,'' he said,
defending his attempted coup.
	   He offered few details about what he plans to do as president,
except to say he will hold a national referendum in February to
install a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.
	   After his speech at the electoral council, he walked outside and
gave another speech to thousands of cheering supporters. Earlier,
he laid a wreath at the tomb of Simon Bolivar, the South American
liberation hero.
	   Chavez will take office Feb. 2 for a five-year term. He replaces
82-year-old President Rafael Caldera, who released Chavez from
prison in 1994.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Eight-year-old Francisco Martinez remembers
the Christmases of years past. There would be a big dinner, a
Christmas tree and _ best of all _ presents beneath it.
	   This year he doesn't expect any gifts. He doesn't expect much of
a dinner. He certainly doesn't expect a tree. His family hasn't
celebrated their usual Christmas since 1995, when an economic
meltdown dumped it and most of Mexico's middle-class into poverty.
	   ``Santa Claus no longer exists for most Mexicans,'' Francisco's
grandmother Dolores said. ``We no longer even mention him to
Francisco. He knows how things really are.''
	   Bad as things are, most Mexicans fear they will get worse if
President Ernesto Zedillo's 1999 budget proposal is approved.
Congress has until Tuesday to modify and pass a budget that even in
the best-case scenario will be the most austere in modern history.
	   The budget crunch comes from the multibillion-dollar losses
caused by a record fall in oil prices. Oil exports represent
one-third of all government income.
	   It is compounded by a dlrs 67 billion bailout of private banks
that most Mexicans see as benefiting wealthy bankers with
government ties at the expense of poor taxpayers.
	   Opposition lawmakers want the federal government to tighten its
belt, getting rid of obscure agencies and reducing the salaries and
perks of top officials.
	   Zedillo, in turn, has proposed higher taxes, including an extra
2 percent on top of the 15 percent sales tax, a new 15 percent
surcharge on phone service and a 31 percent increase in gasoline
prices.
	   Prices for staples such as tortillas and busfare have risen
sharply, while the minimum wage _ around dlrs 3.40 a day _ has
failed to keep pace.
	   ``We used to eat tortillas and beans,'' Martinez said. ``Now
we're down to tortillas with hot sauce.''
	   Martinez, her son and daughter-in-law and Francisco live in a
middle-class house with few possessions inside in the Gulf of
Mexico port of Tampico, 210 miles (335 kilometers) northeast of
Mexico City.
	   Together, the family makes about 1000 pesos (dlrs 100 a month),
making the 1 million pesos (dlrs 100,000) they owe on the house
seem unreachable. The debt built up as interest rates jumped to
more than 100 percent a year in the 1995 economic crisis. They now
hover around 35 percent.
	   Until now, the family had suffered silently. But the new budget
proposals were too much.
	   So Martinez, her daughter-in-law Juanita and Francisco got on a
bus to the capital, to join thousands of protesters who have been
camping under plastic sheeting and in buses outside Mexico's
Congress since Tuesday to plead for changes in Zedillo's budget.
	   The protest was organized by El Barzon, a nationwide group of
middle-class Mexicans driven to bankruptcy by soaring interest
rates after the 1994-95 crisis that marked the beginning of
Zedillo's administration.
	   El Barzon's protests have been getting bigger and louder as
Mexicans take to the streets.
	   The protesters ``represent the nationwide irritation against
Zedillo's economic policy,'' said Rep. Carlos Heredia of the
left-center Democratic Revolution Party. He donated dlrs 120 on
Thursday to help feed the Martinez family and other protesters from
his native Tampico.
	   Outraged by the bailout plan, the right-center National Action
Party even proposed a constitutional amendment that would create a
presidential impeachment law.
	   The Barzon protesters say they'll camp outside Congress until
legislators pass the 1999 budget, which will contain provisions on
the bank bailout and a program to help small- and medium-sized
debtors.
	   For the Martinez family, any kind of relief would represent a
big break.
	   And a chance to buy Francisco some new toys.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians were killed
Friday in central Kosovo, Serb sources reported amid Albanian
accusations that Serbian authorities are reneging on international
commitments.
	   The three Albanians _ all known to be loyal to the Serbian
regime _ were shot while repairing a power station near the central
town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media Center in the provincial
capital Pristina said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The latest incident further risking the fragile peace in the
strife-torn Serb province came as Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian
party accused Serbian authorities of reneging on international
commitments by blocking the first European probe into atrocities
here.
	   ``The Belgrade regime is in clear breach of its international
obligations,'' said Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic
League of Kosovo.
	   On Thursday, Serb police using armored vehicles prevented a team
of Finnish forensic experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic
Albanians allegedly massacred at a site in central Kosovo,
insisting they accompany the Finnish group. Gashi said this was
``proof that the Serbian regime is obstructing an international
impartial investigation.''
	   Serbs rejected the accusations, saying the Finns had earlier
agreed to visit the site only in presence of Serb authorities.
	   The Finnish team, working under a Euopean Union mandate, was to
begin exhumations at the site _ the first in a series of six Kosovo
locations to which Belgrade had previously granted access.
	   Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said Friday his
group was aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians.
	   ``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities
in trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' Lahelma said.
Lahelma did not know when his team would begin exhumations.
	   Gashi said if the probe is to include Serb officials, (ethnic)
Albanian experts should also be present _ a demand the Serbs flat
out refuse.
	   ``There is a legally established court of law and the state's
institutions are the only ones authorized to carry out such
investigations,'' Serbian Judge Danica Marinkovic said in response.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and up to 300,000 forced
from their homes in Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia dominated
by ethnic Albanians. Serbia, together with Montenegro comprises
Yugoslavia.
	   Also Friday, the Albanian side accused the Serbs of preparing
new offensives, claiming they had brought in new military and
police reinforcements in the past week.
	   Meanwhile, the Contact Group of nations concerned with the
Balkans said in Paris Friday ``time was running out'' and urged
direct talks between the two sides. So far U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill has been shuttling between the two.
	   On Friday, Hill said that he will ``intensify'' his efforts to
find a peaceful solution for the Serbian province. He indirectly
denied reports that he will no longer shuttle between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, but added there should be ``less traveling and
more negotiating,'' in the future, independent B 92 radio reported.

Court clears Mikhailov of main charge

 &UR; Eds: ADDS verdict on second charge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss court on Friday cleared a wealthy Russian
businessman and alleged mafia boss, Sergei Mikhailov, of charges
that he belonged to an illegal organization.
	   The outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who had said
that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and should be
jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   The defense had demanded his acquittal.
	   The six-man jury found there was insufficient evidence to prove
the charges. The surprise decision came after day-long
deliberations. The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented
security, with some of the 90 witnesses under police protection.
	   Mikhailov was also cleared of charges that he forged documents.
He was found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated strict
Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying a villa
near Geneva.
	   Defense lawyer Xavier Magnee welcomed the verdict.
	   ``A fair trial is the best protect for all innocent people,'' he
said outside the courtroom.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The former New South Wales state
minister responsible for Sydney's Olympic bid says he was asked to
offer bribes in exchange for votes for Sydney's bid during the
competition to host the 2000 Games, the Sydney Morning Herald said
Saturday.
	   The revelations by Bruce Baird, who is now a federal member of
Parliament, came as the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
announced an inquiry into what a senior IOC member described as
``bribes'' paid to some African IOC members by the Salt Lake City
bid committee which won the rights to host the Winter Games in
2002, the newspaper said.
	   The Salt Lake City Organizing Committee controversy centers on
the payment of nearly 400,000 US dlrs in scholarships to relatives
of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee for the 2002 games.
	   The Herald quoted Baird as saying he was not surprised by these
revelations.
	   ``There was an approach to me, from a third party, when I was in
Acapulco, who said he could secure some African votes,'' Baird
said.
	   ``I said, `This is not what the Sydney bid is all about', and he
said, `You may well lose', and I said: `I would prefer Sydney lost
than won on those grounds','' the paper quoted Baird as saying.
	   Baird said the ``third party'' was not an IOC member and he
could not be certain the approach was made with the support of any
IOC members.

Blast at firework factory in Brazil kills 17 and injures 45
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ An explosion destroyed an illegal
firework factory in northeastern Brazil on Friday, killing 17
people and injuring 45, police said.
	   ``There were a lot of people, many of them women, working in the
building when the explosion happened,'' police officer Paulo
Raimundo de Souza said by telephone. ``It seems like they had been
working flat-out because there is a big demand for fireworks at
this time of year with New Year's Eve coming up shortly.''
	   The explosion happened at 11:30 a.m. on the outskirts of the
town of Santo Antonio de Jesus, about 1,050 miles (1,700 kms)
northeast of Rio, he said.
	   Nine of the dead were children who had been working in the
factory, reported TV Globo.
	   The cause of the explosion was unclear, but it appears to have
been an accident, Souza said. It happened in a house which was
being used as a factory.
	   The blast also badly damaged three nearby houses, he added.
	   Firefighters continued to search for people in the burned
remains of the factory, said Souza. The injured were being treated
at different hospitals in the region.
	   The town which is in the state of Bahia has a population of
about 80,000 people.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin granted Alexander
Solzhenitsyn the country's top cultural honor Friday, the 80th
birthday of Russia's most famous living writer _ and Solzhenitsyn
promptly rejected it.
	   Solzhenitsyn, a longtime critic of Yeltsin, thanked the
president but said: ``In today's conditions, when people are
starving and striking just to get their wages, I cannot accept this
award.
	   ``Maybe, maybe, in a long, long time, when Russia's overcomes
its insurmountable problems, my sons may be able to accept such an
award,'' he said at a Moscow performance of the play ``Sharashka,''
based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First Circle.''
	   Oleg Sysuyev, who met with Solzhenitsyn on Friday to tell him
about the award, said, ``It is well-known that (Solzhenitsyn's)
attitude to authority has always been complicated, his attitude to
awards has always been complicated. It is well-known that he
regards critically many aspects of our life.''
	   Speaking to Russia's ORT television station, Sysuyev said, ``It
is his right to accept or decline an award, but the duty of the
president ... is to not fail to honor such an outstanding person on
his birthday.''
	   Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service before the fatherland and great contributions
to world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   The award, named after a Christian missionary, is one of
Russia's highest honors.
	   Solzhenitsyn did not turn down another award he was granted
Friday, the Lomonosov Medal from the Russian Academy of Sciences on
Friday, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Solzhenitsyn is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet
Union's gulags, or prison camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work. He had already become
internationally famous when Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974.
He lived a secluded existence in Vermont before returning to Russia
in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet regime.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seated dour-faced in a wheelchair, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet on Friday made his first public appearance since his
arrest on a Spanish extradition warrant and declared no foreign
court has jurisdiction to try him ``against all the lies of
Spain.''
	   Afterward, the former Chilean dictator, facing charges of
genocide and torture, was whisked from a heavily guarded court in
southeast London, past rival groups of shouting protesters and
supporters.
	   He returned to his rented English country mansion under new bail
conditions _ now, he can use the garden.
	   The 83-year-old general, wearing a pinstriped brown suit, looked
grimly disapproving during most of the 30-minute hearing at the
high-security Belmarsh Magistrate's Court.
	   ``With respect to your honor, I don't recognize the jurisdiction
of any other court but in my country to try me against all the lies
of Spain,'' he said, reading huskily in Spanish from a card, as an
interpreter translated into English.
	   He waved his hand and added, ``That is all I want to say.''
	   It was the first time Pinochet has been seen in public since
London police arrested him Oct. 16 in a hospital bed while he was
recuperating from back surgery.
	   Magistrate Graham Parkinson set a Jan. 18 hearing date for the
formal start of proceedings to extradite Pinochet to Spain, which
wants to try him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture
committed by his security forces during his 1973-90 rule.
	   But legal wrangling could go on for months, or even longer.
	   The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, will begin hearing
next Tuesday a highly unusual application to set aside the court's
own 3-2 ruling on Nov. 25 that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest
under British law.
	   Pinochet's lawyers have complained that one of the judges is
chairman of the fundraising arm of Amnesty International, the
British-based human rights group prominent in the long campaign to
put their client on trial.
	   Amnesty International says Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann was not
involved in the campaign.
	   Outside the Belmarsh court, hundreds of supporters chanted
``Free Pinochet!,'' many wearing embroidered headbands and
``Pinochet I Love You _ Chile'' vests, and waving Chilean flags.
	   Leaning across police barriers, they formed a shouting gauntlet
as opponents showed up to join protesters waving placards that
declared ``Don't let this butcher go.''
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a violent coup.
But Chile's government wants Pinochet freed, partly because the
crisis could threaten its new democracy founded on compromise.
	   Pinochet's face was hidden by a coat hung across a window of the
van that brought him to the courthouse in a five-vehicle police
convoy.
	   A helicopter circled overhead and hundreds of police in
bulletproof vests guarded every door. In the public gallery, 12
members of the public _ six opponents, six supporters _ were joined
by a dozen policemen.
	   At the end of the hearing, Pinochet smiled and shook hands with
several of the Chilean diplomats and right-wing Chilean senators
who had sat behind his wheelchair.
	   James Lewis, the British lawyer representing the Spanish
government, said Spain had no objection to altering bail conditions
``to allow him to go into the garden.''
	   But Pinochet still must be under British police guard at all
times _ inside or outside the mansion at Wentworth, 20 miles (30
kms) west of London. Pinochet moved there Dec. 1 from a north
London hospital.
	   Expected only to give his name in court, Pinochet added a string
of titles _ ``I was the commander in chief of the army, the captain
general of Chile, president of the republic and, actually, I am at
the moment a senator of the republic.''
	   Outside, 33-year-old Alex Godoy, whose parents fled to Britain
from Chile in the Pinochet years, kept holding her banner.
	   ``Today is a very humiliating day for him _ he is a very proud
man,'' she said.

Auschwitz museum council urges removal of crosses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Auschwitz museum's advisory council
urged Poland's government Friday to remove crosses planted this
year by conservative Catholics near the former Nazi death camp.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the International Council of the
Auschwitz Museum condemned ``actions by irresponsible people'' who
``use religious symbols to aggravate tensions and conflicts.''
	   More than 200 small wooden crosses have been placed around an
eight-meter- (26-foot-) tall papal cross that has stood since 1988
at a site adjacent to Auschwitz where Nazis murdered 152 Polish
resistors.
	   Jews have long objected to the presence of the larger cross,
visible inside the camp, as an insult to the memory of Jews killed
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations around the world renewed their
outrage after the smaller crosses began appearing this summer,
planted by Roman Catholics in protests of demands to remove the
papal cross.
	   The Israeli government has urged Poland to solve the dispute.
	   The Auschwitz council asked that the crosses be removed before
the spring, the season when Catholics started planting the crosses
this year.
	   The council, formed in 1990 of Polish and Jewish survivors and
historians, also advised setting up a permanent exhibition at the
museum of wooden plaques brought by people from around the world in
memory of those killed at the camp.
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in the Auschwitz gas
chambers or from forced labor, disease and starvation at the camp
between 1940 and 1945.

 &UR; In new blow to peace accord, IRA confirms it has `ruled out'
disarming &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army
signaled Friday it won't start disarming in support of the Belfast
peace accord, complicating efforts to make the deal work.
	   An IRA spokesman told the Irish national broadcasters RTE in
Dublin and the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast that the
outlawed group's senior members ``firmly ruled out'' at a secret
weekend convention any start to disarmament.
	   The IRA has previously dismissed calls to begin destroying its
stockpiled armaments, even though April's accord specified that
should be completed by May 2000. The group has many tons of
weaponry, mostly smuggled from Libya in the mid-1980s and buried in
bunkers in the Irish Republic.
	   Belfast politicians said the latest statement seemed a
deliberate response to Thursday's conferring of the Nobel Peace
Prize on David Trimble and John Hume, the province's top Protestant
and Catholic leaders.
	   During his acceptance speech, Ulster Unionist Party leader
Trimble emphasized that Protestants would not permit the IRA's
allied Sinn Fein party to enter any new administration for Northern
Ireland without concrete evidence that the IRA had really renounced
violence.
	   A senior Ulster Unionist, Ken Maginnis, said the IRA response
underlined Protestant fears that ``Sinn Fein could enter government
... when in fact they still are armed to the teeth.''
	   The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie
Ahern, said they weren't surprised by the IRA statement and urged
local politicians to keep their eye on the real prize _ forming a
coalition government outlined in April's accord.
	   It was supposed to have been appointed in October, but has been
delayed by numerous disagreements.
	   According to the BBC and RTE reports, the IRA elected few new
faces to its two command and policy-making bodies: the seven-member
Army Council and 12-member Army Executive.
	   The IRA began bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of
abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state but,
after killing more than 1,800 people, called a truce in July 1997.
	   April's accord confirmed that Northern Ireland's 77-year-old
union with Britain would remain so long as most residents favored
it.
	   The accord also commits Northern Ireland's two major pro-British
paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force, to giving up their weapons.
	   Those groups killed 900 people, mostly Catholic civilians,
before calling a joint 1994 truce. Unlike Sinn Fein, neither
group's politicians attract enough votes to merit a place in the
new government.

Court clears Mikhailov of main charge

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on
Friday cleared a wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss, Sergei Mikhailov, of charges that he belonged to an criminal
organization.
	   The surprise outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who
had said that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and
should be jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if
found guilty.
	   The defense had demanded his acquittal.
	   ``This is the most important day of my life,'' Mikhailov told
the four men and two women on the jury.
	   ``You have told Switzerland and the whole world that in this
country there is democracy, law and equality,'' he said in a low
calm voice. His comments in Russian were translated by the court
interpreter.
	   ``I would like to send each of you a letter and in each line of
this letter I will write `I love you, I love you, I love you,''' he
declared before leaving the court for an unknown destination.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.
	   He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that
he was ``very, very rich.''
	   After day-long deliberations, the jury found there was
insufficient evidence to prove that he did belong to a criminal
organization.
	   The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, with
some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at
risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to
protect their identity.
	   Mikhailov was brought to the court each day in a bullet-proof
vest and armored vehicle.
	   The Russian was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents. He was found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated
strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying
a villa near Geneva.
	   The judge took into consideration the fact he had spent two
years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   Defense lawyer Alex Reymond praised the jury for ignoring
widespread media coverage of the c

	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ After chopping down and burning
nearly half a million marijuana plants in four days, Caribbean
troops are facing the fact that a two-week mission is not long
enough to eradicate the lucrative crop.
	   Machetes, gasoline and matches are the weapons in this military
operation as 129 soldiers from around the Caribbean land in U.S.
Marine Corps helicopters in ``marijuana villages'' in St. Vincent's
rugged terrain.
	   ``It would take months'' to wipe out the crop, St. Vincent's
police superintendent Cyril Doyle said Thursday, after troops
burned more than 200,000 plants in one day.
	   He said troops airlifted into uninhabited areas found what he
called ``marijuana villages,'' or makeshift camps usually occupied
by hands working in the marijuana plantations.
	   While U.S. Marines are providing support, regional security
system troops from half a dozen countries are doing the hard work
of destroying the marijuana. Lt. Col. Jeff Douglass, public affairs
officer with the U.S. Marine Corps, said the soldiers are moving
quickly, but the task is immense.
	   ``Some of the areas are very difficult to reach,'' said
Douglass. ``When the troops have completed their work in one area,
we then have to airlift them to another site. It would be really
difficult to destroy the entire crop in just two weeks.''
	   The two-week operation, targeting mountainous terrain near the
4,000-foot (1,200-meter) Soufriere Volcano, was requested by St.
Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell.
	   St. Vincent is just one of several islands in the eastern
Caribbean where the marijuana-eradication program has destroyed
millions of plants in recent years. But it is the first site where
an organized protest against the operation has sprung up.
	   Marijuana farmers have pleaded with their government not to
allow the crops to be destroyed and have written a letter of
protest to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The farmers argue they have no legal way to make a living and
marijuana cultivation is also at marijuana cultivation is crucial
to their livelihoods as well as the Vincentian economy. Unofficial
estimates suggest that between 15 and 20 percent of the population
of 110,000 people benefits in some way from the illegal drug trade.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on
Friday cleared a wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss, Sergei Mikhailov, of charges that he belonged to an criminal
organization.
	   The surprise outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who
had said that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and
should be jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if
found guilty.
	   The defense had demanded his acquittal.
	   ``This is the most important day of my life,'' Mikhailov told
the four men and two women on the jury.
	   ``You have told Switzerland and the whole world that in this
country there is democracy, law and equality,'' he said in a low
calm voice. His comments in Russian were translated by the court
interpreter.
	   ``I would like to send each of you a letter and in each line of
this letter I will write `I love you, I love you, I love you,''' he
declared before leaving the court for an unknown destination.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.
	   He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that
he was ``very, very rich.''
	   After day-long deliberations, the jury found there was
insufficient evidence to prove that he did belong to a criminal
organization.
	   The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, with
some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at
risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to
protect their identity.
	   Mikhailov was brought to the court each day in a bullet-proof
vest and armored vehicle.
	   The Russian was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents. He was found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated
strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying
a villa near Geneva.
	   The judge took into consideration the fact he had spent two
years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   Defense lawyer Alex Reymond praised the jury for ignoring
widespread media coverage of the case _ much of it focusing on his
supposed mafia connections.
	   ``The jury thought very precisely and very strictly,'' Reymond
said.
	   ``From now on he's a free man and he's been in jail for nothing
for two years.''

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Auschwitz museum's advisory council
urged Poland's government Friday to remove crosses planted this
year by conservative Catholics near the former Nazi death camp.
	   Ending a two-day meeting, the International Council of the
Auschwitz Museum condemned ``actions by irresponsible people'' who
``use religious symbols to aggravate tensions and conflicts.''
	   More than 200 small wooden crosses have been placed around an
eight-meter- (26-foot-) tall papal cross that has stood since 1988
at a site adjacent to Auschwitz where Nazis murdered 152 Polish
resistors.
	   Jews have long objected to the presence of the larger cross,
visible inside the camp, as an insult to the memory of Jews killed
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations around the world renewed their
outrage after the smaller crosses began appearing this summer,
planted by Roman Catholics in protests of demands to remove the
papal cross.
	   The Israeli government has urged Poland to solve the dispute.
	   The council, formed in 1990 of Polish and Jewish survivors and
historians, also advised setting up a permanent exhibition at the
museum of wooden plaques brought by people from around the world in
memory of those killed at the camp.
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in the Auschwitz gas
chambers or from forced labor, disease and starvation at the camp
between 1940 and 1945.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two popular brands of Italian Christmas cakes were
pulled off the shelves Friday after an animal rights group said it
injected them with rat poison.
	   The Animal Liberation Front sent cakes to the ANSA news agency
in Bologna and Florence on Thursday with messages saying it was
protesting genetic engineering.
	   Both cakes tested positive on Friday for enough rat poison to
make someone seriously ill, ANSA said. Additional tests were being
run on some of the cakes that authorities ordered pulled off the
shelves in about 1,000 stores nationwide.
	   Both brands of ``panettone'' _ Motta and Alemagna _ are make by
Nestle Italia. The president, Yves Barbeiux, told a news conference
that Nestle does not use genetically engineered ingredients in any
of the products the multinational sells in Italy.
	   According to ANSA, it was the second attack on Nestle attributed
to the Animal Liberation Front this year. In May, several delivery
vehicles were set on fire in Florence and slogans against genetic
engineering were scrawled on nearby walls.

Russian parliament seeks to control inflation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament moved Friday to limit the amount of
money the government can print, part of an effort to rein in
inflation that's at 70 percent this year and threatening to spiral
out of control.
	   As Russia wrestles with its economic crisis, one of the
trickiest questions is how much money President Boris Yeltsin's
government should inject into the economy. More money helps
stimulate the weak economy, but it also stokes inflation.
	   Since a financial meltdown in August, the government has pumped
billions of rubles into the economy in a bid to revive ailing banks
and pay off state workers whose wages are months overdue.
	   Despite these huge obligations, the government may print only 25
billion rubles (dlrs 1.3 billion) in the final quarter of this
year, according to the bill that won overwhelming approval in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   The government printed 13.5 billion rubles (dlrs 650 million)
total in October and November without approval from parliament,
which it was supposed to seek.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he
endorsed the plan approved Friday and would seek to maintain ``the
stability of the ruble,'' which has fallen sharply over the past
four months.
	   Many economists predicted the government would flood the economy
with additional cash, and the country's money supply has gone from
about 160 billion rubles (dlrs 8 billion) when the crisis struck to
more 190 billion rubles (dlrs 9.5 billion) Friday, according to
government figures.
	   Still, the increase is less than many economists had forecast
and so far has not been a major contributor to inflation, according
to some analysts.
	   However, the economists say it will be more difficult for Russia
to rein in spending in coming months because it faces ever larger
debts and shrinking revenues.
	   The Duma passed the bill Friday on its second reading. It must
be approved one more time before going to parliament's upper
chamber, where it's also expected to win passage next week.
	   In another development Friday, the government said that the
economic crisis had virtually halted the sale of major state assets
to private investors, and revenues this year were only a fraction
of those forecast.
	   The government had hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles (about dlrs
400 million) by auctioning off state property, but it has earned
only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 70 million) through October, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   The country's economic downturn has chased away foreign
investors, and the government has decided to put off auctions of
two large companies, the Rosneft oil company and the Svyazinvest
communications firm.
	   The government is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent
stake in the gas monopoly Gazprom later this month.
	   One possible buyer is the German gas distributor Ruhrgas, which
delivers Gazprom's gas to German consumers.
	   Russia's Cabinet approved a draft budget Thursday and planned to
send it to parliament Friday. In previous years, the government and
parliament have wrangled over the budget for months.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has good relations with all
the leading parliamentary factions, and has said that rapid passage
is necessary to deal with the economic crisis.
	   Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year,
and has been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst
depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jetliner with 146 people
aboard crashed in heavy rain and burst into flames Friday night in
a swamp in southern Thailand. Officials said scores of people were
killed and at least 45 confirmed survivors.
	   By 2 a.m., rescuers struggling in thigh-high water had pulled 29
bodies from the charred wreckage. Two were identified as
Westerners. Several bodies were still trapped in the plane, many of
them burned beyond recognition, police said.
	   At least 45 people survived, said a police official speaking on
condition of anonymity. About 10 of them were Westerners, probably
tourists, and had checked into a local hospital. Thai television
reported that the pilot survived, but this could not be confirmed.
	   Police said bodies were still being pulled from the wreckage in
the swampy, rain-battered area where Thai Airways Flight TG261
crashed about five kilometers (three miles) from the Surat Thani
airport about 6:45 p.m.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _
survived and were hospitalized. The parents of three of them were
known to have survived. Police were trying to match up the other
two with their parents.
	   Television footage showed four rain-soaked, bloodied Westerners,
two men and two women, being led to a pickup truck and driven away.
Ambulances were unable to reach the area and only four-wheel-drive
vehicles could navigate the mud.
	   From a hospital bed with blankets up to his neck, Akadek
Pudemha, a flight attendant, described the crash to Thai
television.
	   ``The plane was circling around the airport, going up and
down,'' Akadek said. ``We figured that if we couldn't land on the
third try, we would return to Bangkok. The plane was shaking the
whole time and we crashed on the third try. Then the plane was on
fire and I urged the passengers to jump out. They were reluctant to
jump.''
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in Thai's fleet. It was delivered to Thai
Airways in April 1986. By the end of October, it had accumulated
23,000 flight hours.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Rain fell steadily through the night in Surat Thani, a fishing
port and travel hub for nearby resort islands 500 kilometers (330
miles) southwest of Bangkok. But the high waters that hampered
rescuers may have cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   The airline released a manifest which indicated that most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also a score of Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list nationalities.
Passengers would not have been required to show passports when
checking in for the domestic flight.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban,
speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, said his sister Siriwan
had been on board. He had also originally been booked on the flight
until he canceled to attend a wedding.
	   Suthep, who said he did not know the fate of his sister,
expressed dismay that he learned about the crash first from his
relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the government-owned
airline, which he supervises.
	   Suthep boarded a subsequent flight to Surat Thani to supervise
the rescue, but it and about 100 reporters on board were diverted
by bad weather to the resort island of Phuket, a three-hour
overland journey from Surat Thani.
	   Suthep said that two Westerners were among the dead but was
unable to confirm reports that his sister had died. Television also
reported that Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of parliament from
Surat Thani, died in the crash.
 &UR; Suthep said Thai Airways would compensate, pick up 15th graf pvs.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top
prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped
foreigners, officials said Friday.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Officials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attackers
seized Tagirov, and authorities speculated it was the work of an
armed band seeking the release of one of its members from prison.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose
severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the
breakaway Russian republic.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3 by
unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's
abduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said
authorities had arrested a man who confessed to kidnapping the four
foreigners. The suspect was identified as Apti Abitayev, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Chechen security forces were searching Friday for additional
suspects as well as the bodies of the four foreigners.
	   Atgeriyev said he did not place any value in a videotape that
showed one of the four victims saying he was spying for Britain.
	   ``There are certain methods that might force a person to confess
to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said.
	   The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president,
showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been
sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the
breakaway republic.
	   Chechen officials refused to answer any questions about the
tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the government
got it. It was not known if Kennedy spoke under duress.
	   Britain's Embassy in Moscow was trying to obtain the tape,
spokesman Michael Haddock said Friday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government
agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, feuding gangs have waged bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people
have been kidnapped, mostly for ransom.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was
released after a year of efforts to free him, ITAR-Tass said
Friday. Alexei Novikov was seized in February 1996. Only a handful
of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity.
	   The report gave no details of his release.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians were killed
Friday in central Kosovo, Serb sources reported amid Albanian
accusations that Serbian authorities are reneging on international
commitments.
	   The three Albanians _ all known to be loyal to the Serbian
regime _ were shot while repairing a power station near the central
town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media Center in the provincial
capital Pristina said.
	   In a separate incident, a group of armed Serb civilians
reportedly held up six humanitarian workers on their way home from
delivering aid a village near Urosevac, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
south of Pristina late Friday, said Palok Berishaj, a
representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian
group.
	   Berishaj said the group included five ethnic Albanians and one
German national. No further information regarding the whereabouts
of the six was immediately available.
	   Neither report could be independently confirmed.
	   The latest incidents further risk the fragile peace in the
strife-torn Serb province came as Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian
party accused Serbian authorities of reneging on international
commitments by blocking the first European probe into atrocities
here.
	   ``The Belgrade regime is in clear breach of its international
obligations,'' said Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic
League of Kosovo.
	   On Thursday, Serb police using armored vehicles prevented a team
of Finnish forensic experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic
Albanians allegedly massacred at a site in central Kosovo,
insisting they accompany the Finnish group. Gashi said this was
``proof that the Serbian regime is obstructing an international
impartial investigation.''
	   Serbs rejected the accusations, saying the Finns had earlier
agreed to visit the site only in presence of Serb authorities.
	   The Finnish team, working under a European Union mandate, was to
begin exhumations at the site _ the first in a series of six Kosovo
locations to which Belgrade had previously granted access.
	   Gashi said if the probe is to include Serb officials, (ethnic)
Albanian experts should also be present _ a demand the Serbs flat
out refuse.
	   ``There is a legally established court of law and the state's
institutions are the only ones authorized to carry out such
investigations,'' Serbian Judge Danica Marinkovic said in response.
	   Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said Friday his
group was also aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians.
	   ``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities
in trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' Lahelma said.
Lahelma did not know when his team would begin exhumations.

India working on longer range nuclear-capable missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian scientists are proceeding on
schedule in the development of a longer range version of the
nuclear-capable Agni missile, a parliament report was quoted as
saying Friday.
	   India is also developing a naval version of its other
nuclear-capable missile, Prithvi, with a strike capability of 250
kilometers (155 miles), Press Trust of India reported, citing the
report of parliament's standing committee for defense.
	   ``(The) government has already approved the next phase of Agni
for the development of longer range system using state-of-the-art
technologies developed indigenously and development work is
progressing as per schedule,'' said the report.
	   The surface-to surface version of the Prithvi, being developed
for the army, will have a range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), the
report said.
	   Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat this month set Jan.
26 as the deadline for arming an unspecified number of ships with
the Prithvi missiles. Jan. 26 is the national holiday on which
India celebrates the day in 1950 when its constitution came into
effect.
	   India and neighbor and rival Pakistan both set off underground
nuclear test explosions in May and declared themselves nuclear
weapons powers. Analysts say the next step will be developing
delivery systems for their weapons.
	   The medium-range Prithvi and the long-range Agni are expected to
be the mainstay of India's nuclear delivery system, according to
Jane's Intelligence Review. While the Agni is still in the
development stage, India's Prithvi force is considered to be in the
range of 20 to 50 missiles, the magazine says.

Libyan oil minister says OPEC members should reduce production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Oil prices will not rise unless members of
the OPEC cartel reduce their production, Libyan Petroleum Minister
Abdalla Salem el-Badri said Friday.
	   Moreover, Libya's revenues will be dlrs 2 billion lower this
year than in 1997 because of the fall in the world price, Planning
Minister Gadallah Azouz al-Tolhi told the Libyan parliament.
	   This week the benchmark oil price of Brent futures fell to below
dlrs 10 - a 12-year low.
	   Analysts have put the fall down to a glut in the market caused
by overproduction and depressed demand owing to the economic
recession in Asia and the warm winter in the West.
	   ``Oil prices will not go up unless the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reduces production, because asking non-OPEC
members to reduce production is impossible,'' el-Badri told the
General People's Congress, or parliament, which is holding its
annual five-day meeting in the coastal town of Sirte, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted el-Badri as
saying Libya had lost a lot of money because of the collapse of oil
prices.
	   El-Badri did not give a figure, but later Friday Libyan
television showed al-Tolhi telling legislators that the country's
income from oil would be dlrs 2 billion lower this year.
	   OPEC President Youcef Yousfi said last month that member states
should reduce their combined production by up to 1.5 million
barrels a day in order to boost oil prices.
	   The members of OPEC are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

UVSC president traveling to Egypt to offer advice on education

<TEXT>
	   OREM, Utah (AP) _ The president of Utah Valley State College is
traveling to Egypt to advise government and education leaders on
how to merge their country's academic and vocational-training
college.
	   At the request of Egypt's Consul General Hagar Islambouly, Kerry
D. Romesburg and two aides will fly to Cairo for three days of
meetings next week. A wealthy Middle Eastern industrialist who
visited the Orem campus with Islambouly this summer is paying for
the trip.
	   ``While they were here, they came to campus and were impressed
with what we are doing,'' Romesburg said. ``They were very
impressed with how we combine vocational training in an academic
setting.''
	   Islambouly and millionaire Ibrahim Kamel, chairman of an
aerospace-technology company that leases planes powered by
Rolls-Royce engines to Russian and Egyptian airlines, were
attending Utah's Russia Days, sponsored by UVSC's Utah-Russia
Institute in June.
	   Kamel, who is hosting the education summit with Romesburg, also
is chairman of the Egypt-U.S. partnership for development, created
by Presidents Clinton and Mohammed Hosni Mubarak in April 1995.
	   Members of the partnership's committee are charged with working
to enhance economic relations between the two countries. Egyptian
committee members also work to attract attention of U.S. investors
toward opportunities in the Middle East.
	   Meetings have been scheduled next week with Egypt's ministers of
education, higher education, finance and industry. Romesburg has
been asked to explain how UVSC handles both trade-training courses
and a growing number of liberal-art programs leading to four-year
degrees.
	   Egypt's education system does not mix trade and academic
programs at institutions of higher education _ but that may change
if officials believe such education models are efficient.
	   Romesburg said he is not receiving a fee for the consulting
work.
	   Rusty Butler, head of UVSC's Russia Institute, and Brad Cook, a
Brigham Young University professor and former UVSC aide, will
attend the consulting sessions with Romesburg and his wife, Judy, a
former teacher.

Russian poultry workers lock alleged thieves in freezer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Workers at a Russian poultry factory have been
arrested for locking seven colleagues in a meat freezer after
accusing them of stealing six tons of chicken legs, a news report
said Friday.
	   Four security officials at the Novosibirsk Poultry Plant first
questioned the seven workers, then beat them with a bat, then
locked them in the freezer, police told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ITAR-Tass said the accusations of theft were unfounded.
	   Police in Novosibirsk, a city about 2,800 kilometers (1,750
miles) east of Moscow, freed the frozen workers and detained four
security officials.
	   The report did not say when the incident occurred or how long
the workers were in the freezer, or what happened to the six tons
of chicken legs.

	   Meanwhile, the Contact Group of nations concerned with the

direct talks between the two sides. So far U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill has been shuttling between the two.
	   On Friday, Hill said that he will ``intensify'' his efforts to
find a peaceful solution for the Serbian province. He indirectly
denied reports that he will no longer shuttle between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, but added there should be ``less traveling and
more negotiating,'' in the future, independent B 92 radio reported.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINC, Haiti (AP) _ The Haitian government is
encouraging efforts by expatriates living in France to bring former
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to court.
	   ``Justice Minister Max Antoine has urged people to file suit.
Our government has certain documents relative to Duvalier's
situation and will do everything in its power'' to assist the
victims, Interior Minister Jean Moliere told the private Radio
Haiti-Inter on Friday.
	   Encouraged by the arrest in Great Britain of former Chilean
military ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald
Bloncourt founded a committee a week ago to bring Duvalier to trial
for crimes against humanity.
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   His father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' had ruled Haiti
with an iron hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes,
his private militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and
tortured to death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty.

direct talks between the two sides. So far U.S. envoy for Kosovo,
Christopher Hill has been shuttling between the two.
	   On Friday, Hill said that he will ``intensify'' his efforts to
find a peaceful solution for the Serbian province. He indirectly
denied reports that he will no longer shuttle between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, but added there should be ``less traveling and
more negotiating,'' in the future, independent B 92 radio reported.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin tried to honor literary
giant Alexander Solzhenitsyn on his 80th birthday Friday, but the
veteran of the Soviet gulags refused Russia's highest cultural
award.
	   Solzhenitsyn, a longtime critic of Yeltsin, thanked the
president but said: ``In today's conditions, when people are
starving and striking just to get their wages, I cannot accept this
award.''
	   ``Maybe, maybe, in a long, long time, when Russia overcomes its
insurmountable problems, my sons may be able to accept such an
award,'' he said at a Moscow performance of the play ``Sharashka,''
based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First Circle.''
	   Yeltsin granted Solzhenitsyn the Order of St. Andrew for
``outstanding service to the fatherland and great contributions to
world literature,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told
reporters.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, told Russia's ORT
television station that the writer had the right to decline the
award. But it is the president's duty to ``honor such an
outstanding person on his birthday,'' Sysuyev said.
	   Solzhenitsyn did accept an award from the Russian Academy of
Sciences, Russian news agencies reported.
	   He is the author of such renowned works as ``One Day in the Life
of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities in the Soviet prison
camps.
	   The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a party Thursday night at
the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and chatted amicably with
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man he criticized in the
past.
	   Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for eight years, and he
turned his experiences into his life's work, winning him
international fame. Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974 and he
lived in seclusion in Vermont before returning to post-Soviet
Russia in 1994.
	   He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but his
influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one of
the best-known opponents of the Soviet system.

Yeltsin goes to Kremlin to meet several top aides

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin office on
Friday to meet with top aides and sign orders before retreating
back to his country residence, his spokesman said.
	   It was the first time Yeltsin had gone to the Kremlin since
Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number of other
aides.
	   On Friday, the president met with his new chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's
work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin also met with Vladislav Sherstyuk, new chief of the
government's agency in charge of classified communications.
	   Brief television footage of the Friday meetings showed the
67-year-old president either smiling and gesticulating animatedly
or staring glumly. Like most footage of Kremlin meetings, the tape
had no sound of the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin also called Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss
the next year's budget, which the Cabinet passed Thursday and was
heading shortly to parliament.
	   Yeltsin also recorded a radio address to air Saturday marking
the fifth anniversary of the approval of Russia's constitution, and
signed a decree awarding a medal to writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn _
a former Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate who turned 80 on
Friday.
	   The president ``had a very active day today, which demonstrates
properly the state of his health,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been at his Rus country home, 60 miles north of
Moscow, since Wednesday, when he was released from the hospital
after a two-week stay to recover from pneumonia. After his trip to
the Kremlin on Friday, Yeltsin went to his residence just west of
the capital, Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and
doctors believe this can be done at a country residence ... with
periodic examinations at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' Yakushkin
said.
	   He refused to speculate how long the recuperation will last.
	   Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and
Belarusian presidents, Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin, who insists he is still fit to lead the country, has
spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of
various illnesses. He has handed over responsibility for solving
the country's economic problems to Primakov.
	   Yeltin had heart bypass surgery in 1996.

 &UR; Two Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops &QL;

<TEXT>
	   QALQILIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops opened fire Friday on
hundreds of Palestinian stone-throwers, killing two and injuring
dozens in a new outbreak of violence just a day before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's arrival in the region.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile said he
would not budge from his demand that the Palestinians must meet a
list of conditions before he will withdraw troops in the West Bank,
as he pledged to do in the Wye River agreement.
	   Netanyahu suggested that even Clinton would not make him change
his mind. ``We do not change our opinions, our positions on account
of this or that circumstance,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with
Israel TV's Channel One.
	   The new violence and Netanyahu's tough talk made it more likely
that Clinton's three-day visit, intended to usher in the second
stage of the Wye agreement, will not go smoothly and that the
president will be drawn into the bitter disputes between Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   A senior White House official said Clinton will not be deterred
from making the trip. ``I do not think the president has had second
thoughts for a minute about going on this trip,'' said Sandy
Berger, his assistant for national security affairs.
	   Monday's gathering of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' top decision-making body, has the greatest potential
for trouble. During the session, the PNC is to ``reaffirm'' earlier
decisions by lesser bodies declaring provisions in the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void.
	   Netanyahu insists that the PNC abrogate the charter by vote,
while the Palestinians say that under the Wye accord they are not
required to do so. Instead, they say they will approve the charter
changes by acclamation.
	   Netanyahu reiterated Friday that he will settle for nothing less
than a vote. If Clinton validates the PNC decision despite Israeli
misgivings, Netanyahu said he will not attend a three-way meeting
with Arafat the Americans are trying to arrange immediately after
the PNC session.
	   The Israeli leader also accused the Palestinian Authority of
orchestrating West Bank riots to pressure Israel into releasing
more Palestinian prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   In all, four Palestinians have been killed and scores injured
this week in widespread clashes with Israeli troops. The violence
erupted after marches pressing for the release of prisoners.
	   In the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, about 500 Palestinians, most
of them supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, marched to the
outskirts of town Friday afternoon and began throwing stones at
Israeli troops. Soldiers standing only about 10 meters (30 feet)
away from the crowd fired tear gas and rubber-coated steel pellets.
Witnesses said troops also used live ammunition, a claim denied by
the Israeli army.
	   Rubber bullets, when fired from a short distance, can be fatal.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman
at the U.N. clinic in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by
rubber bullets, two by live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas
inhalation, clinic officials said.
	   Suleiman's father, Ismail, sat on a hospital bed, chain-smoking
and shaking after learning about his son's death. The 50-year-old,
an officer in the Palestinian police, said he supported peace with
Israel, but was having second thoughts.
	   ``My son didn't endanger them,'' he said. ``Why did they kill
him? Peace won't come if Israeli soldiers keep shooting live
bullets.''
	   Earlier this week, after the most widespread West Bank clashes
in months, Netanyahu ordered troop commanders to take ``a firm
hand'' against rioters.
	   Arafat's West Bank security chief, Jibril Rajoub, said
Palestinian police would make sure there will be no violence during
the Clinton trip. ``I can assure you the situation will be quiet,''
he said.

 &UR; Eds: AMs; recasts with investigation beginning, new details,
 &UR; Salt Lake officials questioned in alleged bribery case
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Moving quickly to tackle an
escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders questioned Salt Lake
City officials Friday in the first ever investigation into alleged
vote-buying by an Olympic city.
	   Acting with unusual speed, the International Olympic Committee
set up a special investigative panel that immediately summoned the
organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake Games to address the bribery
allegations.
	   The chief investigator refused to rule out the possibility of
taking the games away from Salt Lake City _ though that scenario is
considered highly unlikely.
	   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC
panel for 90 minutes Friday night.
	   Both sides declined to comment after the talks, saying the
inquiry was still in process.
	   Earlier, Joklik met with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
and other top officials to provide information and documents on the
case.
	   The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid
committee which won the right to stage the 2002 games.
	   Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the
scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake
officials _ amounted to a bribe to sway votes in the 1995 election.
	   It's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct
investigated by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert Helmick was
accused of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick eventually
resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
	   This is the first time the IOC has ever investigated possible
bribery by bidding cities, despite previous rumors and allegations
of corruption in other Olympic votes.
	   ``The executive board takes this matter very seriously,'' said
Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the Salt Lake inquiry.
``Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support
rumors that have been floating around, we have never had anything
come forward.
	   ``Specific allegations have now been made. The executive board
acted very quickly to investigate.''
	   Also on the investigative panel are IOC vice president Keba
Mbaye, executive board members Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach, and
IOC director general Francois Carrard.
	   Pound said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there
may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the
IOC or their families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.''
	   Pound, a Canadian lawyer, said there was no deadline for
completion of the investigation but said it was possible the
inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend.
	   Pound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could
be taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games
elsewhere.
	   ``We're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as
to what we may decide until we know what the facts are,'' he said.
	   Moving the games would be unprecedented and, with just over
three years to go, would be a logistical nightmare. Most of the
facilities needed for the games in Salt Lake already are built.
	   John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, discounted any possibility of the games being moved.
	   ``There is no chance at all, absolutely none in my mind,'' he
said. ``I can't be stronger in saying I don't consider it a
possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn from Salt Lake
City. ''
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Olympic rules prohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or
their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs
150.
	   ``I've already stated I do not regard what was done as a
bribe,'' Joklik said Friday. ``I recognize there have been
perceptions contrary to that. I regret those perceptions, but I
don't feel they are justified.''
	   Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time, the No. 2
official behind Welch.
	   Welch resigned last year as president of the organizing
committee after being accused of domestic violence against his
wife. He currently serves as a SLOC consultant.
	   ``The organizing committee certainly has people of integrity and
ethical standards that would stand any investigation,'' Joklik
said. ``The facts were in the early 1990s when the bid committee
was operating.''
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on
Friday cleared a wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss, Sergei Mikhailov, of charges that he belonged to an criminal
organization.
	   The surprise outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who
had said that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and
should be jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if
found guilty.
	   The defense had demanded his acquittal.
	   ``This is the most important day of my life,'' Mikhailov told
the four men and two women on the jury.
	   ``You have told Switzerland and the whole world that in this
country there is democracy, law and equality,'' he said in a low
calm voice. His comments in Russian were translated by the court
interpreter.
	   ``I would like to send each of you a letter and in each line of
this letter I will write `I love you, I love you, I love you,''' he
declared before leaving the court. He was taken back to the prison
where he had been held for the past two years and was then expected
to leave for a secret destination..
	   Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.
	   He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that
he was ``very, very rich.''
	   After day-long deliberations, the jury found there was
insufficient evidence to prove that he did belong to a criminal
organization.
	   The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, with
some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at
risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to
protect their identity.
	   Mikhailov was brought to the court each day in a bullet-proof
vest and armored vehicle.
	   The Russian was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents. He was found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated
strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying
a villa near Geneva.
	   The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he had spent
two years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   Defense lawyer Alec Reymond praised the jury for ignoring
widespread media coverage of the case _ much of it focusing on
Mikhailov's supposed mafia connections.
	   ``The jury thought very precisely and very strictly,'' Reymond
said.
	   ``From now on he's a free man and he's been in jail for nothing
for two years.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out
searches again Friday, despite a dispute with the authorities over
entry to an office of the ruling party.
	   Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs the National Monitoring
Directorate, said three U.N. teams ``carried out 14 surprise visits
to sites,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported Friday night.
	   Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said there were fewer
inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim sabbath. But, she
added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of work''
and would conduct searches through the weekend.
	   This week's searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have
been the most intensive since U.N. teams were allowed to resume
work last month.
	   Visiting teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct
the more intrusive searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath Party, to which a
team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday.
	   A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco
building, has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try
to return. The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is
private property and contains no materials wanted by the
inspectors.
	   The U.N. inspectors insist they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. Richard
Butler, the chief weapons inspector, has said the office in the
neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials of significance.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Iraq on Friday
that if it did not honor its promise to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors, ``the military option remains on the table.''
	   But Albright told reporters in Washington that the United States
was reserving judgment until Butler files his report on Iraqi
cooperation to the U.N. secretary general early next week.
	   On Thursday, U.N. inspectors tried to search what Iraqis called
a private home, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. The Iraqis
insisted, however, that the inspectors first get permission from
the home's owners.
	   Two women inspectors entered ``amid surprised faces of the
residents of the house'' and got approval, the agency said, quoting
Gen. Amin of the monitoring directorate.
	   Eight U.N. teams checked 12 sites on Thursday, with two teams
using helicopters, Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors resumed work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus after Iraq banned them from visiting any new
suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed down on Nov. 14 and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes.
	   The United States has said the disputes over the inspections
could lead it to attack Iraqi without warning.

U.S., Russia to hold steel talks next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration has agreed to a
request by Russia to discuss how to avert penalty tariffs on
shipments of Russian steel into the United States.
	   Assistant Commerce Secretary Robert S. LaRussa will meet in
London next week with Russian trade officials to discuss a proposal
the Russian government has put forward to limit steel shipments,
officials at the White House and Commerce Department said Friday.
	   ``The Russians have asked us to come talk about a variety of
things including suspension,'' said Commerce Department spokesman
Morrie Goodman.
	   The Russians want the United States to suspend a case brought by
the steel industry accusing Russia of dumping steel in the United
States, or selling steel at unfairly low prices. The case, which
won't finally be decided until next summer, seeks stiff tariff
increases on certain kinds of steel shipments from Russia, Japan
and Brazil to halt a flood of cheap imports.
	   The global economic crisis has sent a number of Asian countries
and Russia into deep recessions that have cut sharply into foreign
demand for steel. Foreign makers have turned to the still healthy
U.S. market to unload their excess production.
	   Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have raised
the problems of the U.S. steel industry in meetings over the past
month with the leaders of Russia, Japan and South Korea.
	   While the overall U.S. economy has been able to withstand the
shocks from the global economic turmoil, the trade deficit has been
skyrocketing as American manufacturers have been hit by a double
whammy, the loss of key overseas export markets and increased
imports into the United States.
	   The steel industry has complained that imports are up 64 percent
this year, pushing down domestic prices and threatening thousands
of U.S. jobs.
	   Responding to the pressures from the domestic industry, the
House passed a nonbinding resolution in October asking Clinton to
impose one-year bans on low-cost steel imports from 10 nations.
	   Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic Strategy Institute
in Washington, said the administration is looking for a way to
defuse a foreign policy headache.
	   While the domestic steel industry and its union would like to
impose stiff tariffs, the administration wants to allow some
Russian steel shipments to continue as a way of providing support
for the beleaguered Russian economy.
	   ``The odds are very high that the administration will end up
negotiating some sort of voluntary restraint agreement to suspend
the dumping case,'' Mastel said.
	   Mastel said the administration has the power to suspend dumping
cases involving countries where the industry is state-owned. The
administration negotiated a voluntary restraint agreement involving
different types of steel imports from Russia and China last year.
	   As America's trade deficit surges to record highs this year and
next, the steel case could be the first of a number of dumping
cases filed, complaints alleging that products are being sold in
the United States at unfairly low prices _ either below the cost in
the home market or below the cost of production.
	   Other industries which could bring dumping cases in the future
are manufacturers of computer chips, machine tools, textiles and
autos.

Kosovo Albanians vow to rebuild from the ruins

	   LODJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Overcoming fears of more violence,
Kosovo Albanians are cautiously returning in greater numbers to
damaged or abandoned homes in the war-scarred Serbian province.
	   But for a group of refugees who came back Friday to resettle
their nearly flattened village, home no longer exists.
	   Probably nowhere in Kosovo does a more shocking scene of
destruction exist than the one that greeted 15 ethnic Albanians who
rode back into this western village on the back of a truck,
escorted by humanitarian aid workers.
	   ``This is the most difficult moment of my life,'' said
56-year-old Hegrige Morina, her voice quavering as she gazed with
moist eyes at the stone skeleton of the house where she was born.
	   Shelled, bombed, mortared, looted, burned and bulldozed into
near-oblivion by Serbian forces on a vengeance spree last summer,
Lodja _ once a prosperous farming village _ looks like old footage
of Hiroshima.
	   Virtually the only buildings left fully standing from a village
of 2,800 people are a half-dozen on the edge of town that belonged
to non-Albanians.
	   The ruins are graphic testimony to the ethnic hatreds that tore
apart Kosovo, a Serbian province with a majority Albanian
population.
	   But even this breathtaking level of destruction can't extinguish
the Albanians' fierce will to stay.
	   After touring the devastation, the shocked refugees promptly
went about cleaning up the shattered but intact school so eight
displaced families can move into it.
	   ``They're extremely brave,'' said Morgan Morris, office head in
the neighboring town of Pec for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees. The agency is assisting in the
resettlement along with diplomatic observers and the Swiss agency
Medair.
	   ``They wanted to come back,'' she said. ``They were just too
scared to do it without us.''
	   Across Kosovo, other villages are slowly starting to revive
after a quarter-million or more people fled during seven months of
fighting between Serb forces and separatist rebels that killed
hundreds.
	   In nearby Junik on the Albanian border, an estimated 1,300
ethnic Albanians have come back in the last two weeks from
neighboring Montenegro, Albania or villages in Kosovo.
	   For many refugees, like those in Lodja, the question was not
whether to reclaim their village but when.
	   ``It's our dream to return here, all of us,'' said Tenzile
Ademi, a 29-year-old teacher.
	   Lodja had boasted huge homes made of brick or stone with
intricate designs on a rich agricultural plain that abuts towering,
snowcapped mountains.
	   Its woes began after Kosovo Liberation Army rebels found it a
welcome haven in their fight against Serb forces on an offensive
against separatists. The KLA tortured and killed two Serb policemen
and hung their bodies from a tree, according to diplomats citing
photographs of the victims, and that brought down the wrath of Serb
planes, tanks and shells in an all-out blitz in August.
	   Now cabbages rot in the fields and apples lie frozen on the
ground in the rubble that was a village. Taunting Serb graffiti
welcomes arrivals at the edge of town.
	   Nimon Morina, 75, a cousin of Hegrige, pointed his cane in
anguish to a leveled home _ one of six he owned, inhabited by his
six sons.
	   ``This was my oldest house. It was built in 1872 by my
great-grandfather,'' he said, his voice breaking.
	   His agonizing walk continued _ he must see all the damage.
	   ``I remember World War II, and even the Nazis didn't destroy
mosques and medical clinics,''
	   A bittersweet moment brings smiles to the refugees' faces _
against all odds, one of the men's dogs is sitting faithfully on
the desolate lawn next to his wrecked house.
	   Mahmut Morina, 63, walked joyfully toward his beloved Cub, but
the dog was jittery and refused to let him get close.
	   ``Take care of my house for me. I'll be back!'' Morina shouted
to him cheerfully.
	   After walking away he stopped suddenly, wiping away tears.

minutes after half time.
	   Rennes now has 31 points, seven behind Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   Strasbourg and Nantes drew 2-2 in the night's other game.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians were killed
Friday in central Kosovo, Serb sources reported amid Albanian
accusations that Serbian authorities are reneging on international
commitments.
	   The three Albanians _ all known to be loyal to the Serbian
regime _ were shot while repairing a power station near the central
town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media Center in the provincial
capital Pristina said.
	   In a separate incident Friday, a group of armed Serb civilians
reportedly held six humanitarian workers hostage for three hours,
hoping to exchange them for Serb captives, said Palok Berishaj, a
representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian
group.
	   Police mediated their release in Nerodimlje, 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pristina, said Berishaj. The group reportedly
included five ethnic Albanians and one German.

Netanyahu in a bind over Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running short of
options.
	   If he sticks to his decision to hold up a West Bank troop
withdrawal until the Palestinians meet his demands, he risks
embarrassing and angering Clinton during his high-profile visit.
	   If Netanyahu softens his position to appease the Americans, his
right-wing coalition is likely to fall apart within a week.
	   It would seem there is no way out.
	   But Netanyahu has proven himself to be the Houdini of Israeli
politics, and may yet wriggle out of this one.
	   The Israeli right sees Clinton's visit, in which he will be
treating Arafat like a head of state, as implicit recognition of
Palestinian desires for statehood. If Netanyahu agrees to give more
land to the Palestinians, they are likely to bolt from the
coalition.
	   In the run-up to Clinton's three-day visit, members of
Netanyahu's Cabinet have let it be known that they would prefer he
stay home. Grass-roots right-wingers have put up posters portraying
Clinton wearing an Arab keffiyeh, or headdress, a symbol of
Palestinian nationalism.
	   ``Clinton and Netanyahu have conflicting interests. The more
Clinton succeeds, the worse Netanyahu's situation will become, and
vice versa,'' commentator Hemi Shalev wrote in the Maariv daily.
	   The dovish Labor Party has shown no interest in rescuing
Netanyahu from his own supporters, refusing to consider a national
unity government, even to save the latest peace agreement.
	   Netanyahu described the conflicting pressures on him in a speech
to Israeli newspaper editors this week. ``We are being pressed from
the right not to progress with the Palestinians even if the
Palestinians do honor their obligations, we are being pressed from
the left, even if Palestinians don't honor their obligations,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu said he would go forward with the West Bank
withdrawals only if the Palestinians agreed to his demands.
	   Those demands are focusing on the meeting of the Palestinian
leadership that Clinton will address Monday. Netanyahu wants
members of the Palestine National Council, the highest
decision-making body, to vote in Clinton's presence to abrogate
clauses in the PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have _ with apparent U.S. backing _ insisted that
they are not required by the Wye River peace agreement to take such
a vote.
	   The question is what will happen if Clinton views the issue as
settled, and Netanyahu claims the Palestinians have not fulfilled
their commitment.
	   Netanyahu said Friday that he would not accept any finessing and
hoped Clinton would not accept a ``farce.'' If there was no vote,
Netanyahu said he would not agree to a three-way meeting with
Arafat later that day even if Clinton proposed it.
	   ``The truth about whether they have canceled or not does not
change as a result of this or that visit, however important,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Nabil Shaath, planning minister in Arafat's Cabinet, said
Netanyahu was seizing more and more excuses to get out of handing
over land and to try to preserve his coalition. ``I don't know if
anything satisfies the Israeli government,'' Shaath said.
	   Domestic Israeli politics, not diplomacy, seem to play a key
role in Netanyahu's considerations. Even some of his closest
supporters say he may have decided last week to suspend a West Bank
troop withdrawal to keep his coalition intact.
	   Netanyahu faces a vote in the Israeli parliament in 10 days on
an early elections bill. He failed to muster the necessary votes to
defeat the bill earlier in the week, but managed to stave off
defeat by deft parliament maneuvers.
	   The Netanyahu magic has rescued him from what seemed certain
disaster in the past as well.
	   In January 1997, Netanyahu was nearly brought down by a scandal
involving the appointment of a political crony as attorney general.
Netanyahu's top aide resigned but he emerged unscathed, even though
police had recommended to file charges against him.
	   Later that year, Netanyahu faced another major crisis over his
approval of a failed Mossad operation in neighboring Jordan that
targeted a Hamas leader, Khalid Mashaal. The Mossad chief resigned
but Netanyahu one again stayed on.
	   Netanyahu would seem to be boxed in this time as well, but could
easily emerge unscathed yet again.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jetliner with 146
people aboard crashed in heavy rain and exploded in flames Friday
night in a swamp in southern Thailand. Officials said there were
scores dead and at least 50 confirmed survivors.
	   By 4 a.m., rescuers struggling in chest-high water had recovered
44 bodies from the charred, fragmented wreckage in the swamp. The
rescue operation was eased back after midnight and was to resume
after daybreak.
	   Rescue workers told reporters at the Surat Thani airport that
scores more bodies remained trapped in the plane, many of them
burned beyond recognition. Searchers had to wade and swim among the
bobbing pieces of shattered aircraft _ the largest said to be
little bigger than a door _ to try to recover the remains.
	   At least 50 people survived and were taken to five hospitals in
the area around Surat Thani, a fishing port and travel hub to
nearby resort islands 503 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of
Bangkok. About 10 were Westerners, probably tourists, officials
said.
	   Thai television reported the pilot survived.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban broke
down in tears after arriving from the capital, Bangkok, and
learning that his sister, Siriwan, had been killed in the crash.
Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of parliament from Surat Thani, also
died.
	   Suthep was originally booked on Flight TG261 himself but
canceled to attend a wedding. He expressed dismay that he learned
first about the crash from relatives than the government-owned
airline, which he supervises.
	   The Airbus A310-200, one of two in Thai's fleet, crashed about
five kilometers (three miles) from the airport about 6:45 p.m.
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise and came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to
go up high. The engines were really screaming. Then I saw a light
bright like the sunset about four stories off the ground, then a
fireball falling.''
	   From a hospital bed with blankets up to his neck, Akadek
Pudemha, a flight attendant, described the crash to Thai
television.
	   ``The plane was circling around the airport, going up and
down,'' Akadek said. ``We figured that if we couldn't land on the
third try, we would return to Bangkok. The plane was shaking the
whole time and we crashed on the third try. Then the plane was on
fire and I urged the passengers to jump out. They were reluctant to
jump.''
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _
survived and were hospitalized. The parents of three of them were
known to have survived. Police were trying to match up the other
two with their parents.
	   Television footage showed four were rain-soaked, bloodied
Westerners, two men and two women, being led to a pickup truck and
driven away. Ambulances were unable to reach the area and only
four-wheel-drive vehicles could navigate the mud.
	   Airbus said from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that it
would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation. It said the aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways
in April 1986 and had logged 23,000 flight hours by the end of
October.
	   The airline released a manifest which indicated that most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were a score of Western and
Japanese names. It did not list nationalities. Passengers would not
have been required to show passports when checking in for the
domestic flight.
	   One of the dead foreigners was identified by officials as Roger
Figenschau. No nationality was known. The second dead foreigner
remained unidentified.
	   In the past 15 months there have been two other Airbus crashes,
both in Asia.
	   On Feb. 16, an Airbus A300 owned by Taiwan's China Airlines
crashed and burst into flame in a neighborhood near Taipei's Chiang
Kai-shek airport, where it was trying to land in fog and rain after
a flight from Bali, Indonesia. A total of 203 people died.
	   On Sept. 26, 1997, 234 people aboard an A300B4 belonging to the
Indonesian state airline Garuda died in northern Sumatra. The plane
crashed into a jungle slope while descending to land in a thick
smog caused by forest fires.

 &UR; Two Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with quotes from Netanyahu, victim's father,

 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QALQILIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops opened fire Friday on
hundreds of Palestinian stone-throwers, killing two and injuring
dozens in a new outbreak of violence just a day before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's arrival in the region.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile said he
would not budge from his demand that the Palestinians must meet a
list of conditions before he will withdraw troops in the West Bank,
as he pledged to do in the Wye River agreement.
	   Netanyahu suggested that even Clinton would not make him change
his mind. ``We do not change our opinions, our positions on account
of this or that circumstance,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with
Israel TV's Channel One.
	   The new violence and Netanyahu's tough talk made it more likely
that Clinton's three-day visit, intended to usher in the second
stage of the Wye agreement, will not go smoothly and that the
president will be drawn into the bitter disputes between Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   A senior White House official said Clinton will not be deterred
from making the trip. ``I do not think the president has had second
thoughts for a minute about going on this trip,'' said Sandy
Berger, his assistant for national security affairs.
	   Monday's gathering of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' top decision-making body, has the greatest potential
for trouble. During the session, the PNC is to ``reaffirm'' earlier
decisions by lesser bodies declaring provisions in the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void.
	   Netanyahu insists that the PNC abrogate the charter by vote,
while the Palestinians say that under the Wye accord they are not
required to do so. Instead, they say they will approve the charter
changes by acclamation.
	   Netanyahu reiterated Friday that he will settle for nothing less
than a vote. If Clinton validates the PNC decision despite Israeli
misgivings, Netanyahu said he will not attend a three-way meeting
with Arafat the Americans are trying to arrange immediately after
the PNC session.
	   The Israeli leader also accused the Palestinian Authority of
orchestrating West Bank riots to pressure Israel into releasing
more Palestinian prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   In all, four Palestinians have been killed and scores injured
this week in widespread clashes with Israeli troops. The violence
erupted after marches pressing for the release of prisoners.
	   In the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, about 500 Palestinians, most
of them supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, marched to the
outskirts of town Friday afternoon and began throwing stones at
Israeli troops. Soldiers standing only about 10 meters (30 feet)
away from the crowd fired tear gas and rubber-coated steel pellets.
Witnesses said troops also used live ammunition, a claim denied by
the Israeli army.
	   Rubber bullets, when fired from a short distance, can be fatal.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman
at the U.N. clinic in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by
rubber bullets, two by live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas
inhalation, clinic officials said.
	   Suleiman's father, Ismail, sat on a hospital bed, chain-smoking
and shaking after learning about his son's death. The 50-year-old,
an officer in the Palestinian police, said he supported peace with
Israel, but was having second thoughts.
	   ``My son didn't endanger them,'' he said. ``Why did they kill
him? Peace won't come if Israeli soldiers keep shooting live
bullets.''
	   Earlier this week, after the most widespread West Bank clashes
in months, Netanyahu ordered troop commanders to take ``a firm
hand'' against rioters.
	   Arafat's West Bank security chief, Jibril Rajoub, said
Palestinian police would make sure there will be no violence during
the Clinton trip. ``I can assure you the situation will be quiet,''
he said.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After only a day on board,
Endeavour's astronauts began wrapping up work inside the new
international space station Friday for its release this weekend
from the shuttle.
	   ``We sure wish we had another day,'' commander Robert Cabana
radioed down. ``It's a shame we've got to close up shop so soon.''
	   Among the items left behind for the first permanent residents,
due to arrive in little over a year: wrenches, screwdrivers,
drills, a spare computer, a video-conferencing system and clothes.
There also was a surprise or two, but the astronauts wouldn't say
what.
	   ``Something that lets them know that we were thinking of them,''
Cabana hinted.
	   The five Americans and one Russian entered the seven-story,
35-ton station mounted in the shuttle cargo bay on Thursday.
Twenty-six hours later, they were to begin backing out compartment
by compartment, turning out the lights and closing the hatches
behind them.
	   Even if the crew accidentally left a light burning or a valve in
the wrong position, flight controllers had the ability to turn
anything on or off.
	   Before resealing the first of six hatches, the astronauts
removed bolts that had been installed to reinforce the components
for launch. Sergei Krikalev, the lone Russian cosmonaut, also
cleared a blocked air duct in Zarya, the Russian-built control
module.
	   The astronauts spent more than an hour searching for a missing
pivot pin for a rack inside Unity, the American-made chamber. The
pin got away from them and floated off. After removing panels and
peeking into corners, they finally gave up and moved on to other
close-out chores.
	   It may be a while before any of the five Americans see the
inside of the space station again, if ever. Krikalev, on the other
hand, is assigned to the first permanent crew and is scheduled to
move in with two other men in January 2000.
	   The shuttle astronauts still have more work to do on the
outside.
	   On Saturday, Jerry Ross and James Newman will float out for the
third and last time to attach a sack of tools to the space station
and fix a stuck antenna. On Sunday, the crew will set the station
loose to await the next construction mission in May.

DiMaggio pulls out of coma
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHEL LA CORTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio
awakened from a coma Friday, hours after he became unconscious
overnight and his doctor said his chances of recovery were slim.
	   ``You won't believe it but he's awake and he's moving his head
and grabbing my hand and squeezing it,'' Dr. Earl Barron said.
``It's completely unexpected. The coma that was present deeply this
morning is just not there now.''
	   On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best outlook, Barron
said DiMaggio was at 0.5 earlier in the morning and had improved to
a 1 by afternoon. An ``overwhelming'' lung infection had left him
near death.
	   ``It's still a very dire situation. The whole thing could change
in 15 minutes,'' he said.
	   He said DiMaggio's fever, which had shot up to 102 degrees
Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) overnight, was down again. He did
not give his exact temperature, but he said DiMaggio's lungs
sounded clear.
	   Barron said he had no medical explanation for the surprising
turnaround of the 84-year-old baseball great, adding that maybe all
the prayers contributed to it.
	   During a late-morning news conference, Barron said DiMaggio had
become comatose over the last 18 hours and ``this morning he was
unresponsive to any stimulation.''
	   ``I don't know how long but I would guess not very,'' Barron
said earlier of DiMaggio's life expectancy.
	   DiMaggio remained on a respirator to help him breathe, although
his blood pressure and heart and kidney functions were good. He was
not in any pain, Barron said.
	   DiMaggio would live only about a half-hour if he were taken off
the respirator, Barron said. There were no plans to remove him,
however.
	   His family was at the hospital, deciding whether to sign a ``do
not resuscitate'' order that would be followed only if DiMaggio's
heart stopped.
	   DiMaggio played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World Series in 13
seasons with the Yankees. He was a two-time batting champion and a
three-time most valuable player.
	   His 56-game hitting streak from 1941, one of the greatest feats
in all of sports, is still a record, and his marriage to Marilyn
Monroe in 1954 elevated his place in American culture.
	   He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years after his
retirement, and in 1969 was chosen as the greatest living baseball
player.
	   DiMaggio entered Memorial Regional Hospital Oct. 12 and had a
cancerous tumor removed from his right lung two days later. Fluid
was drained from his lungs several times since then and his blood
pressure dropped so rapidly on Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was
summoned to administer last rites.
	   The latest setback came after doctors drained fluid from his
lungs Thursday and said the congestion had improved temporarily.
	   DiMaggio has guarded his privacy intently since his retirement
from baseball in 1951, and information about his condition has been
tightly controlled.
	   His last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was honored at
Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine championship rings
that were stolen from his hotel room three decades ago. The New
York Yankees had wanted him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch
at the World Series, but by then, he was in the hospital.
	   He marked his 84th birthday in the hospital on Nov. 25,
surrounded by family, including his brother, Dom, and two
great-grandchildren.

Libyan oil minister says OPEC members should reduce production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Oil prices will not rise unless members of
the OPEC cartel reduce their production, Libyan Petroleum Minister
Abdalla Salem el-Badri said Friday.
	   Moreover, Libya's revenues will be dlrs 2 billion lower this
year than in 1997 because of the fall in the world price, Planning
Minister Gadallah Azouz al-Tolhi told the Libyan parliament.
	   This week the benchmark oil price of Brent futures fell to below
dlrs 10 - a 12-year low.
	   Analysts have put the fall down to a glut in the market caused
by overproduction and depressed demand owing to the economic
recession in Asia and the warm winter in the West.
	   ``Oil prices will not go up unless the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reduces production, because asking non-OPEC
members to reduce production is impossible,'' el-Badri told the
General People's Congress, or parliament, which is holding its
annual five-day meeting in the coastal town of Sirte, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted el-Badri as
saying Libya had lost a lot of money because of the collapse of oil
prices.
	   El-Badri did not give a figure, but later Friday Libyan
television showed al-Tolhi telling legislators that the country's
income from oil would be dlrs 2 billion lower this year.
	   OPEC President Youcef Yousfi said last month that member states
should reduce their combined production by up to 1.5 million
barrels a day in order to boost oil prices.
	   The members of OPEC are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Meeting between banana growers and striking workers called off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A scheduled meeting Friday
morning between banana growers and striking workers fell apart
because the growers' representatives refused to meet while
protesters continued to block the port.
	   The representatives of the growers decided not to negotiate as
long as the port is blocked by strikers, Louis Daniel Berthome,
farmers federation president, told RFO radio Friday.
	   On Thursday, the workers' union proposed opening the port to
allow the export of 20 containers of bananas, but growers refused
the offer, citing solidarity.
	   ``It was as if they asked us to choose among a hundred
containers, and the growers refused to negotiate on that basis,''
said Berthome.
	   Meanwhile, merchants said the inability to import goods right
before Christmas was increasingly hurting their businesses.

Democrats remind Republican chairman of his statementy saying they
</HEADLINE>
would have to agree &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Clinton,US-Clinton Impeachment &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DONALD M. ROTHBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Making their case against impeachment to the
U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Democrats remind Republican
Chairman Henry Hyde of his suggestion last January that ``at the
end of the day, the Democrats have to agree.''
	   When debate opened Friday on four articles of impeachment
against President Bill Clinton it was clear that no committee
Democrats were prepared to agree.
	   The vote to approve the first article of impeachment which
charged the president with perjury before a federal grand jury was
21 Republicans in favor and 16 Democrats opposed.
	   One issue on which all sides agreed during the impeachment
debate was the gravity of the process which could end with the
removal of president. How will the public react to taking that step
on a party-line vote within the committee?
	   ``They view a party-line vote as more of the same,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press which regularly surveys public opinion on a range of issues.
	   ``It makes people feel Washington is out of touch with their own
feelings on the subject,'' said Kohut, a nonpartisan pollster.
	   Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said he doesn't think the
public would be surprised by a party-line vote within the Judiciary
Committee. ``They'd be surprised if it were a party-line vote in
the full House,'' he said.
	   According to recent polls, almost six in 10 Americans disapprove
of the way Republicans in Congress are handling the investigation
of Clinton. Two thirds oppose impeachment and about six out of 10
favor censuring the president.
	   Newhouse acknowledged that the process contains risks for the
Republicans. ``They are in the process of impeaching a president
with 60 percent approval ratings,'' he said.
	   That risk increases the farther the process goes, reaching a
critical stage if the House votes next week to send articles of
impeachment to the Senate for a trial that could result in removal
of Clinton from office.
	   David Mayhew, a Yale historian who is an authority on divided
government, cases in which there is a president of one party and a
Congress controlled by the other party.
	   Mayhew said an impeachment trial in the Senate ``could pre-empt
time and energy'' Congress could spend on other issues.
	   On the other hand, he said, if the House rejects all proposed
impeachment articles the impact of the divisive process ``might
fade pretty quickly .''
	   Mayhew said that the long investigation of Clinton's involvement
with Monica Lewinsky and the allegations that he lied under oath
about it, have not seemed to impair his ability to function on
foreign and defense policy.
	   On domestic policy, said Mayhew, Clinton has been far less
successful and probably wasn't going to get his way with the
Republican Congress in any case.
	   Herbert S. Parmet, a historian and biographer of Presidents
Richard Nixon and George Bush, said the allegations against Clinton
fall far short of those brought against Nixon and Andrew Johnson.
	   He said the current process gives ``the impression of a partisan
ganging up on a president by individuals who loathed him from the
beginning.''

Haessler loser as Dortmund held to 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German international Thomas Haessler was the
tragic figure Friday as Borussia Dortmund was held to a 1-1
Bundesliga draw by last-place Borussia Moenchengladbach.
	   But Hertha Berlin celebrated a successful debut of highly touted
striker Piotr Reiss. Joining the side three days earlier, the
Polish player punched in his first shot and set off a 4-0 rout of
Hamburger SV.
	   Haessler, already fighting for a starting role, had another
setback when his penalty shot to win the match was stopped by
keeper Robert Enke in the 76th minute.
	   The veteran national team player has struggled since joining
Dortmund this season.
	   ``I don't belong to the team and I never will belong to this
team,'' Haessler said earlier in the week.
	   He had been benched to start the match and watched his
replacement, Vladimir But, shoot the team ahead in the 18th minute.
The Russian teenager kicked in a followup after Enke charged from
his cage to block the first try.
	   Austrian striker Toni Polster then equalized on a controversial
penalty six minutes later for Moenchengladbach, which picked up a
valuable point in its desperate fight against relegation.
	   Dortmund, stalled in its battle to rejoin the Bundesliga's top
teams, then lost its resolve and was booed at Westfalenstadium by
67,500 fans.
	   Sixth-place Berlin pulled even in points with Dortmund as Reiss,
who had drawn raves from his teammates in practice, kicked off
Hertha's biggest away win of the decade.
	   Reiss connected in the 22nd minute and the national team player
from Lech Posen almost added a second goal with a 20-meter (20
yards) blast late in the match.
	   Berlin won its third straight as Dariusz Wosz scored in the 50th
minute, Rene Tretschok in the 79th and Michael Preetz four minutes
later.

Fog disrupts traffic at Madrid airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Thick fog disrupted flights and brought
Madrid's main airport to a near standstill Friday, authorities
said.
	   The airport was operating at only 8 percent and only allowed
planes equipped to land in special conditions to touch down between
9 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) Saturday, Barajas airport
officials said in a statement.
	   Visibility was as low as 45 meters (145 feet) at the beginning
of the landing field.
	   More than half of the scheduled flights were delayed, and a
number were canceled outright. The airport estimated that tens of
thousands of passengers were affected.
	   Foggy conditions could continue Saturday, officials said.

Haitian government urges legal action against former dictator

Duvalier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The Haitian government is
encouraging Haitians to file lawsuits against former dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier a week after expatriates in France announced
plans for a suit.
	   ``Our government has certain documents relative to Duvalier's
situation and will do everything in its power'' to assist the
victims in filing suit, Interior Minister Jean Moliere told the
private Radio Haiti-Inter on Friday.
	   Encouraged by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean military
ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald Bloncourt
founded a committee a week ago to bring Duvalier to trial for
crimes against humanity.
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   His father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' had ruled Haiti
with an iron hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes,
his private militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and
tortured to death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians were killed
Friday in central Kosovo, Serb sources reported amid Albanian
accusations that Serbian authorities are reneging on international
commitments.
	   The three Albanians _ all known to be loyal to the Serbian
regime _ were shot while repairing a power station near the central
town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media Center in the provincial
capital Pristina said.
	   In a separate incident Friday, a group of armed Serb civilians
reportedly held six humanitarian workers hostage for three hours,
hoping to exchange them for Serb captives, said Palok Berishaj, a
representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian
group.
	   Police mediated their release in Nerodimlje, 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pristina, said Berishaj. The group reportedly
included five ethnic Albanians and one German.

 &UR; U.S., Russia to hold steel talks next week &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration has agreed to a
request by Russia to discuss how to avert penalty tariffs on
shipments of Russian steel into the United States.
	   Assistant Commerce Secretary Robert S. LaRussa will meet in
London next week with Russian trade officials to discuss a proposal
the Russian government has put forward to limit steel shipments,
officials at the White House and Commerce Department said Friday.
	   ``The Russians have asked us to come talk about a variety of
things including suspension,'' said Commerce Department spokesman
Morrie Goodman.
	   The Russians want the United States to suspend a case brought by
the steel industry accusing Russia of dumping steel in the United
States, or selling steel at unfairly low prices. The case, which
won't finally be decided until next summer, seeks stiff tariff
increases on certain kinds of steel shipments from Russia, Japan
and Brazil to halt a flood of cheap imports.
	   Weirton Steel Corp., the nation's eighth-largest producer, and
other companies say that Russia, Japan and Brazil are violating
U.S. trade laws with their exports. Brazil, Japan and Korea are
responsible for 80 percent of the recent increase in imported
steel, which now makes up about 40 percent of the U.S. market.
	   The global economic crisis has sent a number of Asian countries
and Russia into deep recessions that have cut sharply into foreign
demand for steel. Foreign makers have turned to the still healthy
U.S. market to unload their excess production.
	   Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have raised
the problems of the U.S. steel industry in meetings over the past
month with the leaders of Russia, Japan and South Korea.
	   While the overall U.S. economy has been able to withstand the
shocks from the global economic turmoil, the trade deficit has been
skyrocketing as American manufacturers have been hit by a double
whammy, the loss of key overseas export markets and increased
imports into the United States.
	   The steel industry has complained that imports are up 64 percent
this year, pushing down domestic prices and threatening thousands
of U.S. jobs.
	   Responding to the pressures from the domestic industry, the
House passed a nonbinding resolution in October asking Clinton to
impose one-year bans on low-cost steel imports from 10 nations.
	   Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic Strategy Institute
in Washington, said the administration is looking for a way to
defuse a foreign policy headache.
	   While the domestic steel industry and its union would like to
impose stiff tariffs, the administration wants to allow some
Russian steel shipments to continue as a way of providing support
for the beleaguered Russian economy.
	   ``The odds are very high that the administration will end up
negotiating some sort of voluntary restraint agreement to suspend
the dumping case,'' Mastel said.
	   Mastel said the administration has the power to suspend dumping
cases involving countries where the industry is state-owned. The
administration negotiated a voluntary restraint agreement involving
different types of steel imports from Russia and China last year.
	   As America's trade deficit surges to record highs this year and
next, the steel case could be the first of a number of dumping
cases filed, complaints alleging that products are being sold in
the United States at unfairly low prices _ either below the cost in
the home market or below the cost of production.
	   Other industries which could bring dumping cases in the future
are manufacturers of computer chips, machine tools, textiles and
autos.

Fresh in power, once-radical German Greens seek internal reform

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Green party, born out of protest
against establishment politics, decided Friday to become more
professional now that they're in power.
	   Delegates at a party convention voted to overhaul the party's
structure so it can hold its own as the junior partner in the new
Social Democratic-led government. Another goal is to avoid public
squabbles over policy.
	   ``People expect the Greens to show professionalism and
consistency as a governing party, and rightly so,'' party
co-chairwoman Gunda Roestel told the Leipziger Volkszeitung
newspaper.
	   Though many Greens cherish the party's traditionally loose
style, the proposals to give national leaders more power to direct
policy passed late Friday with the required two thirds majority of
the roughly 750 delegates meeting in the eastern city of Leipzig.
	   Delegates approved creating a new 30-member body to coordinate
among Greens lawmakers, the national leadership and local
activists. For the council, they also agreed to waive a
time-honored Greens rule excluding lawmakers and ministers from
holding party posts.
	   ``We want to strengthen ourselves in the competition with other
parties,'' outgoing party co-chairman Juergen Trittin told the
convention.
	   Once radical, the Greens won power at the national level for the
first time in September elections, snaring three Cabinet posts when
they agreed to join the Social Democrats in a coalition.
	   Leaders say the Greens must bolster their success by
strengthening internal organization and discipline. Antje Vollmer,
a top Green lawmaker, said the party in recent years had ``tended
to lose punch because of our complicated rules.''
	   On Saturday, the convention is expected to choose a new party
leadership, including an executive council slimmed down to five
members from nine.
	   A new party co-chair will be elected to replace Trittin, who
became environment minister in the new government. Antje Radcke, a
party left-winger like Trittin, is expected to win the post,
putting women in both leadership positions for the first time.

Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Incensed over the continued detention of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet in London, the government suspended the
exchange of visits and meetings with Spain and Britain on Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said Chile's ambassador to
London, Mario Artaza, had been ordered to remain in Chile
indefinitely.
	   The ambassador was called home earlier this week to protest
British Home Secretary Jack Straw's decision to allow Spain to
proceed with its attempts extradite Pinochet to face charges of
genocide and torture.
	   Insulza also announced Chile would join legal actions by
Pinochet's lawyers in London against Straw's decision and against
the vote in the House of Lords that determined Pinochet didn't have
immunity as a former head of state.
	   One of the actions the government is joining is the complaint
against Lord Leonard Hoffman, because of his ties with the human
rights group Amnesty International.
	   And the government is recommending private companies suspend
flights from Chilean territory to the British Falkland Islands off
Argentina, which claims the islands.
	   Pinochet remains under police custody in Britain on an
extradition request from Spain.
	   The government measures came the same day Pinochet made his
first public appearance, at a British court, since his Oct. 16
arrest.
	   Pinochet declared his innocence Friday in a ``letter to
Chileans'' released in his homeland.

Canada to compensate veterans captured by Japan at Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Almost 60 years after their capture during the
fall of Hong Kong, Canadian veterans will get compensation from
their government for years of slave labor in Japanese prisoner of
war camps.
	   About 700 veterans and surviving spouses will each get dlrs
24,000 (dlrs 15,600 U.S.), the government announced Friday.
	   ``This is an extraordinary payment to extraordinary individuals
who suffered extraordinary treatment in captivity,'' said Veterans
Affairs Minister Fred Mifflin.
	   The payment will total dlrs 18 million (dlrs 11.7 million U.S.)
and will come from Canadian federal funds, not from Japan.
	   Similar payments will go to a handful of Canadians captured by
the Japanese elsewhere in the Pacific and to 26 air force veterans
held by the Germans in the Buchenwald concentration camp for three
months in 1945.
	   The money isn't compensation for captivity, but for the forced
labor the Canadians performed in Japanese mines, docks and war
industries.
	   In November 1941, two Canadian regiments were sent to Hong Kong
as a token reinforcement of the garrison.
	   Hong Kong surrendered on Christmas Day. Of the 1,973 Canadians
in the fight, 290 were killed and 493 were wounded.
	   Just under 1,700 Canadians were taken prisoner and 265 died in
captivity.
	   Japan has refused extra compensation to former POWs, saying its
obligations were met in a 1952 treaty which gave each former
prisoner dlrs 1 for each day of captivity. In 1958, Canada kicked
in an extra 50 cents a day.
	   This fall, Japan's high court rejected a compensation suit filed
by a coalition of former Allied POWs. It cited the treaty as final.
	   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Canada has lobbied Japan
unsuccessfully on the subject for some time. The government decided
that time was too important for the aging vets to waste it on
prolonged legal fights, so it paid up on its own.
	   ``Our claim has always been against the Japanese government,''
said Roger Cyr, head of the Hong Kong Veterans Association. ``We
got absolutely nowhere.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a sixth round of talks Friday, North Korea
said several problems remain relating to a U.S. demand for access
to a North Korean site suspected of being used to develop nuclear
weapons.
	   North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said the talks
in New York and Washington were ``serious'' and had led to a better
understanding of each side's concerns. In this context, he said,
there was progress.
	   ``However, it's apparent there are differences,'' he said. ``We
will continue to talk to solve these differences.''
	   American negotiators, led by U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman,
had no comment. In Washington, however, State Department spokesman
James Foley agreed progress had been made and said the two sides
had decided to meet again as soon as possible.
	   ``Although gaps remain, the parties approached the issues in a
problem-solving manner,'' Foley said. ``The U.S. continued to
require the complete resolution of our concerns regarding North
Korea's suspect underground construction and has made clear this
will require access.''
	   The talks have been devoted exclusively to American concerns
about the North Korean project, which is said to involve thousands
of workers at an underground site. The site was detected on
satellite photos inside a mountain at Keumjang-ri, 25 miles (40
kilometers) northeast of the North's main nuclear complex at
Yongbyon.
	   While claiming the facility is for civilian use only, North
Korea says it would allow a one-time inspection for dlrs 300
million in compensation. Washington has rejected the North's offer.
	   ``There are some things we can give up and there are some things
we cannot give up,'' Kim told reporters outside the U.S. Mission to
the United Nations.''We cannot give up positions related to some
fundamental principles,'' he said, refusing to give any specifics.
	   The delegations met early this month in New York, continued
talks in Washington on Monday and Tuesday, then returned to New
York.
	   The United States says the North's reluctance to allow outside
inspectors violates a 1994 framework agreement with Washington to
freeze its nuclear program in return for two modern nuclear
reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion, substitute fuel oil and other
economic benefits.

DiMaggio has raised millions for hospital bearing his name

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio
always kept a low profile during his regular visits to the
children's hospital bearing his name, hoping to bring joy to its
young patients without calling attention to himself.
	   ``You'll see him ... sitting by a child's bedside telling a
story or you'll catch a glimpse of him peeking in at the babies and
asking about an infant's condition, or you'll see him signing
autographs for some little slugger who's recognized him,'' the
hospital's newsletter reads.
	   While the Hall of Famer was battling pneumonia and a lung
infection Friday at Memorial Regional Hospital, part of the medical
center that includes Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, more
cheerful images filled its corridors.
	   Black and white photos of a young, tall New York Yankees slugger
visiting children. Recent color shots of an older DiMaggio doing
the same.
	   ``I love these little guys, I really do,'' DiMaggio said during
the 1996 dedication of the hospital's pediatric emergency room, for
which he has helped raise millions of dollars.
	   ``I have grandchildren and I now have great-grandchildren. I
know the pains we all have to go through in watching over them.''
	   In the lobby is a display case with bats, dozens of unsigned
baseballs and a teddy bear with Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital
written across its chest.
	   ``The man really likes children, that's one of the reasons why
he lent his name to an institution like this,'' said Dr. Joseph
Angella, a pediatrician. ``He has a lot of warmth and a lot of very
deep feeling for children.''
	   A ``Hall of Fame'' greets visitors to the fourth floor of the
pediatrics wing, where a huge mural depicts memories from
DiMaggio's celebrated life. A Life magazine cover from Aug. 1,
1949, shows DiMaggio in pinstripes and flashing his famous smile.
The cover story is called ``It's Great to be Back.''
	   DiMaggio is pictured with such celebrities as Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner, former President Reagan, former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and actor Tom Selleck.
	   ``It's been very meaningful for this county to have his name
attached to the children's hospital,'' Angella said. ``It's instant
recognition of the greatest living sports legend.''
	   Framed posters in the elevator encourage riders to join the Joe
DiMaggio fan club. Visitors are led through the corridors of the
pediatrics wing by a trail of floor stencils bearing the hospital's
insignia _ a baseball glove holding a heart.
	   A bat signed by the former Yankees center fielder reads, ``To
all the children at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital _ a speedy
recovery.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on
Friday cleared a wealthy Russian businessman of charges that he
belonged to a criminal organization.
	   The outcome was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who had said
Sergei Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and should be
jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   ``You have told Switzerland and the whole world that in this
country there is democracy, law and equality,'' Mikhailov told the
four men and two women on the jury. His comments in Russian were
translated by the court interpreter.
	   While being acquitted on the more serious charges, Mikhailov was
found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated strict Swiss
property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying a villa near
Geneva.
	   The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he had spent
two years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   Prosecutors alleged Mikhailov, 40, was the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because prosecutors couldn't gather enough evidence in Russia.
	   Mikhailov consistently protested his innocence, although
conceded that he was ``very, very rich.''

jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   ``You have told Switzerland and the whole world that in this
country there is democracy, law and equality,'' Mikhailov told the
four men and two women on the jury. His comments in Russian were
translated by the court interpreter.
	   While being acquitted on the more serious charges, Mikhailov was
found guilty of a lesser charge that he violated strict Swiss
property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying a villa near
Geneva.
	   The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he had spent
two years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   Prosecutors alleged Mikhailov, 40, was the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on charges that
included the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped
because prosecutors couldn't gather enough evidence in Russia.
	   Mikhailov consistently protested his innocence, although
conceded that he was ``very, very rich.''

It's a main event to Vargas

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Fernando Vargas' bid for a
world title Saturday night is not billed as the main event, and he
couldn't care less.
	   ``Just as long as I'm getting a title shot,'' the 21-year-old
Vargas said. ``Gatti-Robinson is a great fight to be under.''
	   The second half of an HBO doubleheader in the Trump Taj Mahal
will be a 10-round rematch of their Aug. 22 bout, won by Robinson
on a split decision, which has has been called by some people the
fight of the year for 1998.
	   The telecast will open with the unbeaten Vargas' challenge in
only his 15th pro fight to IBF junior middleweight champion Yory
Boy Campas of Mexico, seeking his 73rd victory in his 75th fight.
	   Gatti, a former IBF junior lightweight champion, is the kind of
fighter television and most fans love. Win or lose, his fights are
never dull, and he has lost his last two, being stopped by Angel
Manfredy in the eighth of a brawl that preceded his
``take-no-prisoners'' loss to Robinson.
	   ``Absolutely,'' Gatti said when asked if it was the most
important match of his career.
	   ``In the back of my mind I know that Arturo Gatti has a lot
left,'' Robinson said. A third straight loss, however, could
severely damage Gatti's bargaining power. He and Robinson each are
getting dlrs 400,000.
	   The 27-year-old Campos is getting about dlrs 450,000, and
Vargas' purse is dlrs 180,000.
	   ``This time I will be the fighter I was supposed to be the first
time in August (in which he was the favorite),'' said the
26-year-old Gatti (29-3, 24 knockouts), of Jersey City, New Jersey.
``I'm going to win every round this time.''
	   ``I was a better man that night (the first fight) and I will be
a better man Saturday night,'' said the 27-year-old Robinson (26-2,
10 knockouts), of Philadelphia, the IBF's No. 2-ranked contender.
	   The contract weight limit is 136 pounds (61 kilograms), a pound
over the lightweight limit. Gatti weighed in officially Friday at
135 pounds (61 kgs), and Robinson weighed 133 3/4 pounds (60 kgs).
In this era of weigh-ins being held one or two days before a fight,
boxers often weigh much more than their official weights by fight
time. Gatti said he expects to go into the ring at about 150 pounds
(68 kgs). Robinson said he would weigh 142 or 143 pounds (64 kgs).
	   Campas and Vargas each weighed 151 pounds (68 kgs), three pounds
under the junior middleweight limit.
	   Some boxing people wonder if Vargas (14-0, 14 knockouts), of
Oxnard Calif., has enough experience to handle a power-puncher the
caliber of Campos (72-2, 62 knockouts), who will be making his
fourth title defense.
	   Vargas, however, said he's confident he has the speed and
movement to offset the straight-ahead style of the champion. and he
also noted that he also can punch with power.
	   With a victory, Vargas would join Floyd Mayweather, IBF super
featherweight champion, as the only members of the 1996 U.S.
Olympic boxing team to win world titles.

Steamboat has the goods for Olympic training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colorado (AP) _ The wheeling and dealing is
about to begin for 2002 Olympic training sites, and this ranching,
mining and resort community 165 miles (265 kilometers) northwest of
Denver is holding some pretty good cards.
	   ``It started last spring. Nations started showing up unannounced
to look us over,'' U.S. Nordic combined coach Tom Steitz said
Friday after ski jump training for Saturday's second round of the
Sprint Ski Town USA World Cup at Howelsen Hill.
	   Steitz, a Steamboat Springs resident, pointed to a
representative of the Norwegian Olympic Committee who he said was
scouting the community as a potential training base.
	   Steamboat Springs' elevation of 6,700 feet (2,010 meters) is
approximately the same as Park City, Utah, site of Alpine and
freestyle skiing plus snowboarding in 2002. Steamboat Springs is
also in the same time zone and receives the same powder snow as the
Salt Lake City region.
	   ``And, at worst, it's just a five-hour drive,'' Steitz said.
	   ``I think it's a no-brainer,'' Rod Hanna, vice president of
marketing for Steamboat Ski and Resort Corp., said. ``Steamboat has
the facilities, we have the experience, the athletes love to be
here.''
	   In addition to the World Cup this week, Steamboat will host a
freestyle skiing World Cup Jan. 15-17 and has staged Alpine World
Cup races. The community points with pride to a ski heritage that
includes over 40 athletes sent to various Olympics.
	   Also coming into consideration is an Olympic edict, in the name
of fair play, against training on an Olympic venue before a Winter
Games opens so the host nation doesn't get a competitive advantage.
	   ``Right now,'' Steitz said, ``every nation's trying to figure
where to go to build a base camp before the Olympics. Most of that
is run by the nation's Olympic Committee, not the ski association,
and the Olympic Committees are very big on the family approach, on
keeping the whole (Olympic) team together.
	   ``If it was the ski team, they'd let the Alpiners go here, let
the jumpers go there, and the freestylers, well ... but you take a
country like Norway and their Olympic Committee gives the teams
money to prep, so they want everybody in one spot,'' Steitz said.
``The only real spot you can do that is Steamboat Springs because
Park City (ski jump complex) isn't built yet.
	   ``So, we've had two or three nations show up unannounced _ their
Olympic Committees, the big shots, vice presidents and all _ and
they're running around trying to figure out where they'll put their
base camp. Norway has someone here now and they had two top guys
from the Olympic Committee here in June, who made the tour from the
hospital to the schools to everywhere.''
	   He said Austria, Italy and Germany also have studied Steamboat.
Before the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, he said German,
Austrian, Italian and Japanese teams trained here.
	   ``I think you'll start to see summer training here, and all fall
training, and some winter training. They'll be here in summer and
fall because they can't be here in winter; you don't have the
freedom in winter because we're all on the different World Cup
circuits,'' according to Steitz.
	   ``I think you could easily see Norway's Alpine teams and Nordic
teams, men's and women's, in Steamboat in August to train. I think
America's approach, though, is `We're at home, we know our way
around' and I'm not sure what my (coaching) counterparts will be
doing.''
	   The economic benefits for the city are obvious. ``It could be a
monster media coup with so much copy coming out of here,'' Steitz
said, although he isn't sure it would be the best thing for his
athletes, all of whom now live and train in Steamboat.
	   Hanna brought the Sprint Ski Town USA tournee to Steamboat
Springs before Salt Lake City got the Olympics and is ever the
voice of caution despite his aggressive marketing strategies which
have positioned Steamboat as one of the nation's premier skiing
playpens. He expects to see the ``research'' by other nations only
become more intense.

Fergie's father tells of cancer battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Maj. Ronald Ferguson, father of the Duchess of
York, revealed Friday night that he has been battling prostate
cancer for the past two years.
	   His disclosure came two months after the death of the duchess's
mother, Susan Barrantes, in a car crash in Argentina.
	   Speaking to Independent Television News, the 67-year-old said he
wanted to spread awareness of the most common form of cancer among
men.
	   He said he was diagnosed with the disease, which is now in
remission, two years ago after a routine medical check-up, but had
kept it secret from his family until treatment was underway.
	   ``I kept it from everybody except for my wife,'' he said.
	   Ferguson said when he eventually broke the news of his illness
to the duchess, with whom he has a very close relationship, she was
very supportive.
	   ``You can never get used to that word, ``cancer,'' when it is
with a direct relation. Cancer is something that hits straight away
and because you hear about so many cases of people with cancer
dying, immediately cancer is connected with death,'' he said. ``But
it doesn't have to be, far from it in my case. It doesn't have to
be.''

NHL rookies getting passing grades after attending U.S. colleges

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. college kids are coming.
	   Led by players such as Florida's Mark Parrish and Vancouver's
Bill Muckalt, many of the top candidates for this season's National
Hockey League rookie of the year award have come out of American
schools.
	   ``The trend is that more and more Division I players are working
their way into the NHL,'' said Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson,
a Canadian who was one of the first players to jump to the NHL from
an American college.
	   ``Thirty-five years ago, they told me I'd never be a pro.
There's still an element (of that type of thinking), but it's
changing dramatically. Players are coming out at that level and are
competitive.''
	   American colleges have always produced good players, and even
produced a Calder winner once in a while. Generally, though, that
trophy winds up in the hands of a European or someone from the
Canadian junior ranks.
	   The last American college product to win the Calder was
goaltender Ed Belfour of the Chicago Blackhawks in 1991. Belfour
now plays for the Dallas Stars. The '90s have belonged mostly to
the Europeans, with seven winning the award in the last nine years.
	   There are also some top European candidates this season,
including Colorado's Milan Hejduk, Florida's Oleg Kvasha and Los
Angeles' Olli Jokinen.
	   Rookies who have held their own this season coming out of the
Canadian junior ranks include Chicago's Dan Cleary and Mike
Maneluk; Manny Malhotra of the New York Rangers; and Tampa Bay's
Vincent Lecavalier.
	   But none of them will stand a chance if Parrish and Muckalt
continue to play the way they have for the rest of the season.
	   Parrish, an Edina, Minnesota native who played at St. Cloud
State in Minnesota, led all NHL rookies in goals with 10 going into
the weekend. Muckalt, a native of Surrey, British Columbia, who
played at Michigan, was first in points with 17. Parrish and Hejduk
were tied for second with 15.
	   Five of the top eight scorers among rookies in the NHL came out
of colleges.
	   Parrish was voted the NHL's rookie of the month for October and
Muckalt finished runner-up to Jokinen for the award in November.
	   Among other rookies from American colleges off to fast starts:
New Jersey's Brendan Morrison (Michigan); the New York Islanders'
Mike Watt (Michigan State); Edmonton's Tom Poti and Colorado's
Chris Drury (both Boston University); St. Louis' Marty Reasoner
(Boston College); and Anaheim's Mike Crowley (Minnesota).
	   In his time, Berenson was unique _ a Canadian who actually
ignored the time-tested Canadian juniors to take the U.S. college
route to the NHL. Now, more and more Canadians are doing the same.
	   A big plus for American collegians is the age and maturity
factor. Players drafted out of Canadian juniors are no older than
18. With some exceptions, few of them step right into the NHL and
make an immediate impact. Very often, they are sent back to their
junior team for more seasoning, or play with a minor league pro
affiliate of the NHL team.
	   While American collegians don't always finish the full four
years of their scholarship, they are usually older when coming into
the NHL.
	   ``No question, they're more developed physically and mentally,''
Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said of the collegians. ``And
they probably make a greater impact when they do make an NHL
team.''
	   While Canadian junior teams play a longer, tougher schedule to
reflect the type of play in the NHL, American colleges have an
advantage in training because they have more days to practice
during a 30- to 35-game schedule.
	   ``The practice-to-game ratio is different,'' Berenson said. ``We
play two games and practice at least four times a week. The players
have the opportunity to handle the puck more and develop skills,
kind of like European hockey.''
	   Parrish, who also played one year in Canadian juniors before
advancing to the NHL, felt the bigger ice surfaces at many college
rinks help develop offensive skills.
	   ``The college game is more of a skill game than junior hockey,''
he said. ``Junior hockey is rough and tumble, smaller rinks, a lot
of big guys on the ice. In college hockey, there are a lot of
Olympic-size rinks. There's not as much body contact, (and) it
pretty much forces you to skate more, handle the puck more.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Making their case against impeachment to the
U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Democrats remind Republican
Chairman Henry Hyde of his suggestion last January that ``at the
end of the day, the Democrats have to agree.''
	   When debate opened Friday on four articles of impeachment
against President Bill Clinton it was clear that no committee
Democrats were prepared to agree.
	   The vote to approve the first article of impeachment which
charged the president with perjury before a federal grand jury was
21 Republicans in favor and 16 Democrats opposed.
	   On the second article, charging Clinton with perjury in the
Paula Jones case, Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina
joined Democrats in opposition. The other 20 Republicans voted in
favor, making the tally 20-17.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks rallied in the last hour of
trading, nearly erasing a full day's losses, but were still in
negative territory at the end of the session. The Dow Jones
industrial average dropped just 19.82 at 8,821.76. The Dow's slide
occurred Friday despite a positive report from the Commerce
Department that showed shoppers opened the holiday season by
spending freely at department stores and auto showrooms in
November, pushing sales up by a strong 0.6 percent. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seeking to diversify and strengthen its worldwide
soft drinks business, Coca-Cola Co. said Friday it is buying
Cadbury Schweppes' beverage brands in more than 120 countries in a
deal estimated at dlrs 1.85 billion. Both companies said that the
transaction, which covers Schweppes and Canada Dry mixers, Dr
Pepper and Crush, does not apply to the United States, where
Cadbury Schweppes will still produce Dr Pepper, 7UP and other
brands. The deal means that a Schweppes mixer ordered in a New York
or Los Angeles bar will still be made by England-based Cadbury
Schweppes PLC, but the same mixer bought in London will be made by
Coke. The businesses being sold to Coca-Cola generated 56 million
pounds (dlrs 89 million) in trading profits, around 9 percent of
the group's total, in 1997. (COCA COLA-CADBURY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament moved Friday to limit the amount of
money the government can print, part of an effort to rein in
inflation that's at 70 percent this year and threatening to spiral
out of control. As Russia wrestles with its economic crisis, one of
the trickiest questions is how much money President Boris Yeltsin's
government should inject into the economy. More money helps
stimulate the weak economy, but it also stokes inflation. Since a
financial meltdown in August, the government has pumped billions of
rubles into the economy in a bid to revive ailing banks and pay off
state workers whose wages are months overdue. Despite these huge
obligations, the government may print only 25 billion additional
rubles (dlrs 1.3 billion) in the final quarter of this year.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's finance minister promised
Friday that his cash-strapped government would meet its debt
payments despite financial troubles that he said have been
exacerbated by international economic sanctions. Pakistan has to
make a dlrs 300 million payment on a variety of loans from
international lenders and import bills by mid-January to stave off
default, something it will do, Ishaq Dar said. ``We will make all
our payments,'' Dar said. It's expected the money will come from
the International Monetary Fund, which has negotiated a dlrs 5.5
billion loan to Pakistan. The first installment of that loan will
come after the agreement gets its final approval from the IMF board
of directors, which is to meet in January, said Dar.
(PAKISTAN-ECONOMY)
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rover auto workers voted Friday to
accept a radical restructuring deal that will cut 2,500 jobs but
keep Birmingham's huge Longbridge assembly plant open, the company
and union leaders said. The deal will lead to hundreds of millions
of pounds (dollars) of new investment by Rover's owners BMW,
including the building at the Longbridge factory of a new Mini, a
compact model that had been the company's biggest-selling car.
Ratification of the deal calmed fears that Longbridge could close,
causing the loss of 14,000 jobs at the plant and thousands of
others across England. (BRITAIN-ROVER)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The boardroom drama at India's state-run
international carrier and the domestic airline took a new turn
Friday as the government fired the board of the two companies and
made fresh appointments, domestic news agencies reported. P.V.
Jayakrishna was named the new chairman of Air India, and Anil
Baijal will be chairman and managing director of Indian Airlines,
Press Trust of India and United News of India reported. Both are
senior bureaucrats in the federal Civil Aviation ministry. The
announcement is seen as part of government efforts to streamline
management and plug huge losses in both airlines. Friday's decision
came days after the ministry announced that the two companies would
be controlled by a common holding company, a step away from a
possible merger. (INDIA-AIRLINES)

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a jarring blend of constitutional drama and
partisan struggle, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary
Committee approved two articles of impeachment Friday against
President Bill Clinton on grounds of perjury. Clinton pleaded for
the lesser punishment of ``censure and rebuke.'' The votes along
party lines set the stage for a momentous showdown next week on the
floor of the House. The panel rendered its verdict on the first
article of impeachment just moments after Clinton stepped before
the television cameras with his extraordinary public apology.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jet trying to land
in a heavy rainstorm plunged into a swamp Friday and burst into
flames, but at least 50 of the 146 people aboard survived,
officials and witnesses said. Thai Airways Flight TG261 from
Bangkok went down about 6:45 p.m. three miles (five kilometers)
from the airport in Surat Thani, a fishing port and travel hub for
vacation resorts 330 miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
Slogging through a swamp, rescue workers struggled to pull bodies
from the charred wreckage. The rescue operation was scaled back
early Saturday due to dark, rainy conditions and was to fully
resume after daybreak. By 4 a.m., police and workers had discovered
44 bodies among the burnt, twisted metal of the plane. Two were
identified as Westerners. Scores more bodies were still trapped in
the plane, many of them burned beyond recognition, police said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Seated dour-faced in a wheelchair, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet on Friday made his first public appearance since his
arrest on a Spanish extradition warrant and declared no foreign
court has jurisdiction to try him ``against all the lies of
Spain.'' Afterward, the former Chilean dictator, facing charges of
genocide and torture, was whisked from a heavily guarded court in
southeast London, past rival groups of shouting protesters and
supporters. He returned to his rented English country mansion under
new bail conditions _ now, he can use the garden. The 83-year-old
general, wearing a pinstriped brown suit, looked grimly
disapproving during most of the 30-minute hearing at the
high-security Belmarsh Magistrate's Court. ``With respect to your
honor, I don't recognize the jurisdiction of any other court but in
my country to try me against all the lies of Spain,'' he said,
reading huskily in Spanish from a card, as an interpreter
translated into English. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   QALQILIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops opened fire Friday on
hundreds of Palestinian stone-throwers, killing two and injuring
dozens in a new outbreak of violence just a day before President
Clinton's arrival in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he would not budge from his demand that
the Palestinians must meet a list of conditions before he will
carry out the West Bank troop withdrawal he promised in the Wye
River agreement. Netanyahu suggested even Clinton would not make
him change his mind. ``We do not change our opinions, our positions
on account of this or that circumstance,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israel TV's Channel One. The new violence and
Netanyahu's tough talk made it more likely that Clinton's three-day
visit, intended to usher in the second stage of the Wye agreement,
will not go smoothly and that the president will be drawn into the
disputes between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army
signaled Friday it won't start disarming in support of the Belfast
peace accord, complicating efforts to make the deal work. An IRA
spokesman told the Irish national broadcasters RTE in Dublin and
the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast that the outlawed group's
senior members ``firmly ruled out'' at a secret weekend convention
any start to disarmament. The IRA has previously dismissed calls to
begin destroying its stockpiled armaments, even though April's
accord specified that should be completed by May 2000. The group
has many tons of weaponry, mostly smuggled from Libya in the
mid-1980s and buried in bunkers in the Irish Republic. Belfast
politicians said the latest statement seemed a deliberate response
to Thursday's conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on David Trimble
and John Hume, the province's top Protestant and Catholic leaders.

Cuban dissidents scuffle with communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Communist youth overwhelmed a planned
demonstration by Cuban dissidents in Havana, and police led away at
least one dissident, witnesses said.
	   Dissidents had planned a demonstration Thursday in a Havana park
in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. About 50 members of a Communist Party youth group
held a party in the same place.
	   When reporters arrived at the park, one man shouted ``Freedom
for prisoners!'' Some of the youths scuffled with the man and
police took him away, witnesses said. It was unclear whether he was
formally arrested.
	   Several youths surrounded photographers, blocking them from
taking pictures of the dissidents, the witnesses said.
	   Also Thursday, relatives of four prominent dissidents awaiting
trial in Cuba urged the government to either try or free them. The
dissidents were arrested in July 1997, but their relatives said
they still had no word of a trial date. They were charged with
sedition in September.
	   Their jailing came after they criticized the Communist Party for
not presenting solutions to the country's economic crisis, and
after they held two news conferences with foreign journalists.

China's military to quit business on time, sort of
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From mobile phone services to stomach medicines
on pharmacy shelves, the commercial power of China's armed forces
touches every facet of Chinese life.
	   Come next week, while the glittering office towers and popular
products will remain unchanged, their ties to China's military are
supposed to end as part of a campaign against corruption.
	   The Communist Party has given the People's Liberation Army and
the People's Armed Police until mid-December to transfer their vast
business holdings to civilian control.
	   State media is expected to announce _ perhaps as early as Monday
_ that the military has made the deadline. But for all the likely
fanfare, crucial questions remain about ownership and compensation,
said Gerald Segal of London's International Institute of Strategic
Studies.
	   ``The devil is in those details. The political battle is in
those details. The money is in those details. All that counts is in
those details. And until you see that you can't be confident'' the
divestment will happen, Segal said.
	   The 2.9-million member People's Liberation Army, the world's
largest military, controls over 15,000 enterprises alone. Started
up in the 1980s to make up for budget cuts, the enterprises covered
a third of the military's operating expenses as of a few years ago.
	   While the PLA might welcome getting rid of thousands of small,
money-losing factories making munitions and other military goods,
its commercial ventures are more successful. The holdings of what
has been called PLA Inc. include the maker of a popular
stomach-ache remedy, a swanky tourist hotel and a conglomerate that
trades arms internationally.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who also heads the Communist
Party commission in charge of the military, ordered the divestment
this past summer to reduce corruption and spur efforts to make the
armed forces more professional.
	   Since then, the campaign has been broadened to include
government agencies and the judiciary, which have until the year's
end to cut their business ties.
	   A spokesman for the State Economic and Trade Commission, which
is overseeing the transfer, said Friday that the government-run
Xinhua News Agency may announce the completion of the military
divestment on Monday.
	   In the run-up, state media have run daily accounts of transfers,
lending a sense of momentum to the campaign. Military commands from
the frozen northeast to the balmy southwest have announced the
handover of hundreds of enterprises to civilian authorities.
	   Most of the companies have been small, and absent in the reports
are any details of how the new system is supposed to operate.
	   Under a three-part plan provided by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the transfer of businesses taking place this month is
largely ceremonial. Only afterwards, in the plan's third phase,
will special multi-agency task forces begin shifting assets and
merging money-losing enterprises.
	   Segal, the China scholar, sees in this strategy the same caution
that has derailed key programs to reform decrepit state industries
or debt-laden state banks.
	   With Asia's financial troubles slowing economic growth and
shrinking investment, Chinese leaders are worried about the
potential for more market-oriented reforms to unleash social
unrest.
	   The PLA's own newspaper has hinted that morale among officers is
already low as state enterprises lay off millions of workers, among
them the wives and family members of servicemen.
	   The PLA remains a potent political force that Jiang and other
top leaders ignore at their risk. True divestment means shutting
down more enterprises, laying off more workers and giving more of
scarce government funds to the military, Segal said.
	   ``They recognize the problems that they have and this is one of
them. But they're just in no position to really seize it,'' he
said.

U.S., Russia to hold steel talks next week
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration has agreed to a
request by Russia to discuss how to avert penalty tariffs on
shipments of Russian steel into the United States.
	   Assistant Commerce Secretary Robert S. LaRussa will meet in
London next week with Russian trade officials to discuss a proposal
the Russian government has put forward to limit steel shipments,
officials at the White House and Commerce Department said Friday.
	   ``The Russians have asked us to come talk about a variety of
things including suspension,'' said Commerce Department spokesman
Morrie Goodman.
	   The Russians want the United States to suspend a case brought by
the steel industry accusing Russia of dumping steel in the United
States, or selling steel at unfairly low prices. The case, which
won't finally be decided until next summer, seeks stiff tariff
increases on certain kinds of steel shipments from Russia, Japan
and Brazil to halt a flood of cheap imports.
	   The global economic crisis has sent a number of Asian countries
and Russia into deep recessions that have cut sharply into foreign
demand for steel. Foreign makers have turned to the still healthy
U.S. market to unload their excess production.
	   Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have raised
the problems of the U.S. steel industry in meetings over the past
month with the leaders of Russia, Japan and South Korea.
	   While the overall U.S. economy has been able to withstand the
shocks from the global economic turmoil, the trade deficit has been
skyrocketing as American manufacturers have been hit by a double
whammy, the loss of key overseas export markets and increased
imports into the United States.
	   The steel industry has complained that imports are up 64 percent
this year, pushing down domestic prices and threatening thousands
of U.S. jobs.
	   Responding to the pressures from the domestic industry, the
House passed a nonbinding resolution in October asking Clinton to
impose one-year bans on low-cost steel imports from 10 nations.
	   Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic Strategy Institute
in Washington, said the administration is looking for a way to
defuse a foreign policy headache.
	   While the domestic steel industry and its union would like to
impose stiff tariffs, the administration wants to allow some
Russian steel shipments to continue as a way of providing support
for the beleaguered Russian economy.
	   ``The odds are very high that the administration will end up
negotiating some sort of voluntary restraint agreement to suspend
the dumping case,'' Mastel said.
	   Mastel said the administration has the power to suspend dumping
cases involving countries where the industry is state-owned. The
administration negotiated a voluntary restraint agreement involving
different types of steel imports from Russia and China last year.
	   As America's trade deficit surges to record highs this year and
next, the steel case could be the first of a number of dumping
cases filed, complaints alleging that products are being sold in
the United States at unfairly low prices _ either below the cost in
the home market or below the cost of production.
	   Other industries which could bring dumping cases in the future
are manufacturers of computer chips, machine tools, textiles and
autos.

	   NEWE SHALOM, Israel (AP) _ While her husband tries to shore up a
fragile Mideast peace, Hillary Rodham Clinton will watch Arab and
Jewish children demonstrate with playful ease what grown-ups in
this troubled land find so difficult to do _ how to get along.
	   Emphasizing programs that put children first, Mrs. Clinton has
chosen to visit an Israeli-Palestinian kindergarten, an Israeli
preschool enrichment program she helped bring to Arkansas and a
rehabilitation center for handicapped Palestinian children.
	   ``I want her to see that there's a possibility for Palestinians
and Jews, with all their differences of opinion, to live
together,'' said Ayshe Najar, a Palestinian kindergarten teacher at
the Newe Shalom village Mrs. Clinton will tour during a three-day
presidential trip to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Nestled in a hill and surrounded by olive groves, Newe Shalom
was founded 22 years ago by a Dominican monk who wanted to show
that Arabs and Jews could live in the same community. However, the
idea has not caught on and throughout Israel, Arabs and Jews still
largely live in separate towns, villages and neighborhoods.
	   On Friday, scores of American and Israeli security officials
combed the community of 36 families to make final arrangements for
Mrs. Clinton's visit.
	   Resident Howard Shipper said Newe Shalom, Hebrew for ``A New
Peace,'' was not insulated from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	   ``Of course there's a lot of friction, just like in any small
community,'' Shipper said, strolling along the flower-lined streets
that give way to breathtaking views of the Jerusalem hills on one
end and Tel Aviv on the other.
	   All residents speak Hebrew and Arabic and the mayor's job
rotates between Arabs and Jews.
	   Mrs. Clinton will visit the kindergarten, painted in yellow and
red, where nine preschoolers from Newe Shalom and 19 from
surrounding towns are taught.
	   On Friday, two children wrestled on the nap couch, nearly
tearing down the Arabic and Hebrew alphabet posters on a wall
behind them. Three low tables with tiny chairs stood neatly in the
center of the room.
	   One table held a Menorah, or eight-armed candelabra used during
the Jewish Hanukkah holiday, a foot (0.30 meter)-high Christmas
tree and a small Fanous lantern, a traditional gift for children
during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Mrs. Clinton was to light all three during her visit, and the
children have been sketching the objects to learn more about each
other's religions.
	   Mrs. Clinton and Sarah Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, will also visit an ``Etgar,'' Hebrew
for ``Challenge,'' an enrichment program that teaches poor Jewish
and Arab parents how to teach their preschool children.
	   Etgar officials said Mrs. Clinton helped bring the program to
Arkansas more than a decade ago as HIPPY, or Home Instruction
Pre-School Program Youngsters, after hearing about it on a radio
program.
	   Soha Arafat, wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, will take
Mrs. Clinton to Palestine's Future, a rehabilitation center for
physically and mentally handicapped children.
	   The center is housed in a two-story villa near the Arafats'
guest house in Gaza City. This week, workers were erecting a stage
in the front yard where the 65 children ages 5 to 12 at the center
will display crafts they have prepared for Mrs. Clinton's visit.
	   Children and families is the theme running through Mrs.
Clinton's separate schedule during President Clinton's three-day
trip to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
	   In addition to the school programs, Mrs. Clinton will tour the
Mother and Child Care Pavilion at Hadassah Medical Center in
Jerusalem and meet with the families of four Israeli soldiers who
have been missing in action since the 1980s.
	   Mrs. Clinton will accompany the president to Gaza on Monday, but
go out on her own while he is meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. Among her stops: a visit to a women's center at the
Beach Refugee Camp designed to teach refugee women skills necessary
for improving their economic standing and to a Palestinian center
for disabled children.

Three ethnic Albanians killed amid strains on fragile Kosovo peace

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians were killed
Friday in Kosovo, Serb sources reported, and signs of strain on the
fragile truce in the province were growing.
	   The Albanians _ all known to be loyal to the Serbian regime _
were shot while repairing a power station near the central town of
Glogovac, said the Serb-run Media Center in the provincial capital
of Pristina.
	   In a separate incident Friday, a group of armed Serb civilians
reportedly held six humanitarian workers hostage for three hours,
hoping to exchange them for Serb captives, said Palok Berishaj, a
representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian
group.
	   Police mediated their release in Nerodimlje, 18 miles south of
Pristina, said Berishaj. The group reportedly included five ethnic
Albanians and one German.
	   Neither report could be independently confirmed.
	   In a further sign of strain to the fragile peace in Serbia's
southern province, Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian party accused
the Serb government of reneging on international commitments by
blocking the first European probe into war atrocities.
	   On Thursday, Serb police using armored vehicles prevented a team
of Finnish forensic experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic
Albanians allegedly massacred at a site in central Kosovo. Belgrade
insists Serbian officials accompany the team. The Albanians say
that if Serbs can go they must be allowed as well, a condition the
Serbs reject.
	   The Finnish team, working under a European Union mandate, was to
begin exhumations at the site _ the first in a series of six Kosovo
locations to which Belgrade had previously granted access.
	   ``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities
in trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' said Tino
Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 forced from
their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, a southern
province in Serbia dominated by ethnic Albanians.
	   Yugoslavia is composed of Serbia and Montenegro, and, under
threat of NATO airstrikes, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed Oct. 12 to end the crackdown.
	   Also on Friday, the Albanian side accused Serbs of preparing new
offensives, claiming they had brought in new military and police
reinforcements in the past week.
	   Meanwhile, the international Contact Group for the Balkans
warned Friday in Paris that ``time was running out,'' and urged
direct talks between the two sides. So far, U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill has been shuttling between them.
	   A command center opened Thursday in Macedonia for a NATO
``extraction force'' that will rescue, if necessary, the 2,000
international monitors who will oversee the truce in Kosovo.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ After only a day on board,
Endeavour's astronauts turned off the lights and closed the doors
of the new international space station Friday for its release this
weekend from the shuttle.
	   ``We sure wish we had another day,'' commander Robert Cabana
radioed down. ``It's a shame we've got to close up shop so soon.''
	   Among the items left behind for the first permanent residents,
due to arrive in little over a year: wrenches, screwdrivers,
drills, a spare computer, a video-conferencing system and clothes.
There also was a surprise or two, but the astronauts wouldn't say
what.
	   ``Something that lets them know that we were thinking of them,''
Cabana hinted.
	   The five Americans and one Russian entered the seven-story,
35-ton station mounted in the shuttle cargo bay on Thursday.
Twenty-seven hours later, they began backing out compartment by
compartment, pulling out the air ducts, turning off the lights and
closing the hatches behind them.
	   Even if the crew accidentally left a light burning or a valve in
the wrong position, flight controllers had the ability to turn
anything on or off.
	   Before resealing the first hatch, the astronauts removed bolts
that had been installed to reinforce the components for launch.
Krikalev, the lone Russian cosmonaut, also cleared a blocked air
duct in Zarya, the Russian-built control module.
	   The astronauts spent more than an hour searching for a missing
pivot pin for a rack inside Unity, the American-made chamber. The
pin got away from them and floated off. After removing panels and
peeking into corners, they finally gave up and moved on to other
close-out chores.
	   They couldn't resist doing a few final flips and somersaults
inside the empty, spacious Unity on their way out.
	   It may be a while before any of the five Americans see the
inside of the space station again, if ever. Krikalev, on the other
hand, is assigned to the first permanent crew and is scheduled to
move in with two other men in January 2000.
	   The shuttle astronauts still have more work to do on the
outside.
	   On Saturday, Jerry Ross and James Newman will float out for the
third and last time to attach a sack of tools to the space station
and fix a stuck antenna. On Sunday, the crew will set the station
loose to await the next construction mission in May.

	   Oddsmakers at the MGM Grand Hotel, where the fight will be held
Jan. 16, made Tyson a 6-1 favorite in man-to-man betting. Bettors
will have to wager dlrs 7 to win dlrs 1 on Tyson, while those
favoring Botha could win dlrs 5 for every dlrs 1 bet.
	   It will be the first fight in 19 months for Tyson, who was a
slight underdog when he and Holyfield met in their second fight.

Woman gives birth to baby by dead husband
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The woman who won a two-year legal battle over the
right to her dead husband's sperm, has given birth to a baby boy.
	   Diane Blood gave birth to Liam Stephen Blood at 8:15 p.m. local
time at Jessop Hospital, in Sheffield on Friday. Mother and baby _
5 pounds, 13 ounces _ are both doing very well, Mrs. Blood's father
Mike McMahon said.
	   Her husband, Stephen, died of meningitis in 1995 at the age of
30.
	   She persuaded doctors to remove sperm from his body while he was
on a life-support machine, but because it was taken without Mr.
Blood's consent, doctors were not allowed to release it from where
it was being stored.
	   The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, the government
regulatory agency, barred the use of the sperm in Britain because
Mrs Blood, who had been married to her husband for four years, did
not have his written permission.
	   Mrs. Blood, now in her early 30s, then launched an emotional
legal battle to win the right to take the sperm abroad to undergo
fertility treatment banned in Britain. Her case won wide public
sympathy.
	   The Court of Appeal, in February 1997, ruled that the authority
rightly had banned her insemination in Britain, but it had not been
properly advised that under European Union laws Mrs. Blood was
entitled to be treated in another member country. The court then
turned the final decision over to the government authority, which
decided she could take the sperm abroad for treatment.
	   A Belgian clinic, the Brussels Free University, agreed to carry
out insemination.
	   ``Everybody has been working for this and I am so chuffed for
Diane and for Stephen as well,'' said Paul Plante, a friend of Mr.
Blood's. ``This is exactly what Stephen had wanted.''

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ An explosion destroyed an illegal
fireworks factory in northeastern Brazil, killing 19 people and
injuring 60, police said.
	   ``There were a lot of people, many of them women, working in the
building when the explosion happened,'' police officer Paulo
Raimundo de Souza said Friday by telephone. ``It seems like they
had been working flat-out because there is a big demand for
fireworks at this time of year with New Year's Eve coming up
shortly.''
	   The explosion happened at 11:30 a.m. on the outskirts of Santo
Antonio de Jesus, 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers) northeast of Rio,
he said.
	   Nine of the dead were children who had been working in the
factory, reported TV Globo.
	   The cause of the explosion was unclear, but it appears to have
been an accident, Souza said. It happened in a house that was being
used as a factory.
	   The blast also badly damaged three nearby houses, he added.
	   Firefighters continued to search for people in the burned
remains of the factory, said Souza. The injured were being treated
at different hospitals in the region.
	   The town, which is in the state of Bahia, has a population of
80,000.

Meissnitzer divulges secret of her success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Rising ski star Alexandra Meissnitzer
on Friday revealed the secret of her success.
	   Winner of three career World Cup races coming into the season,
Meissnitzer has won four even before the ski season reaches its
Christmas break, her latest victory a giant slalom on Friday.
	   While teammate Hermann Maier _ the reigning World Cup overall,
super-G and giant slalom champion _ attributed his sudden rise to
the top to a typical Austrian diet of pasta, granola and lots of
skiing, Meissnitzer's has a distinctly Chinese flavor.
	   Having a repuation of crumbling under pressure, the 25-year-old
Austrian said that an oriental relaxation technique known as
``Chi-gong'' has turned her career around.
	   ``Chi-gong has completely changed my life,'' said Meissnitzer,
who leads the overall World Cup standings with 625 points, 242
ahead of second-place Martina Ertl. ``When I was 19-20, I had a lot
of problems.
	   ``I was a very nervous person who could do well in training but
could never get good results on race day,'' Meissnitzer recalled.
``I spent a lot of energy worrying.''
	   Practiced by several other high profile Austrian athletes,
including ski jumper Andreas Goldberger, Chi-gong works to
establish a balance in the body's energy fields.
	   ``It also helps me heal faster when I'm injured,'' said
Meissnitzer. ``I am a lot calmer and more sure inside of myself.
	   ``I can handle any situation and when I'm leading after the
first run now, I just think to myself, `relax, it's the other girls
who have to be faster.'''
	   Meissnitzer consults Werner Tautermann for her Chi-gong sessions
in Salzburg, Austria, near her hometown of Abtenau.
	   ``I trust him completely,'' said Meissnitzer. ``It's a serious
practice and not a joke.
	   ``Since I've started I've progressed by leaps and bounds,'' the
Austrian skier said. ``But at the same time I don't worry about
what people or the media say.''
	   For teammate Anita Wachter, the 1993 overall World Cup champion,
you can't get better advice.
	   ``Just relax and don't think about the points,'' said Wachter.
``You just have to think about yourself and what you have to do,
not about the others.''
	   A 15-year veteran of the Austrian national team, many had
written off Wachter after a crash in Cortina, Italy last year left
her with severe knee injuries.
	   Unable to reach the podium for the past year and a half, on
Friday Wachter finally displayed some of the form which led her to
14 career wins and an Olympic gold medal, placing third in the
giant slalom behind Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy.
	   ``It feels good,'' said Wachter, 31. ``It's been a long time and
today is a happy day for me.
	   ``It was a good thing I believed in myself and didn't let my
results bring me down.''

League and union meeting secretly in Manhattan

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to udpate latest developments &QL;

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Under a shroud of secrecy, top negotiators for
National Basketball Association owners and players made plans to
have another stealth meeting this weekend after holding a hush-hush
five-hour session a day earlier.
	   ``It's always a good sign when the sides are meeting as opposed
to not meeting. Hopefully we'll come to some sort of a productive
exchange,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the
union.
	   Neither side divulged any details of Friday's session, although
sources close to the talks told The Associated Press that it
centered more on defining differences rather than settling them.
	   ``We agreed not to discuss any of the details, and I don't want
to break that pledge,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
	   Thursday's session was the first secret meeting since Oct. 26,
when the sides first came up with a framework for a collective
bargaining agreement. A deal was within reach two nights later when
Michael Jordan joined in and the sides met late into the evening,
but talks eventually broke off and there has been little progress
since.
	   If this weekend's meeting proves productive, it is likely that
both sides' full bargaining teams will be brought in next week for
their first session since Dec. 3.
	   ``I think David Stern clearly has a timetable in his own mind.
I've always said it's best to communicate, and it's distressing
that they haven't been,'' said agent David Falk, whose client,
Patrick Ewing, is the president of the players' union.
	   ``For what the commissioner is going to get out of this delay,
maybe an extra dlrs 2 or dlrs 3 million per team, for the damage
it's creating I just don't understand it,'' Falk said.
	   The sides are fighting over how to split an estimated dlrs 2
billion in annual revenue. The owners, who paid 57 percent of
revenue toward salaries last season, are seeking cost certainty
over the final three or four years of a six- or seven-year deal.
	   The players, who have offered concessions on high-end salaries
and maximum annual raises, would like to continue receiving the
same percentage of revenue they got last season.
	   Both sides have publicly stated that they have not yet put their
best offers on the table. The first 2 1/2 months of the season have
been lost, and it is widely believed that an agreement must be
reached by early January in order to save the season.
	   Stern has refused to say when it will be too late to save the
season, saying it will expire of its own accord in the near future.
The participants in Thursday's meeting were Stern, Granik, union
director Billy Hunter, Ewing and lawyers for both sides.

`Stella' the movie attracting single women to Jamaica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY314-315 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP) _ It's a ``Stella moment'' on the beach.
	   A handsome young Jamaican with bulging pectorals strides up to
three middle-aged women strolling barefoot by the sea. His opening
gambit is an invitation to ride on his glass-bottom boat.
	   Then the real business: ``Yes mon, my friend and I noticed you
last night. You were wearing sneakers,'' he says to one.
	   ``Oh yeah?''
	   ``We said, `Those are oldies but goldies!''' he continues.
	   ``How dare you!'' The woman's brassy American accent is a marked
contrast to the melodious Jamaican one. ``Didn't your mother teach
you how to talk to ladies? `Oldies?'''
	   The women storm off past a fence that cordons off their
all-inclusive resort, leaving their suitor behind.
	   David Patrick, about 30, scratches an ear ruefully but takes the
rejection in stride.
	   ``Women been coming in droves since that movie,'' he says.
	   He's talking about ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' the
summer movie about a woman who goes to Jamaica and falls in love
with a man half her age and rediscovers her enthusiasm for life.
	   ``It's not just Americans,'' Patrick says. ``English women,
Germans, Swiss _ they all say the same thing: That they've come to
get their groove back.''
	   The movie was based on a book by Terry McMillan, whose book and
movie ``Waiting to Exhale'' caused a similar sensation among black
American women. She said she kept running into women who bought
tickets to Jamaica after ``Stella'' became a bestseller in 1996.
	   The movie, starring Angela Bassett as Stella and Taye Diggs as
her lover Winston, appears to have had even more of an effect.
	   ``Jamaica couldn't have paid for the publicity we're getting,''
says photographer Ken Ramsay, referring to scenes that linger on
white-sand beaches, turquoise and emerald waters, cloudless skies
and exotic flowers.
	   Jamaica's Tourist Board has screened the film for U.S. travel
agents and aired TV spots promoting the island as a lovers'
getaway.
	   Board officials say it's too early to quantify any impact, so
it's impossible to say if, or how much of, recent increases could
be attributed to the movie.
	   The board's latest figures, for September, the month after the
movie's release, show a 10 percent increase over the same month
last year. There was a 22 percent jump to 20,544 visitors from the
northeastern United States alone.
	   Mark Adkins, a manager at the public relations agency
Adkins-Rome Entertainment and Marketing in Los Angeles, describes
an enthusiastic response, with ``a lot of women ... saying they
wanted to go to Jamaica to find their Winston.''
	   ``We're seeing groups of ladies coming together that look like
the type Terry McMillan was writing about _ more single ladies,''
says hotel manager Brian Sang.
	   Sang, executive manager of the Jamaica Grande resort at Ocho
Rios on the island's north coast, says one visitor sent him a poem
saying she and her girlfriends were ``coming to get their groove
back.''
	   A new lexicon has grown around the movie.
	   ``I've heard tourists say things like, `There's a Stella thing
going on here,''' Sang says.
	   Sensual tourism is not new to Jamaica.
	   It's a country where resort hotels cost dlrs 200 a night and
hotel workers make dlrs 80 a week, about what a prostitute earns in
a night. While some gigolos may be content to have their
entertainment and meals paid for, most expect money and gifts. For
those who are not married and trying to earn money to support their
families, the ultimate is marriage to an American and a ticket out
of the poverty.
	   Official AIDS figures reflect the prostitution. The highest rate
of AIDS infection is in St. James parish, which includes Jamaica's
most popular tourist area at Montego Bay. There, 285 of every
100,000 people are infected, compared to a national average of 120
per 100,000, the government says.
	   Negril, on the island's western tip, long has been known as the
place where some European women go to ``rent-a-Rasta'' _ one of the
beach boys who sport Rastafarian-style dreadlocks.
	   Ocho Rios is Jamaica's most popular destination for black
Americans. Maureen Singh, owner of a dive shop there, says she is
seeing a lot more middle-aged American women vacationing alone or
in groups.
	   Singh adds that Jamaican men love women who might be considered
overweight by American standards. ``In their culture, they're told
that they're overweight and ugly. But the men here love the big,
fat women,'' she laughs. ``They love them. They hope to marry
them.''
	   Back on the beach, the rejected Patrick says foreign women
``just love Jamaican men.''
	   As if on cue, the three women return.
	   Patrick strides up to the one who had chastised him, brushes
against her and takes hold of her hand. She doesn't rebuff him.
Emboldened, he snakes his arm around her shoulder and they walk
off.
	   Ten minutes later he's back.
	   Spurned again?
	   ``No, mon. I'm seeing her tonight,'' he boasts.

Antarctic ice-trekkers speed up progress toward South Pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Antarctica's Discoverer
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ After nearly five weeks of
slogging through rough ice towing heavy sleds, three Antarctic
adventurers have reported making dramatic progress in their
unassisted round trip to the South Pole.
	   In what they describe as ``brilliant'' weather, the trio said
that in the past week they have made up to 29 miles (47 km)
progress a day, raising a slight hope they can still reach the
South Pole by their target date of Dec. 25, Christmas Day.
	   ``Unbelievably good weather continues, and so do we,''
expedition leader Peter Hillary reported by phone link to the
trek's Internet site.
	   New Zealander Hillary and his team, Australians Jon Muir and
Eric Philips, are trying to recreate British explorer Robert
Scott's ill-fated 1911 expedition and ski nearly 1,875 miles (3,000
km) from New Zealand's Antarctic Scott Base to the South Pole and
back with no outside assistance.
	   If successful, the trip will be the longest unsupported ice trek
in history.
	   So far, the group has covered 421 miles (675 km) as they near
the halfway point of their trip to the Pole. The three men departed
Nov. 4.
	   ``(We are) still getting the crystal-clear blue skies and warm
temperatures, which require copious quantities of sunscreen on all
exposed parts of our bodies,'' Hillary reported.
	   ``Our time on the Ross Ice Shelf is starting to draw to an end,
for the inward leg of the trip at least,'' he said.
	   The ice-trekkers were expected to begin climbing up the
Shackleton Glacier next, a route never previously used by overland
expeditions to the pole.
	   The early progress of the expedition and its three, 396-pound
(180-kilo) sleds was hampered by ice formations called sastrugi,
wavelike ridges and furrows chiseled out of the ice or snow by the
abrasive action of ice crystals driven by wind.
	   The team expects similar conditions on the 88-mile (140 km) long
glacier, as well as dangerous crevasses in the ice surface.
	   Scott and his team of four men, who set out with ponies and
sled-dogs, died of starvation and exhaustion only a few miles (km)
from a supply dump, just days from their journey's end.
	   The Australasian team is banking on modern technology to see
them through the adventure, expected to take about 100 days. The
team passed the site where Scott died a fortnight ago.
	   ``We think a lot about Scott,'' Phillips said at the time. ``We
feel very strongly that he and his group were a very committed
party.
	   ``Despite the advantages of modern technology that we have ...
the task ahead of us is still a huge challenge.''
	   Each man is dragging a sled weighed down by food, fuel and
equipment. The gear includes super-lightweight equipment, an
Iridium satellite telephone and paraglider-style kites.
	   Hillary said mileage would be further improved when the group's
quadrifoil kites are unfurled. Tail winds so far have been too
light for the trio to use the kites.
	   ``Pity the tail wind was not a bit stronger,'' Hillary said,
``if it was we could put up the kites and really make some
distance.''
	   With tail winds, the kites will allow the men to double their
speed. They hope to average 9-15 mph (15-25 kph) with the kites,
which are expected to be used mostly on the return trip.
	   New Zealander Hillary is the son of Sir Edmund Hillary, the man
who conquered Mount Everest with Tenzing Norgay. Peter Hillary has
also climbed Everest, the world's tallest peak.

Americans call on Russians to block weapons technology to Iran
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A high-level U.S. delegation pressed Russia on
Friday to do more to halt the transfer of weapons technology to
Iran, an ongoing point of friction between Washington and Moscow.
	   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, head of the American
delegation in Moscow, told Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that
Washington believes the Russians have taken some steps but could do
more, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The official did not specify what steps Russia should take.
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear power plant, but insists
the project is only for generating electricity _ not for providing
Iran with technology to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We are not interested in anybody acquiring biological, nuclear
or chemical weapons or missiles for their delivery, and this
naturally applies to all countries in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
	   Iran denies U.S. charges that it is trying to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
	   However, the Americans believe that individual Russians may be
acting without government authorization to assist the Iranians,
U.S. officials said.
	   Russia has thousands of underpaid scientists and the Americans
fear they may be tempted to sell their expertise to countries like
Iran. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars in
recent years to keep Russian scientists employed in peaceful
projects.

Report: Qantas pilot suspended for letting passengers fly jets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Qantas airline captain has been
suspended over allegations that he let passengers take the controls
of jet planes during international flights, an Australian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Sydney's Daily Telegraph said the country's Civil Aviation
Safety Authority and Bureau of Air Safety Investigation have
launched an inquiry into the allegations.
	   The newspaper also reported that Qantas confirmed the pilot has
been suspended with pay pending the conclusion of an internal
investigation.
	   Government authorities have obtained statements from two male
passengers, one of whom said he was allowed to fly a Qantas 767
aircraft and another who said he flew one of the airline's 747
jets, the report said.
	   Both men were qualified pilots, but were only rated to fly much
smaller aircraft with no more than 10 seats, it said.
	   One incident allegedly took place in mid-1990 on a regular
scheduled commercial flight from Sydney to Manila.
	   A man who was a part-time officer in the Australian air force
told authorities that he and another air cadet officer were allowed
to fly a Qantas jet, which was almost full with passengers, for
twenty minutes each.
	   The Telegraph said the man claimed that at one point his friend,
who has since died, banked the plane so sharply it caused cabin
crew to contact the flight deck to see if there was a problem.
	   The second case being investigated allegedly took place on a
flight from Sydney to New Zealand in September 1996, the paper
said.

Newspaper fires Warne as columnist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A Melbourne newspaper has terminated
its relationship with Australian cricketer Shane Warne after
revelations of his involvement with an illegal Indian bookmaker.
	   The editor of The Age, Michael Gawenda, said that Warne's
actions had contravened the newspaper's code of conduct.
	   ``If this had have been one of our staff who had a secret
contract giving information to a person involved in an illegal act,
that staff member would be dismissed,'' he said in The Age on
Saturday.
	   The decision to drop Warne comes after he was fired as a
columnist by English tabloid newspaper The Mirror for his
involvement in the 1994 affair that only came to light this week.
	   Warne had been contracted to write regular columns for The Age
and wrote for The Sunday Age for three years.
	   His management was informed of The Age decision on Friday.
	   The Australian Cricket Board was forced to go public this week
and reveal it had fined Waugh 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
6,400) and Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) over
the matter, and had asked the International Cricket Council (ICC)
to keep it quiet. (djp)

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways jet trying to land
in a heavy rainstorm plunged into a swamp and burst into flames,
but at least 50 of the 146 people aboard survived, officials and
witnesses said.
	   Thai Airways Flight TG261 from Bangkok went down about 6:45 p.m.
Friday three miles (five kilometers) from the airport in Surat
Thani, a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts 330 miles
(530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Slogging through a swamp, rescue workers struggled to pull
bodies from the charred wreckage. The rescue operation was scaled
back early Saturday due to dark, rainy conditions and was to fully
resume after daybreak.
	   By 4 a.m., police and workers had discovered 44 bodies among the
burnt, twisted metal of the plane. Two were identified as
Westerners. Scores more bodies were still trapped in the plane,
many of them burned beyond recognition, police said.
	   At least 50 people survived. About 10 were Westerners, probably
tourists, officials said. Thai television reported the pilot
survived, but that could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   The rain keep falling even as the rescue effort continued
Saturday. Ambulances were unable to reach the area and only
four-wheel-drive vehicles could navigate the mud.
	   Still, the water that hampered rescuers may have cushioned the
aircraft's impact, officials said.
	   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
plane made three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before
attempting to land.
	   Flight attendant Akadek Pudemha described the crash to Thai
television from his hospital bed.
	   ``We figured that if we couldn't land on the third try, we would
return to Bangkok,'' he said. ``The plane was shaking the whole
time, and we crashed on the third try. Then the plane was on fire,
and I urged the passengers to jump out. They were reluctant.''
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to go
up high. The engines were really screaming. Then I saw a light,
bright like the sunset, about four stories off the ground, then a
fireball falling.''
	   One of the survivors shown on television was a boy, about 10,
who had wounds on his forehead.
	   Another survivor, popular Thai musician Reungsak Loychusak, told
a television station from his hospital bed: ``My whole left side is
in pain, I can barely move.''
	   The airline released a passenger manifest that indicated most of
the 132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western
and Japanese names. The manifest did not list the passengers'
nationalities.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in Thai Airway's fleet. It was delivered in
April 1986. By the end of October, it had accumulated 23,000 flight
hours.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   ``Until an official investigation report is available, it is
unproductive to enter into speculation about the causes,'' Airbus
said, noting that weather had been poor in the area.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban broke
down in tears after arriving from the capital, Bangkok, and
learning that his sister, Siriwan, had been killed in the crash.
Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of parliament from Surat Thani, also
died.
	   Suthep was originally booked on the flight but canceled to
attend a wedding. He expressed dismay that he had learned about the
crash first from relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the
mostly government-owned airline that he supervises.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would compensate the families of anyone
who was killed or injured.
	   In the past 15 months, there have been two other Airbus crashes,
both in Asia.
	   On Feb. 16, an Airbus A300 owned by Taiwan's China Airlines
crashed in a neighborhood near Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek airport,
where it was trying to land in fog and rain after a flight from
Bali, Indonesia. A total of 203 people died.
	   Taiwan's government ordered the airline's nine remaining planes
of the same type temporarily grounded.
	   On Sept. 26, 1997, 234 people aboard an A300B4 belonging to the
Indonesian state airline Garuda died in northern Sumatra. The plane
crashed into a jungle slope while trying to land in a thick smog.

<TEXT>
	   LAKE PLACID, New York (AP) _ The half-hour drive along Route 73
in mid-winter shows why Lake Placid is such a special place when
snow is on the ground.
	   On the right, ice climbers work their way up the frozen Roaring
Brook Falls. On the left, snowshoers trudge up Cascade Mountain. A
few minutes down the road is the turnoff for the Olympic
cross-country course. Then the road goes past the curious looking
Olympic ski jump towers.
	   Looming to the north is Whiteface Mountain, site of some of the
most challenging downhill skiing east of the Rockies.
	   The road leads to Lake Placid, host to the 1932 and 1980 Winter
Olympics, and one of the most complete winter resorts in the
country.
	   Lake Placid is surrounded by the Adirondack mountain
backcountry. The 6-million-acre (2.4-million-hectare) Adirondack
State Park encompasses a territory bigger than the state of Vermont
and is preserved by some of the toughest land-use regulations in
the country.
	   Lake Placid was one of the nation's first resort areas, and
attracted families such as the Rockefellers and Whitneys who built
lavish vacation lodges deep in the forests more than a century ago.
	   The facilities left from the two Winter Olympics, combined with
the preserved wilderness, have turned the Lake Placid area into a
backcountry playground an easy day's drive from New York City,
Montreal or Boston.
	   Those Olympics left a legacy of restaurants, hotels and sports
facilities.
	   Vacationers coming to Lake Placid in winter can stay at hotels
ranging from luxurious to rustic. There are bobsledding, lugeing,
skating, skiing, dog-sledding and ice-fishing opportunities.
	   A major reason to come to Lake Placid is Whiteface Mountain.
What distinguishes Whiteface from all other ski mountains in the
East is its 3,216 foot (980 meters) vertical drop, the steepest
this side of the Rockies. There are 65 trails at Whiteface evenly
divided for the beginner, intermediate and the expert skiers.
	   The mountain even provides a challenge to cross-country skiers.
The unplowed five-mile (8-kilometer) road to the summit is a
popular route for hardy cross-country skiers and the descent is a
thrill.
	   The Lake Placid region has hundreds of miles (kilometers) of
trails, and such high peaks as mile-high (1.6-kilometer-high) Mount
Marcy accessible to skiers.
	   Tony Goodwin knows all about cross-country skiing around Lake
Placid. By his reckoning, he is on skis at least 100 days every
winter. When he is not skiing, he is snowshoeing or skating on the
frozen ponds.
	   ``What makes the Lake Placid area unique among the eastern
resorts, and to a certain extent even some Western resorts, is the
amount of expansive wilderness open to skiers that provides a
totally different level of experience from the highly developed
resorts,'' says Goodwin, director of the Adirondack Ski Touring
Council.
	   A cross-country skier can choose between the deep snow and
mountainous terrain of the backcountry or miles and miles
(kilometers and kilometers) of maintained trails.
	   A highlight for cross-country skiers is the 50-kilometer
(30-mile) Jackrabbit Trail, a public trail that connects to several
ski centers as it winds it way from Keene through Lake Placid and
Saranac Lake to Paul Smith's, a small village.
	   Then there is Mount Van Hovenberg Cross-Country Ski Center at
the site of the Olympic, World Cup and National Championship
events.
	   Winter vacationers can skate around the Olympic Speed Skating
Oval where Eric Heiden won a record five gold medals in the 1980
Winter Olympic Games. Would-be Olympians can take lessons at the
Olympic oval. Over at Mount Van Hovenberg, they can ride the luge
and bobsled where the Olympians competed and trained.
	   Elevator and chairlift rides to the top of the 26-story ski
jumping towers provide panoramic views of the Adirondack mountain
landscape
	   The more extreme sports are gaining in popularity around Lake
Placid, among those who like their winter sports with an edge, who
like the adrenaline rush.
	   Skiing on Whiteface got more extreme last winter with the
opening of ``The Slides'' to the most daring _ and most expert _
skiers. The slides are hundreds of feet (meters) of treeless, sheer
rock face high up the mountain. Promoters call it ``the greatest
lift-accessed backcountry skiing around.''
	   The skier who ventures onto the Whiteface slides will encounter
frozen waterfalls, cliffs, and steep, ungroomed snow during runs
that last from 15- to 45 minutes.
	   The cliffs and frozen waterfalls around Lake Placid provide some
of the best ice-climbing opportunities. At The Mountaineer, an
outdoor outfitter in nearby Keene, ice climbing tools have been
outselling skiing equipment the last few years, according to Vinny
McClelland, the manager.
	   The Mountaineer sponsors an annual ice-climbing festival that
brings some top climbers to dig their crampons into the ice on
Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain, Chapel Pond Slabs, Pitchoff Mountain and
Roaring Brook Falls.

	   DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah (AP) _ It was nearly 100 years
ago that Earl Douglass noticed eight dinosaur tail bones sticking
out near the top of a sandstone ridge in eastern Utah.
	   ``It was a beautiful sight,'' Douglass, a Carnegie Museum
paleontologist, later said of the brontosaurus bones.
	   As the site of the largest Jurassic Period dinosaur quarry in
the world, where 2,000 dinosaur bones still protrude from the rock,
it still is.
	   What's great about the quarry is how it's preserved. There are
the expected mounted displays, such as a femur bone that looms over
a woman standing nearly 5 feet 8 inches (1.72 meters) tall.
	   But this is no stuffy museum. Visitors gape at the actual quarry
wall where vertebrae, femurs, skulls and other bones are still
embedded in rock.
	   While the 20 complete dinosaur skeletons Douglass discovered in
1909 are housed in museums across the country, fossils discovered
since 1953 have been left in place.
	   Visitors can walk the length of the 150-foot (45 meters) quarry
wall and see remains of giant vegetarians such as the stegosaurus
and meat-eaters such as the rare allosaurus.
	   On the first floor, visitors can reach out to the wall and touch
a few of the massive bones that lay preserved in the rock.
	   The quarry averages between 250,000 and 300,000 visitors a year.
Last summer, some had a chance to view a new excavation at the
nearby Cedar Mountain Formation that contains what may be a new
genus-species from the long-tailed, long-necked sauropod family.
	   ``We've found leg bones, ribs and complete and partial skulls of
dinosaurs from there,'' says the quarry's chief naturalist, David
Whitman.
	   ``It has no name. I guess that will be our job someday to figure
out what it is. All these are going to be brand new to science.''
	   Whitman expects the site to open again next summer to small
groups of visitors.
	   President Woodrow Wilson established the Dinosaur National
Monument in Jensen, Utah, in 1915 as an 80-acre (32-hectare)
preserve six years after Douglass' find. In 1938, it grew to
200,000-plus acres (81,000-plus hectares) of eastern Utah and
western Colorado wilderness.
	   The dramatic surroundings, carved out by the Green River to the
south and the Yampa, its tributary, add to the experience. Before
leaving, it's a good idea to buy the 50-cent booklet ``Tour of the
Tilted Rocks'' at the gift shop. It is a good guide during a car
tour of the nearby, 19-mile (30-kilometer) Desert Voices Trail.
	   While Split Mountain and Elephant Toes Butte are among the
impressive natural sights along the trail, the petroglyphs are the
real draw.
	   Etched into rock by the Fremont people 1,000 years ago, the
designs depict lizards, bighorn sheep, chieftains, princesses
wearing headdresses and necklaces and figures playing the
didjeridoo or flute.
	   It's not known if these were religious or clan symbols, seasonal
calendars, stories told in pictures or merely graffiti by the
Indians who lived in Utah from about 200 to 1250 AD.
	   These whet your appetite for pressing on to the 200-foot (60
meter)-high Navajo Formation sandstone cliffs in Dry Fork Canyon,
on the Sadie McConkie Ranch just 18 miles (29 kilometers) northwest
of the dinosaur quarry or 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of
Vernal.
	   Nowhere in Utah can you see more petroglyphs in one area.
	   A caveat: Trails are not handicapped accessible. This is a
rugged climb. Borrow a walking stick from the shack at the parking
lot; it will come in handy. Wear hiking boots. Sneakers and running
shoes will make for an uncomfortable climb.
	   There is no admission or parking fee. Simply pull into the
gravel lot, find the trail entrance and begin.
	   Crude wooden signs occasionally alert hikers to petroglyphs
along the route. Because they are on private land, trails are
primitive and sometimes hard to follow. Small orange ribbons tied
to bushes and trees mark the route and visitors may need to pause
occasionally to search out the next marker.
	   But the effort of climbing over rock and scrub adds to the
memorable experience of viewing ancient drawings that have been
featured in National Geographic, Smithsonian and American
Antiquities magazines.
	   If mountain biking is more to your liking, there are trails at
Dry Fork Canyon, which also features petroglyphs, and at nearby Red
Mountain. The 21.5-mile (35-kilometer), out-and-back trail at Dry
Fork Canyon is ranked for intermediate bikers and is considered its
best in the spring through fall.
	   The 11.5-mile (19-kilometer) Red Mountain loop, with its steep
climb, is ranked for advanced bikers.
	   If you decide to press northward by car from Dry Fork Canyon to
the magnificent Flaming Gorge dam and reservoir, take the Red Cloud
scenic backway _ accessed from U.S. 191 _ only if you have two
hours to spare. The winding road is often rutted, bumpy and varies
between paved and gravel. It is closed during the winter.
	   Instead, you may want to head to Vernal _ a 10-mile
(16-kilometer) drive southeast of Dry Fork Canyon and 18 miles (29
kilometers) west of the Dinosaur quarry.
	   Overnight accommodations abound, and for a good meal Curry Manor
offers a nice change of pace from a day spent in the rugged
outdoors.
	   It was built in 1910 by Utah state senator William Curry and
used to host state and church dignitaries at formal dinners and
receptions. Lace curtains and antiques _ including a claw-foot tub
in the upstairs bathroom _ fill the home-turned-restaurant, which
is on the National Registry of Historic Places.
	   The menu offers a wide selection for fine dining and desserts
are prepared tableside.

Colorado big winner in ranking of top ski resorts in North America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Colorado ski resorts dominated the rankings in a
poll of Conde Nast Traveler magazine readers asked to evaluate 154
ski resorts in 54 mountain areas of North America.
	   In the best overall ski resorts and ski areas category, Colorado
claimed eight spots out of the top 10, beginning with the first
place winner, Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Vail, followed by four
other properties in Vail and one each in Aspen, Beaver Creek and
Telluride.
	   Conde Naste surveyed 1,539 readers, 84 percent of whom consider
themselves intermediate to expert on the slopes. They were asked to
take into consideration the terrain, conditions, accommodations,
town ambiance, amenities, lifts, lines, food and service.
	   The top 10 as listed in the December issue of Conde Naste
Traveler:
	   (1) Lodge and Spa at Cordillera, Vail, Colorado; (2) Sonnenalp
Resort, Vail, Colorado; (3) Chateau Whistler Resort,
Whistler-Blackomb, British Columbia; (4) Vail Marriott Mountain
Resort, Vail, Colorado; (5) Lodge at Vail, Vail, Colorado; (6) Vail
Cascade Hotel and Club, Vail, Colorado; (7) St. Regis Aspen, Aspen,

 &UR; Home of Everglades' grande dame to become state museum
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The tiny wood and stucco English-style cottage that
was home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the grande dame of the
Everglades, is being converted into a state museum.
	   The Land Trust of Dade County next month will take over the
Coconut Grove home, where Douglas died in May at age 108.
	   The trust, which already has received a dlrs 125,000 grant from
Miami-Dade County, plans to start raising more money in January to
renovate the home and build an adjacent educational center.
	   Douglas' ``The Everglades: River of Grass,'' published in 1947,
has become a bible for environmentalists, and she spent the second
half of her life fighting to save the imperiled wetlands.
	   The 1,000-square-foot (93-square-meter) cottage had been her
home since 1926. Douglas had arranged for it to become a state
historic site after her death.
	   Surrounded by million-dollar mansions, the home has no driveway
because Douglas never learned how to drive. The kitchen has no
stove because she did not cook.
	   Because the home is so small, tours probably will be limited to
a half-dozen people and conducted only by appointment.

 &UR; Monorail connecting Vegas resorts clears a major hurdle
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ A monorail shuttling tourists between several
Las Vegas resorts could be up and running by mid-2002.
	   The four-mile (6.4-kilometer), dlrs 350 million elevated train
has the blessing of the Clark County commissioners, but there are
some other hurdles to be cleared, including funding and traffic
studies.
	   Despite objections from some homeowners, the commission voted
recently to allow MGM-Bally's (Hilton) Monorail Limited Liability
Co. to build the train.
	   The monorail would run from the MGM Grand to the Las Vegas
Hilton, or possibly the Sahara, with several stops along the way.
	   The system, which will be 20 to 35 feet (6 to 11 meters) high in
most places, will travel at a top speed of 50 mph (80 kph).
	   There would be stations at the Flamingo Hilton, Harrah's and
Imperial Palace, the Hughes Center near Paradise Road and Sands
Avenue, and the Las Vegas Hilton.
	   Terminals might also be built at the Las Vegas Convention Center
and the Sahara.

 &UR; Agencies looking at public toilets for Alaska travelers
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ Alaska finally is on the road toward
getting public toilets for tourists.
	   Government officials are working on a solution after years of
listening to travelers complain about the lack of suitable pit
stops along the state's highways.
	   ``This is a very serious matter,'' said Tina Lingren, executive
director of the Alaska Visitors Association.
	   The current situation is grim, she said. ``There are toilets. De
facto toilets. Just walk a couple feet (one meter) off the highway
and you'll see,'' she told the Anchorage Daily News.
	   Agencies are being encouraged not just to build the toilets but
also to erect what are referred to as Alaska Rest and Information
Stops. The rest stops might offer other amenities such as
information booths, short hiking trails, dog-walking areas, picnic
tables and telephones.
	   But is a system of public toilets along the roadways proof that
Alaska is becoming as civilized as the Lower 48?
	   ``Well, we're not talking about flush toilets, Lingren said.

Palestinians: committed to peace despite Israeli `aggression'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian Cabinet said it
remained committed to the Wye River peace agreement despite
disputes with Israel over implementation and the deaths of two
Palestinian teen-agers by Israeli army fire.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile said he
would not budge from his demand that the Palestinians meet a list
of conditions before he will withdraw troops in the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu suggested that even U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
was to arrive just after midnight Saturday for a three-day visit,
would not make him change his mind.
	   ``We do not change our opinions, our positions on account of
this or that circumstance,'' Netanyahu said in an interview with
Israel TV's Channel One.
	   The new violence and Netanyahu's tough talk made it more likely
that Clinton's visit, intended to usher in the second stage of the
Wye agreement, will not go smoothly and that the president will be
drawn into the bitter disputes between Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Monday's gathering of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' top decision-making body, has the greatest potential
for trouble. During the session, the PNC is to ``reaffirm'' earlier
decisions by lesser bodies declaring provisions in the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void.
	   Netanyahu insists that the PNC abrogate the charter by vote,
while the Palestinians say that under the Wye accord they are not
required to do so. Instead, they say they will approve the charter
changes by acclamation.
	   Netanyahu reiterated Friday that he will settle for nothing less
than a vote. If Clinton validates the PNC decision despite Israeli
misgivings, Netanyahu said he will not attend a three-way meeting
with Arafat the Americans are trying to arrange immediately after
the PNC session.
	   The Israeli leader also accused the Palestinian Authority of
orchestrating West Bank riots to pressure Israel into releasing
more Palestinian prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   In all, four Palestinians have been killed and scores injured
this week in widespread clashes with Israeli troops. The violence
erupted after marches pressing for the release of prisoners.
	   Palestinian Cabinet ministers stood for a moment of silence for
those killed this week. Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath,
speaking after the weekly Cabinet session, accused the Israeli
government of ``aggression against our people in the West Bank.''
	   ``While the Israelis are adopting this policy against us, we are
really committed and are going to continue the implementation of
the Wye memorandum,'' Shaath said.
	   He spoke after about 500 Palestinians, most of them supporters
of Arafat's Fatah faction, marched to the outskirts of the West
Bank town of Qalqiliya on Friday afternoon and began throwing
stones at Israeli troops. Soldiers standing only about 10 meters
(30 feet) away from the crowd fired tear gas and rubber-coated
steel pellets. Witnesses said troops also used live ammunition, a
claim denied by the Israeli army.
	   Rubber bullets, when fired from a short distance, can be fatal.
	   Two 18-year-old Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan,
were killed by live bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman
at the U.N. clinic in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by
rubber bullets, two by live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas
inhalation, clinic officials said.

International team steamrolling toward victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED with afternoon matches &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ America's worst nightmare came true
Saturday in the Presidents Cup. It turns out the International team
was just warming up.
	   One day after Frank Nobilo's thunderous 40-foot birdie putt on
the 18th green gave the International team a jump start at Royal
Melbourne, Craig Parry pushed it to the brink of an insurmountable
lead Saturday morning with another stunning finish.
	   Needing to get up-and-down to halve the alternate-shot match
against Fred
	   Couples and Tiger Woods, Parry rammed home his 50-foot birdie
chip for a 1-up victory that swung the tide in the International
favor.
	   When the dust had settled on another blistering hot, wind-swept
day at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, the International lead was at 11
1-2 to 3 1-2, giving them a chance to clinch the cup should they
sweep the afternoon best-ball matches.
	   At this rate, anything was possible.
	   ``The whole picture of the thing is hard to believe,'' said Mark
Calcavecchia. ``We're all in a state of shock. We've got to win all
these afternoon matches.''
	   Calcavecchia and Janzen accounted for the only U.S. points
Saturday morning _ a halve against Greg Norman and Steve Elkington,
although they surely will look back on Janzen missing a 2-foot par
putt on the 16th hole that led to a halve.
	   The spectacular play of the International team was summed up on
the last two holes.
	   Couples and Woods were leading 1-up when Shigeki Maruyama sank a
35-foot birdie putt on No. 17 to square the match and set up
Parry's heroics on the 18th.
	   ``It's unbelieveable what they did,'' Couples said. ``The
35-footer on 17, and then 18 was just plain goofy.''
	   Moments later, Stuart Appleby sank a 20-foot birdie putt on the
17th to go
	   1-up on Phil Mickelson and David Duval, and he and Nick Price
hung on for victory.
	   Nobilo and Greg Turner of New Zealand were more solid than
spectacular. Still, that was enough to pull off a 2-up victory over
Davis Love III and Justin Leonard. In the other match, Ernie Els
and Vijay Singh pummeled Scott Hoch and Jim Furyk for a 6 and 4
margin.
	   ``They're playing great golf _ holing all their shots,
up-and-downs everywhere, and making so many birdie runs that it's
hard to stop them,'' Woods said.
	   Parry's chip-in came from roughly the same spot where Nobilo
sank his 40-footer for birdie on the first day, and resulted in the
same thunderous cheer from the Australian gallery and the shock on
the faces of Woods and Couples.
	   ``I've hit a lot of good chips, but that would have to be the
best,'' Parry said.
	   The only thing that can save the Americans now is a change in
weather. Cooler winds from the south were due late Saturday
afternoon, with the forecast calling for more moderate temperatures
Sunday _ if the matches mean anything by then.
	   ``I think the conditions here at Royal Melbourne ... I don't
think enough
	   of our guys have had enough experience,'' said U.S. captain Jack
Nicklaus. ``I think that little bit of edge has left the
International side ahead.''
	   That, and a dose of great putting.
	   If there was one match Saturday that seemed to summarize the
plight of the Americans it was Love and Leonard failing to come up
with the big putts _ or the short ones, for that matter _ in a
match that could have set the tone for the day.
	   After falling behind 2-down after four holes, Love and Leonard
took a 1-up lead into the back nine. Leonard hit his approach from
the rough to 4 feet behind the hole, while the Kiwis were short of
the green.
	   Nobilo chipped to 8 feet and Turner made the birdie putt, but
then Love's
	   4-foot eagle putt slid by on the right, and a chance to go 2-up
slid right by with it.
	   Nobilo made birdie putts of 8 feet and 15 feet on the next two
holes _ Love missed a 6-foot birdie putt on the 12th that would
have halved the hole. The International team took the lead for good
when Love's drive on the 14th was so tangled in the trees that
Leonard had to go back to the tee and reload.
	   ``They're playing very well,'' Nicklaus said. ``But that's the
game of golf.'' (df/djp)

No-smoking laws are scoffed at in some countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY300-NY303, Graphic TRV SMOKE &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID L. LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Travel Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers on the go are always a step ahead in
plotting when and where they can get that next nicotine fix.
	   On a day-trip with the kids in the back of the car and a wife
with an attitude about second-hand smoke, they finesse with
frequent pit stops blamed on the bladder.
	   But deep dread sets in when boarding a U.S. airliner and some
foreign carriers, knowing there is no finesse.
	   That's a given. But what is less defined are the anti-smoking
laws in the countries you plan to visit. They vary greatly and
often are winked at.
	   Authorities in Singapore are determined to make the city-state
the world's first smoke-free nation. To that end, smokers can be
slapped with a dlrs 600 fine just for lighting up while waiting in
line for a bus or taxi.
	   On the other hand, smokers in Japan are allowed for the most
part to light up when and where they please. Could that be because
the powerful Ministry of Finance owns two-thirds of the stock in
Japan Tobacco, which controls nearly 80 percent of the cigarette
market?
	   There's also a smoker-friendly atmosphere in Egypt, where the
government owns the country's biggest cigarette company.
	   A reporter who was covering Israel's Knesset (parliament) when
it passed a law banning smoking in elevators, among other public
places, recalls riding an elevator with the minister of police,
Haim Bar-Lev, holding a lighted cigar.
	   ``How can you smoke in the elevator?'' the reporter asked.
``Shouldn't you be setting an example of compliance with the new
law?''
	   Haim Bar-Lev smiled and replied: ``The law says I mustn't smoke
in the elevator. It doesn't say I mustn't hold my cigar in the
elevator.'' He later died of cancer while ambassador in Moscow.
	   A newswoman in a small restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was
sitting beneath a ``No Fumar'' sign. She asked the waiter if there
was someplace else she could smoke.
	   ``The waiter promptly lifted the sign off the wall and urged me
to go ahead and smoke,'' she says. ``There weren't any other
customers, so I did.''
	   In Montreal, once a smokers' haven, there's a move afoot to
restrict smoking in restaurants and most public places. That
bothers Frank Valente, a restaurateur who fears business will
suffer.
	   ``The nonsmoker will have a coffee,'' he says, ``The smoker will
have three cognacs and two coffees, then he'll have a bottle of
wine with dinner.''
	   For the benefit of smokers _ and nonsmokers _ who travel, we
asked AP correspondents around the globe to summarize the smoking
laws where they are stationed. This is their report, with the
countries in alphabetical order:
	   AUSTRALIA: Even pubs are succumbing to creeping anti-smoke
sentiment, with bar workers' unions in Sydney suggesting that
employers should be legally liable if workers end up with lung
disease. Smoking is outlawed in most public places and offices, and
the heaps of butts at back doors and loading docks indicate
compliance.
	   BELGIUM: Enter a restaurant in Brussels and one question you
will never hear is: ``Smoking or nonsmoking?'' Belgian law bans or
curbs smoking in public places, but enforcement is sloppy,
violations rampant. Belgians are simply not bothered by
anti-smoking rules, and complaints from nonsmokers are often
treated with disdain.
	   BRAZIL: A recent ban on smoking in public buildings and on short
flights is widely ignored. Smokers routinely light up in shopping
malls and waiting rooms, and the ``No Smoking'' section in planes
often exists only in theory. Cigarette ads on TV must carry a
health warning, but often it's no more than ``Avoid smoking around
small children.'' Brazil is a major producer and exporter of
tobacco.
	   CANADA: Toronto tried to become Canada's first city to ban
smoking in bars and restaurants but backed down last year in the
face of widespread defiance. In smoker-friendly Montreal,
provincial legislation in the works would outlaw smoking in most
public places and require restaurants to allocate at least 60
percent of their seats to nonsmokers.
	   CHINA: With 320 million smokers, smoking is the closest thing
China has to a national pastime. Lighting up in the Forbidden City,
on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small
fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally
the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored.
	   DENMARK: Although smoking is banned in hospitals, public
transportation and shops, Danes can still have a puff in Copenhagen
cafes and restaurants so long as they don't bother others. Most
offices have a smoking room and, if colleagues don't mind, smokers
can light up at their desks.
	   EGYPT: Smokers puff away almost anywhere: on buses, in
elevators, next to ``No Smoking'' signs. The government regularly
announces anti-smoking drives, but it owns the biggest cigarette
company, too. Its newest brand, Toshka, is named for a vast
government plan to turn Egypt's desert into farmland _ perhaps for
growing tobacco?
	   FRANCE: Smoke-filled cafes are still pretty much the norm. But
thanks to a 1991 law, the haze is starting to clear. Smoking is
prohibited in subways, trains, airplanes, hospitals and public
places. Though some still light up in those places, it's happening
less and less. Officials at the National Committee Against Smoking
say the biggest headache remains the workplace, where it's up to
the boss to enforce the law.

Security Council urges all parties to sign Congo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council urged all sides in
Congo's civil war Friday to work ``in a constructive and flexible
spirit'' with a view to signing a cease-fire at a summit in Zambia
on Dec. 14-15.
	   The council also urged participants at a follow-up meeting of
the Organization of African Unity in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on
Dec. 17-18 ``to take urgent steps towards a peaceful settlement of
the conflict.''
	   To assist in implementing a cease-fire, the council said it is
prepared to consider ``the active involvement of the United
Nations, in coordination with OAU, including through concrete,
sustainable and effective measures.''
	   The council adopted the presidential statement at a formal
meeting Friday. The statement, which carries less weight than a
binding resolution, did not specify any measures.
	   But last Friday, a senior U.N. official said a cease-fire
agreement hopefully will be followed by deployment of an African or
U.N. peacekeeping force in the Congo with at least 15,000
personnel.
	   At a meeting in Paris in late November, leaders of Congo,
Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda made a commitment to strive for an
immediate cessation of hostilities, sign a cease-fire agreement and
work toward ending the war.
	   Zimbabwe has sent troops to boost Congo's President Laurent
Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda back rebels trying to overthrow
Kabila.
	   The Security Council urged the all parties ``to participate at
the highest level possible'' in the Lusaka summit, but its success
appears in doubt.
	   Kabila has refused to sign a cease-fire or speak to the rebels
until Rwanda and Uganda withdraw from Congo.
	   South Africa's Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo on Thursday insisted
that Congolese rebels be allowed to attend the Zambia summit,
putting him at loggerheads with Kabila. The rebels did not attend
the Paris meeting and have not been invited to participate in the
Lusaka summit.
	   Saying it remains ``deeply concerned'' about the continuing
conflict, the Security Council noted a deterioration in food
supplies for the civilian population and an increasing flow of
refugees.
	   The council called for ``an immediate cease-fire, the orderly
withdrawal of all foreign forces, arrangements for security along
the international borders'' of the Congo, the re-establishment of
government authority in the country and the initiation of a
national reconciliation process which leads to early ``democratic,
free and fair elections.''
	   It also condemned any violations of human rights, ``including
acts of and incitement to ethnic hatred and violence by all
parties.''
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling Mobutu Sese
Seko, longtime dictator of what was then known as Zaire. He
promised reform and democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic of
Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18 months in power has
produced repressive policies and a growing intolerance of
criticism.

	   GERMANY: Health-conscious Germans are drinking less beer and
eating leaner meat, but they still like their cigarettes. Big ``No
Smoking'' signs hang at subway entrances in Berlin, but,
recognizing the inevitable, there are ashtrays on the platforms. In
February, parliament easily defeated the first attempt to regulate
smoking nationwide.
	   GREECE: One would never know it, but smoking is actually
forbidden in public places in Greece _ where 45 percent of adults
smoke _ and it has been for years. It is banned on all public
transport (1952), in closed public spaces (1980), on domestic
flights (1990) and in health-care facilities (1993). ``Regardless,
some people abuse it,'' says Pantelis Vekios of the Health
Ministry. ``It happens a lot in Greece. If your boss smokes and you
can't say anything to him because he'll fire you, what can you
do?''
	   ISRAEL: By and large, Israel has followed the United States'
lead in enacting bans, but some time later. But the head of Israel
radio, Amnon Nadav, refused to allow government inspectors into his
building after some of his staff complained about the
round-the-clock stench of nicotine.
	   ITALY: Cigarette smoke wafts from the Coliseum in Rome,
cigarette butts litter the Forum. You've come to Rome to see the
sights, but the country's anti-smoking laws are, in general,
blowing a lot of smoke. Two years ago, the government banned
smoking in private businesses serving the public and ordered
government agencies to enforce the prohibitions. Still, banks put
up ``No-Smoking'' signs just a few feet from ... ashtrays. Ditto
for some hospital waiting rooms.
	   JAPAN: In Tokyo, restaurant patrons eat in a fog of tobacco
smoke, a blue haze hangs over coffeehouses and workplaces reek of
cigarettes. Restrictions are slowly springing up. Smokers are
limited to special parts of train platforms, for example, and small
no-smoking sections are becoming more common in family style
eateries.
	   MEXICO: If it isn't a smoker's paradise, it's only because the
cigarettes are so bad. It's hard to walk a block in Mexico City
without finding someone hawking smokes such as Marlboros or
Delicados (unfiltered ``Delicate Ones''). The only places with
effective bans are the movie theater, subway and public buses.
	   NETHERLANDS: You can walk into a so-called ``coffeehouse'' and
smoke marijuana or hashish without fear of arrest, so puffing on
mere tobacco is tame stuff. There are no ``smoker segregation''
laws, but change is in the air. More companies are sending
employees outside to smoke, and this year KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
banned smoking on all flights.
	   PORTUGAL: When entering an elevator in Lisbon, don't worry if
the ashtray is full. You can stub out your cigarette on the floor
like those before you. Such occurrences are much rarer than they
once were, but the smoke still blows thick in Portugal _ especially
in bars and restaurants.
	   RUSSIA: Moscow has a few designated no-smoking areas, but
everywhere else people smoke as they please. State officials light
up in the corridors of government buildings, school teachers puff
away in lounges and school stairwells, restaurants allow smoking in
the dining rooms. Even in clinics and hospitals, there is little
apparent concern for the dangers of smoking. But smokers may be
fined if they light up on a city bus or subway.
	   SINGAPORE: Soon smokers will have nowhere to hide. It's still
safe to light up in a bar, disco, karaoke lounge and in the great
outdoors. But if you are on line for a bus or a taxi with more than
two other people, you'd better stub out that butt fast.
	   All public areas, air conditioned shopping centers and shops,
offices, schools, private clubs, taxis, buses and public toilets in
Singapore are designated smoke-free. Smoking is also barred in
underground pedestrian walkways and any lines of two or more
people.
	   The maximum fine for selling tobacco to anyone under 18 is 5,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,000) for the first offense, and 10,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,000) for subsequent offenses. Last year,
a court sentenced a 16-year-old boy to two years in juvenile
detention for repeated underage smoking.
	   But after 28 years of increasingly restrictive laws, about 18
percent of the population still smokes.
	   SPAIN: When dining out in Madrid, don't worry about fighting for
a seat in the no-smoking section because there's no such thing.
Just hold your breath and chew fast. In other public places, such
as stores and public transport, smoking is banned under law but
some people light up anyway. In government buildings, smoking is
prohibited only in ones that deal directly with the public.
	   TURKEY: A year after a law banned smoking in public offices,
hospitals, buses and airports, people are still said to ``smoke
like a Turk.'' Cinema lobbies and waiting rooms seem less hazy
these days, with the nonsmoking minority policing the ban. Still,
ashtrays remain under no-smoking signs to collect the butts of
violators, who dare to face a 10 million turkish lira (dlrs 32)
fine.
	   UNITED KINGDOM: Pity the smoker who doesn't drink, as pubs
remain a safe haven. Otherwise, British smokers increasingly are
relegated to the sidewalk or the parking lot, largely at the
initiative of employers, and smoking is banned in many public
places including subways and trains. The government has set a
target of reducing cigarette consumption by 40 percent by the year
2000.
	   VENEZUELA: It's pretty much OK to smoke anywhere you want in
Caracas and most other cities, with a few exceptions, such as
hospitals and the Health Ministry. Upscale restaurants are
beginning to create no-smoking sections, and there's a de facto ban
on overcrowded buses because passengers are already irritated by
exhaust fumes from traffic jams.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Delegates to the first global conference
on the Year 2000 computer bug decided little, but did lay the
groundwork for ways to increase international and regional
cooperation.
	   Held on Friday at the United Nations, the conference was
organized to be a starting point for international cooperation to
deal with the computer-generated glitch in time. Organizers hope
for more meetings and communication between the member-states' Year
2000 coordinators in the 385 days before midnight, Jan. 1, 2000.
	   ``The ultimate purpose of this meeting is to agree on the
actions needed in the coming year,'' said Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistan
ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the U.N. Economic
and Social Council's Working Group on Informatics.
	   According to a statement issued by Kamal's office, the delegates
from more than 120 member-states agreed to press their governments
to assign the ``highest priority'' to the problem, and suggested
tapping a World Bank trust fund to help poor countries pay for
bringing their computer systems into compliance.
	   And while few concrete proposals arose from the conference, the
delegates did agree to hold further meetings to discuss how to
organize regional task forces, share information across borders and
build a more accurate picture of the scope of the problem.
	   ``This is an issue that, if left unsolved, will impact
everyone's everyday life,'' said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
in an address to the delegates. ``This simple problem does not have
a simple solution.''
	   The Year 2000 problem _ also called Y2K and the millennium bug _
occurs because some programs, especially older ones, may fail when
the date changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize
only the last two digits of a year, such programs could read the
digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.
	   No one really knows what will happen at century's end, and
predictions vary wildly, from electrical outages to financial
instability to civil disorder.
	   Many are especially concerned about developing countries. They
don't use as much sophisticated technology as the developed world,
but their technology often is older and relies on software that
cannot be updated. In the developed world, the sheer number of
computer systems needing to be checked and corrected is the main
obstacle.
	   There are 386 days remaining until Jan. 1, 2000. Global
estimates for fixing the problem run as high as dlrs 600 billion,
according to the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, not
including potential lawsuits.
	   ``We swimming in a vast sea of the technological unknown,'' said
Jonathan Spalter, Associate Director of Information for the United
States Information Agency. ``There is not a lack of will or good
faith, but the cartography remains unclear.''
	   The United Nations can help draw the map for surviving and
managing the affects of the millennium bug, he said.
	   ``The U.N. was forged to bring order to a world wracked by
technological disaster _ Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' he said. ``Now,
it's trying to do it again.''

Indonesia's students settle into rhythm of street protest

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The students hardly flinched when an
armored personnel carrier rolled toward them during a recent
protest. A few clambered aboard. One even opened the hatch and
yelled democracy slogans at the soldiers inside.
	   Anti-government protest has become a festive ritual for
thousands of students in the Indonesian capital, who by the week
are polishing and expanding an arsenal of freedom anthems, banners,
marching steps and taunts tailored for the police.
	   Protesters with their arms linked often shuffle to drum beats
and their rallies sometimes resemble carnivals. But the bolder
their demands for swift democratic reform, the greater the risk of
more violence.
	   ``We want a better system, a better government,'' said student
organizer David Heriyanto. ``This isn't about having fun. It's our
duty.''
	   Several hundred students protested Friday outside police
headquarters in Jakarta, a day after angry activists hurled stones
and bottles at the building. Protests Thursday by 10,000 students
were among the biggest since the turbulent ouster in May of
authoritarian President Suharto.
	   On Nov. 13, troops killed nine activists after students tried to
march to Parliament to protest a government assembly they said was
not moving fast enough on political reforms.
	   Yet there is no end in sight to the protests, which the
government predicts will persist until parliamentary elections set
for June 1999.
	   President B.J. Habibie, whom students label a Suharto stooge
despite his pledges of democratic reform, has appealed in vain for
protesters to get off the streets.
	   He has not met their main demand that Suharto be put on trial
for corruption, instead launching _ under pressure _ an
investigation that critics suggest is cosmetic.
	   These days, the once-startling image of soldiers in camouflage
and small tanks guarding the presidential palace is routine.
Thousands of troops brought in as reinforcements from garrisons
outside Jakarta bed down in the parking lots of hotels and office
buildings.
	   The big fear is that violent protests will trigger riots and
looting by Jakarta's poor, a pattern that preceded Suharto's
downfall and emerged again last month. Indonesia is foundering in
its worst economic crisis in decades and hardship is widespread.
	   The protests tangle commerce and commuting in the smog-soaked
capital of 11 million people. Students block main thoroughfares for
hours and security guards drag barbed wire barricades in front of
shuttered banks and shopping centers as they pass by. The students
say they don't care.
	   Students who used to wear simple headbands with the slogan
``Reform'' now wear bandannas with a confusing array of acronyms of
various university groups.
	   Some leaders coordinate rallies with cellular phones. Student
medics and logistics teams with boxes of food and water trail large
demonstrations in convoys of cars.
	   Gimmicks are popular. Students handed a chicken to Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib, saying it symbolized his lack of
resolve in investigating the 77-year-old Suharto.
	   The protesters enjoy the sympathy of many Indonesians, who
resent a government filled with one-time allies of Suharto that has
failed to shake its image as a bastion of corrupt bureaucrats.
	   One group of business executives recently dreamed up banner
slogans for protesters, who invariably end up blocked by lines of
riot police and occasionally fight them.
	   ``Thank you for not killing'' was one idea. Another was, ``This
is a killing-free zone.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union nations are at an impasse
over the EU's future financing but insist that won't slow plans to
open the door to a dozen newcomers in the years ahead.
	   The 15 EU leaders end a two-day summit Saturday with a pledge to
continue pursuing their biggest enlargement ever by letting Cyprus,
10 Eastern European nations and Malta into their club in the next
decade.
	   They will conclude the summit in the spectacular former imperial
Hofburg Palace by meeting with the leaders of all candidate
nations.
	   Yet they made no headway Friday at resolving a money dispute
that must be settled before the first candidates join, probably
around 2004.
	   Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark insist on
a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European currency
units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear they will lose EU funds to
poorer newcomers and argue outlays must at least rise in line with
economic growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by
2006.
	   On another issue, the leaders did better by agreeing to pursue
ways of how Europe can craft a credible defense arm without always
relying on the United States.
	   France and Britain _ Western Europe's only nuclear powers _
issued a joint statement this month saying the EU must be able to
act on its own with a ``credible military force'' within the
framework of NATO.
	   Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other
northerners complain they already pay to much. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for absorbing East
Germany, made it clear Europe's enlargement problems are not going
to be solved with a German checkbook.
	   In a related issue, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he will not
give up an annual rebate Britain has been getting since 1984 for
its net payments. ``It shouldn't be negotiated away because it is
justified. Otherwise, Britain would be paying a quite
disproportionate and unfair amount into the European Union,'' he
said
	   Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of
which is refunded.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   The leaders set a March deadline to sort out budget reform.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok. ``If this bogs down
you'll see a serious crisis situation and that you cannot do to
people whose expectations of Europe we have raised.''

Psychiatrists condemn treatment to convert gays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WELLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The American Psychiatric Association's board voted
unanimously Friday to reject therapy aimed solely at turning gays
into heterosexuals, saying it can cause depression, anxiety and
self-destructive behavior.
	   ``All the evidence would indicate this is the way people are
born. We treat disease, not the way people are,'' said Dr. Nada
Stotland, head of the association's joint committee on public
affairs.
	   ``The very existence of therapy that is supposed to change
people's sexuality, even for people who don't take it, is harmful
because it implies that they have a disease,'' said Stotland, of
Rush Medical College in Chicago. ``There is evidence that the
belief itself can trigger depression and anxiety.''
	   The American Psychological Association made a similar decision
last year.
	   Gay activists applauded the decision. Proponents of converting
gays said the decision could deny patients the treatment they want.
	   Some fundamentalist Christian religious groups attempt to
persuade homosexuals to undergo treatment, sometimes called
``reparative therapy,'' to convert to heterosexuality.
	   Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and the
Christian Coalition began a national advertising campaign just
before the killing of Matthew Shepard urging gays to convert.
	   Shepard, a 21-year-old gay University of Wyoming student, died
Oct. 12 after a severe beating in Laramie, Wyoming. Police believe
he was attacked in part because he was gay.
	   Asked whether efforts to convert gays could result in attacks
like the killing of Shepard, Stotland said spreading the idea that
homosexuality is a disease or evil could make people ``feel less
inhibited about beating up gays, or not giving them jobs.''
	   Stotland said during the psychiatric group's quarterly meeting
that there is no evidence that sexual orientation can be changed.
	   John Paulk, a specialist on homosexuality and gender for the
Colorado Springs-based Focus on the Family, disagreed. He said
there is no evidence that homosexuality is ``biologically
predetermined.''
	   ``This makes it more difficult for clients who want to be
treated for unwanted homosexuality,'' Paulk said. ``Furthermore no
scientific study has given conclusive evidence that homosexuality
cannot be successfully treated.''
	   David Smith, chief strategist for the Human Rights Campaign,
said, ``We applaud ... the condemnation of this thoroughly
discredited practice that causes great harm to people who are gay
but not yet comfortable with their sexual orientation.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Making their case against impeachment to the
House Judiciary Committee, Democrats reminded Chairman Henry Hyde
of his suggestion last January that ``at the end of the day, the
Democrats have to agree.''
	   When debate opened Friday on four articles of impeachment
against President Bill Clinton, it was clear that no committee
Democrat was prepared to agree.
	   ``Tragically, there's no bipartisanship here,'' lamented Hyde
after about nine hours of often rancourous debate.
	   The vote to approve the first article of impeachment, which
charged the president with perjury before a federal grand jury, was
21 Republicans in favor and 16 Democrats opposed. As passed, it
carried a Republican-proposed amendment that passed by identical
numbers.
	   On the second article, charging Clinton with perjury in the
Paula Jones case, Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina
joined Democrats in opposition. The other 20 Republicans voted in
favor, making the tally 20-17.
	   On the third article, the party-line vote was 21 Republicans in
favor and 16 Democrats against.
	   One issue on which all sides agreed during the impeachment
debate was the seriousness of a process that could end with removal
of president. How would the public react to taking that step on a
party-line vote within the committee?
	   ``They view a party-line vote as more of the same,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press, which regularly surveys public opinion on a range of issues.
	   ``It makes people feel Washington is out of touch with their own
feelings on the subject,'' said Kohut, a nonpartisan pollster.
	   Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said he doesn't think the
public would be surprised by a party-line vote within the
committee, but ``they'd be surprised if it were a party-line vote
in the full House.''
	   According to recent polls, almost six Americans in 10 disapprove
of the way Republicans in Congress are handling the investigation
of President Clinton. Two-thirds oppose impeachment, and about six
in 10 favor censuring the president.
	   Newhouse admitted the process contains risks for the
Republicans. ``They are in the process of impeaching a president
with 60 percent approval ratings,'' he said.
	   That risk increases the further the process goes and will reach
a critical stage if the House votes next week to send articles of
impeachment to the Senate for a trial that could result in
Clinton's removal from office.
	   David Mayhew, a Yale historian and an authority on divided
government, in which the president is of one party and Congress is
controlled by the other, said an impeachment trial in the Senate
``could pre-empt time and energy'' Congress could spend on other
issues.
	   On the other hand, he said, if the House rejects all proposed
impeachment articles, the impact of the divisive process ``might
fade pretty quickly .''
	   Mayhew said the long investigation of Clinton's involvement with
Monica Lewinsky and the allegations that he lied under oath about
it have not seemed to impair his ability to function on foreign and
defense policy. On domestic policy, however, Mayhew said Clinton
has been far less successful and probably won't get his way with
the Republican Congress in any case.
	   Herbert S. Parmet, a historian and biographer of Presidents
Nixon and Bush, said the allegations against Clinton fall far short
of those brought against Nixon, who resigned after the
Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee passed articles of
impeachment for which several Republican members also voted.
	   He said the current process gives ``the impression of a partisan
ganging up on a president by individuals who loathed him from the
beginning.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The United States will give dlrs 5
million in emergency assistance to rebuild houses for Central
Americans left homeless by Hurricane Mitch, a U.S. official said
Friday.
	   The assistance, announced in the Honduran capital by U.S.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, is part of a
U.S. aid package that reached dlrs 300 million on Friday with dlrs
17 million in additional food aid announced by President Clinton.
	   Hurricane Mitch, which struck Central America in late October
and early November, killed more than 9,000 people, according to
official figures. About 250,000 houses were damaged.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Two Guatemalan brothers convicted of
killing a taxi driver, a mother and her child in November 1997 have
been sentenced to die by lethal injection.
	   A judge in Puerto Barrios, 160 miles (260 kilometers) northeast
of Guatemala City, handed down the sentence Thursday to Obdulio
Hernandez Salazar, 29, and his brother, Gelser Wilfredo, 20.
	   They were convicted of killing a taxi driver who had refused to
take them 18 miles (30 kilometers) from Puerto Barrios to Morelos.
	   They then forced another taxi driver to take them there and
raped a woman who had been a passenger in the cab. They later
killed the woman and her 8-year-old son. The driver escaped by
jumping into a river and was the key witness against the brothers.
	   The brothers, among 34 people condemned to death in Guatemala,
can appeal their sentences.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ The United States is seeking permission from
Peru to use an airport on the north coast to refuel anti-drug
surveillance planes, an embassy spokesman said Friday.
	   Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the head of the U.S. Southern Command in
Panama, made the request in a meeting with President Alberto
Fujimori on Thursday. Peru is considering the proposal.
	   The U.S. government wants to use the airport to refuel the AWAC
planes before and after surveillance flights over the Amazon, said
the embassy spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
	   The planes currently operate out of the Howard Air Force in
Panama, but the government won't be able to use the base after U.S.
forces withdraw from Panama at the end of 1999.
	   Peru is one of the world's biggest producers of the coca leaf
used to make cocaine.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The land where 2,000 people died in a
mudslide caused by Hurricane Mitch has been declared a national
monument, the Nicaraguan government announced Friday.
	   Plans for a memorial at the site on the side of the Casitas
Volcano will be announced within 90 days, the government said in a
decree published in newspapers.
	   The monument site will comprise 4,200 acres (1,700 hectares) of
land along a nine-mile (14 kilometers) stretch that is still
considered too dangerous to be inhabited. Bodies remain buried
there under dried mud and rock.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Panama's president defended riot
police Friday after they used tear gas and rubber bullets to break
up student protests against plans to privatize state water
services.
	   President Ernesto Perez Balladares said police took ``adequate''
steps to halt the protests given ``the level of aggressiveness by
the demonstrators.''
	   During protests Wednesday and last week, students threw rocks
and sticks at police officers. More than 100 people were arrested
and dozens were injured. Human rights groups and opposition
politicians, however, continued to criticize the police.
	   The Permanent Forum for Human Rights, which represents 14
organizations, said the officers used ``excessive force.''
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 13-year-old girl who disappeared while
walking home from her school bus stop appears to be the latest
victim in a string of rapes and slayings of women in the northern
Mexican city of Juarez, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Since 1993, about 100 women have been found dead in the
industrial city across from El Paso, Texas, according to police.
Independent groups have counted between 129 and 192 cases.
	   A man found the body of Celia Gomez de la Cruz late Wednesday,
Mexico City newspapers said. She appeared to have been sexually
assaulted. She had disappeared three weeks earlier.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A state anti-kidnapping squad arrested four
Mexican federal police officers who allegedly kidnapped a man and
demanded a dlrs 25,000 ransom, a published report said Friday.
	   The four federal officers seized Carlos Botello, 35, on Tuesday,
the daily La Jornada reported. Botello's wife went to Chihuaha
state judicial police when she received the ransom demand.
	   State police arranged to deliver the money at a shopping center
parking lot Thursday in Juarez, a border city across from El Paso,
Texas. They arrested two federal officers who arrived to pick up
the money. Two federal police commanders were also arrested.
	   In May, federal authorities pulled an elite anti-kidnapping unit
out of Juarez after three members were arrested in a kidnapping.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In an apparent attempt to improve relations
recently strained by comments made by Fidel Castro, Cuba's foreign
minister will visit Mexico next week, Mexico's foreign secretary
said.
	   Mexico recalled its ambassador from Havana on Dec. 4 and
demanded an explanation after the Cuban president criticized
Mexico's relations with the United States.
	   Mexican newspapers quoted Castro as saying that Mexico had
turned its back on Latin American nations and that its children
knew more about Mickey Mouse than about their national heroes.
	   The Cuban embassy issued a statement last week saying that the
comments were taken out of context and were misinterpreted.
	   After attending a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green told reporters that her Cuban counterpart, Roberto
Robaina, would visit Friday.
	   She expressed confidence the dispute would soon be forgotten.
	   Castro and his small rebel band trained in Mexico for a year
before sailing to eastern Cuba in 1956, launching the revolt that
would topple dictator Fulgencio Batista two years later.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Rescue workers combed through the
wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner early Saturday searching for
possible survivors and the bodies of victims. Local hospitals
reported at least 80 of the 146 passengers aboard had died, while
50 others survived the crash.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261 plunged
into a swamp at about 6:45 p.m. on Friday and burst into flames
about three miles (five kilometers) from the airport in Surat
Thani.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   The passengers were mostly Thais returning to the area for the
weekend or heading to nearby resort islands. Of the 25 foreigners
on board, 11 had survived, 3 were confirmed dead and the rest were
still missing, police said on Saturday morning.
	   Slogging through a swamp, about 200 rescue workers and
volunteers from nearby villagers struggled to pull bodies from the
burnt, twisted metal of the wrecked plane. The rescue operation was
scaled back early Saturday due to dark, rainy conditions but began
again in full force at daybreak.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   Thai television said the pilot survived, but the report could
not be immediately confirmed.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the water that has hampered rescuers may have cushioned the
aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to go
up high. The engines were really screaming. Then I saw a light,
bright like the sunset, about four stories off the ground, then a
fireball falling.''
	   One of the survivors shown on television was a boy, about 10,
who had wounds on his forehead.
	   Another survivor, popular Thai musician Reungsak Loychusak, told
a television station from his hospital bed: ``My whole left side is
in pain, I can barely move.''
	   The airline released a passenger list that indicated most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western and
Japanese names. The list did not include the passengers'
nationalities.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was an Airbus A310-200 with
245 seats, one of two in Thai Airway's fleet. It was delivered in
April 1986. By the end of October, it had accumulated 23,000 flight
hours.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   ``Until an official investigation report is available, it is
unproductive to enter into speculation about the causes,'' Airbus
said, noting that weather had been poor in the area.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban broke
down in tears after arriving from the capital, Bangkok, and
learning that his sister, Siriwan, had been killed in the crash.
Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from Surat Thani, also
died.
	   Suthep was originally booked on the flight, but canceled to
attend a wedding. He expressed dismay that he had learned about the
crash first from relatives in Surat Thani, rather than from the
mostly government-owned airline that he supervises.
	   Suthep said Thai Airways would compensate the families of anyone
who was killed or injured.
	   Thai Airways was attempting to fly relatives of the passengers
to Surat Thani or nearby Phuket on Saturday morning, but bad
weather in southern Thailand forced them to delay the flight.

Kwan easily wins technical program

 &UR; EDS: Will be UPDATED with men's results &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now if only Michelle Kwan had felt this way in
February at Nagano.
	   Kwan calmly and almost routinely skated a stylish technical
program Friday night to take the lead in the World Professional
Figure Skating Championships. That peacefulness was missing during
the Olympics, in which she skated tentatively in the long program
and finished second to Tara Lipinski.
	   This time, Kwan hit everything with flair as she debuted her new
free skate, to ``Lamento d'Ariane.'' The two-time world champion on
the Olympic-eligible level plans to use the same routine in the
nationals in two months; this event has been sanctioned by the
International Skating Union, so Kwan and Nicole Bobek, who was
second Friday night, retain their eligibility.
	   ``I felt more relaxed than I usually do,'' the 18-year-old Kwan
said. ``Last year, I'd probably have done two internationals and a
couple of pro-ams and been exhausted. But now I feel ready for
nationals. I'm not worried and tense and stressed out.''
	   Facing the toughest field she will encounter this season, Kwan
swept the seven-judge panel. Of course, none of the other
competitors came close to the seven triple jumps she nailed, or to
the flair she put into the performance, worth half the total score.
	   ``Tonight was a very important night for us,'' coach Frank
Carroll said. ``She did seven triples _ yea, team! _ and whether it
was slow or not, I'll take it.''
	   Kwan earned one perfect 6.0, from the Canadian judge. That was a
surprise.
	   ``You get a perfect score and you wonder, `Where do I go from
here?''' she said. ``Everyone says, `Don't change a thing.' But I
have to change.
	   ``I have to appreciate it now and start all over.''
	   Bobek, who's had to start all over after her 17th-place disaster
at Nagano, also looked sharp in edging Japan's Yuka Sato for second
heading into Saturday night's artistic program. Back training with
Richard Callaghan, who oversaw her climb to the 1995 national
title, Bobek nailed a beautiful triple lutz to begin her rousing
routine, to music from the film ``Zorro.''
	   ``Basically, I'm looking at every competition as a step up,''
Bobek said. ``We're working hard. I don't feel as nervous.''
	   It was a rough night for the two Olympic champions in the field.
Oksana Baiul, the 1994 winner, finished fifth, and Katarina Witt
(1984-88) was sixth and last. Two-time Olympic bronze medalist Lu
Chen of China was fourth.
	   ``I'm embarrassed,'' Witt said. ``I skated very poorly.''
	   Five-time U.S. ice dance champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod
Swallow were a surprising first after the rhythm dance. It's rare
when Americans wind up ahead of Russian dancers in any competition,
let alone the world pros.
	   But they edged Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov, and Pasha Grischuk
and Yevgeny Platov. Grischuk partnered with Platov to win the last
two Olympics, while Usova and Zhulin, who once were married, also
were Olympians.
	   Nagano winners Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia led
the pairs.
	   ``It's the first time we skated this program,'' Dmitriev said of
their performance to Frank Sinatra's ``Fly Me to the Moon.''
	   ``Before, we mostly do classical music. This is different for
us.''
	   The men's technical program was held later Friday night.

his continuing rehabilitation.
	   Konstantinov, seriously injured in a limousine accident 18
months ago, attended the Red Wings' National Hockey League game
Friday night against the Edmonton Oilers. He sat in team owner Mike
Ilitch's box high above Joe Louis Arena.
	   It was the first game he's attended since the Red Wings, who
used Konstantinov as inspiration for their second straight Stanley
Cup title last June, raised the banner on that championship on Oct.
16.
	   Konstantinov waved slightly and was given a standing ovation
from the capacity crowd when he was shown on the scoreboard video
screens during the second period.
	   Konstantinov and his family will soon move to Florida for the
winter, where his rehab work will include sound stimuli designed to
rekindle memories. The former star defenseman's short-term memory
is poor, a result of brain trauma suffered in the June 13, 1997
accident that also severely injured team masseur Sergei
Manatsakonov.
	   Doctors hope sounds from his past will jog Konstantinov's
memory, and the Red Wings are contributing to that effort.
	   During Thursday's practice at Joe Louis Arena, microphones were
set on the ice to record voices and skating sounds so familiar to
Konstantinov during his playing days. The tapes will be played to
him in hopes of stirring those memories.

Economic crisis dampens Singapore's Merry Christmas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ For the first time in years, an economic crisis
has forced this rich island nation to cut down on preparations for
Christmas, usually one of its biggest entertainment and shopping
events.
	   Only 12 percent of Singapore's 3.1 million people are
Christians, but overdressed Santas sweat in tropical Singapore from
November to January, shortly before this predominantly Chinese
population marks the Lunar New Year.
	   Though the trappings may not always be right _ last year Santa
arrived in some malls on horseback _ the city-state in years past
glowed with bright decorations as Singaporeans jammed the stores.
	   But the regional economic downturn means Saint Nick's sack will
be lighter than usual this year.
	   Not that he didn't make an effort to boost spirits in these hard
times.
	   Strings of lights and stars still glimmer above Orchard Road,
Singapore's plush shopping avenue. In front of the Goodwood Park
Hotel, voted the best-decorated, Santa looms in a huge sleigh
pulled by gigantic reindeer.
	   But the lights are fewer this year, tourists and Christmas trees
fewer, and Singaporeans seem to be bracing for deep wage cuts.
	   ``I'm only buying presents for children,'' said Deema Bakar,
gazing at a toy shop display recently. ``The rest of the family
will have to do without gifts for a while.''
	   Though this prosperous country has escaped the worst of the
crisis, the government recently launched a dlrs 6 billion
cost-cutting package that will slash salaries and benefits in
January.
	   Unemployment has doubled to 4.5 percent in recent months, and
many Singaporeans worry that the era of free-spending may have
finally ended.
	   Like most hotels and malls, the Goodwood Park has cut its
decoration budget from 50,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 30,000) to
20,000 (dlrs 12,000).
	   ``So this year our kitchen artist dreamt up the design, and our
engineers and maintenance crew did the construction,'' said Cindy
Huang-Chan, its head of public relations.
	   At nearby Tanglin Mall, shoppers are greeted by fake snow,
artificial fog and real bubbles. Santa sits quietly in a little
house, as if speculating how much his property has sunk in value
since the last visit.
	   Children buzz around the mall's Christmas fair, where some gifts
can be bought for as little as 10 Singapore dollars (dlrs 6). But
most shops are far from crowded.
	   ``This is a big difference from last year,'' said Josie Sze, who
expects sales to drop 20 to 30 percent this year in her arts and
crafts boutique. ``Singaporeans are mostly coming to see the
decorations, and tourists are much fewer than in previous
seasons.''
	   One of prime casualties of the crisis, Singapore's tourist
arrivals is expected to decline this year by 16 percent after years
of attracting 7 to 8 million people annually.
	   For some, the economic downturn is a warning to sober up after
past spending frenzies.
	   ``I think it's horrible how much we used to spend for the
holiday season,'' said Angeline Teo, a 32-year-old lawyer. She
bought a plastic tree this year, and sent the money she saved to
her cousins in Malaysia.

American skier still out with inner ear problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colorado (AP) _ Three-time Olympian Tim
Tetreault was pulled from a World Cup starting lineup Friday night
because of an inner ear problem that has been hampering his ski
jumping.
	   Tetreault, 28, of Norwich, Vermont, was sidelined for Thursday's
sprint event but had been expected to compete Saturday in the
112-meter jumping event.
	   However, coach Tom Steitz said Dr. Bryan Bomberg recommended
Tetreault also skip the jumping Saturday at Howelsen Hill and the
15-kilometer race Sunday while trying to recuperate from the ear
problem, which has been affecting his equilibrium while jumping.
	   ``I just don't feel comfortable on the jump now,'' Tetreault
said. ``It's pretty bad timing, with my parents in town from
Vermont, but I can't take a chance on creating a bigger problem by
jumping now. I want to be back on the World Cup next month.''
	   Steitz added, ``It's pretty discouraging but you can't fool
around with this kind of safety issue. It's serious stuff.
	   ``If Timmy loses his equilibrium on a jump,'' the coach asked,
``who knows what could happen? Better to sit and have Dr. Bomberg
keep working with him through the holidays so, hopefully, he gets
back on the World Cup.''

Punishing schedule leads to poor soccer as Asian Games progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A punishing schedule with a new match
every 48 hours is taking its toll on the soccer teams at the Asian
Games, leading to sloppy, listless play as the survivors of the
original 23 sides head wearily to the knockout rounds.
	   The coaches of several teams have complained that playing three
matches in six days during the second preliminary round _ narrowing
the remaining 16 teams down to eight _ had both physically and
mentally exhausted their players.
	   That has left sides like Kuwait _ whose potent striking duo
Jasem al-Huwaidi and Farj Laheeb teamed up for a combined 15 goals
in the first three matches _ able to score only one in their last
two.
	   ``After too much effort in a short period, the players cannot
make a great match,'' said Carlos de Queiroz, the Portuguese coach
who took over United Arab Emirates three months ago. ``From a
physiological point of view, they can't recover.''
	   De Queiroz noted that most of the sides at the Asian Games are
composed of youngsters about 20 years old preparing for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Their elders in the mid-to-late 20s
who make up most World Cup sides typically have three to four days
between matches to rest up.
	   Philippe Troussier, his French counterpart coaching Japan, said
an extra day between matches would make all the difference between
100 percent recovery and tired, laggard teams that can play only
the most basic soccer.
	   ``It's not only my team,'' Troussier said. ``It's the same for
everybody. In this weather, with this schedule, the players can't
concentrate their efforts.''
	   But Asian soccer veterans said such a pace was typical in
regional tournaments. National federations don't have the funds to
maintain a team abroad for three or four weeks, as they do in
Europe. Nearly all tournaments are compressed into two, pushing the
players hard.
	   Some of the strongest sides in the tournament _ Japan, Kuwait,
Oman _ looked brilliant in about their third or fourth matches. By
the end of the second preliminary round, they had succumbed to
fatigue worsened by Bangkok's intense tropical heat.
	   Oman pulled out all the stops Tuesday and upset mighty Iran, one
of the favorites for a gold medal. Oman's Brazilian coach, Valdeir
Vieira, said afterward he doubted his team could repeat a
giant-killing performance with only two days rest. He was right _
another favorite, China, demolished his side, 6-1, in their next
outing.
	   Things won't ease up once the knock-out quarterfinals start
Monday, though half the sides advancing _ South Korea, Kuwait,
defending champion Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan _ will have one more
day of rest, a potentially decisive factor.

Langer's 157 not out props Australia to 361-9
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Inspired by a brilliant unbeaten 157
by Justin Langer, Australia batted itself to a strong position in
the third Ashes cricket test against England at the Adelaide Oval
on Saturday.
	   Resuming the day on 266 for four, Australia batted on to 361 for
nine at lunch on the second day with No. 11 Glenn McGrath unbeaten
on three at the break.
	   Langer continued from where he left off on the first day,
acquiring his career-best innings despite England claiming five
wickets from the other end.
	   Overnight batsman Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy and Damien Fleming
fell cheaply
	   to the medium pace combination of Darren Gough and Dean Headley,
but Langer
	   stayed composed throughout his 7 1-2-hour innings.
	   Ponting scored five before driving at a hard-working Gough to
give second slip Graeme Hick a head-high catch.
	   It was Gough's second wicket with the second new ball following
his dismissal of Steve Waugh 13 minutes before stumps on the first
day.
	   Langer's chanceless innings included 11 boundaries off 314
balls. The other main contributions came from Mark Taylor and Steve
Waugh who scored 59 runs apiece.
	   Headley was the pick of the England bowlers with 4-91 in 21
overs. Off spinner Peter Such took 3-88 while Gough had 2-90.

Mexican, Bolivian leaders indirectly criticize action against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The presidents of Mexico and Bolivia
indirectly denounced Spain's attempts to try former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   Friday's joint declaration was issued after a day of official
meetings by Bolivia's Hugo Banzer, whose own past as a military
dictator has caused controversy here.
	   Banzer held private talks with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, Mexican senators and Mexican and Bolivian businessmen on
Friday.
	   In the joint statement, the two presidents ``rejected the
unilateral and extraterritorial application of laws,'' saying that
``injures the legal equality of states, sovereignty and the
principle of non-intervention in internal affairs.''
	   Latin American nations have rallied behind Chile's complaints
about Britain's decision this week to proceed with extradition
proceedings against Pinochet. He is wanted in Spain on charges of
torture, genocide and kidnapping stemming from his 1973-90 military
dictatorship of Chile.
	   Banzer also ran into controversy here. Mexico's largest leftist
party, Democratic Revolution, issued a statement this week saying
he should be prosecuted for genocide for killings during his
1971-78 military government.
	   Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leader of Democratic
Revolution, refused to give Banzer the keys to the city.
	   In a television interview on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Greene criticized those actions, calling them ``a great
discourtesy'' to an elected leader.
	   Banzer, who insists he is now a proven democrat, won Bolivia's
presidential election in 1997.
	   The two presidents said in their joint statement that
``democracy is indispensable for stability, peace and
development.''

DiMaggio awakens from coma but outlook `dire'

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio slipped in and out of a
coma, again bringing family to his bedside for what could be a
final vigil.
	   But the 84-year-old American baseball great startled doctors
Friday with his resiliency. At one point, he awakened from the deep
coma, moved his head and squeezed his doctor's hand.
	   ``It's still a very dire situation,'' Dr. Earl Barron said after
visiting DiMaggio in the afternoon. ``The whole thing could change
in 15 minutes.''
	   Barron said earlier in the day that chances of recovery were
slim after DiMaggio weakened from an ``overwhelming'' lung
infection. But even the doctor seemed stunned by this latest turn.
	   ``You won't believe it, but he's awake and he's moving his head
and grabbing my hand and squeezing it,'' Barron said. ``It's
completely unexpected. The coma that was present deeply this
morning is just not there now.''
	   In the morning, Barron sounded far less optimistic about how
long DiMaggio would live.
	   ``I don't know how long, but I would guess not very,'' he said.
	   On a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the best outlook, Barron
said DiMaggio was at 0.5 in the morning and had improved to a 1 by
afternoon.
	   Barron said DiMaggio's fever, which had shot up to 102 degrees
Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) overnight, was down again. He did
not give his exact temperature, but he said DiMaggio's lungs
sounded clear.
	   DiMaggio's family _ including his brother, Dom; grandchildren
Kathy and Paula; and longtime friend and lawyer Morris Engelberg _
were at Memorial Regional Hospital.
	   ``We're near the end,'' Engelberg said. ``It's a question of
hours, perhaps days.''
	   The family was discussing whether to sign a ``do not
resuscitate'' order, which Barron said would allow DiMaggio to die
with a ``measure of dignity.''
	   The order would mean that should his heart stop, there would be
no measures taken to restart it, Barron said. But he added that DNR
did not mean removal of the respirator that has helped DiMaggio to
breathe since his Oct. 14 surgery for lung cancer.
	   DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941, one of the greatest
feats in all sports, is still a record, and his marriage to Marilyn
Monroe in 1954 elevated his place in American culture.
	   He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years after his
retirement, and in 1969 was chosen as the greatest living baseball
player.
	   DiMaggio played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World Series in 13
seasons with the New York Yankees. He was a two-time batting
champion and a three-time most valuable player.
	   He has guarded his privacy intently since his retirement from
baseball in 1951, and information about his condition has been
tightly controlled since he entered the hospital, which has a wing
named in his honor, Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital.
	   His last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was honored at
Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine championship rings
that were stolen from his hotel room three decades ago. The Yankees
had wanted him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the World
Series, but by then, he was in the hospital just north of Miami.
	   He marked his 84th birthday in the hospital on Nov. 25,
surrounded by family, including his brother and two
great-grandchildren.

Scientists hunt way to rebuild bone in osteoporosis patients
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-MED-US-Bone Builder-Glance &QL;

 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Millions of women with advanced osteoporosis
can take drugs to stop the crippling disease from getting worse,
but they can't regrow much lost bone _ and thus they will always be
frail.
	   Now scientists are studying a biologically engineered hormone
that might one day help patients actually rebuild strong bones.
	   ``We have the beginning of a whole area of research into how you
rebuild a skeleton and cure the disease,'' said Dr. Robert Lindsay,
president of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and a lead
investigator of the experimental drug, called recombinant
parathyroid hormone.
	   It will take several more years of testing before scientists
know if parathyroid hormone, or PTH, works well enough to
prescribe, cautioned Dr. David Sartoris of the University of
California, San Diego. But ``it is a therapy that has a lot of
promise.''
	   Osteoporosis, or brittle-bone disease, afflicts 10 million
Americans, mostly elderly women, and 18 million others have low
bone mass. They're at risk of severe injury, such as breaking a
hip, along with chronic pain and a stooped posture as spinal
vertebrae and other bones fracture.
	   Bone is living tissue: Cells called osteoclasts dissolve
worn-out bone while other cells called osteoblasts replace it with
new bone. During childhood, new bone builds faster than old bone
dissolves. People hit their peak bone mass in their mid-20s.
	   Then the cycle changes and, as they age, bone removal exceeds
new bone formation. When that happens too fast, or when people
didn't build up strong enough bones when young, osteoporosis
occurs.
	   Various treatments, including estrogen and the popular
nonhormonal drug Fosamax, can slow bone loss by targeting
osteoclasts.
	   But ``conventional treatments cannot build bone. So they can
only hope to stabilize'' the disease, explained Dr. Sherry Sherman,
the National Institutes of Health's clinical endocrinology
director.
	   Small injections of parathyroid hormone, in contrast, appear to
act on osteoblasts to stimulate new bone growth.
	   Lindsay studied 217 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who
injected PTH or a placebo for a year. The drug increased the
density of the women's spines by 7 percent, a significant boost.
The hormone, a version made by Canada's Allelix Biopharmaceuticals,
also increased the size of the women's spinal bones, which might
give added strength.
	   The next step is making sure that the drug rebuilds quality bone
that won't easily break. Animal studies suggest it can restore bone
to original strength, said Allelix Vice President John Dietrich.
Now the company is looking for a U.S. partner to launch advanced
trials early next year to test that in women.
	   But even as scientists figure out how the hormone may rebuild
bone, young people, especially women, must take steps now to
prevent osteoporosis, Sartoris stressed. Women at risk _ who
include white or Asian women who are petite, thin or have relatives
with osteoporosis _ should get their first bone-density test
between ages 21 and 35, he advised.
	   At that age, women whose bones are thinning have time to block
further loss, by exercising, eating more calcium and vitamin D,
stopping smoking or taking anti-osteoporosis medication.

new bone formation. When that happens too fast, or when people
didn't build up strong enough bones when young, osteoporosis
occurs.
	   Various treatments, including estrogen and the popular
nonhormonal drug Fosamax, can slow bone loss by targeting
osteoclasts.
	   But ``conventional treatments cannot build bone. So they can
only hope to stabilize'' the disease, explained Dr. Sherry Sherman,
the National Institutes of Health's clinical endocrinology
director.
	   Small injections of parathyroid hormone, in contrast, appear to
act on osteoblasts to stimulate new bone growth.
	   Lindsay studied 217 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who
injected PTH or a placebo for a year. The drug increased the
density of the women's spines by 7 percent, a significant boost.
The hormone, a version made by Canada's Allelix Biopharmaceuticals,
also increased the size of the women's spinal bones, which might
give added strength.
	   The next step is making sure that the drug rebuilds quality bone
that won't easily break. Animal studies suggest it can restore bone
to original strength, said Allelix Vice President John Dietrich.
Now the company is looking for a U.S. partner to launch advanced
trials early next year to test that in women.
	   But even as scientists figure out how the hormone may rebuild
bone, young people, especially women, must take steps now to
prevent osteoporosis, Sartoris stressed. Women at risk _ who
include white or Asian women who are petite, thin or have relatives
with osteoporosis _ should get their first bone-density test
between ages 21 and 35, he advised.
	   At that age, women whose bones are thinning have time to block
further loss, by exercising, eating more calcium and vitamin D,
stopping smoking or taking anti-osteoporosis medication.

Tips to prevent osteoporosis

<TEXT>
	   Taking steps to prevent osteoporosis early in life is vital, but
too few people, especially young women, do it, experts say.
	   The best advice is to get enough calcium during childhood and
adolescence. But for adults, Dr. David Sartoris of the University
of California, San Diego, recommends:
	   _Women with significant risk factors for developing thin bones
should have their first bone-density test between ages 21 and 35,
when it would do the most good. Instead, many women wait until
menopause or until they've broken a bone.
	   Risk factors include being a woman; being white or Asian; being
thin, underweight or anorexic; having a family history of
osteoporosis; or not having regular menstrual periods.
	   _Women whose bones are somewhat thin can make lifestyle changes
to help prevent later osteoporosis, including getting enough daily
calcium and vitamin D, exercising, stopping smoking and avoiding
excessive alcohol or caffeine.
	   _Women at serious risk of osteoporosis, or who already have the
disease, may be put on drug or hormone therapy to curb bone loss.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Rescue workers combed through the
wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner early Saturday searching for
possible survivors and the bodies of victims. Police said at least
82 of the 146 people aboard had died, while 50 others survived the
crash.
	   Burned and bruised corpses were lined up on the floor of the
passenger terminal at Surat Thani airport, and police said they
were having difficulty identifying some of the dead.
	   At the scene of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using
specially-designed equipment cut through what remained of the jet's
fuselage to extract the remaining bodies and anyone who might still
be alive inside.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
after bursting into flames about three miles (five kilometers) from
the airport.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   The passengers were mostly Thais. Of the 25 foreigners on board,
11 had survived, 3 were confirmed dead and the rest were still
missing, police said on Saturday morning.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and volunteers from nearby villagers
struggled to pull bodies from the burnt, twisted metal of the
wrecked plane. The rescue operation was scaled back early Saturday
due to dark, rainy conditions but began again in full force at
daybreak.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Thai television said the pilot survived, but the report could
not be immediately confirmed.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the waist-high water that has hampered rescuers may have
cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to go
up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset, about four
stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   The airline released a passenger list that indicated most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western and
Japanese names. The list did not include the passengers'
nationalities. The remaining 14 people were crew members.
	   An airline spokesman said the plane was delivered in April 1986
and had accumulated 23,000 flight hours.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban broke
down in tears after arriving from the capital, Bangkok, and
learning that his sister, Siriwan, had been killed in the crash.
Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from Surat Thani, also
died.

	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Michael Peca's backhander broke a
scoreless tie with 2:01 to play and Dominik Hasek added another yet
another shutout against New York as the Buffalo Sabres beat the
Rangers 2-0 Friday night.
	   Peca averted what would have been a second scoreless tie between
the teams this season. Vaclav Varada, who assisted on Peca's goal,
scored an empty-netter with 15 seconds left.
	   Hasek stopped 16 shots, including a backhander by Todd Harvey in
front with 2:40 left as he notched his fifth shutout this season
and 38th of his NHL career. Hasek had a four-game shutout streak
against the Rangers snapped in a 4-2 Sabres win on Nov. 25.
 &UR; Red Wings 3, Oilers 2
	   In Detroit, Sergei Fedorov and Steve Yzerman both had a goal and
an assist as the Red Wings beat the Edmonton Oilers.
	   Vyacheslav Kozlov scored the other goal for the Red Wings, who
are 8-1-1 in a 10-game stretch that began with a 6-2 victory Nov.
18 at Edmonton.
	   Andrei Kovalenko scored both goals for the Oilers, 0-4-1 in
their last five games.
 &UR; Flames 2, Lightning 1
	   In Tampa Florida, Andrew Cassels and Cory Stillman each scored a
goal and assisted the other as the Calgary Flames beat the Tampa
Bay Lightning.
	   Calgary rookie goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere came in to
replace injured starting goalie Tyler Moss with just 6:11 gone in
the first and stopped 21 shots.
	   Alex Selivanov scored at 5:53 of the third period for Tampa Bay.

ASEAN foreign ministers gather to discuss Asian crisis

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The morning after a lengthy session spent
wrangling over whether to admit Cambodia, foreign ministers from
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathered Saturday for
formal talks on helping their countries recover from a severe case
of economic flu.
	   A working dinner on Friday went for more than four hours,
breaking up just after 11 p.m., so many ministers were short on
sleep as they straggled in for the 9 a.m. start of a scheduled
seven hours of discussions sandwiched around a short lunch.
	   ``The main challenge facing this meeting is addressing the
financial and economic problems, the measures for economic recovery
and cushioning the impact on vulnerable members of society,'' ASEAN
Secretary-general Rodolfo Severino said.
	   Severino and other top officials clearly were trying to steer
the spotlight back to economic issues, which were expected to top
the agenda for meetings heading up to the annual summit of ASEAN
leaders Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   So far, however, the question of Cambodia's membership has
dominated the talks.
	   Despite heavy lobbying by host nation Vietnam and other
countries, the foreign ministers could not reach a consensus Friday
for an unanimous decision on the issue.
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in 1997, but political
turmoil led to its application being put on hold until a stable
government was in place.
	   An agreement between two major Cambodian political factions was
reached late last month, and the country was given back its seat at
the United Nations earlier this week.
	   ``From the beginning, since the elections, we in ASEAN have said
we would act on Cambodia's membership once it formed a coalition
government,'' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said. ``Now
they have, and I think we should move swiftly to process their
membership.''
	   However, some countries were holding out, warning against using
the upcoming summit as an artificial deadline.
	   Despite the lack of accord, there still was a chance ASEAN's
leaders could decide to admit Cambodia.
	   ``Last night, we didn't succeed at the foreign ministers level
to solve it, but we are going to report to our respective heads of
government, and they will have to decide,'' Alatas said.
	   Severino said the meeting's objective was to come up with
concrete measures to advance regional economic integration. He said
he has seen no opposition to ASEAN's proclaimed free-market
philosophy and no trend toward protectionism which needs to be
combated.
	   ``Closing the economies to one another at this stage would be
self-defeating,'' Severino said. ``That is not the direction that
ASEAN is going. It's going toward faster economic integration and
maintaining openness of the economies.''
	   He said the primary challenge is to address the economic
problems and measures for economic recovery while ``cushioning the
impact on vulnerable members of society.''
	   Alatas said ASEAN wants to send a ``clear signal'' that its
members are united in the fight against their individual problems.
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group made up of less-developed and
rapidly industrializing nations. But the region's economies already
range from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's
poorest countries.
	   ASEAN economic ministers, meeting separately and avoiding the
media, reportedly have been discussing how to fast-track previous
agreements on an ASEAN Free Trade Area and an ASEAN Investment
Area.
	   Such proposals were discussed by trade ministers recently in
Manila after they saw a study showing a precipitous drop in foreign
investment in the region.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Elder statesman Bob Charles
produced the best answer to those who have complained the Formosa
Auckland Country Club course he designed was too tough.
	   The 62-year-old Charles took advantage of conditions easier than
in the blustery first two days as he toured the new layout
collecting six birdies in a round of 4-under-par 68 Saturday in the
third round of the New Zealand Open.
	   He then turned his dry wit to addressing players who'd
complained the course was too hard after being buffeted by the wind
in the earlier rounds.
	   ``They are a little wet behind the ears,'' said Charles.
	   ``They need a few more years experience out there and then they
might be a little more appreciative of how fortunate they are to be
playing in an Open championship where they are tested to the utmost
not only physically but also mentally.''
	   Asked if he thought some young players expected to play in easy
conditions too often, Charles agreed.
	   ``Stopping short of calling a lot of my fellow pros a bunch of
prima donnas _ stopping short of saying that, I think what you said
has some truth to it.
	   ``As Gary Player would say, you need a little hardship in your
life, you can't have everything on a silver platter.''
	   Charles is a winner of 75 tournaments worldwide and still the
only lefthanded winner of a major championship _ the 1963 British
Open. (djp)

 &UR; AP Boxing Writer

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Fernando Vargas' bid for a
world title Saturday night is not billed as the main event, and he
couldn't care less.
	   ``Just as long as I'm getting a title shot,'' the 21-year-old
Vargas said. ``Gatti-Robinson is a great fight to be under.''
	   The second half of an HBO doubleheader in the Trump Taj Mahal
will be a 10-round rematch of Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson's Aug.
22 bout, won by Robinson on a split decision, which has has been
called by some people the fight of the year.
	   The telecast will open with the unbeaten Vargas' challenge in
only his 15th pro fight to IBF junior middleweight champion Yory
Boy Campas of Mexico, seeking his 73rd victory in his 75th fight.
	   Gatti, a former IBF junior lightweight champion, is the kind of
fighter television and most fans love. Win or lose, his fights are
never dull, and he has lost his last two, being stopped by Angel
Manfredy in the eighth of a brawl that preceded his
``take-no-prisoners'' loss to Robinson.
	   ``Absolutely,'' Gatti said when asked if it was the most
important match of his career.
	   ``In the back of my mind I know that Arturo Gatti has a lot
left,'' Robinson said. A third straight loss, however, could
severely damage Gatti's bargaining power. He and Robinson each are
getting dlrs 400,000.
	   The 27-year-old Campos is getting about dlrs 450,000, and
Vargas' purse is dlrs 180,000.
	   ``This time I will be the fighter I was supposed to be the first
time in August (in which he was the favorite),'' said the
26-year-old Gatti (29-3, 24 knockouts), of Jersey City, New Jersey.
``I'm going to win every round this time.''
	   ``I was a better man that night (the first fight) and I will be
a better man Saturday night,'' said the 27-year-old Robinson (26-2,
10 knockouts), of Philadelphia, the IBF's No. 2-ranked contender.
	   The contract weight limit is 136 pounds (61 kilograms), a pound
over the lightweight limit. Gatti weighed in officially Friday at
135 pounds (61 kgs), and Robinson weighed 133 3/4 pounds (60 kgs).
In this era of weigh-ins being held one or two days before a fight,
boxers often weigh much more than their official weights by fight
time. Gatti said he expects to go into the ring at about 150 pounds
(68 kgs). Robinson said he would weigh 142 or 143 pounds (64 kgs).
	   Campas and Vargas each weighed 151 pounds (68 kgs), three pounds
under the junior middleweight limit.
	   Some boxing people wonder if Vargas (14-0, 14 knockouts), of
Oxnard Calif., has enough experience to handle a power-puncher the
caliber of Campos (72-2, 62 knockouts), who will be making his
fourth title defense.
	   Vargas, however, said he's confident he has the speed and
movement to offset the straight-ahead style of the champion. and he
also noted that he also can punch with power.
	   With a victory, Vargas would join Floyd Mayweather, IBF super
featherweight champion, as the only members of the 1996 U.S.
Olympic boxing team to win world titles.

Worry over sponsorship fallout from Salt Lake scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top U.S. Olympic official is
worried that Salt Lake City's financial misconduct scandal could
scare away sponsors from the 2002 Winter Games.
	   ``Clearly the sponsors are not going to be happy with what
they're hearing,'' said John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee's
chief marketing official. ``This controversy needs to be quickly
and totally resolved.''
	   ``I hope it will be a footnote,'' he said. ``I hope it never
becomes a chapter.''
	   The International Olympic Committee on Friday began a top-level
investigation into allegations of impropriety by the Salt Lake
group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of
then-president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Olympic rules prohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or
their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs
150.
	   One senior IOC executive board member, Marc Hodler of
Switzerland, has characterized the Salt Lake fund as bribes to sway
votes of IOC members. Salt Lake won the 1995 election in a
landslide.
	   ``I've already stated I do not regard what was done as a
bribe,'' SLOC president Frank Joklik said Friday. ``I recognize
there have been perceptions contrary to that. I regret those
perceptions, but I don't feel they are justified.''
	   Joklik and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared
before a special IOC investigative panel for 90 minutes Friday
night. Both sides declined to comment after the talks, saying the
inquiry was continuing.
	   It's the first time the IOC has ever investigated alleged
vote-buying by a bidding city. And it's the biggest Olympic
misconduct scandal since 1991 when conflict-of-interest charges
forced Robert Helmick to resign as an IOC member and USOC
president.
	   Krimsky, who heads the U.S. sponsorship program for the 2002
games, said two unidentified sponsors have already expressed
concern to him about the Salt Lake controversy.
	   ``It's perfectly appropriate for the sponsors to ask me
questions about it,'' he said. ``What they wanted was more
information. I gave it to them and they seemed satisfied.''
	   Krimsky said U.S. marketing officials were holding briefings for
the sponsors to keep them informed of the situation.
	   ``The fragility of the Olympic movement is of concern to me and
those who market it,'' he said. ``The sooner this case is dealt
with the better. We are now within the window where everything
needs to be focused on the preparation of the games. Anything that
disrupts that is of great concern to us.''
	   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the investigation,
said the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend. He declined to
speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could be taken against Salt
Lake.
	   He did not rule out moving the games elsewhere _ although that
is considered highly unlikely.
	   ``We're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as
to what we may decide until we know what the facts are,'' Pound
said.
	   Moving the games would be unprecedented and, with just over
three years to go, would be a logistical nightmare. Most of the
facilities needed for the games in Salt Lake already are built.
	   Krimsky discounted any possibility of the games being moved.
	   ``There is no chance at all, absolutely none in my mind,'' he
said. ``I can't be stronger in saying I don't consider it a
possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn from Salt Lake
City. ''

Mexico defeats Argentina to gain advantage for World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico took a major step toward the 1999
Women's World Cup of soccer on Friday with a 3-1 victory over
Argentina.
	   Monica Gerardo, Maribel Dominguez and Andrea Rodebaugh scored at
24, 31 and 67 minutes after Argentina's Elizabeth Villanueva gave
her country a temporary lead with a goal in the first minute.
	   ``We missed several opportunities to increase the score, but we
came away with a good advantage for the return match,'' said
Leonardo Cuellar, the Mexican coach.
	   The return game will be played Dec. 19 in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The aggregate winner earns a place in next year's World
Cup in the United States.

Memorial to Australian occupation forces in Japan unveiled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A memorial to thousands of Australian
troops who served in the British Commonwealth Occupational Forces
in Japan after World War II was unveiled Saturday.
	   Australian Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Scott unveiled the
memorial in the Sculpture Garden at the Australian War Memorial in
front of Australian Defense Force chief Adm. Chris Barrie, Japanese
Ambassador Masaji Takahashi and occupation force veterans from
around the country.
	   ``Australian servicemen and women were stationed in Japan for
close on seven years after the Japanese surrender in August 1945,''
Scott said.
	   ``They played an important role in helping Japan to make the
transition from war to peace and the installation of democratic
government, a contribution which sadly has largely been forgotten
in the years since.''
	   More than 19,000 Australians served with British Commonwealth
Occupational Forces (BCOF), which at one stage consisted of more
than 40,000 Commonwealth troops under Australian command.
	   Australian occupation forces were predominantly responsible for
Hiroshima Prefecture and assisted in rebuilding the city, which was
devastated by an atomic bomb in the closing days of the war.
	   The memorial includes a raised garden built in sandstone and a
forecourt paved in granite with an etched map of Japan. Panels
provide a brief history of BCOF's role in Japan and the emblems of
the three Australian services.
	   The memorial also features three cherry trees donated by the
Japanese government in recognition of BCOF's service in Japan.

Singapore's senior statesman urges Indonesia to hold elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Warning that a political and economic collapse
in Indonesia would negatively impact the entire region, Singapore's
elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has called for elections in the
neighboring Southeast Asian country to help it avoid
disintegration.
	   ``I think the first thing to do now is to get some form of
popular government elected that has the support of the people and
carry out the tough reforms that are necessary,'' replied Lee to a
caller's question late Friday during a live interview on CNN
International.
	   ``The biggest country in the region is of course Indonesia,'' he
said. ``So if it collapses, and does not recover after the
elections, then I think the whole region will suffer, not just
Singapore, but Malaysia, Brunei, and even beyond to the Philippines
and Thailand and beyond.''
	   Lee warned that ``Indonesia faces a very severe test in national
resilience.'' Economic stress, massive unemployment, and the
occasional shortage of essential items makes life ``extremely
difficult'' for people there, he said.
	   Southeast Asia's largest country has suffered from dire
political, social and economic disruption since the start of a
regional crisis in July of 1997.
	   Millions of Indonesians have fallen below the poverty line,
thousands have been killed in ethnic and religious unrest, and the
country's political future remains uncertain.
	   Amid frequent public protests against corruption and the current
political system, an interim government led by President B.J.
Habibie has promised general elections in July next year.
	   ``I think, in the circumstances, that's a practical solution to
establish legitimacy and some form of representative government,''
said Lee of the promised elections.

Japanese charity and South Korean cash at the Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Athletes at the Asian Games are being
urged to leave their track suits and other clothing behind when
it's time to head home.
	   A clothing drive for charity has been organized by a Japanese
sports official who got the idea while competing in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, where she won a bronze medal in synchronized
swimming.
	   Mikako Kotani remembers giving uniforms that wouldn't fit into
her suitcase to a maid while fellow athletes just left outfits in
their rooms when checking out.
	   Kotani and seven assistants are distributing leaflets at the
Athletes Village asking for contributions to the officially
sanctioned 13th Asian Games Clothing Drive.
	   Kotani, who works as a TV reporter and synchronized swimming
coach, is the first and only woman to serve on the executive board
of the Olympic Council of Asia.
	   The council's president, Sheik Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, on
Friday gave Kotani the track suit he wore in the games' torch
relay.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MVP: While it may raise some eyebrows, dlrs 100,000 will be
handed _ indirectly _ to the most valuable player of the Asian
Games. Officials say the award is designed to boost amateur sports
on the continent.
	   Since such cash awards to amateurs are not allowed under
International Olympic Committee rules, the MVP will receive only a
trophy at the games' closing ceremony Dec. 20.
	   The check will be presented by South Korea's Samsung Electronics
to the athlete's country, which will then use it for the winner's
training and other expenses, an official news release said.
	   ``This award is a major boost to amateur sport in Asia and will
provide even greater inspiration for all athletes,'' said Maj. Gen.
Charouck Ariachakaran, secretary-general of the games' organizing
committee.
	   Nearly three-quarters of the athletes at the Asian Games are
amateurs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FOOTBALL GREATS: Former Manchester United star Sir Bobby
Charlton and British Minister of Sports Tony Banks will be watching
events at the Asian Games next week, including possibly the soccer
semifinals.
	   They will be accompanied by a delegation from the English
Football Association, which helped bring Thailand's British soccer
coach, Peter Withe, to the country.
	   Banks and Sir Bobby visited Thailand in February to discuss
England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. They are scheduled to
arrive in Bangkok Wednesday.

 &UR; Kwan easily wins technical program &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's results &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now if only Michelle Kwan had felt this way in
February in Nagano.
	   Kwan calmly and almost routinely skated a stylish technical
program Friday night to take the lead in the World Professional
Figure Skating Championships. That peacefulness was missing during
the Olympics, in which she skated tentatively in the long program
and finished second to Tara Lipinski.
	   This time, Kwan hit everything with flair as she debuted her new
free skate, to ``Lamento d'Ariane.'' The two-time world champion on
the Olympic-eligible level plans to use the same routine in the
nationals in two months; this event has been sanctioned by the
International Skating Union, so Kwan and Nicole Bobek, who was
second Friday night, retain their eligibility.
	   ``I felt more relaxed than I usually do,'' the 18-year-old Kwan
said. ``Last year, I'd probably have done two internationals and a
couple of pro-ams and been exhausted. But now I feel ready for
nationals. I'm not worried and tense and stressed out.''
	   Russia's Alexei Yagudin, like Kwan the current world champion on
the eligible level, won the men's technical program, hitting seven
triples, including two triple axels.
	   He edged five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, allowed to
reskate the second half of his routine after a cuff link fell off
his costume and landed in his way.
	   Eldredge, who fell on a triple lutz, got to redo the jump and
landed it perfectly.
	   ``The referee asked if I wanted to start before or after the
lutz,'' he said with a smile. ``I said, `Let me think about it.' ''
	   Rudy Galindo was third, followed by Kurt Browning, winner of
this event the last three years.
	   Facing the toughest field she will encounter this season, Kwan
swept the seven-judge panel. Of course, none of the other
competitors came close to the seven triple jumps she nailed, or to
the flair she put into the performance, worth half the total score.
	   ``Tonight was a very important night for us,'' coach Frank
Carroll said. ``She did seven triples _ yea, team! _ and whether it
was slow or not, I'll take it.''
	   Kwan earned one perfect 6.0, from the Canadian judge. That was a
surprise.
	   ``You get a perfect score and you wonder, `Where do I go from
here?''' she said. ``Everyone says, `Don't change a thing.' But I
have to change.
	   ``I have to appreciate it now and start all over.''
	   Bobek, who has had to start all over after her 17th-place
disaster at Nagano, also looked sharp in edging Japan's Yuka Sato
for second heading into Saturday night's artistic program. Back
training with Richard Callaghan, who oversaw her climb to the 1995
national title, Bobek nailed a beautiful triple lutz to begin her
rousing routine, to music from the film ``Zorro.''
	   ``Basically, I'm looking at every competition as a step up,''
Bobek said. ``We're working hard. I don't feel as nervous.''
	   It was a rough night for the two Olympic champions in the field.
Oksana Baiul, the 1994 winner, finished fifth, and Katarina Witt
(1984-88) was sixth and last. Two-time Olympic bronze medalist Lu
Chen of China was fourth.
	   ``I'm embarrassed,'' Witt said. ``I skated very poorly.''
	   The top three men all skated well. But Yagudin's far more
difficult program earned him the top spot.
	   ``This is an important competition for me, but it is not so
serious as the Grand Prix and the worlds and Europeans,'' said
Yagudin, who plans to skate at the Russian championships and at
worlds. ``It's OK. I'm happy.''
	   Five-time U.S. ice dance champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod
Swallow were a surprising first after the rhythm dance. It's rare
when Americans wind up ahead of Russian dancers in any competition,
let alone the world pros.
	   But they edged Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov, and Pasha Grischuk
and Yevgeny Platov. Grischuk partnered with Platov to win the last
two Olympics, while Usova and Zhulin, who once were married, also
were Olympians.
	   ``We took a chance doing this long program for a technical
program,'' Swallow said. They received a 6.0 for presentation from
the Polish judge. ``We were rewarded nicely. That's our first 6.0
from an international judge.''
	   Nagano winners Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia led
the pairs.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Rescue workers combed through the
wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner early Saturday searching for
possible survivors and the bodies of victims. Police said at least
87 of the 146 people aboard had died, while 43 others survived the
crash.
	   The number of survivors dropped from an earlier figure of 50
because some died after being rushed to local hospitals, including
the pilot of the airliner, police said.
	   Burned and bruised corpses were lined up on the floor of the
passenger terminal at Surat Thani airport, and police said they
were having difficulty identifying some of the dead.
	   At the scene of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using
specially-designed equipment cut through what remained of the jet's
fuselage to extract the remaining bodies and anyone who might still
be alive inside.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
after bursting into flames about three miles (five kilometers) from
the airport.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   The passengers were mostly Thais. Of the 25 foreigners on board,
11 had survived, 3 were confirmed dead and the rest were still
missing, police said on Saturday morning.
	   Police said the black box, or flight recorder, had been
recovered from the wreckage.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and volunteers from nearby villagers
struggled to pull bodies from the burnt, twisted metal of the
wrecked plane. The rescue operation was scaled back early Saturday
due to dark, rainy conditions but began again in full force at
daybreak.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the waist-high water that has hampered rescuers may have
cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to go
up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset, about four
stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   The airline released a passenger list that indicated most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western and
Japanese names. The list did not include the passengers'
nationalities. The remaining 14 people were crew members.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Airbus said the plane was delivered in April 1986 and had
accumulated 23,000 flight hours.
	   Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban broke
down in tears after arriving from the capital, Bangkok, and
learning that his sister, Siriwan, had been killed in the crash.
Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from Surat Thani, also
died.
