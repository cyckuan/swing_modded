<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police today warned
people of refraining from crossing the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border
through undesignated points because of landmines.
</P>
<P>
Police officer in Mutare in east Zimbabwe Malisa
Batakhati said border jumping is becoming a big problem in the
province, costing the government a lot of money in deportation.
</P>
<P>
Batakhati said deportation is becoming more frequent as
teenagers are crossing into Zimbabwe in groups from neighboring
Mozambique in search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56 teenagers were deported back to Mozambique on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Some Zimbabweans also jump the border into Mozambique on
shopping trips," he said. "We are trying to educate them that it
is illegal and dangerous because of landmines."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 1.5 million landmines were planted
along Zimbabwe's eastern border with Mozambique and its northern
border with Zambia before Zimbabwe won independence in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: Russia-NATO Accord Possible Before Madrid Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today that it is possible for Russia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to sign an agreement on bilateral
relations before the NATO Madrid summit is held in July.
</P>
<P>
"My intuition is that (the difference between NATO and Moscow)
lies within the circumstances which allow one to solve it. There
should be some diplomacy, and that each side should respect the
other," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Chirac as saying
after holding talks with Yeltsin in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that under these conditions, "I think that an
agreement could come even before the summit of Madrid."
</P>
<P>
"I got the conviction that if it reflects the views of both
sides, an agreement could perfectly be elaborated," he said at a
press conference given at the Moscow airport before leaving for
home late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that any agreement between
Russia and NATO should have a legal nature, and should not be a
general declaration only.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France does not take side on this demand by
Moscow, which is opposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Between the political declaration and a legal declaration
ratified by all the parliaments (of NATO members and Russia),
there are a range of possibilities and thus a margin for
discussion," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The French president also said that he was impressed by the
quick re-establishment of health of President Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President, U.N. Chief Discuss Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said today that he discussed security issues
concerning the protracted Cyprus problem during his meeting
Saturday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Davos,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at the Larnaca Airport upon his
return from Davos, where he attended the world economic forum.
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views on what should be done to break the
deadlock and move efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem
forward," President Clerides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he put forward his view that "the security of the two
communites (the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities) is of
utmost importance" and should be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
"If a solution does not ensure the future of Greek and
Turkish Cypriots, no common ground can be found," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said he also outlined his position
concerning the demilitarization of Cyprus, the deployment of an
international force here and foreign guarantee for the
safeguarding of a solution.
</P>
<P>
He said he also told the secretary-general that there should
not be separate foreign initiatives for a solution to the Cyprus
problem, but "coordination under the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Concerning the U.S. proposal to ban the Greek and Turkish
military flights over Cyprus, President Clerides said he has not
given the U.S. a commitment that Greek military planes would not
fly over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his government's position that "when the
U.S. initiative for a solution to the Cyprus problem begins," it
is prepared to stop Greek military plane flights over Cyprus
until the end of August, in order to maintain a good climate.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this gives sufficient time to efforts for a
solution to the Cyprus problem," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops seized
the northern third of the island in the wake of a short-lived
coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> German Carmakers Increase Market Shares in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- German carmakers Mercedes Benz,
BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Opel and German-based U.S. firm Ford have
increased their market presence and shares in Greece, a market
which is dominated by rival Japanese firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the local weely To Vima (the Tribune) today, of
the 38 car-importing companies operating in Greece, six are
German. Last year they captured approximately 25 percent of the
market, a figure sharply higher than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Should the German-controlled UK carmaker Rover be included, the
market share held by German carmakers in Greece would come close
to the 30 percent mark, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance by Volkswagen in 1996 is further proof
of the rising stature of German carmakers in Greece. In terms of
sales, Volkswagen ranked third in the year, up from seventh just
two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the face of intense competition, local representatives of
Germany's six carmakers have been carrying out substantial
investment programs and are expected to continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
One of the most sizeable investments made is that of Mercedes
Benz Hellas, budgeted at 4 billion drachmas (about 17 million U.S.
dollars), for the construction of its new headquarters comprising
administration, sales and marketing departments, technical
training and spare-part storage facilities, as well as car storage
room for new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the company has invested an extra 6 billion
drachmas (25 million U.S. dollars) to modernize its sales network.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Benz Hellas representative D. Psillakis said that in
1996 Mercedes sold 640,000 passenger cars worldwide and in three
years' time, the figure is expected to reach the 1 million mark.

<HEADLINE> Transfer of Power to Be in Smooth Way: Leghari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is to complete the
process of "free, fair and transparent elections" by Monday night,
and power will be transferred in a smooth way within days.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made this evening by Pakistan's President
Farooq Leghari in his televised address to the nation on the eve
of the election day.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Pakistan stands at a crossroads. It
needs political leaders with vision and courage to steer this
country out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption, waste and inefficiency have eaten into the vitals
of our state. We need to restructure, revamp and revive the
economy," Leghari said, adding that it must be done "transparently
and fairly".
</P>
<P>
Leghari spoke highly of the achievements by the caretaker
government led by Miraj Khalid during the three-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has given Pakistan "a sound legal
framework for holding accountability." It has investigated in two
months over 320 cases of corruption and abuse of authority by
politicians and bureaucrats, Leghari noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Investigation
Agency remain busy in collecting new evidence against dozens of
other alleged offenders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the government had stabilized the
economy, revived the stock market, re-established international
credibility and shored up Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan has been granted autonomy,
nationalized banks have been cleaned of political influences and
pressures, Leghari added.
</P>
<P>
Leghari also said that "we have tightened the election laws
without encroaching on the fundamental rights of citizens. This
will disqualify scores of dishonest politicians from contesting
the elections or sitting in parliament."
</P>
<P>
The government has passed laws to recover outstanding dues from
defaulters and about 3 billion rupees (approximately 75 million US
dollars) have been recouped from them in one month only, according
to the president.
</P>
<P>
The government has also downsized 40 government divisions to 31
and has completely abolished two ministries.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government has given adult franchise to the
tribal areas of the Federal-Administered Tribal Areas. Leghari
said that "this is a revolutionary step which all governments in
the past had hesitated to take."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the next government has a huge responsibility. It
needs to carry forward the measures taken by the caretaker
government."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people want political stability and economic
continuity, Leghari said. "A government which gives them all this
may justly expect to complete its tenure."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Enhance Ties with Russia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government is
encouraging all state institutions to deepen relations with
Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the remarks in a meeting with Levo Vakuflovich
Rukhlin, chairman of the Russian State Duma's Defense Committee,
who arrived here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Moscow and Tehran play a fundamental role in
forming regional cooperation and restoring peace and regional
balance.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that Tehran welcomes development of relations
with Moscow and encourages all state institutions to work to
deepen relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran-Moscow relations have expanded drastically in recent
years and the two countries have come to conclusion that further
cooperation between them serves peace and security in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreements already reached with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeni Primakov are being put into practice. But he
did not specify what kind of agreements.
</P>
<P>
During Primakov's visit to Tehran on December 23, Russia and
Iran signed a memorandum of understanding on the export control
of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iran also signed another memorandum of
understanding on visa and consular affairs and two declarations
on Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
On regional cooperation at the Caspian Sea, Velayati said the
two countries should work to develop regional cooperation at the
world's largest inland sea.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Rukhlin said
that Iran is of high importance in the Middle East and hailed
Iranian stand toward regional issues, including the Caspian Sea,
Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Caspian Sea oil has attracted the attention of many
countries to such extent that they have embarked on interfering
in regional issues," the visiting Russian official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for cooperation between Iran and
Russia in strengthening regional cooperation. He voiced Russia's
readiness to carry out the agreements already reached between
the two countries on defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the Russian parliamentarian, Iran's
Parliament Vice-Speaker Hassan Rowhani said that Iran and Russia
are the two strongest states in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that development of Tehran-Moscow relations would
play a key role in maintaining the balance at the regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani said the strong presence of Iran in the region that
possesses 70 percent of the world's oil reserves has formed a
stronghold vis-a-vis the U.S. interventionist policy, adding
that close relations between Iran and Russia would help foil the
U.S. conspiracies in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Afghan issue, Rowhani called for further consultations
between Tehran and Moscow to help restore peace and security in
Afghanistan.

MAPUTO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The leading opposition
Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) is negotiating with some
other opposition parties for alliance for local elections due to
start in November, the Mozambique Information Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama who
was speaking to reporters today in Beira City, central

itself.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to ally with these parties for the elections in
view of their goodwill," added Dhlakama. However, he refused to

to do so.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that he will not run for the presidency
of the Maputo City Hall himself, but will designate someone else
to contest for it because he is very busy with his current job.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his party will not give up the local autonomy
elections, though there still exist some differences between the
Renamo and the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party on some
issues of the elections.

<HEADLINE> Secret Germ Warfare Tests Conducted in London: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- British Ministry of Defense
scientists carried out top-secret germ warfare tests in the heart
of London and other parts of England in the 1960s, accordign to a
report in today's Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Documents from the Public Records Office revealed that
simulants of biological warfare agents were exposed in public
places including Waterloo Bridge and "massive quantities" of
biological warfare simulants were launched at the Dorset coast
from ships and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the biological warfare experiments
extended far beyond those few already publicly known, such as a
series conducted on the London Underground.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo insisted in a letter
to a Labor MP that simulants (including bacillus globigii,
"killed" serratia marcescens and E coli 162) used in these
experiments were "judged to present no risk to public health."
</P>
<P>
The tests took place in public areas from 1964 in order to
"determine the effect of environmental conditions on the viability
of organisms, Portillo said.
</P>
<P>
However, leading microbiologists say that some simulants could
cause pheumonia, septacaemia or opthalmitis in "vulnerable"
individual such as young children, old people or those already
ill.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gary French, head of microbiology at St Thomas
Hospital in London said, "We now recognize serratia marcescens to
be quite an important cause of infection in patients."
</P>
<P>
Leonard Cole, an American researcher, said that bacillus
globigii was an organism which "may cause infections and invade
the blood stream in cachetic diseases."

<HEADLINE> Half of UK's Primary Schools Have Low Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Standards are too low in up to
50 percent of Britain's primary schools, with poor teaching, weak
management and low expectations, according to a report by Chris
Woodhead, the government's chief inspector of schools.
</P>
<P>
The report, to be published this week, will warn that standards
need to be raised in half of the primary schools in England and
Wales and two-fifths of the secondary schools inspected last year,
and overall, one in six lessons is unsatisfactory or worse.
</P>
<P>
Although this is an improvement on previous years, Woodhead
will identify serious failings in too many primary schools, with
up to half the lessons judged to be unsatisfactory in the worst
schools.
</P>
<P>
Of the 5,000 schools inspected last year, over 100 were
officially declared as failing to give their pupils an adequate
education.
</P>
<P>
The report said that eight out of 10 pupils in one failed
secondary school were more than two years behind in reading for
their age. In another, pupils aged 8-11 are described as taking no
pride in their work and leaving exercises and projects unfinished.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the report will highlight 159 schools for their
"excellent" standards.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the opposition Labor Party is expected to
use the report to make an attack on the government's failure to do
enough to raise standards.

the past four months, according to a report to be published
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) will
show that small firms have attracted new domestic orders and
created proportionately more jobs than larger enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These firms enjoyed their highest increase in orders for a
year, and the almost 10 percent increase stems most probably from
a rise in domestic orders, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The most positive trend the CBI's survey will point to is the
rise in employment in the small-firm sector, as 7 percent of firms
will report an increase in jobs over the past four months, with a
further 6 percent expecting that trend to continue.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with the rest of the manufacturing sector, where
11 percent will report a drop in employment, with a further 12
percent expecting another fall in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Although export orders for small firms fell over the period of
the CBI survey, they are expected to pick up slightly.
</P>
<P>
However, as sterling's strength is starting to hit export
orders and dent confidence in exploring overseas markets,
optimism, with regard to export prospects for the year ahead, has
fallen back for the first time since July 1992.

<HEADLINE> UK Businessmen Back Toyota's Investment Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading British businessmen have
expressed their endorsement to Toyota Motor's warning that jobs
and future investment will drain from Britain if London stays away
from the single European currency named Euro.
</P>
<P>
President of Toyota Motor Hiroshi Okunda issued a stark warning
last week by saying that his company, one of the largest investors
in Britain, would change its investment strategy if Britain did
not join the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Niall Fitzgerald, chief executive of Unilever, said, "If the UK
continues to create the impression it may opt out of the European
mainstream, this will adversely affect inward investment,"
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace,
expressed similar views by saying, "Staying outside the single
currency could be detrimental to the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Unigate boss Ross Buckland said that if Britain was the only
country in the 15-nation European Union (EU) to remain outside the
EMU, it would "clearly not be attractive to inward investors."
</P>
<P>
If there was a "more mixed situation" and fairness between the
Euro nations and non-Euro nations, Britain might still lose out
"marginally," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Offers Mediation in Karabakh Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said today that his country is ready to mediate
between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Karabakh dispute.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the remarks while meeting with visiting Armenian
President of the Supreme Soviet Babden Ararktsyan, who arrived
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Velayati was quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA
as saying that the latest developments in the Caucasus region
and the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute were not in the interests
of either nation.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran is expected to see the two nations of Armenia and
Azerbaijan settle their problems soon based on a just and an
honorable solution and pave the way for the return of the
dislocated people," the Iranian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ararktsyan underlined the need to normalize relations with
the neighboring nation of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have claimed sovereignty over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave entirely
inside Azerbaijan. The two sides have been involved in military
conflicts since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian official voiced welcome to the initiative of
Iran for a just settlement of Karabakh crisis, saying that other
countries in the region should join forces to resolve the Karabakh
problem.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he also called for promotion of the
multilateral cooperations between Iran and Armenia, particularly
cooperation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He also held talks with Iranian officials on possible Iranian
investments in Armenia, transfer of electricity from Iran to
Armenia and laying of pipeline to carry Iranian gas to Armenia as
well as building a tunnel to shorten the transit road between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> France to Bring Home Survivors of Air Crash From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- France sent an Airbus A300
passenger plane of Air France to Senegal this evening to bring
home 29 Frenchmen injured in the air crash Saturday in
Tambacounda, in which 23 other Frenchmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said that all the passengers of the
HS 748 plane of Air Senegal were French nationals, and its three
pilots were two Senegalese and one Guinean, including the son of
President Viera of Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
An investigation team is looking for the black box of the plane
to determine the exact cause for the crash, which could range from
over-loading of passengers to over-use of the plane and bad quality
of the kerosene used on the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted officials and survivors
as saying that water could have been contained in the gas supply
at the Tambacounda airport, because local tourism officials last
week found this problem on the same plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane, flying from Tambacounda to Dakar for the big hunting
season in a natural park in southeast Senegal, broke into two
after it crashed into the field, with its front part catching fire
and killing all people staying there.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, who met with President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette last week, said today that he is very satisfied
with his talks with the French leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the incident which took place between Chirac
and Israeli security guards during the latter's visit to Jerusalem
last October was caused by misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
"The friendship between France and Israel will have a momentum
in future," he told a meeting of the French Jewish organizations
held in Paris today.
</P>
<P>
He said that a period of freeze in relations between the two
countries, which began with Chirac's last state visit to Israel,
"has passed over in a magnificent atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
France repeatedly warned Israel against building new
settlements on Arab land and in East Jerusalem over the past few
months, following the visit by the French president to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe promised late last month to
set up a working group to fully investigate the problem of Jewish
properties seized by the Vichy regime in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
France also welcomed the signing of the Hebron accord between
Israel and Palestinians in mid-January, considering it as an
encouraging sign of the resumption of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon will visit Israel in
April, which could resume military cooperation between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Tries to Win EU Membership in 1997: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government will
make every effort for a full European Union membership in 1997,
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said
today.
</P>
<P>
During a working tour to Turkey's coastal town of Marmaris,
Ciller said that the coalition government would ask the European
Union to give up its rejection of Ankara' bid and make Turkey
part of the rapidly growing Europe as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Although some EU countries have voiced their support for
Turkey's bid for the EU membership, Turkey is still kept outside
the European body owing to some controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with her EU counterparts in Rome last week,
Ciller called on EU countries not to exclude Turkey from the
organization's expansion scheme.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP), said
the DYP should deserve most of the honors if Turkey
finally became a full EU member.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, she said that her party had been pushing
for privatization over the past three years and to privatize
forests which are currently completely state-owned, was its
next step.
</P>
<P>
The government was giving comprehensive support to
small-and-medium-scale enterprises and was also to speed up the
construction of airports across the country, Ciller said.

Novo-Ogaryevo residence near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky,

Yeltsin was very satisfied with the results of the talks. The
press secretary said the Russian president highly appreciated the
understanding of Russia's position on NATO's planned expansion,
which was expressed by Chirac.
</P>

The two presidents at the meeting also discussed problems of
the two countries' interaction in the next few months which will
seem of paramount importance to the creation of a security system
in Europe and further relations between Russia and NATO,
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and French presidents were in agreement on active
cooperation in the cause of formation of an efficient system of
European security on the basis of agreement reached at the Lisbon
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

During the talks, Yeltsin reiterated his invitation to Chirac

TOKYO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto hailed his weekend summit with Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori in Toronto as a success after Fujimori promised
not to settle the Lima hostage crisis by force.
</P>
<P>
"It was successful because I had him declare in my presence he
will not resort to force unless the hostages are injured," Kyodo
News Agency quoted Hashimoto as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rebels from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement are still
holding 72 people hostage at the Japanese ambassador's residence
in the Peruvian capital, after storming the compound on December
17.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also noted that Terusuke Terada, Japanese ambassador
to Mexico and an adviser to Japan's task force in Lima, will be an
observer on a guarantor committee proposed by the Peruvian
government to oversee any agreement reached to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto described the addition of Terada as beneficial,
because it would allow the Japanese government to get first hand
information on negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of representatives from the Red Cross,
Guatemala, Canada and Europe, and a Roman Catholic bishop, will
act as a negotiating panel between the Peruvian government and the

<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people have been confirmed
dead and ten others injured in a collision between a cargo train
and a passenger one in southern Egypt early this morning, said the
Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The MENA quoted an official security source at the Ministry of
Interior as saying that while the passenger train No. 164 was
stopping at the Al Radissiya Station of Aswan, about 1,000
kilometers south of Cairo, another Aswan-bound train hit it in the
back, at about 6 a.m. (04:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The passenger train was heading from the Mediterranean port of
Alexandria to Aswan, a tourist city with picturesque scenery and
Pharaonic monuments which reflect the ancient Egyptian
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The two back wagons of the first train were destroyed in the
accident and the locomotive of the second train was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Railway Authority said that the
accident could be caused by an individual mistake on the part of
either the controller or the engineer of the cargo train.
</P>
<P>
A technical team has been set up to investigate into the cause
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The smashed wagons have been moved away and train service on
the line from Cairo to Aswan has been brought back to normal at
9:45 a.m. local time.

Efforts to begin negotiations under the umbrella of the panel

main demand of the rebels -- the release of 440 of their jailed
comrades in exchange for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister later told the Diet, Japan's parliament,
that he expects Peru to start a "preliminary dialogue" soon with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Peruvian President Fujimori promised to hold the preliminary
dialogue as soon as possible after he returns to Peru in
preparation for fully-fledged negotiations at the proposed
guarantor commission," Hashimoto told the House of Representatives
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Fujimori agreed at their summit to redouble their
efforts to peacefully resolve the hostage crisis which started
when the MRTA rebels stormed the diplomatic compound
during a cocktail party and took more than 500 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
The rebels later released most of the hostages but are still
holding 72 captives, including two Peruvian ministers, the
Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors, about two dozen Japanese
businessmen and Fujimori's brother.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal Launches Largest Hydropower Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today launched a 144-
megawatt hydropower project, the largest one so far in the country
which is abundant in water resources.
</P>
<P>
Construction work began on the Kali Gandaki A project, about 80
kilometers west of Kathmandu, when Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba laid the foundation stone at a special ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed by 2000 and electricity
from the project will be fed to the national grid in West Nepal
through a 132-kv transmission line, project officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Kali Gandaki A project will cost
around 453 million U.S. dollars, of which 70.6 percent will be
provided by the Asian Development Bank and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The remaining cost will be met jointly by the Nepali government
and the Nepal Electricity Authority, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Impregilo S.P.A, an Italian engineering company, earlier had
been awarded the contract for the construction of the Kali Gandaki
A project, which will include a dam, a diversion tunnel and three
turbine generating units.
</P>
<P>
The peak-hour power demand in Nepal was 268 megawatt last year
and it would increase to 433 megawatt by 2000, the officials said.
The new project is expected to generate 144 megawatt of
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Exodus In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- About 400,000 travellers
passed through the airports, railways stations and boat docks of
China's largest city today, as the country's most important
holiday draws near.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, from January 18 passenger flow saw a
three percent rise over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Most outbound passengers are from Yunnan, Anhui, Guizhou and
Sichuan provinces, where the majority of rural laborers for the
economically booming city come from.
</P>
<P>
Although half of the rural laborers have said they will remain
in Shanghai for the Spring Festival, which starts on February 7,
more than a million of them are heading home. Spring Festival in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other large cities sees
a similar flow every year.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this massive exodus, Shanghai has added 26 trains,
and additional airplanes and boats. Shanghai, in addition to being
a major seaport, is at the eastern terminus of the
heavily-travelled Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> HK to Host Trade Fair for Hardware Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Spurred by a substantial
growth in the hardware industry in Asia, a debut trade show for
the industry will be held in Hong Kong later this year.
</P>
<P>
The show, to be staged from October 30 to November 2 at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, will provide an
efficient sourcing center in the region for international buyers,
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The TDC's senior manager for exhibitions, Roger Chu, said, "To
capitalize on Hong Kong's strategic position and outstanding
facilities as Asia's trade fair capital, this show is set to be a
focal point for the hardware industry in the region."
</P>
<P>
Apart from promoting the territory's traditional industries,
the hardware show will be part of the TDC's efforts to promote
non-traditional Hong Kong exports, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Actually, figures show that hardware products have become one
of Hong Kong's major export items. In the first 11 months of 1996,
 Hong Kong exported more than 22.9 billion HK dollars' (2.9
billion U.S. dollars) worth of such products.

Metal household equipment and cutlery are promising sectors,
with exports accounting for over 40 percent of the industry's
total in the period.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest export market for Hong Kong's
hardware products, followed by the Chinese mainland, Germany,

<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some rich countries are
decentralizing the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
and disintegrating its secretariat, the local newspapers Kenya
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said two significant segments of UNEP have been
plucked out of the main environmental secretariat to operate on
their own at the same level as UNEP.
</P>
<P>
The conventions respectively on biodiversity and
anti-desertification were isolated from UNEP to form two distinct
segments of the United Nations, it said.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to decentralize UNEP when the constant pressures
for reform in UNEP by western countries is geared towards further
disintegration of the secretariat, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper, run by the ruling Kenya African National Union,
said countries which are major contributors to environmental
pollution continue to dwell on shifting their blames elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The countries violate the environment and refuse to pay for
the consequences and instead dwell on trivial matters that have
nothing to do with urgent issues at hand, the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the first week of deliberations at the ongoing 19th
session of UNEP's Governing Council opening on January 27, a
smaller fraction came up strongly against UNEP, accusing it of
bad governance, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"These countries, of course led by the United States, insisted
that without speedy reforms in the governance and management of
UNEP, no further funding of the secretariat was likely to come
forth from them," the paper said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- India's wheat production in
the current year is likely to go up considerably and may touch 68
million tons compared with last year's 58 million tons, Press
Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Indian Council of Agricultural Research estimates,
the wheat production in the current season may increase
substantially due to favorable conditions such as timely sowing of
the crop, suitable temperature during the season and good monsoon.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Council R.S. Paroda said the adoption
of a new technology in the current year facilitated timely sowing
and the time taken was reduced by at least 10 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
During the favorable time for planting, even a single day delay
could result in a substantial decline in output, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Abortion Not Yet Legal in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Free abortion has become
a legal right of women in South Africa as of February 1, but the
latest abortion law is by no means welcome and acceptable to
everyone in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abortion in South Africa where is heavily influenced by
western churches and traditional concepts has been a "dirty" word
in the eyes of conservatives for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Before the law took effect, abortion was absolutely illegal
only except for women who became pregnant due to sexually
assaults or might be in danger physically and mentally if she
continues pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, called the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy,
any woman in less than 12-week pregnancy will be allowed to
obtain an abortion on demand. Girls under 18 are allowed to have
abortion without their parents' knowing or consent.
</P>
<P>
A 20-week pregancy may be terminated if the life of the woman
or child is in danger. Abortion is also permitable when a
pregnant woman believes she can not continue pregancy for her
poor economic or social situation, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Abortion operation will be free of charge at all state
hospitals and for non-medical-aid women, the Health Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals and clinics in the country were inundated with
queries about the service just a few days before the law, signed
by President Nelson Mandela in December, took effect.
</P>
<P>
Although it seems a majority of South African women,
especially the blacks, hailed the law that makes them having
abortion possible, religious and humanitarian groups are slamming
the bill as an "immoral legislation".
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg-based Christian Lawyers' Association argued
Sunday that life begins at conception and the unborn babies have
a constitutionally guaranteed right to life.
</P>
<P>
The association said in a statement it is planning to take
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma to the Supreme Court in a bid to
have abortion declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu Natal provincial health spokesman Dave McGlew claimed
Sunday that no hospitals and state clinics in his province will
accept abortion applicants because none of them had got
designation by the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
In terms of technique concerning abortion, local medical
officials said, many hospitals and clinics need to update the
skills of nurses and doctors to deal with abortions.
</P>
<P>
It may take five years or more for the South African
government to install abortion facilities around the country
within official wide reproductive health services, they said.

Benazir Bhutto government last November, Ahammad said.
</P>
<P>
Ahammad's view was echoed by many other people in the capital
city who turned out to vote this morning despite the chilly
weather amidst hopes that political uncertainty will end with the
holding of elections and doubts that the new government may not be
able to resolve the economic crisis plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
"Voters are enthusiastic and they come here early in the
morning, " said Siddeque Khan, a presiding officer of the polling
station set up at a primary school in downtown Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Queues of voters can be seen outside the polling station where
armed policemen strictly checked their identity cards before
allowing them in.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad, like many other voters, declined to say in the public
which candidate he most favors, but hinted that Nawaz Sharif,
leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N), would be his first
choice.
</P>
<P>
The main contest in the current election is believed to be
between the PML(N) and its arch rival, the Pakistan People's Party
(PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
But none of the major parties can win an absolute majority in
the 217-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A white-haired old man, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua
at the polling station that Nawaz Sharif, a successful businessman
and prime minister from 1990-1993, is in a better position than
other candidates to run "the business of the country".
</P>
<P>
He also said Sharif, who has a rural background, knows the
dilemma and poverty of the poor and he is "a man who can do
something for the ordinary people".
</P>
<P>
However, Fanzia Shahid, a housewife, who selected Nawaz Sharif
in both 1990 and 1993 elections, this time would rather vote for
Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned politician, than Sharif who lost
his premiership in 1993 on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"People want accountability, we want someone who is willing to
be all out to fight against corruption," she said.
</P>
<P>
Imran's Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf (Movement of Justice), which
was formed last March, has drawn a noticeable support under its
banner of anti-corruption and because of Imran's politically
untainted past.
</P>
<P>
However, a shopkeeper who declined to be named, said both the
PPP and the PML(N) themselves have no problems, the problem is
that each party had not been given enough time in the past to
fully implement its policies.
</P>
<P>
When one party's government was dismissed, the problems it
wanted to solve were again stockpiled and its policies abolished,
he said. the successive dissolutions have posed a potential threat
to the country's interest.
</P>
<P>
He voted for the PPP and said Benazir, who was sacked by
President Farooq Leghari last November, should have served her
full term.
</P>
<P>
None of the elected governments in Pakistan over the past 12
years could complete the five-year tenure. They were prematurely
dismissed under the controversial Eighth Amendment to the 1973
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
While the voters interviewed cast their votes for different
candidates, they all are not sure whether the next government can
bring the country's staggering economy back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
"People don't hope elections are held one after another while
the country's problems remain unsettled," said a young barber.

BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Public Security
Ministry said today that it issued a record number of passports,
up to 2.4 million, to people going abroad at their own expense,
instead of at government expense, last year.
</P>
<P>
After the ministry announced that it would loosen restrictions
on Chinese citizens going abroad for private reasons and simplify
procedures, the number of people applying to go abroad or to Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan has increased sharply, it said.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, people allowed to go to Hong Kong and Macao were
less than the previous year, at 859,000. People allowed to go to
Taiwan were up 20 percent to 51,000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the individual travelers were from coastal and border
provinces, such as Yunnan, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, or from
Beijing. The most popular destinations were the United States,
Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore,
Malaysia, and Canada.
</P>

current stance on EU affairs.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Caretaker PM Urges Parties to Accept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker Prime
Minister Malik Miraj Khalid today urged the political parties to
accept the results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media in Lahore, Khalid said it was the
constitutional obligation and onerous responsibility of his
government to hold free and fair elections within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
In this context Khalid said he is satisfied with the election
arrangements and added that the administrative machinery of the
elections is operating in a free environment.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the impartiality of the caretaker government,
Khalid said his government is not concerned with the election
results, whosoever wins with whatsoever majority.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the sincerity of the caretaker government
should not be doubted as it has taken every step to fulfill its
pledge made with the nation.
</P>
<P>
Khalid expected the transfer of power to be made in a peaceful
way in accordance with the democratic values and spirit of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relatively low turnout of the voters and low
key enthusiasm of people, Khalid said he is aware of the fact that
people are disillusioned as the accountability process has not
come up to their expectation.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that it was binding upon the caretaker set-up
to contain the accountability process within the limits prescribed
by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In this context he said that the caretaker government has
collected facts and figures about corrupt bureaucrats and
politicians and 250 references have been filed.
</P>
<P>
Khalid criticized those politicians who had urged the people to
refrain from exercising their right of franchise in the elections
and said this is an undemocratic stance on the part of those
politicians.

<HEADLINE> Six Parties in Liberia Ready for Presidental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- At least six political parties
in Liberia get ready for the forthcoming presidential election
set for May, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Boima Fahnbulleh from the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), was
quoted as saying that more political groups are expected to
emerge before and during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Liberian politicians are eager for democracy in the country,
where they have been marginalized by the warring factions for a
long time, Fahnbulleh said.
</P>
<P>
The politicians hope there would be no backsliding in
Liberia's peace process based on the revised Abuja peace accord
signed by the factions in August 1996, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fahnbulleh commended the efforts of the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG in restoring peace in the
war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He urged Liberian politicians to forge a united front and form
a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it may not be necessary to establish a war
tribunal, as everybody would wish to leave the past behind and
forge ahead for the nation's development. enditem

<HEADLINE> EC, Japan to Hold Talks on Port Access Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
and Japan will hold talks in Tokyo on Wednesday to try to resolve a
dispute over access to Japanese ports and cut down on red tape
which the EC says hampers its exports.
</P>
<P>
The talks come after the European Union complained to the World
Trade Organization last October that the loading and unloading of
ships in Japan is controlled in a way that "effectively restricts
competition in Japanese ports and creates unnecessary obstacles to
imports."
</P>
<P>
The EC claims that under the Japanese port system, stevedoring
companies contracted to load and unload ships are organized
through the Japan Harbor Transportation Association(JHTA).
</P>
<P>
The JHTA controls most cargo activities in Japan through a
"prior consultation system" and often interferes with carriers'
schedules and use of port services, the EC claims.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said, "The Commission hopes the talks in Tokyo
will form the basis for the resolution of the problem so as to
reduce the complexity of import formalities in Japanese ports."

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Refugees Return from Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- As many as 200 Sierra Leonean
refugees arrived here early today by air from Monrovia, Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Akilade Akiwumi, the representative of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Xinhua at the airport
that the refugees "are mainly the aged, the sick, children,
pregnant women or young mothers."
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees looked pale but hearty, saying they are
happy to be back.
</P>
<P>
"We were languishing in Monrovia and usually got very little
to eat. We are prepared to be hungry in our own country," says a
45-year-old Salifu Bockarie.
</P>
<P>
"We flew these refugees because they would have not been able
to stand 36 hours of sea ordeal," said Akiwumi.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,300 more Sierra Leonean refugees will arrive on
Wednesday via three vessels provided by the Sierra Leone navy,
said Akiwumi.
</P>
<P>
The wave of refugee return came after Sierran Leonean
President Tejan Kabbah's call on all Sierra Leonean refugees to
return to rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
Under a UNHCR program, the refugees will be first sent to the
Waterloo Transit camp, 20 miles from the capital. There they will
get food and then be sent by bus to their original living places,
mainly in the south and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Another 61 Sierra Leonean refugees are also expected to return
home this week from Bamako, Mali.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone now has 120,000 refugees in Liberia, 250,000 in
Guinea and 4,900 in the Gambia, according to UN data.
</P>
<P>
These refugees fled Sierra Leone during the 1992 civil war.

<HEADLINE> US Congressmen's January Visits to China Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- There has been, on average, one
member of the US Congress visiting China each day since the
beginning of the year, marking a new atmosphere in Beijing's
diplomacy, and a good sign for Sino-US ties in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs
received five Congressional delegations of the United States, with
a total of 35 Representatives and Senators, for most of whom it
was the first visit to China, and it was the first time for China
to receive so many members of Congress in one month.
</P>
<P>
Last year 39 members of the US Congress visited China, and that
was believed to be the most US Representatives and Senators China
had ever seen in a year.
</P>
<P>
Each of these Congressional delegations had a courteous
reception and each was viewed with importance by Chinese
leaders. President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and vice-premiers
Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, and Li Lanqing all met with the visitors
and discussed bilateral relations with them.
</P>
<P>
These involved high-level dialogues, discussion of China's most
favoured nation status, China's access to the World Trade
Organization, environmental protection, bilateral cooperation in
science and technology, human rights, and Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the saying has it, seeing is believing. And for China and
the United States, increasing mutual exchanges has led to better
understanding of each other and a look for shared interests, which
will in turn bring a better understanding of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that these two big nations should approach
the world and their relations with a search for common ground
while reserving differences, and with an eye to the future and a
strategic perspective to bring a world of peace, stability,
prosperity and happiness to the next century.
</P>
<P>
The US Congress has a lot to do toward lasting, stable and
healthy growth in Sino-US relations, they say, and that it is
natural for members of the US Congress to show a stronger interest
in China at this point when Sino-US relations are heading in a
favourable direction.
</P>
<P>
More visits to China by the US Congress will help increase
mutual understanding and trust, the Chinese diplomats point out.

<HEADLINE> Train Service Resumed After Fatal Collision in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Train service on the line from
Cairo to Aswan, a city in southern Egypt, has been brought back to
normal three hours after two trains collided in southern Egypt
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Railway authority has lifted the smashed wagons and restored
train movement back to normal on this line at 9:45 local time
(0745 GMT) today, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported .
</P>
<P>
The accident delayed trains traveling from Cairo to Aswan by
more than three hours. The prosecution is investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a passenger train, which was heading
from the Mediterranean port of Alexandria to Aswan, 998 kilometers
south of Cairo, stopped at the Radissiya Station, 95 kilometers
north of Aswan, due to the presence of a cargo train in front of
it on the same line
</P>
<P>
Another cargo train, running behind the passengers train,
smashed into its rear at about 6 a.m. (0400 GMT), killing
more than 30 people and injuring a few others.
</P>
<P>
The two back wagons of the first train were destroyed in the
accident and the locomotive of the second train was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Interior Minister Major General Rashed
Dahshuri rushed to the site.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists were attracted to Aswan every year by its serene
environment, Pharaonic monuments which reflect the greatness of
the civilization of Ancient Egyptians.

TIANJIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of the most

31.2 percent to 8.297 billion US dollars last year, thanks to
robust foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Phone Exchange in Benin, Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A major fire destroyed a phone
exchange of the Nigerian Telecommunication Limited (NITEL) in the
ancient Benin City, Nigeria's southern Edo State on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A media report said today the Main Distribution Frame and an
analogue exchange with 10,000 lines were burnt down, leaving the
paralysis of an adjacent digital exchange with 10,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
The fire, starting at around 7:00 a.m. and lasting for several
hours, is the third occurring to exchanges of the NITEL, once the
sole telephone service in the country.
</P>
<P>
The exchange with 5,000 lines was torched by fire in Apapa,
the port area of Lagos, in February, 1995 and the Ikeja Exchange,
also in Lagos, was razed with 22,000 lines in July.
</P>
<P>
Only a small part of the burnt lines have been reconnected to
date after the two fires, worsening the shortage of phone lines
in the largest commercial city of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The exchange in Benin City was put into operation in December
1995 as a major relief to inefficient phone service in the city.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's fire came when the historical city is planning to
mark the centennial anniversary of the Britain's invasion into
the Benin Kingdom in 1897. enditem

opportunities in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to China this year and the fact China will
make further plans for its reform and development are both
conducive to Macao's stable transition.
</P>
<P>
The official called on all residents in Macao to make greater
efforts in the year.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing, along with all residents of Macao, to work as
hard as a willing ox, make unceasing efforts, solve any
difficulties and score concrete achievements, so that we will be
well prepared for a better future when China resumes exercise of
sovereignty over Macao in 1999 and the policy of 'one country, two
 systems' is implemented," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani women have shown
unprecedented enthusiasm in the elections this time, seeking
greater participation in the country's politics.
</P>
<P>
In the current elections, Pakistani women are trying their luck
in the direct contest, throwing gauntlet in as many as 36
constituencies in the largely male-dominated hustings.
</P>
<P>
Never before in the history of Pakistan have such a large
number of women contested the National Assembly elections on
general seats. To cap it, some of them have challenged established
political personalities.
</P>
<P>
Larkana in Sindh, hometown of deposed prime minister Benazir
Bhutto, this time witnessed historic contest as five female
candidates are in the run for one National Assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
The five contestants are Begum Nusrat Bhutto, Ashraf Khatoon
Abbasi, Rasheeda Khuhru, Sabiha Sultana and Ghinva Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Nusrat Bhutto and Ghinva Bhutto are taking on each other on the
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and PPP (Shaheet Bhutto) ticket in
the constituency.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Benazir's brother Murtaza Bhutto has divided the
Benazir-led PPP clan and all sorts of rumors are in the air.
</P>
<P>
Ghinva, widow of Murtaza Bhutto, is also contesting from the
same constituency, Larkana. Benazir, chairperson of the PPP, is
contesting from two constituencies, one is from her home town
Larkana and the other from Hyderabad, the second largest city of
Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Benazir this time is facing tough opposition in Hyderabad
because of the vote bank of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) in
Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, famous Pushto film actress Musarat Shaheen surprised
all by deciding to contest election from Dera Ismail Khan, where
her main rival is Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) leader Maulana Fazlur
Rehman.
</P>
<P>
The local media is giving a lot of coverage to Musarat Shaheen
who is employing all sorts of tricks to embarrass the religious
leader.
</P>
<P>
Begum Abida Hussain, who resigned as caretaker federal
minister, is contesting from Jhand on the Pakistan Muslim League
(Nawaz) (PML-N) ticket.
</P>
<P>
Abida Hussain is the wife of former speaker of the National
Assembly Syed Fakhar Imam. She served as Pakistan's ambassador to
the United States during the Nawaz Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
Majeeda Begum Wyne is the wife of former Punjab chief minister
Ghulam Hyder Wyne who was assassinated in his home town near
Khanewal. She is contesting on a PML-N ticket.
</P>
<P>
About 57 million registered voters of Pakistan went to polls
today to select representatives for both the national and
provincial assemblies for a five-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
Voting ended here this afternoon and the returning officers are
busy counting the votes. Preliminary results are expected to be
announced by the Election Commission at midnight.

<HEADLINE> Three Million To Cross Lo Wu Border in Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three million people
are forecast to pass through Lo Wu, the border between Hong Kong
and the adjacent Chinese city Shenzhen during the coming Chinese
Lunar New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on passenger flow between January 28 and
February 16 -- a 20-day period straddling the Chinese New Year's
Day, which falls on February 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Kai-fan, senior principal immigration officer who oversees
border affairs, said that the forecast represents a 18-percent
increase over the passenger flow of about 2.5 million during the
New Year holidays in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The daily outflow of passengers across Lo Wu is expected to
reach the climax of 135,000 on the New Year Eve -- February 6,
since many Hong Kong people will manage to go back to hometown in
Guangdong before the midnight bell ushers in the New Year, known
as Spring Festival in China.
</P>
<P>
On February 9, the end of the New Year holidays, the biggest
daily inflow of passengers is foreseeable at 120,000.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Hong Kong Immigration Department has taken
measures to ensure the smooth flow of passengers in both
directions. Between February 4 and 6, the Lo Wu Control Point will
 open the border an hour earlier at six o'clock in the morning,
and close the border at 11:00 p.m. as usual.
</P>
<P>
The extension of working hours is part of the joint arrangement
 made by Hong Kong and Shenzhen at a working group meeting on
January 13, 1997. The two sides also agreed to appoint liaison
officers to discuss matters on passenger traffic during the
Chinese New Year Holidays.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, liaison officers of both sides will meet twice
 daily to exchange latest information on passenger flow so as to
make appropriate adjustments to the changing situation.
</P>
<P>
Li said: "We have confidence to clear 92 percent of the
passengers within 30 minutes." The Lo Wu Control Point has
strengthened its force with 60 additional staff to ensure
sufficient manpower to handle the anticipated surge of passengers
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we can open more departure or arrival counters
according to the need," said Li. There are 68 departure counters,
which are able to handle 12,000 passengers an hour, and there are
92 arrival counters, which also have a handling capacity of 12,000
 passengers per hour.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, a special passage way has been opened
for the elderly and the handicapped.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Ruling Party Denies Ties With Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party of the
Philippines today denied an opposition party's report that it is
launching a nationwide drive to keep President Fidel Ramos in
power after 1998.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Claudio, deputy secretary-general of the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party, said Laban, the largest opposition party in the
country, should desist from making further allegations.
</P>
<P>
Laban lawmaker Tessie Oreta said over the weekend that at least
two local officials from the ruling party in her constituency have
been mobilized to conduct a signature drive to change the charter,
which forbids Ramos to seek a second term in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Laban Chairman Edgardo Angara also threatened that his party
would reveal "damaging evidence" to prove that the Lakas-NUCD is
spurring the nationwide campaign.
</P>
<P>
Claudio said that any persistent "clamor and support for the
moves to amend the Constitution do not come from Lakas."
</P>
<P>
"If these moves and these discussions were to come from
Lakas-NUCD members, then that's a different matter altogether.
That is something within our control and as I said, I think we
have met with some good degree of success in making sure there is
a distinction between Lakas and the moves to amend the
Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least two private groups supporting Ramos launched
nationwide signature drives to amend the charter. However, they
reportedly failed to collect the demanded signatures.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has asked the industries
emitting air-polluting substances to renew their licences within
12 months in a bid to control air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Under a newly enacted air pollution control act, it will be
illegal for the companies to operate without a licence after the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) have been
sent around the country to issue declaration forms so as to have
all companies licenced.
</P>
<P>
The new act, including long term standards on air pollution
control, is the first of this kind on emission of substances into
air, said the ECZ.
</P>
<P>
The ECZ will be in charge of leading the companies through
medium term standards.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the estimated 80 institutions to be registered
for solid waste management have applied for the renewal of their
licences.
</P>
<P>
Half of 60 water discharging firms will get licences by the
end of this month, said the ECZ.
</P>
<P>
The water waste management is also underway as experts are
consulting with companies on the safe handling of effluents in
all the 60 discharging points in the country.
</P>
<P>
All the procedures will be completed in the next three
weeks, the ECZ said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Tribals Active During Polling in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The people of tribal areas
are showing tremendous enthusiasm in the on-going elections as all
the polling stations are thronged by the newly registered voters
to exercise their right of franchise.
</P>
<P>
The adult residents in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan,
known as the Federal-Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), was granted
franchise last December for the first time since the inception of
this nation in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Since it was a new experience for the general public, the
voters reached their respective polling stations soon after Fajr
prayers (the first prayer in the day) and made queues to wait for
their turn.
</P>

The rush on certain points was so heavy that the security staff
deployed on the gates had to intervene to avoid any ugly
situation.

The general public are showing their pleasure over the right
of franchise given to them by the caretaker government. And many
tribal voters said that they will celebrate the day every year as
it was unique in their history.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Reform Tax Policies in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government is
expected to make drastic changes in its tax policies in 1997 which
will help remedy its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The tax changes, included in a reform package proposed by
Deputy Prime Minister Victor Pinzonik, is now under discussion in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to cut the average personal income tax
from the current 51 percent to 32 percent, said David Snelbecker,
advisor from the Harvard Institute for International Development,
a U.S.-funded macro-economic advisory body founded at the request
of President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko.
</P>
<P>
Under the current tax system, a long list of businesses,
sectors of economy and even regions are exempt from taxation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that a great number of businesses operating in
Kiev, which have registered in the Chernobyl zone, have avoided
taxation.
</P>
<P>
Snelbecker said that the current system encourages the
businesses to operate in a shadow economy, at least fudge their
account records.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's untaxed shadow economy is estimated to account for
30-50 percent of the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
Snelbecker argued that tax cuts only will not bring the
businesses out of the shadow economy but reduce the national
revenues. But the tax reform represents a step in the right
direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has recently rejected a proposal of corporate
property tax which would bring in about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars a
year, saying that it would further boost the government's 1997
budget deficit estimated at 3.2 billion dollars, or 5.5 percent of
the country's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Australia Pledges to Take in Immigrants Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
pledged to keep the intake of immigrants totally
non-discriminatory and assured there was no reason to fear the
country was being swamped by Asians, as alleged by an Independent
MP, Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last year's race debate, sparked by an
anti-immigration speech made by Hanson in the parliament last
September, Federal Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock stressed
his non-discriminatory policy today.
</P>
<P>
Citing an immigration report, Ruddock said one issue that is
not negotiable in any debate is that immigration to Australia must
be based on the principle of non-discrimination in terms of race,
religion, color and ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
He said that fewer than one in four Australians were overseas
born and of those, more than half were Europeans. Just 4.5 percent
of the Australians were born in Asia and that proportion was
unlikely to rise beyond 7.5 percent in the next 30 years, he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Ruddock defended the government's decision to include
an English language test for some skilled migrants.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Deliver Medicines to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of Egyptian
exports of medicines to Iraq will be delivered later this month in
line with a three-million-U.S.-dollar contract signed between the
two countries here in January.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi pharmaceutical authority urged the Egyptian National
Pharmaceutical Company to deliver the medicines soon because of
the Iraqi people's dire need for medical supplies, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company will receive its dues directly from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee that is in charge of paying war reparations
and covering the costs of all Iraqi purchases of food and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
Several Iraqi trade delegations plan to visit Egypt shortly to
strike fresh deals with the Egyptian public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and districts have offered to sell food
and medicine to Iraq suffering from six years of international
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq has struck 13 contracts with about 20 companies
for exporting oil under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, which allows
Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil over a span of six
months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will use 1.2 billion dollars to purchase food, medicine
and other daily necessities, which are much less than the 8 billion
dollars it used to buy food and medicine every year before the U.N.
sanctions imposed after its invasion upon Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Closes Border Post due to Racial Tension in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police today
closed the Sarawak-Kalimantan border post at Tebedu, about 90 km
from Kuching, capital of Sarawak state, due to racial tension in
the Indonesian territory, according to Malaysia's official news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the border post stranded more than 100
Indonesians working in Sarawak who arrived at the border on their
way home for Moslem's Lesser Bairam and several Malaysians also
had to cut short their planned trip to Pontianak, Indonesia,
Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The closure came amid reports of unrest erupting in West
Kalimantan after a mob of some 5,000 indigenous Dayak tribesmen
burnt and looted scores of homes and stores belonging to settlers
from the Indonesian island of Madura, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Extra policemen were seen deployed at the border post,
apparently to guard against any "spill-over" of the troubles from
the other side of the border, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak Commissioner of Police Yeap Kim Seng today visited the
post with several senior police officers to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to comment on the closure and the situation
in the area, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Many Indonesians, laden with festive goods and other products
bought in Sarawak to be taken home for their Lesser Bairam
celebration, were reported waiting at the border post for the
authorities' permission to cross over.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Starts Large-Scale Development of Pine Pollen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has listed the industrialized development of pine pollen
among its 18 major biological engineering projects to be completed
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996 to 2000).
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest five million U.S. dollars in pine
pollen production next year, expecting to receive 120 million
dollars annually from the business by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, known as China's "botanical kingdom," is one of the
country's three pine tree-rich areas. The province has over 4.7
million hectares of pine trees, which can produce one million tons
of pine pollen annually.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional Chinese medical books, pine pollen
strengthens the lungs, fortifies blood, increases energy and helps
to prolong life.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have proved that pine pollen has approximately 200
kinds of active ingredients, including proteins, amino acids and
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by doctors from the Kunming Medical College
show that taking the pine pollen for a long period of time can
lead to a longer life and raise people's physical endurance.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has developed pine pollen food,
pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. It exported more than 1.2
million dollars-worth of pine pollen products to Japan, France,
Malaysia and Singapore last year.
</P>
<P>
The total transaction volume of pine pollen goods in China has
reached three billion Renminbi yuan (361 million US dollars)
annually.

SINGAPORE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and some other
Asian countries will meet their European counterparts here next
week in a bid to boost the relationship between the two
continents.
</P>
<P>
During the 12th ASEAN-E.U. (European Union) Ministerial Meeting
(AEMM), which is to be held on Thursday and Friday next week and
preceded by a Senior Officials' Meeting on Wednesday, ministers
from the seven ASEAN members and the 15 E.U. members plus
representatives of the European Commission will try to "push
forward" the ASEAN-E.U. relationship, Foreign Ministry officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, one of the officials said
the 20-year-old relationship between the two organizations has
been seeing ups and downs because of issues such as human rights
and good government.
</P>
<P>
The issue of East Timor was actually the main issue that
created a lot of problems in the relationship between the ASEAN
and the
E.U. in the past and led to difficulties in the efforts to further
the ASEAN-E.U. dialogue process, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Indonesians had said they would walk
out of the meeting if the East Timor issue were raised by the
Portuguese this time.
</P>
<P>
Now the aim here is to try to promote the relationship between
the two organizations and adopt a very workable joint declaration
which sets up the programs that will push the relationship into
the next century, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the upcoming meeting, the official said,
"Indications are good that there will be a substantive,
forward-looking and action-oriented type of joint declaration
coming out of the AEMM deliberations on the 13th and 14th of
February."
</P>
<P>
The AEMM is held once every two years and the 11th AEMM was
held in Karlsruhe, Germany, on September 22 and 23, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Another Foreign Ministry official said Singapore considers the
First Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which is to be held
next Saturday after the 12th AEMM, "a very important meeting
because it is the first time that the foreign ministers will
actually have an input into the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting)
process."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers have been mandated to prepare the second
ASEM meeting, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"But beyond that, I think, what we expect the foreign ministers
to do is to look beyond the second ASEM and into the future of
ASEM, and try to think of how the ASEM process is working out now,
so that they will ensure the long-term future development of the
ASEM process," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The other important element of the foreign ministers' meeting
is that this is an alternative for them to develop a dialogue...
We hope that, because this is an ASEM process, the political
dialogue will concentrate more on global issues and global
challenges," she said.

<HEADLINE> Transfer of Power within Fortnight: Leghari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's President Farooq
Leghari said today that the next government would be formed within
two weeks and hoped that elected houses would complete their term.
</P>
<P>
"There would be no delay in transfer of power even by a day",
Leghari said while talking to reporters after visiting a polling
station here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no confusion (about transfer of power)", the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Leghari went round both male and female polling booths and
inquired from the election staff about the arrangements and
turnout.
</P>
<P>
The next government would be free to decide the future of
Council for Defense and National Security (CDNS) formed early last
month, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said he did not believe that voter turnout would be
lower than the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
The president said he could assure "on oath" that no rigging
would take place as being alleged by the deposed prime minister,
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government had fulfilled its obligation of
holding elections, he said. "Now it is up to the voters to return
candidates who could safeguard their (voters) interests."
</P>
<P>
He said that a good structure had been raised to achieve the
objective of accountability and hoped that it would continue. "The
accountability should be a "constant process," said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The reforms introduced by the caretaker government, whether
they belonged to economic sector, banking sector, freedom of
information, accountability laws and all the other structural
reforms were revolutionary changes, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that these measures would improve the political
culture of the society in which corruption would be under attack
constantly "and where we move towards good governance".
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation on the eve of the polling
day, Leghari promised that the transfer of power will be within
days in a smooth way after the elections.
</P>
<P>
About 57 million registered voters of Pakistan go to polls
today to elect the National Assembly and four provincial
assemblies amidst hopes that political uncertainty will finally
end without fears that defeated parties will refuse to accept
election results.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth general elections in eight years since the
lifting of martial law at the end of 1985. And it is for the first
time that Pakistan is holding elections for both the National and
provincial assemblies on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results are expected to be announced at
midnight by the Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia to Have New Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to expand its
satellite communications capacity by launching a new generation of
satellite to keep pace with the country's dynamic economic growth
and abreast of rapid technological advances.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, named Garuda, will be launched in mid-1998
in Kazakhstan using a Russian rocket at a cost of some 70 million
U.S. dollars, announced Minister of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunication Joop Ave here last week.
</P>
<P>
The Garuda satellite, designed by two Indonesian experts and
being developed by the Asia Cellular Satellite (ACES), is
necessary due to technological development and the increasing use
of cellular phones, Joop said.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite would enable expansion of cellular phones in
the country from the current 600,000 to about 1.3 million in 1999,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The system of ACES, a joint venture of Indonesia's private
satellite carrier, Pt. Pasifik Satellite Nusantara, the Philippine
long distance telephone company, and Thailand's Jasmine
International, will allow connection between hand-held phones and
public telephone networks in Bangladesh, Brunei, Myanmar, China,
South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ACES chief executive officer Adi Adiwoso also welcomed the
Indonesia's plan, saying that "it indicates that Indonesia would
sign a memorandum of understanding on the free circulation of
terminals between countries for customers using satellite-based
mobile personal communication system."
</P>
<P>
Last October, 120 countries met in Europe to draft the
Memorandum on Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite
which is expected to be signed in July this year.
</P>
<P>
"It will be feasible for systems providing services in
Indonesia without having any infrastructure here. They would not
be owned by Indonesia, not even regulated by Indonesia," Adiwoso
said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that it is likely the agreement would be signed by
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam, as well as Western European countries,
Canada, the United States and some Middle Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, as the third country using telecommunications
satellite after the U.S. and Canada, has operated three
generations of Palapa telecommunications satellite since 1970 to
support its vast communication areas as well as countries in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The first satellite system Palapa A was launched in July 1976
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the United States.
</P>
<P>
In March 1987, the country's second-generation satellite Palapa
B2p, which contains 24 transponders, each capable of handling one
color-TV channel, or 1,000 two-way circuits simultaneously, was
launched into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The country's third satellite, the Palapa B2r was launched in
April 1990. the satellite is for telephones, TVs, facsimiles and
data transmission. The Palapa B4 was launched in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Indonesia launched the telecommunications satellite
Palapa C1.
</P>
<P>
At present, Indonesia owns 18 major ground stations, 19 medium
and 84 minor ground stations linking the country's 27 provinces
and 18 other sites in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also has a vision, similar to the U.S. super
information highway, to further develop its future
telecommunications facilities in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"If the Garuda satellite is launched, I have to say that all
the basics are reachable everywhere, in small villages, in boats,"
Joop noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Voids Foreign Bid for Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
today voided a Malaysian consortium's winning bid to purchase the
historic Manila Hotel and ordered the government to sell the hotel
instead to a Philippine bidder.
</P>
<P>
The decision could mar investor confidence in the country,
businessmen and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled the state-owned hotel, built in 1912, is part
of the country's heritage and its sale to a foreign firm would
violate the "Filipino first policy" enshrined in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The policy gives preference to "qualified" Filipinos in the
"grant of rights, privileges and concessions covering the economy
and national patrimony."
</P>
<P>
A group led by Malaysia's Renong Berhad and ITT Sheraton had
offered the highest bid for 51 percent of Manila Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the government to award the contract to the
Manila Prince Hotel Corp.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling was the latest in a series of decisions
affecting the privatization of state assets.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, the Court of Appeals ordered the suspension of
the privatization of Manila's water and sewerage system until it
can rule on claims that it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Two Philippine consortiums, backed by their foreign partners,
won separately the 7 billion U.S. dollars water privatization
project, the largest of its kind in the world.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Survey Underway in China Is Important, FAO Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural survey, which
is under way in China, will help the country improve its agrarian
data significantly, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The farm-to-farm survey of Chinese agriculture will be "a
snapshot" of the current situation at local, provincial and
national levels, the release said, quoting Odell Larson, Chief of
FAO's Statistical Development Service. The release was issued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which began on January 1 "will help China with its
more than 800 million rural people to have a better understanding
of where, what and how much food its farmers are producing," the
FAO official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the data collected in the survey "will be vital
for China to provide food security for its more than 1.2 billion
people and for assessing the future need for such key inputs as
seeds, fertilizers and machinery."
</P>
<P>
China will be able to develop a data collection system to keep
track of shifts in production trends on a yearly basis using the
census as a base, he added.
</P>
<P>
The FAO has provided technical support to China for the
project, the first agricultural census in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 6 million trained workers have been dispatched throughout
the country to collect information from some 230 million rural
households in approximately 800,000 villages and more than 20
million rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The data will be processed at more than 300 computer centers
across the country and the final results will be analyzed by the
Food and Agricultural Statistics Center in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Rebel Police Lay Down Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- About a thousand mutinous
military policemen of Guatemala laid down their weapons Sunday,
ending a five-day confrontation with the government.
</P>
<P>
Under great military pressure, the rebels agreed to solve their
problem through political negotiations, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, government troops supported by tanks
reportedly tightened the besiegement of the headquarters of the
military police force occupied by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said that the government troops have so
far controlled the headquarters and the rebels
have begun to hand out their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Normal patrols will be resumed soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny started on January 29 after the police failed to get
response from the government on their demand that 10,000
U.S. dollars be paid to each of them to compensate their economic
loss caused by a peace accord, which was signed between the
Guatemalan government and the guerrillas a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that the problem remains unsolved with the
demand of the mutinous soldiers still rejected by the government.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Voting Rights At Last for Tribal Adults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The stage is finally set for
the election of the eight National Assembly seats reserved for the
tribal areas on the adult franchise basis.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the tribals to select representatives
of their own in the fifty-year history of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But voting rights for women in the man-dominated tribal areas
seem to be far from a reality.
</P>
<P>
In Khyber, a tribal area situated along the Islamabad-Kabul
highway, the local Malicks (chieftains) even refused to allow
women to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Only 9,135 women were registered as voters in Khyber as
compared to 175,545 male voters.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the adult franchise granted by the caretaker
government to the tribal areas, the Chief of the Pakhtoonkhwa
Qaumi Party, Abdul Latif Afridi, told Xinhua that in the past drug
Mafia was controlling the election system which was only confined
to some influential people.
</P>
<P>
Now the tribal people have the right to elect representatives
of their own choice, who will fight for the solution of their
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Latif believed that there needs to be more changes in
the current election system and the representation should be given
to the tribals in the institutions of North West Frontier
province.
</P>
<P>
As to voting rights for tribal women, Latif, also a prominent
lawyer, expected the issue to be settled in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Women activist and chief of the All Tribal Women Association
Begum Jan said that the male-dominated society of the tribals will
have to seek help of women in the development process.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that in the next elections women in the tribal areas
will have equal rights to vote.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Maulana Abdul Hadi, a prominent cleric, said that
there is no concept of voting by women in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Yet he said it is a welcome development that the tribal adults
have been finally granted franchise after 50 years of independence
of this nation.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most significant aspects of the 1997 elections,
the caretaker government formed early last November introduced an
amendment to the electoral laws by granting franchise to adult
residents in the tribal areas, officially known as the
Federal-Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
</P>
<P>
People living in the FATA had long been demanding adult
franchise. But none of the previous elected governments, since the
lifting of martial law at the end of 1985, thought it fit to let
the tribals take part directly in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Election Commission, more
than 1.60 million people out of a total population of two million,
including 409,620 women in the tribal areas, have been registered
as voters for the February 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
Many politicians in Pakistan, including former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto, believe that the voting rights for tribal adults
will bring about a positive change in all spheres of life in the
tribal areas.

<HEADLINE> Official: Israel's Growth May Fall Short of 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli Treasury
official has painted a gloomy picture of 1997 ahead saying it
is quite possible that economic growth will run short of the
4 percent target, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
David Brodet, Director-general of the Finance Ministry, made
the assessment Sunday. He said, however, that it will still
be possible to achieve 4 percent growth if the fiscal and
monetary institutions begin discussing a joint economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Brodet said that the continuation of low exchange rate and high
interest rate policy is likely to stunt growth in the coming
year. "I am not in favor of a one-off interest rate cut of
two-three percent, but I don't think we need to wait 30 days
to make changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel said in reaction that as far as the
state of the economy in general is concerned the blame lies
more with those responsible for fiscal policy. "The problem of
balancing Israel's economic policy results from the destructive
budgetary control, beginning in 1995 and escalating in 1996,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the bank statement said, the government
faced the 7 billion shekels (about 2.1 billion dollars) deficit
but did nothing to correct the situation in 1996. The bank called
for cooperation between the fiscal and monetary institutions in
implementing the country's approved budget, inflation targets and
planned structural changes.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan researchers have
developed two new maize varieties, the New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Denis Kyetere, the head of the maize section of the Namulonge
Agriculture Research Institute, said the seeds of the new
varieties called 602 and 402 now are tested in field to make
clear their performance and adaptability.
</P>
<P>
Their yield potential can reach seven-nine tons per acre,
higher than five-seven tons of popular variety of Longe 1 in the
eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The new varieties, while remaining main advantages of Longe 1,
can resist drought and most local maize diseases, the researchers
said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif, president of
the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)), cast his vote today in
Lahore and predicted that the PML(N) will win the elections.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who is believed to be the most likely winner in the
on-going general elections, arrived at the polling station at
10:00 a.m. accompanied by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote, Sharif told the media that his party
will sweep the elections, and the PML(N)'s first priority on
winning the elections would be to revitalize the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in very bad shape at the moment due to three
years of mismanagement and mishandling by the previous
government," he said. "We have to do so much to revive the economy
and put the country back on the road of progress and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the controversial Eighth Amendment to the 1973
Constitution, Sharif said that it is up to the next Parliament to
decide whether to continue with it or abolish it.
</P>
<P>
The PML chief denied that he had some kind of deal with
President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The polling station opened around 8:15 a.m., an hour and a
quarter later than the scheduled time. According to a presiding
officer the delay was due to the late arrival of the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP)'s polling agent while that of the Pakistan
Tereek-e-Inssaf (PTI) was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former prime minister and PPP chairperson Benazir
Bhutto, accompanied by local party leaders, cast her vote this
morning at a polling station in her hometown Larkana in Sindh
province
</P>
<P>
Benazir, whose government was sacked by President Farooq
Leghari last November on the accusation of corruption and economic
mismanagement, told the local media that voter turnout "may be
low."
</P>
<P>
About 57 million registered voters of Pakistan began to cast
their votes this morning to select representatives for both the
National Assembly and the provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The polling started at 7 a.m. and will end at 4 p.m. without
break. This is the fourth general elections in the past eight
years since the lifting of martial law at the end of 1985.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results are expected to be announced at
midnight by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Pakistan is holding elections for
national and provincial assemblies simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 political parties and 902 independents are in the
run for the 217 National Assembly seats and 483 provincial
assembly seats.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Demanded to Reduce Cabinet Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party has
directed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to trim his grand-size
cabinet to make the government more effective and popular, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken Sunday by a meeting of the Central
Working Committee (CWC) of the Nepali Congress (NC) party here, a
senior party leader said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to NC General Secretary Taranath Ranabhat, the CWC
meeting demanded the prime minister, who is from the NC party, to
hold serious discussions with other coalition partners for a
reduced and more dynamic cabinet, or the council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali cabinet currently has 47 members after several
reshuffles since the three-party government led by the NC was
formed in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba made his latest cabinet reshuffle last
month to reinduct five members of the two ruling partners, the
National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Nepal Sabdhavana Party
(NSP), who had earlier quit their cabinet seats to support an
opposition attempt to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle has drawn widespread criticism within Deuba's own
NC party.
</P>
<P>
Other decisions made by the NC party on the Sunday meeting
included calling on the government to launch populist programs
like employment generation and maintain economic discipline in
administration.
</P>
<P>
The NC party also ordered the prime minister to prepare a
report on the performance of his 17-month-old coalition government
for the next NC CWC meeting on February 9.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Build PLC Building in Al-Bireh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Work is reportedly to
begin this year on a new building for the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) in Al-Bireh, north of Jerusalem, and
two million U.S. dollars have been allotted for the project.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted PLC speaker Ahmed Qurie as
saying that the building would not be the permanent premises of
the council, which would eventually move to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that Al-Bireh, which
almost touches the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem, could
itself become part of a greater Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"That is something which can be discussed later," he said.
But after the permanent status of Jerusalem is decided, he
said he expected "the council will be inside the Old City."
</P>
<P>
The reasoning behind the decision to build a home for the
council in Al-Bireh, which forms one urban unit with Ramallah, is
that Ramallah is "an important city also" and it needs a cultural
center; and also, when the PLC vacates it, there will be other
uses for the building, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the PLC usually meets in Gaza or Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview to be published later this
week, Qurie said the Palestinians have the right to declare
statehood on May 5, 1999, whether or not agreement is
reached with Israel.
</P>
<P>
That is because the Oslo accords, which he negotiated on
the Palestinian side, explicitly state the final settlement talks
will end by May 4, 1999, "not exceeding five years" from
the implementation of the accords in Gaza and Jericho on May
4, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Qurie said that on the last day of the Oslo negotiations
he insisted on inserting those words to make clear there was
a firm time limit for the final-settlement talks.

JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 110 Southern
African women representatives have demanded representation at the
United Nations' Great Lakes summit, set for the end of March, the
local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
Women from Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South
Africa held a conference in Johannesburg at the weekend on the
role of women in armed conflicts, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the head of the African National
Congress Women's League (ANCWL) and ex-wife of President Nelson
Mandela, said at the meeting women and children are victims of
violence on the continent, especially in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, women should be represented and have their
voice at international conference concerning the issues of the
conflict, said Winnie.
</P>
<P>
ANCWL Deputy President Thandi Modise said letters demanding
participation at the forthcoming UN Great Lakes summit would be
sent to the U.N. Secretary-General, the Ambassador of Rwanda and
the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
A committee of representatives from Southern African countries
would also be established to deal with socio-economic problems
affecting women and children in armed conflict, said Thandi.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Drops Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The pressure on price rise
eased a little as India's annual rate of inflation fell for the
second week in succession to 7.48 percent during the week ending
January 18, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation (provisional-over-final) fell by 0.16
percentage points compared with 7.64 percent during the previous
week even as the wholesale prices index (WPI) for all commodities
(base 1981-82=100) registered a 0.2 percent increase to 320.4
against 319.8 for the week before.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation during the corresponding week in 1996 was
5.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Faces Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will face a shortage of
estimated 141,000 tons of food in the first half of 1997, the
local daily The New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will lack 30,000 tons of cereals, 45,000 tons of
pulses, 124,000 tons of roots and tubers and 522,000 tons of
bananas and plantains in cereal equivalent terms in the period,
the paper quoted a U.N. report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which will import part of food it needs, is expecting
to receive 81,000 tons of food aid between January and June, said
the report released by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) and the World Food Program(WFP).
</P>
<P>
The food crisis was caused by the return of more than one
million refugees from eastern Zaire in 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the food production in Rwanda remains below the
1994 pre-civil-strife level, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on the survey of a joint FAO/WFP mission
in Rwanda in early December. enditem

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Market textile Through Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has signed a
cooperation agreement with Global Textile Network (GTN) to market
its textile products through the Internet, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"The textile trade through the Internet is one of our efforts
to boost Indonesia's exports of textile and its related products,"
Lendo Novo, an official of the Indonesian Textile Association
(API), said after signing the agreement here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York based GTN is an organization of thousands of
textile companies around the world. The network also provides
support services such as storaging, transportation and technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Novo said that the Internet would provide more opportunities to
gain orders and inform buyers about Indonesian products as
competition in international markets "is very tough".
</P>
<P>
API's studies, he said, revealed that the growth of world
demand for textiles "is decreasing, but its time delivery is
shorter. This tendency can be anticipated by entering the Internet
network."
</P>
<P>
Information was formerly distributed by telephone, facsimile
and exhibitions but these methods were costly, Novo said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation with GTN, he said, "is just like moving the
exhibition arena into the computer screen where the traders can
offer their products and the buyers are able to get their needs in
a shorter time."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that if 20 percent of API's 2,000 members had
access to the Internet, "their contribution to the export volume
will be significant because the possibility of getting buyers
instantly is greater."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's textile and textile products export increased 10.5
percent in 1996 to 6.85 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, textile is one of the four largest foreign exchange
earners of Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports.

concerned will be distabilized, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He urged donor countries to assist the UNHCR and the relevant

<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing West Railway Station,
Asia's largest, has established a special award to show support
for its employees who come face to face with disgruntled customers
every day.
</P>
<P>
When Liu Fuxiang of the ticketing office, the first winner of
the award, received a certificate and a 50-yuan bonus today from
the station head, her tears flowed.
</P>
<P>
"I am so excited," she said. "When customers do not acknowledge
my service, at least I know the station understands my troubles."
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, a middle-aged man came to Liu's ticket
window, asking for a train ticket to Zhengzhou, Liu's colleagues
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
When told the tickets were sold out, the man called Liu dirty
names, they said.
</P>
<P>
During festival and holiday periods in particular, many loud
and sometimes profane complaints are heard from people who cannot
get tickets home.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xuecheng, director of Beijing West Railway Station, said
that the customer always comes first, even in a difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
"But we should also think about the employees," Zhou said,
adding that the meager "sympathy award" is little compensation for
what they sometimes endure.
</P>
<P>
He said that station employees who are considered for the award
must show that they were considerate to the customers airing their
grievances.

<HEADLINE> Smart Schools to Be Operational in Malaysia in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 85 Smart
Schools will be open on January 1, 1999 as a first step towards
absorbing such concept of education in all schools in Malaysia by
the year 2010, Education Minister Najib Tun Razak said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Smart Schools will be computerized and the software for
mathematics, science, Malay and English has been completed while
that for other subjects is being developed, he told reporters
after opening a Smart School Seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The 85 Smart Schools would have about 85,000 students, he said,
adding that eight others would be set up under the government's
privatization program in answer to call to invite the private
sector as partner to successful implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
The education minister disclosed the ministry had distributed 5
million ringgit (about 2 million U.S. dollars) for training 1,780
masters trainers and conducting the second Information Technology
(IT) courses for 30,000 primary and secondary school teachers
especially those teaching mathematics, science, Malay and English.
</P>
<P>
He said another 12 million ringgit (about 4.8 million U.S.
dollars) had been allocated to build multimedia laboratories and
upgrade existing computers.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Education Ministry has introduced IT education to
trainee teachers doing their teaching diploma.
</P>
<P>
The Smart School is one of the eight flagship applications for
the first stage development in the proposed 50 km by 15 km

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Cancellation of Jordan-Israel Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon denied Sunday night that
Israel had called off a planned Israeli-Jordanian joint gas
venture, the state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that Israel is prepared to discuss with anybody
the supply of gas, including the Qatari government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's remarks came apparently in response to a Reuter
report that Israel has formally pulled out of a joint venture with
Jordan to set up a 300 million U.S. dollars gas plant in Jordan
that was supposed to supply the two countries with gas from the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Hisham Dabbas
was quoted as saying that "The project is non-existent ... the new
Israeli government is apparently not interested in the project
any longer." He added that Israel had probably opted for other
sources of gas.
</P>
<P>
The deal was agreed upon at the Amman Middle East economic
summit in 1995. U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. spearheaded the
project to set up a 300-million-dollar plant in Aqaba, Jordan's
Red Sea port, to bring liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar to
Israel and Jordan in the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Investors say that the Israeli reluctance was based on
economics, as getting LNG from Qatar by vessels would be more
expensive than other sources, including direct pumping of gas
from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
An investor close to the deal said "The Israeli government
sent a letter to Enron saying that a letter of intent it signed
with Enron in October 1995 was no longer binding."
</P>
<P>
Dabbas, however, said that Enron had not shelved plans
to set up an electric power plant in Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The project was the largest undertaking planned so far
between Israeli and Jordanian private investors. Investors say
that its collapse would be a serious setback to efforts to create
large private sector joint ventures between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty and then established
diplomatic relations with Israel in 1994, has repeatedly
expressed its grievances over Israel's lacking interest in
joint economic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is scheduled to
visit Amman Wednesday to discuss ways to speed up the regional
peace process. The issue of bilateral relations in political and
economic fields will also be likely high on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Counter New EU Dumping Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will battle European
Union claims that Thailand is dumping facsimile machines on EU
members.
</P>
<P>
This month the EU is likely to announce an investigation into
alleged dumping by Thailand, according to Pitsanu Rieanmahasarn,
Thai minister (commercial) to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The other countries and regions to face the investigation are
South Korea, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. The
inquiry follows complaints from a European manufacturer, Philips,
that underpriced cheap imports had damaged its sales.
</P>
<P>
Pitsanu was quoted today by local newspaper the Bangkok Post as
saying that Singapore had called for a meeting with fellow ASEAN
members Malaysia and Thailand. Their ambassadors to the European
Commission might express joint opposition to the claims.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Commerce Ministry source said Thailand was not the main
target of the inquiry because it had a very small share of the
EU's facsimile sales, 2.7 percent, in 1995. The prime targets were
South Korea, which had 23 percent, and Japan, with 21.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market shares of other countries and regions in 1995 were
China 4.1 percent, Hong Kong 2 percent, Malaysia 2.2 percent,
Singapore 4 percent and Taiwan 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Thailand warned the EU that it would consider
the investigation to be a non-tariff barrier that should not be
implemented as trade in information technology products was being

<HEADLINE> Israel Partly Opens Hebron's Shuhada Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army this morning
opened part of Hebron's Shuhada Street to Palestinian emergency
vehicles, municipal vehicles and taxis, as the first stage in
restoring the street to normal use.
</P>
<P>
According an Israel Radio report, the open area is a one-way,
150-meter section from Gross Square, near the Jewish neighborhood
of Avraham Avinu Quarter, to the Padesco Gas station and then
past Beit Romano toward the market.
</P>
<P>
In further stages over the next three or four months the
rest of the street will be open to regular traffic and
business, in accordance with the Hebron agreement reached last
month between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The street was closed off at both ends after the massacre
of 29 Moslem worshipers at the Machpela Cave (Ibrahimi
Mosque) three years ago generated fears of revenge attacks
against settlers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources said that the army is considering
placing a protective wall in front of Beit Hadassah and
neighboring Jewish buildings to maintain security for the
settlers after that section of the street is opened.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings housing Jews, including Beit Hadassah, Beit
Schneerson and Beit Hasson, are located on Shuhada Street,
renamed King David Street under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
The street also links the busy intersection of Bab
el-Zawiye, which is under full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Hebron settlement leaders decried the decision to
open the street, complaining about the earlier opening of the road
at a date less than a month after the Hebron redeployment
agreement, which gives Israel four months to open the road
gradually.
</P>
<P>
Hebron settlement head Noam Arnon said a small "token"
demonstration against the opening of the road is scheduled for
today, and a larger protest action, which he would not spell
out, is planned for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Hebron settlers have waged an exhaustive campaign for months
against the road, saying that opening it to Palestinian
traffic will present a security risk.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Accused of Pushing for Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Laban ng Demokratikong
Pilipino, the main opposition party in the Philippines, Sunday
accused the ruling Lakas-NUCD party of secretly pushing the
signature drive to amend the constitution, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Laban leaders also slammed the ruling Lakas-NUCD for "fooling
the people" by denying that the ruling party had no part in the
drive to collect about 15 million signatures needed for a national
plebiscite to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party, headed by Senator Edgardo Angara, vowed
to present "damaging evidence" to show how Lakas had a direct hand
in efforts to extend the term limits of elected officials,
including President Fidel Ramos, by changing the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Laban officials said the party had received reports from
municipal and city Laban chapters detailing stepped-up moves by
Lakas officials to help gather signatures for those groups seeking
to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the president can only serve
one single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
But a private group, the People's Initiative for Reform,
Modernization and Action, and other pro-Ramos groups said the
president should serve beyond May 1998 when his term expires.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, these groups have been collecting the 15
million signatures needed for a referendum before the 1998 general
election.
</P>
<P>
Ramos himself has repeatedly stressed his determination not to
run for re-election in 1998. But both Ramos and his Lakas party
said they had no right to stop these groups from launching the
charter change campaign.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Experiences Worst Power Load-Shedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chittagong, the largest sea port
of Bangladesh, has been experiencing the worst ever power
load-shedding since the beginning of this year, according to port
sources.
</P>
<P>
the Power Development Board (PDB) is supplying only 30 percent
of the total requirement of the city, causing immense sufferings
to the city dwellers, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the industrial sector of this country's commercial
capital is being badly affected by the continuous unprecedented
load-shedding every day.
</P>
<P>
The garment manufacturing industries are the worst sufferers of
the load-shedding. It is reported that several deliveries of
garment quotas have been canceled due to failure in timely
delivery due to load-shedding.
</P>
<P>
Total demand of Greater Chittagong is over 300 megawatts (mw) a
day. But presently, the PDB is supplying only 130 mw, and even
below 100 mw at times.
</P>
<P>
PDB officials attributed the unusual load-shedding to the
prevailing gas crisis and mechanical fault in some power plants.
Only 130 mw of power generation is now available in the Kaptai
Station while the 210 mw Raozan Power Plant has been out of
operation since last August.
</P>
<P>
For an important port city, this kind of load-shedding can
easily create a big burden on the national economy. It will put
manifold pressure on the industrial sector as well as trade and
commerce, the sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 620,000 yuan (about
74,700 US dollars) has been donated to improve China's "First
Public Toilet" in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest yet the most accessible public toilet in
central Beijing. The municipal government has already spent 3.2
million yuan (about 385,500 US dollars) to build and renovate the
facility.
</P>
<P>
So far, ten companies in the city have volunteered to donate
the money for necessary improvements to make it cleaner and more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northwest corner of the world-famous square --
an internationally-recognized symbol of Beijing -- it is said to
be the first public restroom facility in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing Youth Daily, the public toilet receives
dozens of thousands of visitors per day, and even more during
holidays.
</P>
<P>
The capital city's 2,300 local public hygiene workers have
vowed to gradually renovate 6,239 public toilets scattered around
the city; this year's target figure is 1,000, compared with last
year's 547.
</P>
<P>
The city also claims it will improve conditions of toilets in
rural areas and help renovate 80,000 household and public
restrooms within the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's first public toilet exhibition was held last year
in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Upgrade Drug Rehabilitation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia plans to build
four new drug rehabilitation centers and renovate and upgrade all
the existing ones to accommodate increasing drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has allocated 78 million ringgit (about
31.2 million U.S. dollars) for the purpose, according to
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama today quoting Deputy Home
Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob.
</P>
<P>
There are presently a total of 28 drug rehabilitation centers
in Malaysia, accommodating 14,754 inmates, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Four new rehabilitation centers which will accommodate 500
inmates each will be in Sabah, East Malaysia, and Kedah, North
Malaysia, Megat Junid said.
</P>
<P>
He said besides limiting the number of inmates in each
rehabilitation center to 500, the inmates would also be segregated
into different groups depending on whether they had been on mild
or hard drugs or HIV-positive and undergo different treatment
programs under a major revamp of the drug rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing method, the various groups are placed under
the general rehabilitation program which was found to be
ineffective, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian National Anti-Narcotics Agency has decided to
make a drug rehabilitation center here a place for addicts who
voluntarily turned themselves in.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse and trafficking have become a serious issue in the
country with more people becoming addicts and being involved in
drugs trafficking.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, at present there are 175,165
drug addicts in the country with some 50 more a day adding to the
figure.
</P>
<P>
Among the addicts, 36 percent are those aged 20 to 24.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, police nabbed a total of 3,328 drug traffickers with
305 detained in the capital city as against 184 in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Police busted 28 drug syndicates in the city and prosecuted
1,270 people for various drug-related offenses last year compared
with only 912 people in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Heroin seizures also increased to 68.2 kilograms last year from
18.7 kilograms in 1995.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Democratic Party Slams Plan to Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Democratic
Party leader Tony Leon has criticized the cabinet for its plan to
release thousands of prisoners jailed for "petty offences".
</P>
<P>
The plan would result in a new "wave of lawlessness", Leon
said in a statement issued at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
African National Congress, the ruling party in South Africa,
was reportedly planning to set 25 percent of all convicts free
and to offer amnesty for violent crimes in Kwazulu Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Correctional Serviced Commissioner Khylekani Sithole
said they were to release 50,000 prisoners convicted for petty
offences like theft and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
This is "the worst suggestion I have heard", Leon said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to win the war against crime, apart from
introducing some practical and positive steps, was to demonstrate
zero tolerance for every misdemeanour," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in a period of transition from
apartheid to democracy, has been much troubled with increasing
crimes, said local press.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- East Asia is continuing to
expand as the main destination for Thailand's exports of polished
gem-quality diamonds, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of last year, this market took 51.6
percent of these exports in terms of value.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative value of all diamond exports during this period
was 17.13 billion baht (685 million US dollars) and commerce
analysts estimated that diamond exports for 1996 as a whole would
be worth 21.5 to 22 billion baht (860 to 880 million US dollars)
when the final figures are released in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of the cumulative value of Thai diamond
exports comes from polished gem-quality goods.
</P>
<P>
These analysts pointed out that exports to East Asia showed a
marked improvement in the level recorded a couple of years ago
when only about 44 percent of outbound shipments were destined for
this market.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Outlines Strategic Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Chongqing
recently unveiled an all-encompassing economic plan designed to
turn this leading industrial center in southwest China into an
internationally-recognized economic, financial and trade region by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The multi-function economic development will transform the city
into a modern metropolis -- one that will play an increasingly
important role in China's national economy, said Xu Zhongmin, vice
mayor of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is a well-matched industrial and commercial city
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It is one of the six
traditional industrial bases in China.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan for the upcoming 14 years includes a number
of propositions:
</P>
<P>
* Setting up an open and well-coordinated economic
system. Under it, many export-oriented enterprises and industries
will build an economic and trade system that is in keeping with
generally acknowledged international practices in economic fields,
and will become more competitive on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of Chongqing's import and export value will make up a
quarter of the city's gross domestic product by the year 2000,
and rise to 35 percent by the year 2010;
</P>
<P>
* The city will become the largest port of entry and exit, with
a complete system of services such as customs, commodity
inspection, quarantine, transport and consultancy on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the volume of external trade handled by Chongqing is
expected to reach 15 billion US dollars annually;
</P>
<P>
* It will absorb more overseas funds, two thirds of which will
be direct investment. Overseas investors are encouraged to upgrade
technology at enterprises, build projects in the fields of energy,
communications, telecommunications, agriculture, environmental
protection and for the resettlement of people who formerly lived
in the flooded areas;

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Dismisses Reports of Immediate Iraqi Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has dismissed media
reports that Iraqi troops posed an immediate threat to the
country and assured its people that there was no cause for fear.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti State Minister for Cabinet Affairs and acting
Information Minister Abdul Aziz Al-Dakhil said Sunday night
after a weekly session of Kuwaiti Cabinet that the Kuwaiti government
had closely followed reports about new plans by the Iraqi regime
to invade Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure Kuwaitis and expatriates that there is no cause
for fear. There is nothing that warrants any abnormal action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the Council of Ministers studied reports attributed
to an American military source about Iraqi military movements
within the no-fly zone" in the southern part of Iraq, and agreed
that the situation is assuring and "we are coordinating with
friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
Recent Kuwaiti and U.S. reports said there was a possible
Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, pointing to a military movement
involving between 150,000 and 180,000 troops in the southern
part of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dakhil said that these troops have been there since the end
of the Gulf War. But he added that Kuwait is watching the
situation with an "eagle's eye," saying "in the event the Iraqi
regime sent any sign of threats, we will be able to protect and
safeguard the security and stability of our state."
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait was coordinating with its allies in terms of its
security and stability. However, he ruled out sending any
additional troops to the country
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said
last Friday that the country was "deeply concerned" about the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Former Islamist parliamentary member Abdel Mohsen Jamal told
local Arabic daily Al-Qabas that the United States and other
powers needed occasionally to stir up fears about Iraq to
justify their presence in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
"The great powers will not find a better scarecrow in the
region than Saddam," he said.
</P>
<P>
A foreign diplomat here said Iraq might still pose a threat
to Kuwait but this also could help the U.S. justify its military
presence on the Kuwaiti land.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. F-117a stealthy bomber are still based in Kuwait
while a full brigade of heavy military equipment including tanks
and armored personnel vehicles has been stock-piled here since
1994 when the Iraqi troops made its last military movements in
the no-fly zones.

<HEADLINE> Recent Elections in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The on-going general
elections are the fourth in eight years in this South Asian
nation. The previous three were held in 1988, 1990 and 1993
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the general elections held in November 1988, the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP) won 93 of the 207 directly elective National
Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA), a grouping of nine
parties including the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), gained 54
seats. The remaining seats went to independents and candidates
representing seven smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The PPP and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which together
had a working majority in the National Assembly (the MQM had 14
seats), formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, leader of the PPP, was appointed prime minister
on December 1, 1988, thus becoming the first female leader in the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
But Benazir and her government were dismissed on August 6, 1990
by the then President, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and a general election
was called in late October.
</P>
<P>
In the general elections held on October 24, 1990, the IDA
doubled its representation in the National Assembly, leaving it
only four seats short of an absolute majority, while the People's
Democratic Alliance (PDA, an electoral alliance comprising the PPP
and three smaller parties) suffered a heavy defeat.
</P>
<P>
On November 6, 1990, Nawaz Sharif, leader of the IDA, was
elected new prime minister. But Sharif resigned from the post on
July 18, 1993 and the National Assembly was dissolved at the same
time. General elections were held in October that year.
</P>
<P>
In the general elections held in early October 1993, both the
PML faction led by Nawaz Sharif and the PPP under the leadership
of Benazir Bhutto failed to win an outright majority.
</P>
<P>
After intensive negotiations with smaller parties and
independents in the National Assembly, Benazir Bhutto was elected
to head a coalition government on October 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, Benazir and her government were sacked by President
Farooq Leghari on November 5, 1996, and general elections are held
on February 3.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Imran Khan, New Face In Pakistan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A number of new faces have
emerged on Pakistan's political arena since the election process
began last December, among which Imran Khan is most eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
Imran, a man of strong nerves and quick temper, formed his
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement of Justice) in March 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a span of some months, it has not only created an impact,
but also has attained the characteristics of the third largest
party in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
When the former captain of Pakistan's cricket team first
announced his intention of taking part in the polls, very few
traditional politicians were prepared to give him much of a
chance.
</P>
<P>
However, as the campaign picked up, with Imran drawing large
crowds in every nook and corner of the country, Imran succeeded in
creating a certain niche for himself.
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan's party is the third major party fielding 131
candidates for the National Assembly, trailing behind the Pakistan
People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (N). It has also put
almost equal numbers for the Provincial Assemblies seats.
</P>
<P>
Imran, with a politically untainted past, tops all the
contenders as he is fighting from seven National Assembly
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan's announcement that he would introduce a uniform
education system in the country and that plunderers would not be
spared if the PTI comes to power have earned a great deal of
support for his party.
</P>
<P>
Being a newly-formed party, its candidates are little known and
have almost no personal vote-tank and are not in a position to
compete with the candidates of the PML(N) and the PPP.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here say, Imran is the new unknown factor in
politics.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the pre-election opinion polls said that Nawaz
Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League(N), the most
potential candidate to win the elections, will form the next
government by a slim lead or form a coalition government with
smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
Local press polls said that Imran Khan will win about five
percent of the votes in the on-going general elections.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expands Sports Complex to Lessen Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A Thai government agency in
charge of drug control has expanded its "sports complex for youth"
project aimed at drawing young people away from narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The organizer, the Office of the Narcotics Control Board
(ONCB), hopes to attract young people, students in particular, in
the country by providing them with recreational activities and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has received support from Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, will be held nationwide in temples and
local community facilities.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has instructed all local offices of the state-owned
provincial electricity authority to offer free electricity
consumption for the project in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years there has been a fivefold increase in
reported use of amphetamine, according to prime minister's office
minister Veerakorn Kamprakob.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 around a million amphetamine tablets were taken and it
increased to 5 million tablets the following year, according to
ONCB estimates.
</P>
<P>
The same consumption increase rate brought the figure to 25
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the ONCB estimates that this figure is only 10 percent
of the actual number of tablets taken nationwide. Thus, the 1997
estimate, which will touch 125 million tablets based on the
fivefold rise, could actually be in the region of an alarming 1.25
billion tablets.
</P>
<P>
ONCB Secretary-General Preecha Chammparat said amphetamine
abuse is unlikely to decrease, although production of the drug has
dropped following police crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that amphetamine dealers have turned to smuggling
from minority-group manufacturers living in neighboring countries,
according to Preecha.
</P>
<P>
He added that the largest source of the drug is Myanmar's
minority groups, which smuggle through major outlets in Chiang Mai
and Chiang Rai in north Thailand.
</P>

In the central province of Sing Buri, an estimated 7.45 percent
of all students ar

<HEADLINE> Indian PM May Expand His Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H. D.
Deve Gowda is expected to expand his Council of Ministers on
return from his current foreign tour in time for the budget
session of Parliament scheduled to commence on February 20, the
Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is attending the World Economic Forum
conclave held in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Well-placed sources of the ruling United Front said Gowda had
himself raised the question of adding more people to his team at a
recent meeting of the United Front steering committee.
</P>
<P>
He had said that he was finding it difficult to carry on with
the present strength of 38, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
An expansion has been on the card for some time. But whether
the prime minister would utilize the opportunity to reshuffle his
team or promote anyone among the junior ministers is not clear.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the prime minister may go in for the
cabinet expansion soon after his return. This is because the new
ministers would need time to familiarize themselves with the
government's work in time for the parliament session.

<HEADLINE> Tribals to Vote for First Time in Pak History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic tribals in the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) today will exercise
their voting rights for the first time in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most significant aspects of the on-going general
elections, the caretaker government formed early last November has
introduced an amendment to the electoral laws by granting
franchise to adult residents in the rugged North West Frontier
province bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The tribal areas had never been given representation in any of
the Pakistan assemblies till 1970. They still have no
representation in the North West Frontier Provincial Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The tribal areas have already been given their due share in the
Senate under the 1973 Constitution. However, in the election
process only 8,000 Maliks (chieftains) formed an electoral college
and chose eight representatives for the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This practice was running till the last elections in 1993.
</P>
<P>
None of the previous elected governments since the lifting of
martial law in 1985 thought it fit to let the tribals take part
directly in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
People living in the tribal areas had been demanding adult
franchise for years. Finally, they got it at long last in December
1996 and the Election Commission started registering voters there.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Election Commission more
than 1.60 million people out of a total population of two million
in the tribal areas, including 409,620 women, have been registered
as voters.
</P>
<P>
A total of 793 polling stations with 2,795 polling booths have
been set up in the tribal areas.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of the participants can be judged from the long
list of candidates. As many as 286 candidates from the tribal
areas are in the run for the eight seats of the National Assembly
for FATA.

<HEADLINE> Transnational Companies Play Positive Role in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The positive influence of
investment in China by transnational companies outweighs the
negative impact such funds might have on China's economy,
according to an article in the Beijing-based magazine "Outlook,"
which came out today.
</P>
<P>
Many experts and officials in China share the view that the
good momentum of large-scale investment by transnational companies
in China should be maintained, the article said.
</P>
<P>
National statistics have shown that 200 of the 500 top
transnational companies in the world invested in 1,000 projects
across the country in 1996, with the average amount of funds spent
for each standing at 20 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhile, a research fellow with the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, said the result of a recent survey
on 110 transnational companies has proved that their investment
alleviated the funds shortage in China.
</P>
<P>
Transnational companies have also helped the Chinese
enterprises to upgrade technology and equipment, boost the
development of pillar industries which are technology-intensive or
require huge amounts of funds, and train a large group of
experienced managers and technicians, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the fear that transnational companies can give a
pounding to the national economy of China, some experts held the
view that foreign companies have not and will not monopolize the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the sales value of foreign-funded enterprises made up
35 percent of the market share in the trade of detergent, 36
percent in cosmetics, and 40 percent in soap. After deducting the
amount for export, foreign companies occupied 10 percent of the
Chinese market. And the output of foreign brand beer accounts for
three percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, experts say, the competition between the outsiders
will become much more tense as their number grows.
</P>
<P>
Such competition will prompt some companies to seek new
opportunities in the central and western parts of the country,
which have rich national resources but lack funds, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the article said, direct investment of transnational
companies will present a challenge to China's economy, as
government departments have not drawn up a complete set of
policies to guide and adjust the use of foreign funds.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan has become the leading
trade partner of Shanghai, China's largest economic center.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics provided by the customs, the
Shanghai port handled 14.18 billion US dollars worth of goods last
year, accounting for 26.8 percent of its gross import and export
volume.
</P>
<P>
A municipal official in charge of foreign trade said that the
reduction of China's import tariffs had enabled the imports of
Japan's textiles, iron and steel, sheet materials and machinery to
rise by 15.6 percent over 1995 to 6.886 billion US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai's exports to Japan rose to 7.194 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exported goods included textiles, garments and shoes valued
at 960 million US dollars, and aquatic products, fresh vegetables
and farm products worth 200 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Outlines Strategic Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Chongqing
recently unveiled an all-encompassing economic plan designed to
turn this leading industrial center in southwest China into an
internationally-recognized economic, financial and trade region by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The multi-function economic development will transform the city
into a modern metropolis -- one that will play an increasingly
important role in China's national economy, said Xu Zhongmin, vice
mayor of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is a well-matched industrial and commercial city
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It is one of the six
traditional industrial bases in China.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan for the upcoming 14 years includes a number
of propositions:
</P>
<P>
* Setting up an open and well-coordinated economic
system. Under it, many export-oriented enterprises and industries
will build an economic and trade system that is in keeping with
generally acknowledged international practices in economic fields,
and will become more competitive on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of Chongqing's import and export value will make up a
quarter of the city's gross domestic product by the year 2000,
and rise to 35 percent by the year 2010;
</P>
<P>
* The city will become the largest port of entry and exit, with
a complete system of services such as customs, commodity
inspection, quarantine, transport and consultancy on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the volume of external trade handled by Chongqing is
expected to reach 15 billion US dollars annually;
</P>
<P>
* It will absorb more overseas funds, two thirds of which will
be direct investment. Overseas investors are encouraged to upgrade
technology at enterprises, build projects in the fields of energy,
communications, telecommunications, agriculture, environmental
protection and for the resettlement of people who formerly lived
in the flooded areas;
</P>
<P>
* The government will enhance the city's role as a leading
financial center in west China. A dozen overseas financial
institutions and more than 20 from China will settle in the city
over the next couple of years;
</P>
<P>
* Redoubled efforts will be made to build a communication
network embracing air, shipping and highway services.

ZAGREB, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic held
off Greg Rusedski of Britain in a tough win of 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-6
(8/6) here on Sunday, capturing the Zagreb indoor open title for
the second successive year.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, ranked 56th, broke dual Wimbledon finalist
Ivanisevic at 3-3 in the second set.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Briton, who ousted second seed Thomas Enqvist
on Saturday, had to save four break points in the third set and
then showed remarkable spirit to come back from four points down
in the decisive tie-break to level it at four apiece.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, 25, secured his 18th career title from 22
appearances in finals after Rusedski double-faulted at 7-6 when he
was called for a foot-fault and then served his second effort into
the net.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic added the doubles title with Davis Cup partner Sasa
Hirszon, beating South African Brent Haygarth and American Mark
Keil 6-4, 6-3.

BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Thai government agency in

project aimed at drawing young people away from narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The organizer, the Office of the Narcotics Control Board
(ONCB), hopes to attract young people, students in particular, in
the country by providing them with recreational activities and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has received support from Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, will be held nationwide in temples and
local community facilities.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has instructed all local offices of the state-owned
provincial electricity authority to offer free electricity
consumption for the project in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years there has been a fivefold increase in
reported use of amphetamine, according to prime minister's office
minister Veerakorn Kamprakob.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 around a million amphetamine tablets were taken and it
increased to 5 million tablets the following year, according to
ONCB estimates.
</P>
<P>
The same consumption increase rate brought the figure to 25
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the ONCB estimates that this figure is only 10 percent
of the actual number of tablets taken nationwide. Thus, the 1997
estimate, which will touch 125 million tablets based on the
fivefold rise, could actually be in the region of an alarming 1.25
billion tablets.
</P>
<P>
ONCB Secretary-General Preecha Chammparat said amphetamine
abuse is unlikely to decrease, although production of the drug has
dropped following police crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that amphetamine dealers have turned to smuggling
from minority-group manufacturers living in neighboring countries,
according to Preecha.
</P>
<P>
He added that the largest source of the drug is Myanmar's
minority groups, which smuggle through major outlets in Chiang Mai
and Chiang Rai in north Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the central province of Sing Buri, an estimated 7.45 percent
of all students are drug addicts, according to governor of the
province, Wichita Khongmalai.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are facts and
figures about the 1997 national and provincial assembly elections
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The on-going general elections, the fourth in eight years, are
being held as a result of dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's government
and the dissolution of the National Assembly by President Farooq
Leghari on November 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was the forth in the series of dissolutions since the
lifting of martial law at the end of December 1985. The first,
second and third assemblies were dissolved respectively in 1988,
1990 and 1993.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The total number of registered voters for 217 seats in the
National Assembly is 56,496,773 and those for 483 Muslim and

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's '97 Elections Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Polling process of Pakistan's
1997 general elections started early this morning in a peaceful
way across the country for election of representatives of people
for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The polling, which started at 7 a.m., is to continue till 4
p.m. without any break.
</P>
<P>
Polling in Pakistan's major cities, including Islamabad,
Rawalpindi, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta, commenced in a
peaceful and orderly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The voting and turnout will gain momentum at mid day because
most of voters confined themselves to homes after observing fast
and prayer. The chilly air and cold weather also forced voters to
stay indoors during early hours.
</P>
<P>
The mobile troops of the Pakistan Army, contingents of Pakistan
Rangers and police are conducting patrolling all over the capital
city and some of the personnel of the Army have also been deployed
at polling stations to ensure the peaceful and smooth polling to
meet any eventualities.
</P>
<P>
About 57 million registered voters of Pakistan started voting
this morning to select representatives for both the national and
provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth general elections in the past eight years
since the lifting of martial law at the end of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected to be announced at midnight by
the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Pakistan is holding elections for the
national and provincial assemblies simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The most important feature of the on-going election is that
adult residents in the Federal-Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)
are exercising their right to vote for the first time since the
creation of Pakistan in 1947.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 political parties and 902 independents are in the
run for the 217 National Assembly seats and 483 Provincial
Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
The total number of registered voters for the 217 seats in the
National Assembly are 56,496,773 and those for the 483 Muslim and
non-Muslim seats in the Provincial Assemblies are 54,760,127.
</P>
<P>
There are 36,451 polling stations with 131,607 polling booths
in all the four provinces, the FATA and the Federal Capital of
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 troops have been deployed in the election
day, of whom 100,000 are to perform election duties and 150,000 to
maintain law and order across the country.
</P>
<P>
The main contest will be between two old rivals -- the Pakistan
Muslim League (N) led by Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan People's
Party under the leadership of Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have put up the largest number of candidates --
the PML(N) fielded 178 candidates for the 203 Muslim seats in the
National Assembly while the PPP fielded 163 candidates for the
same seats.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf (PTI) led by cricketer-turned
politician Imran Khan is the third major party fielding 131
candidates for the National Assembly seats. The PTI has also put
almost equal numbers for the Provincial Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that none of the major
political parties is expected to score an absolute majority in the
National Assembly to form a single-party government.
</P>
<P>
The smaller groups and parties will play a significant role in
the formation of the next government.
</P>
<P>
None of the elected governments for the last 12 years could
complete the five-year tenure. They were prematurely dismissed
under the controversial eighth amendment of the 1973 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The on-going elections were called by President Farooq Leghari
on November 5 last year when he sacked Benazir and her government
on charges of corruption, extra-judicial killings and misrule.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Trains 2,800 Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has since 1987
trained more than 2,800 representatives from 85 countries on the
management of family planning and contraceptive technology, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The countries that sent their officers to take part in the
program knew Indonesia is successful in implementing its family
planning program, State Minister for Population Haryono Suyono
said at the parliament at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The number of participants has exceeded that of similar
programs organized by other countries or international
institutions, official sources today quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the UN Family Planning Agency (UNFPA)
declared Indonesia as one of the world's training centers for
family planning in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Haryono, who is also chairman of the national coordinating
board for family planning (BKKBN), said most countries that
followed the family planning workshops in Indonesia, are now
implementing integrated health service, which are managed by the
society.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, he said, the BKKBN has also sent
hundreds of family planning consultants to some Asian and African
countries to help them ensure the success of their family planning
programs under South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's population in early 1997 reached 199.7 million, the
fourth largest in the world after China, India and the united
states.
</P>
<P>
The government managed to lower the population growth rate from
5.6 percent in the first five-year development plan (1969-1974) to
1.6 percent by the end of the fifth five-year plan (1989-1994, so
that each family has now an average of 2.5 children.

<HEADLINE> Brief Introduction to Modern History of Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
introduction to the modern history of Pakistan where the general
elections are being held today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was created in August 1947 by the partition of the
British-ruled former Indian Empire into the independent states of
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan originally comprised two distinct regions, West
Pakistan (presently Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).
</P>
<P>
East Pakistan declared independence in 1971 after a bitter
civil war sparked by an election which proved divisive.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan became republic on March 23, 1956 when its first
constitution was promulgated.
</P>
<P>
When Pakistani troops surrendered in East Pakistan in 1971,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became the first leader of present-day
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, the first civilian leader following the military rule
by Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan (1958-69) and General Mohammad
Yahya Khan (1969-71), was himself toppled by army chief General
Zia-ul-Haq in July 1977.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was hanged in April 1979 on a disputed conviction for
conspiring to commit a political murder.
</P>
<P>
Zia held non-party elections in February 1985. He named
Mohammad Khan Junejo as prime minister and lifted martial law in
December that year. Zia and many of his top military aides died
on August 17, 1988, when his plane crashed near Bahawalpur,
southeast of Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan returned to party-based democracy when Bhutto's
daughter Benazir and her Pakistan People's Party won 39 percent of
the votes in November 1988 elections.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, 1990 President Ghulam Ishaq Khan sacked Bhutto's
government. Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi was named caretaker prime
minister until general elections were held in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Democratic Alliance led by Nawaz Sharif won the
election against Bhutto's People's Democratic Alliance and Nawaz
Sharif became prime minister in 1990 and resigned in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto was re-elected in October 1993 as the head of a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On November 5, 1996, President Farooq Leghari dismissed
Benazir's government, dissolved the National Assembly and
announced the holding of general elections on February 3, 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Announces Tax-Cut Proposal Over 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
announced a proposal for 100 billion dollars in tax relief over
the next six years with almost half going to a child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
The tax-relief proposal is a part of President Bill Clinton's
plan to balance the budget by 2002. The budget plan for fiscal
year 1998 will be announced on February 6.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisions 46.7 billion dollars in cuts for a
500-dollar-per-child tax credit and cuts of 38.6 billion dollars
for various initiatives that will make higher education easier to
be obtained.
</P>
<P>
It also expands the income level on deductible Individual
Retirement Accounts, eliminates the capital gains tax for most
home sales and reduces the estate tax imposed on the death of a
farmer or a small business owner.
</P>
<P>
The administration is looking at some 80 billion dollars in new
tax revenues, mostly on businesses and renewal of the expired
airline ticket tax.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the U.S. Congress are also seeking broader-based
tax relief of about 200 billion dollars in their balanced-budget
plan. They praised the Clinton administration's proposals while
questioning his targeted cutting approach.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Steps to Aid Laid-off Workers (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xu Lantian, a 50-year-old displaced worker with a construction
vibrator plant, has benefitted from the move, receiving various
kinds of aid since he lost his job.
</P>
<P>
Xu suffered from chronic stomach problems and back pain for
many years, and was laid off by his plant two years ago.
</P>
<P>
When the local governments learned of Xu's difficulties, they
offered his family free food, housing, and school tuition for his
two children. They also helped him set up a newspaper stand, which
brings in more than 400 yuan monthly.
</P>
<P>
According to the Trade Union chairwoman, the provincial
government has channeled nearly 10 million yuan to help 640,000
workers get out of poverty over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The province has established a total of 1,326 funds which
raised 150 million yuan, and some 400,000 poor workers are
expected to get relief funding of between 300 and 500 yuan each
around the eve of the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 40,000 poor workers have received free food
stamps, and 60,000 workers who receive low wages have been given
discounts on their housing, water, electricity and gas supply
charges.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has also set up 1,900 insurance firms that have aided
more than 14,500 workers, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
To help displaced workers shake off poverty, the province has
also taken steps to expand employment and provide more job
opportunities for them, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 displaced workers in the province have received
training from 61 professional schools. "Expansion of skills will
help them find new jobs," Sun said.

SHENYANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kong Qingtang, a retired
worker from this largest industrial city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, hasn't had a paycheck for two years. Little did
he dream that a senior provincial leader would drop by his home
with gifts in hand.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, paid a special visit to Kong in late
January, just prior to the Chinese New Year, bringing rice, flour,
cooking oil and 800 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Kong, 64, once a skilled worker with a machine tool factory in
Shenyang, was named a "National Model Worker" in the 1950s. His
three children now work in the same factory.
</P>
<P>
But the factory suffered losses over the past two years,
resulting in cuts in pay for the employees, including Kong and his
family. Added to that, Kong's wife was seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the province has some 367,000
workers in circumstances similar to Kong's.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Chunlan, chairwoman of the Liaoning Provincial
Trade Union, some 30,000 leading officials at all levels have sent
more than 100 million yuan and about 1.8 million daily necessities
to these retired and displaced workers as part of the province's
campaign to "provide warmth to workers in need," which was
initiated four years ago.

Liaoning, one of China's oldest industrial bases built in
1950s, has 26,000 industrial enterprises, including over 1,400
state-owned large and medium-sized firms, accounting for 10
percent of the country's total. Together, they employ more than 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
During China's transition from a planned to a market economy,
Liaoning has faced challenges in the development of enterprises,
as the industrial structure and management have been unable to
adjust to the rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
A report from the provincial industrial department indicates
that over 5,000 companies in the province have had to halt
production or declare bankruptcy because of the problems
experienced in the switch of economic styles.
</P>
<P>
The central government has paid close attention to the
innovation of the province's old industrial structure, putting it
on the top of the agenda for national economic development in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"Under a socialist market economy, it is natural for a company
to go bankrupt," Provincial Governor Wen Shizhen said. "But the
key point is that governments at all levels should ensure the
bottom living standards of displaced workers and workers in need."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Liaoning led the country in its drive to help out its
workers in need, and the rest of the country is now following
suit.

accidents reached a 15-year record of 200,000 cases in 1996, up 15
percent against 1995, with 1,386 people killed and 38,000 injured.

red light and drunk driving, was the main cause of accidents.

According to statistics, the republic's traffic death rate
reached 150 per million, twice as much as that in Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned in the country are working out more

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Holds Elections Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 57 million registered
voters of Pakistan will cast their votes today to select
representatives for both national and provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The polling, which starts from 7 a.m. through 4 p.m., will be
the fourth since 1988 and the first held in the holy month of
Ramadan of the Muslim year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Pakistan to hold elections for
national and provincial assemblies simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The most important feature of the on-going elections is that
the adult residents in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA) will exercise their voting rights for the first time since
the creation of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 political parties and 902 independents are in the
run for 217 National Assembly seats and 483 provincial assembly
seats.
</P>
<P>
The total number of registered voters for 217 seats in the
National Assembly are 56,496,773 and those for 483 Muslim and
non-Muslim seats for the provincial assembly seats are 54,760,127.
</P>
<P>
There are 36,451 polling stations with 131,607 polling booths
in all the four provinces including the FATA and the federal
capital of Islamabad, which would be manned by 560,072 personnel.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected to be announced at midnight by
the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a peaceful poll, the government has deployed a total
of 250,000 troops to perform election duties and to meet any
eventuality on the election day.
</P>
<P>
The main contest will be between the two old rivals -- the
Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)) led by Nawaz Sharif and the
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) under the leadership of Benazir
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have put up the largest number of candidates --
the PML(N) fielded 178 candidates for 203 Muslim seats for the
National Assembly while the PPP fielded 163 candidates for the
same seats.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Tereek-e-Inssaf (PTI), led by criketer-turned
politician Imran Khan, is the third major party fielding 131
candidates for the National Assembly. The PTI has also put up
almost equal numbers for the provincial assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
None of the elected governments for the last twelve years could
complete its tenure. They were prematurely dismissed under the
controversial eighth amendment to the 1973 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The on-going elections were called by President Farooq Leghari
on November 5 last year when he sacked Benazir and her government
on charges of corruption, extra-judicial killings and misrule.

<HEADLINE> FM: Romania Has No Territorial Claim Upon Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Adrain Severin said today that "Romania has no territorial claims
upon Ukraine" and an agreement concerning the border issue between
Romania and Ukraine is under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Severin made the statement over Radio Romania in response to
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's remarks to British
Broadcasting Corporation that Romania has territorial claims upon
Ukraine and Ukraine has good relationships with all its
neighboring countries but Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian foreign minister said, "I don't think the
Romanian-Ukrainian relations are not good," adding that Romania
has good relationship with all its neighbors, and his country has
no territorial dispute with any of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Severin said that the border issue between Romania and Ukraine
has been settled in the Helsinki Agreement, which focuses on
security and cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that Romania could not join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) without signing a bilateral
pact with Ukraine, the Romanian foreign minister said that he did
not regard the bilateral relations agreement between Romania and
Ukraine as the pass for joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Romania has reached bilateral basic agreements with
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Hungary, and is discussing reaching
similar agreements with Ukraine and Moldova, two republics of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
NATO requires, as a precondition, any country applying for its
membership to settle its bilateral relations with its neighbors in
the form of an agreement.

MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Georgia today hailed the U.N.
resolution passed by the Security Council Thursday on the peaceful
settlement of the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict.

BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Philippe Gatien of France
won his first European title in four year when he captured the
men's single triumph at the European Top 12 table tennis
tournament in Eindhoven of the Netherlands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gatien, world champion in 1993, beat Vladimir Samsonov of

victory.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman lost his first two group matches and seemed in
danger of elimination before finding his form. He defeated Jan-Ove
Waldner of Sweden, seven times winner of the event, in the
semifinals after another five-game battle.
</P>
<P>
Ni Xia Lian, a former Chinese national team member, looked

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Measles Rises to 74 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of children killed by
the deadly measles has risen to 74 in the Philippines as the
infectious disease spread outside the Philippine capital region
last week, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
From January 1 to 28, 74 children, most of them aged between
one to five years old, have been killed by measles complications,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 74 deaths, 47 were reported in Metro Manila and its
nearby provinces, 23 in Davao del Norte province in southern
Mindanao, and 4 in Pangasinan province in northern Luzon.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, a total of more than 1,100 measles
cases, most of them in the capital region, were reported by health
officials across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department has come under strong fire for its
failure to curb the spread of measles and its insistence that
there is no measles epidemic in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high number of measles cases and deaths, Health
Secretary Carmencita Reodica insisted there is still no basis to
declare an outbreak or epidemic because there is no clustering or
concentration of cases in one specific area.
</P>
<P>
The department was also accused of imposing a news blackout on
the measles situation after health officials stopped issuing the
latest number of measles cases and deaths on January 28 under an
order from Reodica.
</P>
<P>
According to the health authorities, measles broke out first in
some parts of Metro Manila not covered by routine immunization
activities and then spread among slum areas where sanitation
conditions were poor.
</P>
<P>
Health workers started last week to launch a house-to-house
anti-measles vaccination drive in high-risk areas of Metro Manila
and those areas not covered by routine immunization activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more then 6,000 measles cases and 301 measles-related
deaths were registered all over the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Crackdown Drives Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's drastic crackdown on
illegal foreign workers has driven a large number of unwanted
aliens into south Thailand, local newspaper the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has estimated that about one million illegal foreign
workers from south Asian countries have entered Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the aliens are from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia recently announced that it would take tough action
against illegal workers and their employers, with the former being
expelled and the later punished.
</P>
<P>
Chartsa-ngar Noleechart, governor of Satun province, southern
Thailand, was quoted as saying that Thailand has been adversely
affected by Malaysia's crackdown on illegal aliens who escaped
arrest by fleeing into Thailand before sneaking back across the
border to seek higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the influx of unwanted foreign workers, Satun
provincial authorities have ordered all agencies, particularly
those in border areas, to take action.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, Chartsa-ngar said villagers living along
the border have been asked not to provide shelter to illegal
aliens and to report their movements to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern that illegal workers who escaped the
crackdown by hiding along the Thai-Malaysian border would create
more social problems as well as crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, 73,742 foreign workers entered
Malaysia last year via Satun.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Transport System Urged to Be Updated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy's transport system lags
behind the rest of Europe and urgently needs to be updated,
Transport Minister Claudio Burlando said today.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the railways could be brought "to the brink of
collapse," if no proper measure is taken.
</P>
<P>
Burlando was addressing a regional conference of the Democratic
Party of the Left, the largest force in the ruling center-left
coalitions government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's ministerial directive this week on reorganizing the
state railways and dividing the management of the track from the
provisions of service caused a storm.
</P>
<P>
Railway unions have called strikes in opposition to the
reorganization plans.
</P>
<P>
If the transport system is not modernized in line with its
European partners, Italy will be marginalized, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The railways need to face up to the challenge of competition,
he said, adding that transport should be seen not only as a
service but as part of the productive system.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Call for Further Excavation in Downtown Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists and
historians here have called for further excavations in the popular
shopping area of Wangfujing, where a number of relics and fossils
dating back to the Stone Age were recently found at a construction
site.
</P>
<P>
A group of scholars from Beijing University and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences issued a petition last weekend, urging that
relevant departments support their work at the construction site
of the Oriental Plaza to "ensure that scientific work can be done
smoothly," today's "China Youth Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
A number of stoneware items and fragments of animal fossils
which scientists say are from the Stone Age were found there late
last year. The pieces, discovered by workers during construction,
are the oldest relics of ancient man ever found in the core area
of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-year-old site is also the oldest ever discovered in
a capital city anywhere in the world, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Plaza, located on Beijing's busiest street of
Wangfujing, is a commercial project involving an investment of 1.5
billion US dollars from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The construction workers should learn from the experiences of
foreign experts on similar occasions, and well protect the
relics," said Wu Liangyong, a professor from the prestigious
Qinghua University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists suggested that the site be preserved for
posterity, both for scientific and patriotic purposes.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts are still skeptical about doing so, as
many problems have already cropped up as a result of the conflict
between relics protection efforts and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Among the top ten archeological finds last year, several came
from construction sites, such as the Three Gorges Dam and a large
reservoir at the Yellow River. But some of the pieces were
destroyed during the construction, according to the State Cultural
Relics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen have ignored the value of historical sites,
considering them only for commercial use, said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Experts say there needs to be a period of time to achieve a
balance between the preservation of the 5,000-year-old
civilization and the moderization drive of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese telecommunications
product manufacturers were granted quality certificates on
Saturday in Beijing for their excellent management and high
product quality, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The certificates were granted by the Beijing-based Post and
Telecommunications Quality System Certification Center (PTQC) in
accordance with ISO9000 international standards.
</P>
<P>
The four enterprises are the Zibo Sound Cable Factory in
Shandong Province, the Dongguan CDC Cable Plant, the Shenzhen
Huawei Telecommunications Co Ltd and the Shenzhen Guangtong
Telecom Development Co Ltd of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
PTQC sources said that the four enterprises make up the first
group in China to receive these quality system certificates,
indicating that these enterprises can consistently provide Chinese
and foreign clients with quality telecom products and equipment.
</P>
<P>
They can also provide their customers with excellent service
from start to finish -- during production and during and after
sales.
</P>
<P>
The products of the four companies included switchyards, power
supplies for telecommunication facilities, cables and
fiber-optical cables.
</P>
<P>
China has backed issuing quality certificates to enterprises
for excellent quality control and top management to stimulate
businesses as the country continues to build a socialist market
economy and more Chinese products go to the international market.

<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A consulting company has been
established here to advise and inform overseas investors of all
aspects in the development of China's mineral resources, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company, King Aland Consulting Ltd, will provide
information on the latest geological prospecting achievements and
policies and regulations concerning overseas partners in the
tapping of Chinese mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
"The development mineral resources can no longer be an economic
effort by a single country. It is bound to be an international
effort," said Cui Dewen, president of the company, at its opening
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened its mineral resources to foreign countries,
many overseas companies have expressed their willingness to enter
the Chinese mineral industry. However, a lack of intermediate
companies providing adequate information has hampered the inflow
of overseas capital, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company, which can provide technical economic
appraisals and feasibility studies for geological, mineral and
engineering projects, will meet those market demands.
</P>
<P>
The company was wet up, with a registered capital of one
million yuan by the Armed Police Gold Headquarters, the China Gold
Society, the China Geology Prospecting Technology Institute, the
Changchun Gold Research Institute and the Hainan Huamei
Joint-Stock Co.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Spend More to Help Keep Ground from Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will spend 35 million
yuan (about 4.2 million U.S. dollars) in the next five years to
help keep the ground from sinking beneath the city's feet.
</P>
<P>
The largest municipality in China is ready to update
ground-monitoring facilities in the downtown area and to set up a
new ground-subsidence supervising network in the Pudong New Area
located in the easter bank of Huangpu River running through the
city, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated network will be extended throughout
Shanghai. "Improved monitoring facilities are necessary to
exercise closer control over the excessive use of groundwater
supplies," Xin Benzhi, director of Shanghai's Bureau of Geology
and Mineral Resources, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over-use of the city's shallow layer of groundwater -- or
aquifer -- was causing Shanghai to settle into the layer as its
water was depleted.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 13 million, Shanghai's consumption of
water by residents and industry has been rising. Xin told that his
bureau is studying the feasibility of transferring water from the
Yangtze River to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has kept a close eye on the diminishing aquifer and
pumped water into the aquifier to replenish most of the water
being drawn out.
</P>
<P>
The measures worked. However, the subsidence has accelerated
since the mid-1980s as more water was drawn from the aquifer and
large-scale construction was undertaken in the city.
</P>
<P>
Xin was confident to say that when the projects are completed
and construction tapers off, drainage of the aquifier also will
slow, leaving no threat to the city's future development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 83 percent of the
urbanites in northeast China's Liaoning Province bid farewell to
coal-burning stoves last year and are using gas for cooking and
heating.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 Liaoning households moved to new houses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government invested three billion yuan (about
361 million US dollars) in 1996 to improve basic urban facilities,
50 percent more than the year before, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The province invested another 15 billion yuan building houses
for the people, said Zhao Junlin, director of the provincial
construction department.
</P>
<P>
The projects increased water supply capacity in cities by
226,000 tons each day and more than 96 percent of the urban
residents are provided with a sufficient supply of hygienic
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Urban roads were extended by 1.59 million square meters, and
over 300 public buses were put into operation, thereby easing
urban traffic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people live in houses with central
heating. And many projects are still under construction, Zhao
added.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang and Anshan, the province's capital and major cities,
will build more water supply works this year, Dalian has started
constructing a sewage treatment plant, and Yingkou and Jinzhou have
achieved great progress in improving their gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
Some 126 roads are being constructed in provincial cities which
will greatly improve traffic conditions in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The province also attached importance to green projects. As a
result, more than 31 percent of the land in Liaoning cities is
covered by grass and trees.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A six-driver team of four
Americans and two Britons gave Ford its first triumph on Sunday in
the Daytona 24 Hours sportscar race since 1966.
</P>
<P>
Britons James Weaver and Andy Wallace, teamed up by Americans
Rob Dyson, Butch Leitzinger, John Paul Jr and Elliot Forbes
Robinson snatched victory by one lap in Daytona of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Their car ran the final hour with smoke pouring from a broken
piston but still covered a race distance of 690 laps (3953 km).
</P>
<P>
Second place went to the Ferrari of Spain's Fermin Velez and
Americans Andy Evans and father-and-son Charles and Rob Morgan.
</P>

The Ferrari led early on but was delayed by several collisions,
one in which Rob Morgan and Weaver went spinning off the track.
</P>
<P>
It was the second Daytona victory for Wallace -- he won there
in 1990 for Jaguar -- but the first 24-hour triumph in more than
15 years of trying for Weaver.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leaders Meet With US Envoy on Brcko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb member of the
Bosnian Presidency Momcilo Krajisnik held talks with visiting U.S.
envoy to the Balkans John Kornblum today over the thorny issue of
Brcko and joint Bosnian institutions.
</P>
<P>
Brcko is situated in the narrowest part of the northeastern
Bosnian corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Serb
entity Republika Srpska. The strategic town is still under dispute
and an international arbitration committee will decide the fate of
Brcko in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which was held in the Serb capital of Pale near
Sarajevo, the two sides discussed a number of issues, such as the
question of a central bank, symbols, and the mounting tension in
the inter-entity boundary lines of the two entities, the Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, who is U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe
and Canada, also discussed the Brcko issue with Serb co-chairman
of Bosnia's Council of Ministers Boro Bosic and Serb President
Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Plavsic said, "Any extremely negative
solution (for the Bosnian Serb entity) is out of the question."
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said Kornblum could not say much about the arbitration
as he had not been fully informed on the issue by head of the
Brcko arbitration commission Roberts Owen. The arbitration also
includes members of the two entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska
and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
