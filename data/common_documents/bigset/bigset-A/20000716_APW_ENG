<HEADLINE> Astronauts Get Aviation Honor  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Astronauts Edwin ''Buzz'' Aldrin and Eugene
Cernan were inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember when I've ever been so moved as I have been
today,'' said Aldrin, who in 1969 joined Neil Armstrong as the
first men to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have finally reached that unreachable star,'' added Cernan,
who was the last man to walk on the moon, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The two men embraced after being enshrined, drawing applause
from the more than 400 people who attended the ceremony at the
Dayton Convention Center. Also inducted into the hall of fame were
World War II combat pilot Thomas McGuire and military pilot
Laurence Craigie.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin said his walk on the moon with Armstrong had been ''only
too brief.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just remember looking over at Neil, and we had a great sense
of satisfaction of having just made it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hall of fame, founded in Dayton in 1962 and later
established by Congress, has more than 150 inductees, including
Armstrong, the Wright brothers and Charles Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin, a native of Montclair, N.J., served as an Air Force
combat pilot in Korea before becoming a NASA astronaut in 1963. His
space missions included Gemini 12 in 1966, during which Aldrin
performed a record 5.5-hour space walk, and Apollo 11, when Aldrin
followed Armstrong onto the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Cernan, born in Broadview, Ill., was a Navy attack pilot who
also became an astronaut in 1963. He flew on the Gemini 9, Apollo
10 and Apollo 17 missions. He was the second American to walk in
space and the last to walk on the moon, which he did in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, a native of Ridgewood, N.J., enlisted in the Army Air
Corps during World War II. Assigned to the 475th Fighter Group in
the Pacific combat theater, he shot down 38 enemy aircraft before
he was killed in combat in January 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Craigie, born in Concord, N.H., became an Army Air Service pilot
in 1924 and held key positions in aircraft testing and development.
He served combat duty in World War II and retired from a NATO
command in 1955 as lieutenant general. He died in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Train Bomb in Pakistan Kills Eight  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- A bomb ripped through a crowded
passenger train heading for southern Karachi early Sunday, killing
eight people and injuring 25 others, railway officials and doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   The train was pulling out of the station in Hyderabad, 100 miles
north of Karachi, when the bomb went off around 7 a.m., they said.
Troops quickly cordoned off the area as residents helped rush
victims to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Four passengers died in the emergency ward of the hospital, said
the railway workers, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hospital
officials said another four people died within an hour. They feared
the death toll could increase because at least two other people
were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion
and police say they have no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train was just leaving when there was a huge bang, smoke
everywhere and people screaming,'' said a passenger who identified
himself only as Azim. He was travelling with his sister and her two
children in the passenger car carrying the explosive devise.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from cuts and bruises, Azim said the scene was
chaotic. The rear of the passenger car was a mess of twisted steel.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months there have been several bomb explosions in
Pakistan. Most of the explosions have occurred in the eastern
Punjab province, the country's largest and most populous region.
</P>
<P>
   However, southern Karachi, Pakistan's largest city of 14 million
people located on the Arabian Sea coast, also has been the target.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani authorities have blamed many of the explosions on
neighboring India, however, it's not clear what the evidence is to
link New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India routinely accuse each other of sabotage.
Uneasy neighbors since South Asia gained its independence in 1947,
the two countries have fought three wars in 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, also
has been wracked by ethnic and religious violence. The ethnic
combatants usually are members of the regional Muttahida Qami
Movement, representing Indian Muslims who settled here in 1947, and
indigenous Sindhis.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials suspected the explosion may have been an act of
protest against Saturday's conviction of a leading MQM leader,
Farooq Sattar, on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar was sentenced to 14 years in jail and barred from holding
political office for 21 years. The stiff penalty is part of a new
law introduced by the army-led government after seizing power in a
military coup last October.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Killer Leads Cops to Body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Convicted serial killer Angel Maturino
Resendiz led authorities Saturday to the skeletal remains of a
teen-age girl, a day after admitting to authorities he killed her
and her traveling companion three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz, 39, told Marion County sheriff's detectives during an
interview in Texas that he killed Jesse Howell, 19, with a railroad
air brake coupling and that he strangled Wendy Von Huben, 16, about
eight hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Howell's body was found on March 23, 1997, on tracks running
through Belleview -- a central Florida town about halfway between
Tampa and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a search team following Resendiz's directions found
skeletal remains wrapped in a blanket and camouflage jacket about
15 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   DNA taken from Von Huben's family will be compared to the
remains to help identify the body, Major Patti Lumpkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz told Lumpkin and Detective Jeff Owens that the two
teen-agers were the first of 11 people he has admitted to killing
in Florida, Texas, Illinois and Kentucky. Most of the killings took
place on or near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz was sentenced to death in Texas two months ago for the
1998 murder of a Houston-area physician.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican drifter became the prime suspect in the Florida
slayings early this year after Owens sent him a letter inquiring
about Howell's death and Von Huben's disappearance. In a return
letter, Resendiz said he killed a man and teen-age girl and gave
investigators information about the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz told investigators he believed the couple were
anti-Christians, Lumpkin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he met Howell and Von Huben on March 23, 1997, the day
of Howell's killing, at a switching station near Jacksonville. The
couple decided to catch a ride with Resendiz in a grain car to find
work picking oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz said that he and Howell left the car when the train
stopped at a switching station and that he killed him with a broken
air brake coupling, a three-foot long rubber hose with brass
fittings on each end. He said he returned to the car, and after
several miles, ordered Von Huben out. Then, he said, he strangled
the teen, wrapped her in a blanket and clothes and covered her body
with leaves.

<HEADLINE> Meca-Medina first in NJ marathon swim, disabled team fourth in relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - David Meca-Medina, of Barcelona,
finished first in the grueling Atlantic City Ocean Marathon Swim on
Saturday, finishing the 22 &AMP;frac12;-mile trip nearly one hour slower than
his finish last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meca-Medina completed the swim around Absecon Island in seven
hours, 40 minutes and 15 seconds. His time in last year's Around
the Island Swim was six hours, 56 minutes and 43 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad. I'm happy, especially today because conditions were
not perfect,'' Meca-Medina said after the race. ''It had been
raining, the water was cold and it was very, very choppy the first
half in the swim,'' he said of his slower finish.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Lecat, of Paris, finished second overall in the swim,
with a time of eight hours, four minutes and 18 seconds. In third
place was Andre Wilde, of Rostock, Germany, who finished the swim
in eight hours, four minutes and 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, Regan Scheiber, of Mukilteo, Wash., finished in
eight hours, ten minutes and 32 seconds. Scheiber's time was
seventh overall in the race. Behind her and eighth overall was
Angela Mauer, of Wiesbaden, Germany, who finished in eight hours,
11 minutes and two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Chabotar, of Egg Harbor Township, finished fourth among
women with a time of eight hours, 22 minutes and 58 seconds. She
finished 13th overall.
</P>
<P>
   The disabled relay team, meantime, finished fourth in the relay
event. Their time was 10 hours, 12 minutes and 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The race began in 1954 as a $200 bet between two lifeguards.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. troops launched a rescue mission Saturday
that freed all 222 peacekeepers and 11 military observers trapped by rebels
inside a U.N. base in eastern Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said. In a rare
display of force, the operation began about 6 a.m. in Kailahun, about 200 miles

Republican presidential nominee met at the Governor's Mansion with former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is heading the search for a vice presidential
candidate. Bush said he still does not know if an announcement will come before
the Republican National Convention, which starts July 31 in Philadelphia. Bush
said Saturday's meeting with Cheney was the only one planned for the weekend.
Potential candidates have been quizzed extensively and given detailed
questionnaires that asked, among other things, for financial and health records.

   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- John O. Pastore, a former Rhode Island governor
and U.S. senator who made his mark with a gift for oratory, died Saturday of
kidney failure at age 93. The son of Italian immigrants, Pastore, a Democrat
became one of the most respected senators ever produced by Rhode Island. His
political career included four years as the state's governor and 25 years in the
Senate -- the first Italian-American to serve in either role. Pastore's speaking
skills got national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 1964
Democratic National Convention. Pastore launched a scathing attack on Lyndon
Johnson's Republican rival, U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, and his fire and
eloquence earned him a standing ovation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keith Highet, a lawyer who handled more cases
before the International Court of Justice at The Hague than any
other American lawyer, died Wednesday of complications from
esophageal cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Highet was serving as counsel to the
governments of Indonesia and Cameroon in cases pending before the
international court. Earlier this year, he was a member of a
committee of international law experts appointed to advise the
prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina on fighting corruption in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oxford, England, Highet earned a bachelor's degree magna
cum laude from Harvard in 1954 and then entered the Marine Corps.
After his discharge, he was a Fulbright Fellow, studying at Balliol
College at Oxford University, and then earned a degree from the
Harvard Law School in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote chapters in 13 books on international law and more than
30 articles.
Tomislav Karadjordjevic:
</P>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Prince Tomislav Karadjordjevic, the
brother of Yugoslavia's last monarch who spent much of his life in
exile during communist rule but returned home in 1991, died
Wednesday after a long battle with cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Tomislav died at the royal family's ancestral home of
Oplenac, 40 miles south of Belgrade, where he has lived since
returning to Yugoslavia shortly after the communist-era ban was
lifted on members of the exiled dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken prince, brother of King Peter, fled with his
family from Nazi forces at the outset of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When the communists under President Josiz Broz took over after
the war, they abolished the monarchy, and the Karadjordjevic family
remained in exile. Tomislav owned and ran a fruit farm in Sussex,
England.
Alice Lord-Landon:
</P>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Alice Lord-Landon, a pioneer in
women's swimming and a one-time world record holder in the
400-meter freestyle, died Thursday following a brief illness. She
was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Lord-Landon was a member of the first women's Olympic swimming
team in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Lord-Landon was recognized as a ''Pioneer Swimmer and
Contributor'' and inducted into the International Swimming Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Lord-Landon became famous for a nine-mile swim across
Long Island Sound. At 17, she joined the Women's Swimming
Association of New York. She set a world record in the 400-yard
freestyle relay in four minutes, 59 seconds, the first woman to
break five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't win a medal at the Olympics. But she did strike up an
Olympic romance with track and field medalist Dick Landon, who she
married two years later. She and her husband lobbied Olympic
officials to allow more women to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 she led U.S. athletes in the opening procession at the
Los Angeles Olympics in a reproduction of her 1920 uniform.
John Pastore:
</P>
<P>
   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Former Sen. John O. Pastore, a
fixture in Rhode Island and national politics for five decades,
died Saturday of kidney failure. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore, a Democrat, died at a nursing home where he was being
treated for Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the Senate in 1950 after five years as
governor, and served until his retirement in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore was the child of Italian immigrants. His father died
when he was 9 and his mother supported her five children by working
as a seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way through high school, college and law school,
and went on to serve as a state representative, assistant attorney
general, lieutenant governor, governor, and finally the nation's
first Italian-American senator.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Peterson:
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Helen W. Peterson, an American Indian
activist who lobbied Congress for reform in the 1950s and '60s, has
died. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson died July 10 in a Vancouver, Wash., nursing home of
complications related to Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pine Ridge, S.D., on Aug. 2, 1915, Peterson, an Oglala
Sioux, held positions of power at a time when it wasn't common for
women or American Indians to do so.
</P>
<P>
   From 1954 to 1962, Peterson was executive director of the
National Congress of the American Indian, a lobbying organization
formed by tribal leaders. She later served as one of the
highest-ranking officials in the federal Indian Affairs Commission,
a forerunner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts were needed most in the 1950s, when Congress passed
a bill aimed at terminating all the nation's tribes and selling
their reservation lands.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson organized tribal leaders to fight the policy, planning
voting drives to elect Democrats sympathetic to the tribes' cause.
The termination policy was reversed, and many tribes regained
federal recognition in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is probably one of the most prominent Indian women leaders
in this century,'' said the Rev. Ramona Rank, a Klamath Indian and
associate minister at Augustan Lutheran Church in Portland. ''She
was an advocate for Native American rights long before the civil
rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in
Portland until retiring in 1985. She also founded the Church of the
Four Winds, an ecumenical Christian ministry for urban Indians.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Exchange Names For Reunions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea on Sunday
exchanged the names of 200 candidates who want to be reunited with
their relatives in August after a half century of separation.
</P>
<P>
   After checking the availability of survivors for reunions, the
Koreas will whittle down the lists to 100 and exchange them on June
26. The successful candidates will be allowed to cross the border
on Aug. 15 for three days of visits.
</P>
<P>
   The family reunions are one of the tangible results of the
first-ever inter-Korea summit in June, during which South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il pledged
to work together for national reconciliation and unification.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have since stopped propaganda broadcasts directed at
each other. The North's leader, Kim Jong il, even agreed to make a
visit to South Korea at a date to be fixed later.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first round of family reunions since 1985 when 50
people from each side were allowed to cross the border for visits
with their relatives. Efforts to arrange more reunions failed
because of political tensions.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million people fled North Korea during the Korean
conflict and settled in South Korea. The Korean border is the
world's most heavily fortified and there is no telephone, mail and
other direct means of communications between them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, South Korea's Red Cross used a computer
lottery to select 400 candidates out of 75,000 names they have
registered since the 1980s. The number was halved after they sorted
out those who have died, are ill or too weak to endure the physical
and emotional stress of the journey to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200 candidates, 162 are 70 or older, the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   The family reunions are linked with South Korea's promise to
repatriate several dozen convicted North Korean spies in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seoul officials, there are 83 convicted North
Korean spies in South Korea, 59 of whom want to go home to the
North. The communist spies are free after serving long prison terms
but cannot leave the country without government approval.

that freed all 222 peacekeepers and 11 military observers trapped by rebels
inside a U.N. base in eastern Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said. In a rare
display of force, the operation began about 6 a.m. in Kailahun, about 200 miles
east of Freetown, when helicopters picked up the military observers. Rebels
fired at U.N. troops and British military Chinook helicopters supporting the
mission, said a senior peacekeeping officer, Indian Maj. Anthanarayan Arun.

Bush: Close To Picking Running Mate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said Saturday he is getting closer
to picking a running mate but declined to detail the contenders. The likely
Republican presidential nominee met at the Governor's Mansion with former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is heading the search for a vice presidential
candidate. Bush said he still does not know if an announcement will come before
the Republican National Convention, which starts July 31 in Philadelphia. Bush
said Saturday's meeting with Cheney was the only one planned for the weekend.
Potential candidates have been quizzed extensively and given detailed
questionnaires that asked, among other things, for financial and health records.

Reports: 13 More Killed in Algeria
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ongoing violence in Algeria has left 13 people,
including a family of four, dead over the past several days, national newspapers
reported Saturday. Despite a peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
Islamic insurgents continue to carry out daily attacks in this North African
nation. Violence broke out 1992, when the army canceled legislative elections
the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. More than 100,000
people have been killed in the eight years of fighting since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- More bodies washed ashore after a boat
carrying Guatemalan refugees trying to reach the United States sank
off Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing the death toll to 22 people.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Notimex news agency said four bodies were
discovered in a lagoon on the Gulf of Tehuantepec on Saturday.
Eighteen bodies had been recovered earlier, according to Mario
Perez Noalso, the National Immigration Institute chief for Oaxaca
state.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor, Miguel Juan Francisco, told Notimex he and
the others boarded the boat before dawn Thursday near the
Mexico-Guatemala border and were caught by a storm Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said 18 of the bodies had already been buried in a local
cemetery due to the decomposition of the bodies. He said Guatemalan
Embassy officials had not arrived to claim them, according to

<HEADLINE> Philippines Bombing Kills Two  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) -- A powerful homemade bomb exploded
in a crowded market in the southern Philippines on Sunday, killing
two people and wounding 33 others, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast ripped through the public market on the main shopping
day of the week in the town of Kabacan in North Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, improvised from a 81mm mortar shell, was apparently
planted by Muslim rebels from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
military spokesman Captain Noel Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 33 wounded were in serious condition and were being
treated in various hospitals, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the attack appeared to be in response to a call by MILF
chief Salamat Hashim for a jihad, or holy war, against the
government. Most of the MILF's camps, including its headquarters,
Camp Abubakar, have been seized by the military since April, when
the government of President Joseph Estrada launched an offensive
against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb explosion was the fourth in North Cotabato since April.
</P>
<P>
   Kabacan Mayor Wilfredo Bacada condemned the bomb attack and
challenged the MILF to target the military instead of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF is the larger of two groups fighting for an independent
Islamic state in the impoverished southern Philippines. The smaller
and more extreme Abu Sayyaf is holding about 38 hostages, including
many foreigners, on Jolo island at the country's southern tip.

<HEADLINE> 11 Dead in Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Christians and Muslims waged fierce
street battles in the Maluku islands, leaving at least 11 people
dead, hospital officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One of those killed was a pregnant mother sheltering inside her
house when a mortar round crashed through the window of her home
and exploded Saturday, said Risad, an official from the Protestant
Church Hospital in the region's main city of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
   He said four Christians and seven Muslims were killed, and
hundreds of houses and a church were burned in fighting that
continued through Saturday night and into Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Risad said that despite the declaration of a state of emergency
in the region, the military were incapable of stopping the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please tell the United Nations to help us,'' he said in a
phone interview from Ambon. ''They are the only ones who can stop
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Risad, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, accused
certain sections of the armed forces of taking sides in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the Muslim militants were carrying army-issue
assault rifles and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Another hospital worker, Paing Suryaman, said gunfire continued
to echo across the war-ravaged town on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the security forces had deployed hundreds of heavily
armed police officers and soldiers to the most violent areas in the
town to try to quell the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4,000 people have died in 18 months of intercommunal
violence in the Malukus.
</P>
<P>
   The religious fighting has already spread to Sulawesi island and
there are fears that it could expand to other areas of this vast
archipelagic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials in Jakarta have recently accused
supporters of Indonesia's former dictator Suharto of inciting
fighting in the Malukus in an attempt to destabilize President
Abdurrahman Wahid's eight-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Jakarta Post newspaper on Saturday,
Indonesia's Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono accused Muslim
militants of stoking the sectarian war in Indonesia's Maluku
islands, saying that 10,000 paramilitaries had infiltrated the
province in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to an armed Muslim militia whose leaders have
vowed to rid the islands of Christians. Most members come from
Indonesia's central island of Java and its leaders are supporters
of former dictator Suharto.

<HEADLINE> Merlino's mother says son victim of ''vendetta''  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The feisty mother of reputed mob boss Joseph
''Skinny Joey'' Merlino says she is outraged over the treatment of
her son, who she says is the victim of a government ''vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Merlino blasted prosecutors and prison officials from her
South Philadelphia rowhouse, saying her son has been held in
isolation since June 29 at the federal detention center awaiting
trial on racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not looking for sympathy,'' she told The Philadelphia
Inquirer for Sunday's editions, speaking out for the first time
about the case against her son. ''All I'm asking is that he be
treated fairly and be allowed to prepare for his trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Merlino, unlike his six co-defendants, is locked in an
8-by-10-foot cell 24 hours a day, with no access to radio or
television, unable to get books, newspapers, or magazines, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't even have a toothbrush,'' his mother said.
''Charles Manson is treated better.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlino is allowed to use the phone only to call his attorney
and no visitors other than legal counsel. And, he cannot meet with
his co-defendants unless each defendant's attorney is present, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Merlino said she doesn't want to discuss the charges, and
said her son's guilt or innocence will be decided by a jury. But
she called federal prosecutors petty and arrogant, more concerned
about winning than about justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Merlino's mother got into a shoving and shouting
match with FBI agents during her son's arrest at a Margate, N.J.,
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked to see the warrant,'' she said. ''They gave it to me,
then ripped it out of my hands.'' She called that another example
of overreaction by a government that she said has a ''vendetta''
against her son.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say Merlino is being held in ''administrative
detention,'' allowed out of his cell one hour a day for recreation,
said Wade Houk, acting executive assistant at the 628-cell facility
that opened last month to hold prisoners awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino, 38, was placed in solitary confinement pending
classification by the Bureau of Prisons, Houk said. An
administrative hearing will be held this week at which Merlino can
argue about his status, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are evaluating him now to determine whether he can be
safely housed in one of the units,'' Houk said. Merlino's reputed
status will be a factor, along with past problems he may have had
with any inmate and his impact on the center's safety and security,
Houk said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino's attorney, Edwin Jacobs Jr., said the classification
issue is a ploy to punish his client and derail the defense in a
racketeering case against Merlino and 10 reputed associates. Seven
of the defendants, including Merlino, have been ordered held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs pointed out that prior to Merlino's transfer to the
Federal Detention Center, he was housed in the general prison
population at Fairton, N.J. and at two other facilities in which he
was temporarily housed.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' may boost efforts to help swordfish  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The movie ''The Perfect Storm'' recounts the
final voyage of the vessel Andrea Gail, sunk by a ferocious storm
after venturing far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists hope the film will also focus attention on what
sent the ship 1,500 miles off the New England coast: the depleted
swordfish population.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of the film was fortuitous,'' said Vikki Spruill,
executive director of SeaWeb, a conservation group running a
public-education campaign around the movie. ''We're trying to use
the film to draw attention to this larger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans, said swordfishing is a
victim of its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand we have this tremendous appetite for seafood,
which creates a high price,'' Saxton said. ''At the same time we've
developed technologies that allow us to find the fish in a
scientific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Worry over swordfish depletion is being addressed on several
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists eagerly anticipate an Aug. 1 ruling by the
National Marine Fisheries Service that may close almost 200,000
square miles in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico to ''pelagic
longline'' fishing, a highly successful but indiscriminate
technique by which miles of hooked and baited fishing lines are
suspended at a predetermined depth.
</P>
<P>
   SeaWeb, through its ''Perfect Storm'' education campaign,
supports the proposal because it would protect swordfish nursery
areas. ''The overarching problem is we're catching swordfish before
they've had a chance to reproduce,'' Spruill said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service also plans to implement
reduced quotas recommended late last year by the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The lower quotas
will be enforced over the next three fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trusts, which created SeaWeb, recently formed
the Pew Oceans Commission, which will spend 18 months studying
issues including overfishing. Its chairman is New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   And in Congress, competing bills by Saxton and Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., each would create a voluntary buyback program to encourage
swordfish and tuna longliners to give up their permits in exchange
for up to $450,000 in compensation from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Water Fishermen's Association, which represents
commercial fishermen, favors the Breaux bill because it would focus
specifically on the several dozen ships that will be directly
affected by the closure of swordfish nursery areas. Some
environmental groups prefer Saxton's broader approach.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing advocates say they support most efforts to
boost the swordfish population through quotas and other
regulations, as long as they are applied fairly to all countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Common sense says nobody wants to fish themselves out of
business,'' said Linda Candler, vice president of communications
for the National Fisheries Institute, which represents commercial
fishermen and others in the seafood industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ''The Perfect Storm,'' author Sebastian Junger
details the pressures and challenges facing commercial fishermen
since the introduction in the early 1960s of longlining.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Junger wrote, ''the gold rush was on'' as
fisherman used satellite navigation and electronic fish finders, as
well as new monofilament that made it possible to set 30 to 40
miles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government took a series of steps, first requiring
longliners to acquire permits, then implementing a quota in 1991
for U.S.-licensed sword boats that closed swordfishing season as
soon as the target was reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the Natural Resources Defense Council still considers
swordfish ''severely depleted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal has been to help rebuild this fishery and restore it
to health,'' said Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney with the council.
''That way everyone can benefit, (including) consumers, commercial
fishermen and recreational fishermen.''

<HEADLINE> Vatican Discloses Papal Intervention  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LES COMBES, Italy (AP) -- Pope John Paul II personally intervened
with Italian authorities to gain the release last month of the
Turkish gunman who sought to kill him in 1981, a Vatican spokesman
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul wrote to Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi asking
for a ''gesture of clemency'' for Mehmet Ali Agca, who was serving
a life sentence in Italy for shooting the pope during a public
appearance in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's interest in Agca's release was known, but the
disclosure by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls was the first
confirmation that the pope himself had been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Since Agca's release June 13 and his extradition to Turkey to
serve a sentence in another case, Agca, in a bizarre outburst, has
accused the Vatican of being ''the enemy of God'' and humanity, and
urged that John Paul resign.
</P>
<P>
   Agca shouted the comments July 10 as he was being transferred to
an Istanbul courtroom where he is being tried for a 1979 armed
robbery of a factory. He is also serving a 10-year sentence in
Turkey for killing a newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls said the Vatican would not respond to the
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no point in adding to his efforts for
self-publicity,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether John Paul regretted his request to the Italian
president in light of Agca's comments, the Vatican spokesman said,
''I never heard him say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls is accompanying the pope during his 13-day
vacation in this hamlet in the Italian Alps near France.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul made the only scheduled public appearance of his
vacation Sunday, addressing and blessing some 4,000 pilgrims and
vacationers gathered on a plateau looking out on Mount Blanc, the
highest mountain in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The frail, 80-year-old pope was in good form. He walked briskly
with the help of a cane, spoke in a strong voice and lingered for
30 minutes to bless babies and greet local dignitaries.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Economic Talks With China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Russia will study China's economic reforms and
wants to expand anemic trade and cooperation between the two
nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview
broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who arrives in Beijing on Monday for a state visit, said
closer economic ties will play a prominent part in the development
by Russia and China of their ''strategic partnership,'' a rubric
describing efforts by the former communist antagonists to boost
contacts and coordinate their international relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on state-run China Central Television, Putin
said China's tax reforms and efforts to remove bureaucratic
obstacles could be applicable to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While economic cooperation is developing rapidly, the potential
is ''far from being fully tapped,'' Putin said. He also pledged to
improve Russia's attractions as a destination for foreign
investors, including those from China.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia have urged stepped-up trade to lend backbone to
their growing closeness in international affairs. But the volume of
trade remains low apart from China's large-scale purchases of
Russian fighter planes, submarines and other armaments to modernize
its enormous but antiquated military.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's visit, his first to China since becoming president,
underscores efforts by the neighbors to coordinate challenges to
what they consider U.S. domination of the world. The two leaders
met for the first time earlier this month in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia shares strategic partnership with China and puts
relations with Beijing among priorities of its foreign policy,''
Putin said in the interview with CCTV.
</P>
<P>
   The China-Russia partnership will become the ''most important
factor in maintaining global stability and peace'' in this century,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with Chinese officials
in Beijing over the weekend to put finishing touches on documents
to be signed during the visit, including one that condemns U.S.
plans for a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia have stridently condemned the U.S. plan, which
would violate the 28-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. China
considers the shield plan an attempt to blunt its small nuclear
deterrent, and both China and Russia have warned that the shield's
deployment would spark a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Jiang will also preside over the signing of agreements
on education, banking and a feasibility study for a pipeline to
bring Siberian gas to China.
</P>
<P>
   In an account of the interview released by the Kremlin's news
service, Putin said China stands in the ''first rank'' of Asian
countries with which Russia wants to develop relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''China is a rapidly developing state, while Russia is a vast
power with its own advantages, often unique ones, which makes the
people of Russia and China natural partners,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the CCTV broadcast of their growing ties, Putin said
he becomes ''even more confident'' of their development when he
hears Jiang speak Russian and sing Russian songs. Jiang, a
Russian-trained engineer, frequently tries to charm foreign
visitors by quoting speeches or singing tunes in their native
languages.

<HEADLINE> Small Fire Ignited in White House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- A construction crew performing repairs to
the East Wing of the White House ignited a small fire Sunday, but
there was little damage, a White House spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Paint debris from an exterior shutter caught fire as workers
were using a torch to burn off old paint, spokeswoman Nanda Chitre
said from the White House office near Camp David, Md., where
President Clinton is meeting with Middle East leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The material smoldered, but no flames erupted, Chitre said.
</P>
<P>
   Three fire trucks responded, she said. The fire did not spread
and was quickly extinguished. There was no estimate of damage, but
workers were able to resume work almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The East Wing contains the first family's living quarters as
well as public areas such as the ornate East Room, where White
House press conferences are often held, and the display room for
two centuries of White House china.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-year-old building has withstood two major fires. Much of
the interior of the building was burned by the British in 1814. In
1929, while Herbert Hoover was president, a fire damaged the West
Wing, which holds the Oval Office and the business offices of the
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Army Weighs More Physical Training  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army gets enlistees who can't do a sit-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very common. They can't do sit-ups. None. I could not
believe it when I saw it,'' said Staff Sgt. Terry J. Dokey, who was
a drill instructor at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   After the drill sergeants are through with them, the recruits
will meet or beat the minimum physical requirements, said Dokey,
now at the Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Va., as
the Army's 1999 Drill Sergeant of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But the enlistees must overcome the effects of too little
physical education in public schools, and too much easy modern
living. In fact, Army training experts wonder if even the Army's
standards have gotten too soft, and fail to prepare troops
adequately for combat.
</P>
<P>
   They are testing a new regimen based on the Army's 1946 fitness
manual. If it works, recruits will be training more intensively.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Army's problem is in the poor physical condition of
young Americans in general, said Stephen E. Van Camp, chief of
doctrines at the Army Physical Fitness School in Fort Benning, Ga.
''There is a high incidence of low fitness and obesity,'' he said.
''There are pockets of good attitude toward physical fitness, but
in general it's not a great priority.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a longstanding problem, said researcher John F. Patton,
chief of the military performance division at the Army Research
Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass. A comparison of
aerobic and strength abilities of incoming soldiers in 1978 and
1998 showed little if any change, he said. Similarly, the troops
had approximately equal improvements at the end of Basic Training,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness is a great priority in the military, of course. Each
soldier must meet a minimum for his or her sex and age. A 17- to
21-year-old male, for instance, must do 35 push-ups in 2 minutes,
47 sit-ups in 2 minutes, and run 2 miles in 16 minutes, 36 seconds
or less, Dokey said. A female of similar age must do at least 13
push-ups and 47 sit-ups in her 2 minutes, and run 2 miles in 19
minutes, 42 seconds or less.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements become somewhat more stringent after Basic
Training. The Army wants troops to continue physical training and
to improve. Soldiers test their fitness twice a year throughout
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Army Basic Training begins with a diagnostic test to separate
the fit, the adequate and the poor. Each group gets a different
training intensity, so all should emerge better than they entered.
Trainers generally alternate days that focus more on strength
training, such as push-ups, with days that focus more on endurance,
such as running, Dokey said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts at Fort Benning want to change this. They think the
current standard owes more to the health-club approach of aerobics
and weight training than it does to the needs of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Running is a case in point, said Frank Palkoska of the Fitness
School. Aerobic endurance is good, but combat is largely anaerobic
-- a sprinting activity, not a distance run, he said. ''We probably
don't need to be running as much as we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, sloppy calisthenics -- unfortunately common in today's
PT -- is no substitute for teaching swift, precise body control that
can be needed in real fighting, he said. Troops need more
gymnastics-style movements, and activities that prepare them for
close-quarters combat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitness School is seeing if its ideas work in Basic, in a
pilot study being set up at Fort Jackson, S.C. The test program
includes ideas from the Army's 1946 training manual, such as group
activities with heavy medicine balls to teach troops how to control
objects.
</P>
<P>
   However, people entering the Army in those days often were in
better shape to start with -- used to hard physical work on the farm
or in the factory, Van Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are risks in ramping up physical activity among the
unfit. Other military researchers fear injury rates may rise. ''I
have mixed feelings, because I'm on the protect-your-people side,''
said Dr. John W. Gardner, an Army colonel at the Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The solution may be in making the improvements more gradual,
Gardner said. The military may have to increase its commitment to
continuing physical training in the specialty schools where new
soldiers learn their military jobs, he said.

<HEADLINE> HIV-Infected Parents Studied  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Susan Gutierrez had just overcome a 13-year
addiction to heroin in 1995 when she tested positive for the virus
that causes AIDS. Despite the risks and challenges, she decided to
start a new life and family.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughters, 2-year-old Ryanna and 6-month-old Rebecca, tested
negative for the virus, but Gutierrez discovered that raising
healthy children presents unique social, financial and emotional
hardships in the uncertainty of a parent's HIV diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it difficult on and off. It's not an everyday thing
that I stress over, but it's an on-and-off thing,'' said the
37-year-old Glendale mother who was laid off recently from a
secretarial job. ''I just trusted in God.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released June 29 details the challenges faced by the
62,800 HIV-positive Americans who have children under age 18. An
estimated 120,000 children have a parent infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show the need for new support systems and programs
as the disease increasingly affects the poor, minorities and women,
said study co-author Mark Schuster of Rand Institute, an
independent research center based in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these families could use more assistance,'' said
Schuster, a pediatrician at the University of California, Los
Angeles. ''This is going to grow. The epidemic is spreading at a
faster rate among women, and it is also spreading faster among
heterosexual men.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the medical risks, 12 percent of the women -- like
Gutierrez -- give birth to at least one child after diagnosis. About
14 percent of those children test HIV positive, according to the
Rand-UCLA study.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, who has not shown the symptoms of full-blown AIDS,
and her healthy children can rely on support from family members --
her husband and older sister, for instance. And her medication is
paid for by Medi-Cal, the state's health program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   For many women in the same situation, help from friends and
family is not available.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 20 percent of HIV-positive parents reported
having no close friends and 16 percent said they saw other family
members only once a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents also were at an advanced stage of the illness.
About 21 percent said they required hospitalization during the
previous six months and 18 percent needed home health care.
Forty-five percent showed symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen percent said they went without medical care at least
once in the past six months because they needed money for food,
clothing and housing, while 8 percent went without the necessities
because they needed money for health care.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 28 percent of HIV-positive adults have children under
the age of 18. Of those, 60 percent are women and 18 percent are
men. Seventy-six percent of the women and 34 percent of the men
said they cared for the children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in July's American Journal of Public
Health, was sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews took place in 1996 and 1997, and included 2,864
adults receiving health care for HIV infection. The data are part
of the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study, the first
wide-ranging survey of HIV patients on a nationwide scale.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, new medications have decreased death rates,
and infected parents can spend more time with their children, said
Carol Levine, director of the Families and Health Care Project at
the United Hospital Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's providing the opportunity for children to have their
parents for longer times,'' she said. ''But it's also creating a
situation where it's very difficult to keep the quality of life at
what it should be for a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine applauded the research, saying it provides new
information for policy-makers. ''It really lays out the picture of
how many of the HIV infected people are parents and how that sets
the parameters for what we need to be doing,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Fires in Greece Under Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Firefighters brought under control Sunday
nearly all the fires that had been raging throughout the country,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the big fires, which had been burning out of
control for days, were in the region of Corinth -- 50 miles
southwest of the capital -- where a state of emergency was still in
effect. Though fires were under control, authorities were on alert
in case they were rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   Experts started cataloguing the amount of damage done to forest,
farm land, homes and livestock, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country fires were still burning, but they
were now under control and were expected to be extinguished by the
end of the day, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's 6,000-strong firefighting force has fought more than
1,100 fires since the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
   They fought the blazes with help from foreign aircraft sent
Friday by Israel, the Czech Republic and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli crew, consisting of a C-130 transport plane, two
helicopters and 50 members of the air force, were scheduled to
leave Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a Canadair CL-215 aircraft slammed into a mountain
on the east coast of Greece, killing both Greek air force pilots,
as they were fighting a blaze 200 miles northeast of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Greece uses about 10 helicopters and 30 airplanes for
firefighting, most of them Canadair seaplanes which replenish their
water supply to fight fires by skimming over the water while a
trapdoor opens to take in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Rain was forecast for much of Greece starting Monday, but
officials said conditions would remain hazardous over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Stage Sit-In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Leaders of Iran's largest student group
began a sit-in outside the parliament buildings Sunday to protest
the acquittal of police forces on charges of storming a student
hostel last July.
</P>
<P>
   Eight leaders of the pro-reform Office for Fostering Unity sat
on blankets in front of the reformist-dominated parliament, or
Majlis, to demand justice and denounce the ''judiciary's
double-standard practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would continue the sit-in for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hold our sit-in protest outside the judiciary's
building because we have given up any hope of justice from it. We
are protesting the judiciary's double-standard practices and
injustices against the students,'' Akbar Atri, one of the eight
student leaders, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a military court acquitted former Tehran police
chief Brig. Gen. Farhad Nazari and 17 of his subordinates of
storming a Tehran University dormitory. Two other policemen were
convicted in the trial, one for taking part in the July 1999 raid
and another for stealing from the hostel.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-dawn raid left one student dead and at least 20 injured.
The brutality of the raid caused a public outcry and triggered the
biggest demonstrations seen in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict also drew criticism from the Islamic Iran
Participation Front, Iran's largest reformist party, which accused
the judiciary Saturday of sacrificing justice for political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, hard-liners, who control the judiciary, have closed
19 newspapers and magazines, most of them pro-reform, and ordered
the arrest of several leading journalists and political activists.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Spain Ferry Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) -- Two ferries sailing in early morning fog
collided Sunday, killing six North Africans heading home for summer
vacation and injuring 18, Spanish authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A ship bringing trucks to the port of Algeciras rammed the
starboard side of a ferry that had left Algeciras for Tangiers,
Morocco, gouging a hole in the hull next to passenger lounge below
deck.
</P>
<P>
   All of the deaths, including three children, were on the ship
leaving Algeciras. That ferry was carrying 290 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the death toll was given as five but authorities later
found a woman's body floating near the collision site two miles off
the Tarifa area of Spain's southern coast. Tarifa is 10 miles
southwest of the port of Algeciras.
</P>
<P>
   At no point was either ship in danger of sinking, said Salvador
Melero, civil protection director for southern Cadiz province.
</P>
<P>
   Both ships went to Algeciras as authorities investigated the
accident. Melero said fog appeared to have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of North Africans living in Europe
converge on Algeciras every summer to take ferries home for
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   July is one of the busiest months for ship traffic, with about
50 vessels leaving Algeciras every day for Tangiers and other
points in North Africa, port officials say.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees Chinese Tourist-Traders  </HEADLINE>
By ANATOLY MEDETSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) -- Like most of the Chinese tourists who
pour across the border every day, Piao Ming Yu would be
hard-pressed to name any of the sights in Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she arrives in the Far East city, Piao takes up her
post behind a market stand, selling cheap denim dresses from her
homeland, even though the Russian stamp in her passport says she's
a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old doesn't come to Vladivostok to relax. She's here
to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to find a job in China,'' Piao says through a
translator. ''And trade here is better than at home.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Migration Service, Chinese make up the
biggest group of foreign citizens in Russia, though no numbers are
available because, in part, many enter the country illegally. Most
of the Chinese are concentrated in Far East cities like
Vladivostok, 4,000 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, about 30,000 Chinese tourists are in Russia's
Far East, the migration service said. In Ussuriysk, just north of
Vladivostok, they've congregated in a small Chinatown, with its own
hotels, casinos, and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials complain that while the Chinese are engaged in
successful trade in Russia, none of their profits find their way
into the local economy. Instead, they say, the money ends up back
in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such economic expansion is observed throughout the entire
Russian Far East,'' said Sergei Pushkaryov, chief of the region's
migration service branch. ''All the profit is theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides selling cheap clothing, toys and other consumer goods,
Chinese tourists are increasingly involved in illegal timber and
scrap metal exports through elaborate trading networks, said Pavel
Gladkikh, a migration service official.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Chinese businessmen hire unemployed countrymen and
send them to Russia as tourists. Afterward, they ship containers of
goods for the tourists to sell on the Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Receipts from the sales go to firms that the same businessmen
establish in Russia. The money is then used to buy timber and scrap
metal. They then create Russian shell companies to send the
shipments across the border to China.
</P>
<P>
   The shell companies then dissolve before it's time to pay
Russian taxes, Gladkikh said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the 80,000 Chinese who entered and left Russia
legally since the start of 1999 make a living in such schemes,
migration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese tourists also repair shoes, work at construction sites,
farms, and restaurants and camp out to pick ferns and ginseng or
hunt frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A group of tourists comes in and goes straight to a
construction site,'' Pushkaryov said. ''It leaves 30 days later and
another group comes in to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   The migration service says that the Russian Far East has also
become a magnet for Chinese trying to reach the West. In 1997,
border guards nabbed 18 would-be migrants hidden behind crates of
goods at a checkpoint, Pushkaryov said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that there are groups here that facilitate
relocation,'' he said. ''A (tourist) group comes in and registers
at a hotel. The next day it may vanish forever.''

<HEADLINE> Tight power supplies bring high prices and criticism  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's newly deregulated electricity
system is getting a test by fire this summer amid higher demand,
tight supplies and dramatic spikes in some market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect to meet the need for power during this peak
season. But fluctuating wholesale prices affect bills paid by
millions of New York City-area residents. As state officials
scramble to alleviate the supply-and-demand problem, they face
accusations that government policies deserve some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blind faith in the market without any protections is not
smart,'' said Dale Bryk of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Volatile markets were a less visible issue before New York began
deregulating electricity. Utilities mostly relied on their own
generating plants and retail prices were set under multi-year
settlements with state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the phase-in of open electricity markets, most
utilities in New York sold their generating plants. Utilities now
rely on long-term contracts for a large portion of their power
needs. Since December, utilities have been making additional spot
purchases from generators through a wholesale market run by the New
York Independent System Operator (ISO).
</P>
<P>
   Like any commodity market, ISO prices fluctuate. Prices in the
''day-ahead'' market for the Hudson Valley one day last week went
from $15.12 per megawatt hour in the low-demand hours before dawn
to $71.06 during the afternoon peak-demand period. Such price
swings are normal.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers were surprised when some market prices peaked
above $1,000 per megawatt hour recently. Higher fuel prices and
tight supplies have been cited as the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most upstate residents have not been affected by the market
fluctuations because their utility either continues to have a
multi-year rate plan or is able to rely on its own plants for
power. Consolidated Edison in New York City and Orange &AMP; Rockland
in the northern suburbs do ''pass through'' those costs to
residential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An O&AMP;R spokesman said many residential bills were still lower
last month than in June 1999 because of decreased usage. But this
has become a charged political issue in New York City, where the
supply problems are acute and there have been reports that
electricity prices could rise as high as 30 percent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO this month instituted a temporary $1,300 per megawatt
hour cap on prices that it will accept for electricity. But that is
widely seen as a Band-Aid solution to the supply-and-demand problem
- particularly with energy demands expected to increase in New York
state in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service Commission Chairwoman Maureen Helmer, the state's
top utility regulator, says New York needs more power plants to
meet demand. She told a hearing in New York City last week that new
plants would ''place downward pressure in prices and increase
reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   The last major power plant to go on line in New York was Nine
Mile Point 2, which began producing power in 1988. A state siting
board this June approved a proposal by PG&AMP;E Generating to construct
a 1,080-megawatt power plant near the Hudson River in Greene
County. If it receives final approval from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, it could be producing power by summer 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other power plant proposals are under review by state
regulators, some in preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say a building binge is not a complete answer to the
state's power woes.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy
Project, said state regulators should have foreseen the
supply-and-demand problem and taken steps to protect consumers from
price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Bryk said the state should again institute financial incentives
to promote energy efficient buildings and appliances, thereby
reducing demand.
</P>
<P>
   PSC officials counter that they are taking aggressive steps to
handle short-term supply problems, including the support of energy
efficiency programs. They also are considering applying some of the
proceeds from the sale of Con Ed's power plants to reduce
customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will attempt to ameliorate these increases as best we
can,'' Helmer said last week, ''recognizing that they are likely to
diminish after the peak season.''

<HEADLINE> State struggles with soaring Canada goose population  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The population of Canada geese in New Jersey has
doubled in the
past decade, giving the state the highest density of the birds
among the 17 East Coast states in the Atlantic Flyway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   State figures reported in Sunday's editions of The Philadelphia
Inquirer show about 82,000 resident Canada geese in New Jersey, or
11 birds per square mile. In winter, that population can grow as
high as 280,000.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are struggling to manage the population, which has
become an increasing nuisance and possible health threat. The state
Department of Environmental Protection would like to reduce the
number of geese to 41,000, or 5.5 per square mile.
</P>
<P>
   A single goose leaves behind about 1&AMP;frac12; pounds of feces each day,
according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Fecal
coliform traced to geese and other waterfowl has closed beaches in
several states, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Left unchecked, the high bacteria levels can cause
gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea or vomiting, in
bathers.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say the health danger posed by goose droppings is
still being studied.
</P>
<P>
   Except during hunting season, federal law prohibits killing or
even touching Canada geese without a permit. The birds are thriving
on the short grass in New Jersey's parks, lawns and athletic
fields. They have few natural predators, and people often feed
them.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials are trying a variety of measures to rid
themselves of Canada geese legally and humanely.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Union County officials planted a wall of trees and
shrubs along the banks of rivers in two county parks. The hope was
that the geese would avoid bodies of water where they could not see
the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota hired a Rutherford firm to try propane cannons,
pyrotechnic shells and an electronic dog.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood tried mechanized owls to scare geese away, and when that
failed they asked dog owners to walk their pets in a local park a
few mornings a week to frighten the fowl away.
</P>
<P>
   And the Oaklyn Public School District hired a private company
based in Monmouth County, the Geese Police Inc., to bring in border
collies and herd the geese off its playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Medford Commons went ahead with its solution - obtaining a
federal permit this April to destroy goose eggs - despite protests
from some residents and animal-rights supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''These geese used to be cherished at a lower density,'' said
Paul Castelli, the leading biologist for the state's waterfowl,
ecology and management program. ''As density has risen, so have
complaints.''

<HEADLINE> Diamond Meeting Looks At Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Leading figures in the world diamond
industry gathered Sunday in Antwerp for three-days of talks likely
to be dominated by demands they clean up a trade tarnished by
revelations of how smuggled gems are financing wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The biannual World Diamond Congress is scheduled to draw 350
diamond traders and cutters, government representatives from
producing and importing nations, and mining company executives to
the Belgian port city, which is the world's largest diamond trading
center.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure groups are hoping the industry will announce strict new
controls on so-called ''blood diamonds'' trafficked by rebel groups
in Angola, Sierra Leone and other war-torn African nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The eyes of the world will be on the diamond trade to see
whether they are serious about reform,'' said the human rights
group Global Witness.
</P>
<P>
   The congress, which holds it first working session Monday, will
also have to grapple with the announcement last week that the
world's largest diamond company, De Beers, is relaxing its 66-year
policy of buying up the world's surplus diamonds to control supply
and keep prices high.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from a vocal campaign demanding industry reforms,
the South African conglomerate which controls 60 percent of the
uncut diamond market also said it was instructing its 125 major
rough diamond buyers not to purchase gems from African conflict
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups are hoping this week's meeting will bring
tighter controls throughout an industry worth $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Yearsley of the London-based group said Global Witness
wants the Antwerp meeting to agree on an international
certification program to ensure all diamonds can be traced to the
country where they were mined.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan will need to be independently verified to ensure
gems sales are not funding conflicts, Yearsley said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Recent probes by Global Witness and other pressure groups,
together with a hard-hitting U.N. report, have revealed how rebel
groups fighting elected governments in Angola and Sierra Leone have
managed to buy arms through smuggled diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has imposed embargoes on diamonds from the
two nations unless they are certified by government agencies. But
collusion by other African nations and lax controls at
international trading centers have been blamed for allowing
''conflict diamonds'' to continue to reach the market.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the criticism, major diamond centers such as Antwerp,
Bombay and Tel Aviv have brought in tougher rules on certificates
of origin and have threatened to ban sanctions-busting dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners say that is not enough, and Global Witness in a
statement Friday hinted at a campaign to turn consumers away from
diamonds, if stricter regulations are not established at this
week's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to commit to these reforms will leave human rights
organizations with little choice but to increase the level of
public awareness regarding the diamond trade's failure to provide
meaningful guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain is expected to repeat
the call for more rigorous rules when he addresses the meeting
Monday. ''I look to the industry to announce bold new measures,''
Hain told diamond industry representatives in London recently.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Crisis Not Over Yet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Even the ousted prime minister feels sorry for
new Fijian President Ratu Josefo Iloilo, who is expected to name a
new Cabinet as soon as Monday with no obvious options that aren't
full of pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's eight-week parliamentary hostage spectacle ended last
Thursday, but the political crisis is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   A country dependent on tourism and trade faces international
isolation if it continues the path toward guaranteeing indigenous
Fijians superiority and the prospect of more internal turmoil if it
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the influential Fiji Trades Union Council, Felix
Anthony, is talking about economic sanctions and claiming many are
ready to suffer as much as needed to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But many others aren't -- they're making plans to leave, mindful
of the looting and burning that followed the May 19 coup and
largely targeted Indian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mahendra Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian to become prime
minister, wants his government reinstated and is developing a
strategy with other members of his ousted government coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight still hasn't left the Parliament
complex where he staged the coup and freed the last 18 legislators
on Thursday. Laundry hung from the windows Sunday. He says any
Cabinet that doesn't include his men is unacceptable and could
spark more unrest.
</P>
<P>
   One Speight supporter already has been rewarded, raising the
hackles of diplomats. Jope Seniloli is the new vice president, the
first in succession behind the 79-year-old Iloilo, who has
Parkinson's and relies on an oxygen bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats admit this is one of the murkiest situations
they've encountered because the very fundamentals of Fijian culture
and tradition are being challenged and perhaps remolded in a period
of days.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of guaranteeing that their rights come first has struck a
cord among indigenous Fijians, who comprise 51 percent of the
population and resent the economic and political clout of ethnic
Indians, who make up 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Speight has mounted a challenge to authority, he has done
so by respecting custom. He wears his Western suit jacket and tie
over a traditional sulu skirt. He held traditional ceremonies
seeking forgiveness from the hostages before they were released and
when his men surrendered weapons taken from a military armory.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Council of Chiefs, the traditional power, has tacitly
supported his goals of ethnic superiority by appointing both of his
nominees for president and vice president. There have even been
reports that Parliament could be dissolved and lawmaking handed
over to a group of second-tier chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Indians have been basically told they are second-class citizens.
Even if the Constitution isn't rewritten, the psychological damage
already is apparent, and the rift between the two main ethnic
groups seems wider than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The military's reputation has taken a hit for not taking a more
stringent position. Soldiers stood by and even handed over their
weapons to protesters rather than risk bloodshed that could further
inflame the situation.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: the tourism industry has taken a
particularly brutal pounding, worse than after a pair of remarkably
similar 1987 coups that followed independence in 1970 from nearly a
century of British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts that normally would be packed with Australians and New
Zealanders escaping the Southern Hemisphere winter and American
couples on honeymoon are empty. The manager at one, when told of a
cancellation, said she would send staff home because no one else
was staying there.
</P>
<P>
   The industry recovered from the 1987 coups to prosper. It is
planning to launch a multimillion-dollar campaign soon in an effort
at damage control. But with the United States, Australia and New
Zealand warning its nationals to leave the country, Fiji has been
transformed from an idyllic beach resort to a high-risk
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Strikes also are possible that could cripple Fiji's other
critical sector, the sugarcane industry. No wonder that Chaudhry,
when asked what he thought about Iloilo, said: ''I feel sorry for
him.''

<HEADLINE> Land Disputes Disrupt E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- No one knows who really owns the
blackened, burned-out building where Canadian businessman Kirk
MacManus is trying to set up East Timor's first supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese man claims it, saying the army threw him out when
Indonesia invaded in 1975. Later, it housed an Indonesian bank.
Then came East Timor's secession last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of East Timorese moved in soon afterward, claiming that
since their country had been illegally occupied for centuries, the
building and land rightfully belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. administrators in East Timor don't know who to believe.
</P>
<P>
   This half-island's layered history, as colony, territory and now
nascent nation, means that land disputes are proving to be one of
the greatest stumbling blocks to the economic development needed to
sustain it as an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Without clear ownership laws and with many government records
destroyed in a rampage by pro-Indonesian militias, businesses are
reluctant to invest in long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents are unsettling for potential investors. In
December, the United Nations ordered an Australian businessman to
close a hotel he had just built in Dili, because it stood on
disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of colonial misrule by Portugal and 25 years of
corrupt and repressive Indonesian occupation, newly independent
East Timor is one of the poorest places in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Much of its infrastructure and most of its buildings and homes
were destroyed by pro-Indonesia militia after an overwhelming
majority of East Timorese voted to break away in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of service companies setting up shop in
Dili, hoping to profit from the United Nations' short-term presence
there, East Timor's private sector barely exists.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at about 80 percent and there is little hope
that things will improve soon. Most jobs in the cities disappeared
when existing businesses were destroyed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment, considered vital to reviving the shattered
economy, is only trickling in, U.N. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is going to invest in East Timor if we are unable to
provide them with guarantees that the land on which they will be
establishing their head office or their business is theirs, or can
be leased to them for an acceptable period of time,'' said Sergio
Vieira de Mello, the U.N.'s top administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Many Portuguese, Indonesian and East Timorese citizens have
lodged claims for the same farm, shop, house or vacant plot of
land, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. administrators have no land ownership records for the
territory and De Mello said neither Indonesia nor Portugal have
been forthcoming with copies of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Until the problem can be solved, the world body is only granting
leases of up to 12 months to incoming companies.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of businesspeople are gambling that they'll be able to
turn a profit within that time.
</P>
<P>
   MacManus, whose Australian-owned company, Supreme Boot Service
Ltd., plans to invest about $300,000 in turning an almost totally
destroyed building into a supermarket, said he stands to lose most
of it if the lease isn't extended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea if we can keep the property for a second
year,'' said MacManus, walking around the charred remains. ''It's a
real big risk for anyone trying to do business here and scares away
many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless U.N. officials quickly resolve the problem, the new
nation risks being left without a functioning economy when the
transitional administration pulls out in about two years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations intends to set up an independent tribunal in
the next few months to arbitrate claims. But with hundreds of cases
in the pipeline, that could take years.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese woman who returned to Dili decades after fleeing
the Indonesian invasion said the disputes are not just limited to
commercial property.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows who owns what,'' Alice Xavier said. ''The house I
grew up in and was later forced out of by Indonesians now has East
Timorese people in it. So who owns that?''

<HEADLINE> Rail Repairs Underway in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The administrator of a town in a
Russian-controlled region of Chechnya was shot and killed Sunday,
while Russian troops made emergency repairs on a railway track
damaged by explosions that ripped through a military train carrying
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Khamidov, the head of the town of Alkhan-Yurt, was killed
after unidentified assailants arrived at his home early Sunday and
demanded that he come outside. He was shot at least 11 times, said
acting regional prosecutor Nikolai Shepel.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was given for the killing, but Chechen rebels recently
have targeted local officials who have cooperated with the
Russians. Alkhan-Yurt, six miles southwest of the capital Grozny,
has been under Russian control since December.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops began mending a stretch of railway cut by the
explosions Saturday evening. One woman, a sergeant in the Russian
army, was killed, and six servicemen were wounded in the blast, the
press service of the railway forces said.
</P>
<P>
   The train was carrying two carloads of soldiers toward Russian
military headquarters in Khankala, a suburb of Grozny, when four
remote-controlled mines went off near the town of Dzhalka, nine
miles east of the city, NTV television news reported.
</P>
<P>
   The first mine went off under the headquarters car, the second
was detonated under a freight car carrying ammunition and the other
two mines exploded under the two rear cars, railway officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosions, the train came under small arms fire for
40 minutes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts destroyed 100 yards of track and paralyzed rail
traffic between the eastern towns of Argun and Gudermes, Chechnya's
second largest city, 19 miles east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Remote-control mines are a favorite rebel weapon, and soldiers
have been combing roads and rail lines to ward off attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The military command's press center said that no clashes with
rebel fighters occurred Sunday. Russian troops have taken control
of most of the rebellious region, and rebel bands have turned to
bombings and ambushes instead of large-scale operations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned in September after Islamic militants raided several
villages in neighboring Dagestan and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> 'Hip-hop books' publisher reaching for new audiences  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - What kind of book reads like an action movie,
comes with a soundtrack and is easier to find in a record store
than a bookshop?
</P>
<P>
   It's a new breed of story styled in the image of hip-hop music -
slick, quick tales packed with violence, adventure and the kind of
sexy drama more commonly found in music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Marc Gerald hopes the books will create a new genre
and grab the attention of young hip-hop music fans. So he's
packaging his slim volumes of fiction with music CDs and selling
them in record stores and clothing shops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our books are really about style, they're like cinema,'' said
Gerald, CEO of the Hollywood, Calif.-based Syndicate Media Group
Ltd. ''I wanted to create a place where people who'd never really
thought of picking up a book for entertainment could turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald's hip-hop fiction line, dubbed (S) Affiliated, is to
debut later this summer with ''Street Sweeper,'' a glamorized tale
of a disillusioned killer-for-hire by journalist Ronin Ro.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 books are planned for the series. Most will be sold
in record shops and clothing stores, although some copies will be
available in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, whose other projects have included unearthing and
re-releasing what he calls ''black pulp fiction'' novels from the
1960s and '70s, says he hopes the new series will draw an audience
of young music fans who've yet to learn the joys of reading.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mission was to bring books to people,'' he said. ''We want
people to be able to read them in two hours, between subway stops.
We want to make them really democratic. ... A lot of people don't
know what it means to pick up a book for pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald sees his nontraditional sales plan as a way to reach out
to young black readers who he says have been largely ignored by
mainstream publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   The novellas - which are the shape and size of CDs and have
shimmery covers - will be sold mainly in music stores and PNB
Nation clothing shops. The first 50,000 copies of each book will be
packaged with an original hip-hop CD from Def Jam records. Def Jam
plans to produce a different six- or seven-song CD for each (S)
Affiliated book.
</P>
<P>
   The packages are to sell for $16.99, although Gerald said
discounts would likely make the cost more like $14 or $15.
</P>
<P>
   He has commissioned music journalists and novelists to turn his
ideas into books that are about 150 quick pages. Actor Wesley
Snipes is involved in the (S) Affiliated project, and Gerald hopes
some of the stories will make it to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants the books to evoke the street-smart feel and
gritty ethos of popular hip-hop music, while holding onto the
tongue-in-cheek irony of a good action movie. Many of the stories,
he said, are influenced by the ''blaxploitation'' film genre of the
early 1970s. He granted the books were ''for the short attention
span.''
</P>
<P>
   Ro's profanity-packed ''Street Sweeper,'' the first in the (S)
Affiliated series, introduces reader to a professional New York
killer named Jerome Usher, who has a closet filled with expensive
suits and a safe packed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Usher carries a roll of hundred-dollar bills, guzzles Dom
Perignon with a different woman every night and lives a life filled
with cartoonish violence.
</P>
<P>
   But his cavalier attitude toward murder changes after a young
girl is injured in the crossfire that follows one of his contract
hits. Usher falls in love with the girl's mother and starts a more
down-to-earth life with her, promising to take just one more
assignment in his old profession so he can pay for her daughter to
have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Although his characters pull out guns at the slightest
provocation, Ro says his book doesn't glorify violence. He was just
writing a good story, he explains, adding that its twists and turns
bring it down against the gunplay, drugs and materialism that are
sometimes a problem in the music world.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerald, it's all about bringing the spirit of sound to the
page. He says several rap and hip-hop artists have contacted him
offering to pen their own stories for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear hip-hop when you read these books,'' he said. ''I
love that that's possible.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Political Freedoms Regress  </HEADLINE>
By MAE GHALWASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian journalist Adel Hussein has a lot
to say but nowhere to say it.
</P>
<P>
   His opposition newspaper Al-Shaab has been suspended after the
government accused it of causing riots because of its articles
about an allegedly blasphemous novel. Other papers treat Hussein
like a pariah. His Labor Party, tagged as too cozy with Muslim
fundamentalists, has been ordered to suspend activities.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say Hussein's is among the latest voices of
dissent to be silenced in a country that claims to be democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to us ... kills the amount of freedom in the
press that we had achieved. This freedom was the only democratic
progress we had made,'' Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's efforts to join the global economy have not been matched
by moves to meet international standards on political rights:
freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The veering between greater and lesser democracy may be
attributed to President Hosni Mubarak's caution, his choice to move
his people along a path slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa el-Fikky, a top Foreign Ministry spokesman and former
adviser to Mubarak, insists the government's ultimate goal is a
more open Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ''People criticize Mubarak for moving slowly. But this (pace) is
good. Egypt is a very difficult country to control,'' El-Fikky said
at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after succeeding Anwar Sadat to the presidency in 1981,
Mubarak freed scores of political prisoners. Opposition parties and
their newspapers flourished. Human rights groups were founded.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, the government unleashed a tough
crackdown on a violent insurgency launched by Muslim extremists.
Thousands have been jailed and 96 have been executed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Once the militants were crushed, officials turned to other
voices of dissent, like journalists and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say politicians who have held onto their seats too long
have become intolerant of challenges and unused to any checks on
their power. Some Cabinet members have held their positions for at
least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition journalist Gamal Fahmy, who was barred from writing
for just over a year, believes that his fate was sealed not when he
wrote in Al-Arabi newspaper against the re-nomination of Mubarak
for a fourth term, but for a piece critical of former Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak ''is more tolerant than his ministers,'' Fahmy said. The
ministers ''behave as if the country was their mother's farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the passing of a tough press law in 1995, several
journalists have been barred from writing for varying periods. At
least six have been jailed on libel charges. Three independent
newspapers have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Abu Saada, secretary general of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, was ordered into court in February after a
newspaper alleged that he accepted a $25,000 check from a British
parliamentary committee in return for writing a report that accused
police of abusing some 400 Coptic Christians in southern Egypt in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from local and international activists, the
government eventually accepted that Abu Saada had received the
money for a women's legal aid project. The trial was called off.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada went on to act as lawyer for liberal sociologist Saad
Eddin Ibrahim, whom police arrested June 30 on charges that
included preparing a documentary film on Egypt's elections that
harmed the country's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rigging has become a way of life for (Mubarak's National
Democratic Party) although they could win honestly,'' Ibrahim said
in an interview with The Associated Press days before his arrest.
The government strongly denies fixing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said that Mubarak's promises of free and fair votes
could be undermined by ''people around the president who have a
stake in rigging the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The NDP controls 97 percent of the seats in the 444-member
parliament. In the early days of Mubarak's presidency elections
were considered cleaner, as demonstrated by NDP victories of just
two-thirds of the seats. New parliamentary elections are due in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the restrictions on freedom are laid out in an emergency
law that has been in effect since Sadat's 1981 assassination by
Muslim extremists. The law allows arbitrary arrests and gives the
president sweeping powers to refer citizens to emergency and
military courts in which the only appeal is to the president. The
government argues it needs the law to fight Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a margin of freedom, much wider, observers say,
than in the eras of Mubarak's predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For all their complaints of harassment, human rights groups hold
news conferences to criticize the government and debates on issues
like fundamentalism and rights of women, workers and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite restrictions on the press, newspapers are more outspoken
than under other leaders. Opposition parties, albeit hardly a
threat to the government, meet, set their agenda and elect their
boards freely.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation ''is not good,'' said Mohammed Sid Ahmed,
a prominent political pundit and former activist who was jailed
under Gamal Abdel-Nasser and whose newspaper Al-Ahaly was closed
under Sadat. ''But it is better than before.''

<HEADLINE> 'Buffalo Soldier' Vets Go To Italy  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMMOCOLONIA, Italy (AP) -- Sandra Fox was 2 when her father, Lt.
John Fox, lost his life fighting Nazi forces in this medieval
Tuscan village during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, more than 55 years later, she came here for the first
time to attend a ceremony in memory of her father and of the other
black American ''Buffalo Soldiers'' and all those killed here. She
also came to dedicate the battle site -- a 10th century fortress
atop the village -- to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Soldiers was the nickname originally applied to the
black American unit of newly freed slaves who fought in cavalry and
infantry divisions in the late 1800s. The term came to mean any
soldier who served in an all-black unit.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen veterans and Sommocolonian villagers who lived
through the Dec. 26, 1944, battle also gathered on a sunny morning
to lay a wreath at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't recall anything from that year,'' said Sandra
Fox, who traveled from Houston, Texas, with her mother, Arlene.
''My oldest recollection is my father's funeral, about two years
later. But it's important to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortress still carries scars of the battle. A big chunk of
its facade was destroyed by the artillery fire heroically ordered
by Lt. Fox on his own position when he saw that the fortress was
surrounded by enemy soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the all-black Army's 92nd Infantry Division said
about 50 of the 70 Americans were killed in the struggle for the
fortress -- a battle the Americans lost.
</P>
<P>
   Other soldiers who died in the battle included some 30 Italian
partisans fighting on the side of the U.S. forces; the Austrian
Alpine soldiers; and Italian soldiers allied with Nazi forces.
Civilians also were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Buffalo Soldiers in American military history has
often been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Fox was posthumously awarded the Medal of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are catching up,'' said his daughter. ''It is important
for the old ones, because they were the ones who paid the price,
and also for the young ones, so they can understand how high a
price was paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortress in Sommocolonia, about 60 miles northwest of
Florence, was renamed Rock of Peace. It commands views of rugged
mountains and was donated to the town by one of the villagers whose
family owned the fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Sommocolonia, a town of some 100 inhabitants,
still remember the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I live that December 26 morning every day,'' said Lilia
Cassettari, tears in her eyes, showing a picture of her father,
Mario Cassettari, a 29-year-old Italian soldier killed that day.

<HEADLINE> Barr's Challengers Agree on Issues  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Months ago, during the first of several chummy debates, Rep. Bob
Barr's three Democratic challengers made a profound discovery: They
agree on darn near everything.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than spar over issues, the Democratic primary battle
has centered on who has what it takes to unseat the outspoken
Republican incumbent, known for his criticism of President Clinton
and his unyielding support of the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire businessman Roger Kahn boasts a war chest topping $1
million. Former Atlanta police officer Chip Warren has sewn up
endorsements from virtually every major union. And Jim Williams
offers the experience of an impressive earlier attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will weigh these weapons Tuesday when they vote in the
Democratic primary for Georgia's 7th District, which stretches from
the Atlanta suburbs to northwest Georgia. Barr is unopposed for the
GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tuesday's vote might not settle things. There will be a
two-way runoff if no candidate gets a majority -- a possibility that
suits the three-term incumbent just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Runoffs can be very debilitating to candidates,'' said Barr.
''Probably more times than not, the person who comes in second in
the primary wins the runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barr insists he doesn't care who the Democrats choose, he
alluded to Kahn's wealth in a recent donor letter that didn't
mention the others.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Democratic Party insiders were dropping
not-so-subtle hints that they were rooting for Kahn, whose
businesses have included a liquor wholesaler and a company that
broadcasts the PGA Tour on radio.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Atlanta resident had retired to Florida, but he
decided to move back two years ago after watching Williams garner
45 percent of the vote against Barr despite a campaign budget of
less than $10,000. A few months ago, Kahn purchased a farm in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn makes no apologies for his largely self-funded campaign. He
says it'll take an enormous cash flow to win the conservative seat,
and he has raised more than 10 times the combined totals of his
primary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''My business background tells me if a business is going to be
successful, it needs to be well financed,'' Kahn said. ''I see this
as little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Kahn's opponents have lived in the district longer, and
Warren figures his union support will give him the nod. Even Kahn
admits a high labor turnout could sink him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Kahn is a fine person, but he has never really had to work
for a living,'' Warren said. ''I'm not sure he would understand
what families go through on a daily basis, trying to pay their
bills or finance a house. That's just the way his birth rights came
down.''
</P>
<P>
   While the national Democratic Party can often bank on labor's
support, the lines of loyalty are more blurred in the 7th District.
Barr says he expects to attract his own union endorsements,
especially if Warren loses the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chip's a good man, but I'm not going to say anything against
Bob Barr either,'' said Wayne Myrick, president of Machinists Local
709 in Marietta. ''Roger Kahn hasn't been a very union-minded
person in his business dealings.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams often feels excluded during the money vs. endorsements
debate. However, the former Polk County commissioner is the only
challenger who has served in elective office and the only one who
has run for the congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the need two years ago to fill a seat held too long by
the right wing of the Republican Party,'' Williams said. ''Roger
Kahn and Chip Warren didn't recognize that need. They waited until
someone else ran and did well, and then they thought they could do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the typical Democratic issues are off-limits for these
challengers, who must appeal to the political center to woo voters
in the conservative district.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barr is the congressional point man for the
National Rifle Association, and none of his opponents will
criticize him for that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Warren contends Barr's dogged pursuit of issues
alienates colleagues and makes him largely ineffective at seeking
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Barr brushes the criticism aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every challenger promises those sorts of very broad changes --
that they can go up there, change the world and bring those two
sides together,'' Barr said. ''But it's just campaign rhetoric. It
means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Democrats believe the nominee will get financial help
from the Democratic Party. They suspect this is their last, best
chance to wrestle back the seat and defeat the state party's
favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Barr wins this time, it's unlikely he can be defeated
until he retires or runs for a different office,'' Kahn said.

<HEADLINE> New archbishop's first Sunday Mass marks archdiocese's 150th birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - New Archbishop Edward Egan used his first Sunday
Mass to mark the 150th anniversary of the New York archdiocese,
calling it a ''community of faith'' as strong and dedicated as
those of ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   Egan had done daily Masses since taking office a month ago as
the successor to the late Cardinal John O'Connor. His first Sunday
Mass was said to a nearly full house at the 2,300-seat St.
Patrick's Cathedral, which itself has stood since 1878.
</P>
<P>
   The New York diocese was founded in 1808 and became an
archdiocese on July 19, 1850, when then-bishop John Hughes was
elevated by Pope Pius IX to archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, in his homily, recalled the story of 4th century
Christians, living in what is today Algeria, who for the
clandestine practice of their religion were searched out and
murdered by the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who arrested them found scriptures, writings,
silver cups and other items - including food, clothing and sandals
collected for charity - that proved their ''guilt'' as Christians,
Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And 150 years ago, here in New York, when this great people of
faith became the archdiocese of New York, they were guilty, too,''
he said. ''That, dear friends, is our heritage ... faith, and
prayer, and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan recalled that when Hughes went to Rome in 1850, Pius IX
sent him a meal ''from his own table,'' and Hughes later wrote that
despite religious agitation in Italy at the time, he found the pope
''in his splendid majesty with the profoundest spirit ... how
blessed is one from a remote part of the world to spend a few days
in the Eternal City?''
</P>
<P>
   Egan noted that recently, he, too, went to Rome to receive his
pallium (a garment of the office) and found Pope John Paul II, ''in
his splendid majesty.'' Instead of sending a meal to his quarters,
he invited Egan to lunch at the papal residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him we would have a 150th anniversary, and we would
commit ourselves to faith, and to prayer and to charity,'' Egan
said.

<HEADLINE> Green slams Pataki on cuts to mental health care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cuts to funding for treatment of the mentally
ill have left many troubled people on the streets and subways and
created a threat to public safety, Public Advocate Mark Green said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Green criticized Gov. George Pataki for making the cuts and
failing to spend the money saved by shrinking psychiatric hospitals
on community-based treatment for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the city are forced to read about attacks on our streets
and subways by people who have had recent contact with the state's
criminal justice, mental health and homeless systems,'' Green said
in a letter he wrote to Pataki and released to the press. ''Too
often, those responsible - like thousands before them - have simply
been dumped from facilities and programs without access to the care
and services that might have helped them avert disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Green cited recent street attacks on two women who were hit on
the head by bricks and concrete. He also pointed to several
incidents in which mentally disturbed people pushed others in front
of subway trains.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a Democrat who hopes to become mayor, said
deinstitutionalization has reduced the number of inpatients at
state psychiatric hospitals from 93,000 to less than 6,000 in the
past four decades. He accused Pataki of failing to live up to a
pledge the state made in 1993 to reinvest all the money saved from
reducing the number of psychiatric inpatients in community-based
treatment for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state broke its promise to the mentally ill, and to the
public, by creating a revolving door that practically guarantees
failure,'' Green wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Office of Mental Health disputed
Green's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has shown a strong commitment to mental health,''
said Roger Klingman, spokesman for state office of mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Klingman said 4.3 billion is spent on mental heath services in
New York each year and ''that's far and away above any other
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Green called for Medicaid insurance coverage to be extended to
mentally ill people released from prison in New York, additional
spending on supportive housing for the mentally ill, and the
reinvestment of money saved through deinstitutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Manhattan judge ordered New York City to arrange
for the continuing mental health care of thousands of inmates
before they are released from the Rikers Island jail.
</P>
<P>
   Seven mentally ill inmates of the jail had sued, saying the
25,000 people treated for mental illness at the prison each year
were being released without proper provision for treatment in the
community or a way to continue their psychotropic medication.

<HEADLINE> Funds for Alzheimer's Provided  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Federal researchers will get an additional
$50 million over the next five years for research into prevention
and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including the potential for a
vaccine, the White House said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Reagan's daughter Maureen Reagan, an activist
in the fight against the disease her father suffers from, welcomed
the announcement but said much more is needed. The organization
Maureen Reagan represents, the Alzheimer's Association, wants $100
million for research this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disease just gets worse every day,'' she said on CNN's
''Late Edition.'' Asked how the former president is faring, she
said, ''When I say not so good, Alzheimer's families know what I'm
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million for the National Institutes of Health is to
build on preliminary findings made public last week about the
search for a vaccine against the progressive, degenerative brain
disease that afflicts 4 million Americans. The aging of the baby
boom generation will push the total to 14 million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Research ''provides new hope not only for Americans who are at
risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in the future but for those
who are already in its early stages,'' President Clinton said in a
statement from Camp David, Md., where he is attending a summit
conference with Middle East leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmaceutical company said last week that preliminary results
from the first human study of a possible Alzheimer's vaccine
suggest the experimental compound is safe. Scientists said it is
far too soon to tell if the vaccine will do patients any good.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Pharmaceuticals' experimental vaccine raised hopes last
year when the company discovered that, in mice, the compound could
ward off and even reduce the brain-clogging plaque that is a
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Elan has begun small studies in people to see if the vaccine is
safe. If so, the company hopes to launch larger studies, possibly
by the end of 2001, to test whether the vaccine might slow
progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease disrupts the way the brain works, affecting
the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language.
Neither the cause nor the cure has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, one in 10 people over the age of 65 and as many as
half those over 85 have Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The disease costs the American health care system as much as
$100 billion a year, the White House said. The average lifetime
cost of caring for a patient with Alzheimer's disease has been
estimated at $174,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is more clear than ever that the nation must continue its
strong bipartisan support for biomedical research on the causes,
treatments, and cures for Alzheimer's disease and other diseases
affecting millions of Americans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was asked on
CNN whether the Clinton administration is stepping up its attack on
Alzheimer's partly because of pressure from Republicans in Congress
who have complained that Clinton was doing too little.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties have been competing with each other to put more
money into basic research, into clinical trials, particularly into
these prevention efforts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything we can do in the prevention area both here and abroad
makes a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Study finds first evidence of long-term success in a weight-loss program </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An unusually disciplined, long-term weight
loss program helped participants following it lose nearly one-fifth
their original weight and keep it off five years, researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   The Trevose Behavior Modification Program, serving about 1,200
people in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida, is the first weight
loss program in the country proven to work long term, according to
researchers at Rutgers University and University of Pennsylvania.
Their study appears in July's International Journal of Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   While most people eventually quit or were booted out of the free
program for not following the strict rules, the study found those
staying in two years on average lost 19.3 percent of their original
weight. At five years, they were still 17.3 percent lighter than
their original weight.
</P>
<P>
   ''A program where five years later 10 percent of the people are
within 95 percent of their (weight loss) goal is pretty amazing,''
said Rena Wing, a psychology professor and director of the Weight
Control and Diabetes Research Center at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, a member of the National Task Force on Prevention and
Treatment of Obesity who was not involved in this research,
cautioned that it's difficult to evaluate the program because
''failures'' are kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a good option for some patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, members lost 2.4 times as much weight in two
years as patients in a study of the diet pill Orlistat. Even the
Trevose dropouts contacted kept off 5 percent of their original
weight for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike plans using diet pills or fad diets, the program
encourages gradual weight loss through good nutrition, constant
calorie counting, exercise, weekly weighings and support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs use such behavior modification techniques, but
are less strict. Participants can be dismissed if they miss
meetings or don't meet the goals they set based on the healthy
weight range for their height, or if they don't permanently
maintain at least 90 percent of that loss.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer-run program, based in the Philadelphia suburb of
Trevose, was founded in 1970 by Dr. Albert Stunkard, director of
the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's obesity
research clinic, and David Zelitch, who lost nearly 100 pounds and
kept it off until his death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the program operates in 62 locations in New Jersey,
eastern Pennsylvania and Pompano Beach, Fla., with a total of 108
groups of about 10 meeting weekly in ''donated'' space at schools,
churches and synagogues, hospitals and similar locations. Past
''success stories'' serve as new group leaders or role models. Most
groups have a waiting list, but a few new ones are starting soon,
said program director Mary Jackson of Philadelphia, who lost more
than 80 pounds on the program and has kept it off for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very slow weight loss,'' Jackson said. ''Our experience
is the people who lose weight quickly are the ones who gain it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined data on 329 people who applied to the
program's main location in 1992 and 1993. Many either changed their
minds or were rejected because they didn't meet certain criteria,
such as needing to lose 20 pounds to 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 202 who started the program, 105 completed the first
year, 59 were still in after three years and 39 completed five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Peak weight loss came at 30 months, about five times longer than
most diet plans last, said Janet Latner, a Rutgers graduate student
in psychology who was the lead researcher. She found three factors
predicted success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more months you were in treatment, the more you lose; the
more you lost the first month, the more you lose; and the heavier
you were to start, the more you lose,'' Latner said.
</P>
<P>
   Her adviser, behavioral psychology professor Terry Wilson, who
directs Rutgers' Eating Disorders Clinic, said while more study is
needed, the program is a promising model that could be replicated.
He noted that it emphasizes improving health, not appearance,
something greatly needed because the U.S. obesity epidemic is
causing more diabetes, heart disease and other life-threatening
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Latner both said obesity researchers increasingly are
concluding ''continuing care is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not dieting. You're eating this way the rest of your
life. That's why Trevose works,'' said Helene Lees, 60, of Cherry
Hill. The 5-foot-3 dietitian has maintained a 25-pound loss for
nine years, become a group leader and retrained for her current
profession. She budgets her daily calorie allowance to have
desserts or chocolate occasionally. ''I feel fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lees, bank teller Gail Whitworth, 59, of Northeast
Philadelphia had gone through commercial weight loss programs a
dozen times without success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've kept my weight off (about 30 pounds) for seven years,''
she said. ''I eat very healthy now, but I still snack.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is ''thrilled to death. He knows what I've struggled
through and he can't believe it,'' Whitworth said. ''I can't speak
highly enough about the program.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leader Briefs Bush, Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak found
time during the Middle East summit to update Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the two major parties' likely
presidential nominees, about the status of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns on Sunday characterized the telephone conversation
as friendly and said Barak said both the Israeli and Palestinians
delegations were working diligently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush said it was a friendly, brief call and that
Prime Minister Barak let him know they ... had reached no
breakthrough at that point,'' the Republican's spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Jim Kennedy, Democrat Gore's spokesman: ''Mr. Barak told
the vice president that they were hard at work at Camp David, and
the vice president for his part encouraged Mr. Barak to
persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak made the calls on Saturday. The summit continued Sunday,
its sixth day, with Palestinian delegation sources signaling
optimism Sunday about reaching an accord, but Israeli officials
saying a breakthrough was not in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, speaking on CBS' ''Face the
Nation,'' worried that peace might come at an enormous price tag to
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly if there's an agreement between the Palestinians and
the Israelis, we would welcome it. But if this agreement is bought
with some gigantic bribe at the expense of the American taxpayers
to give Bill Clinton a Nobel Prize as his legacy, I think the
Americans really ought to reject it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader said he favors
''demilitarizing foreign policy'' and doesn't think it's necessary
to spend a large amount of American money to achieve peace.

<HEADLINE> Albright Plans N. Korea Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP)-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
making plans to meet with North Korea's foreign minister,
ratcheting up the U.S. dialogue with the once most-isolated country
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Albright hopes to see Paek Nam-Sun while she is in Bangkok,
Thailand, in 10 days attending a meeting of the foreign ministers
of the countries grouped as the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, a State Department official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-level contact with North Korea reflects an improvement
in relations between the United States and a country long denounced
as being headed by a ''rogue regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department stopped using that reference after North
and South Korea began reconciliation talks during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and others in the Clinton administration still
described North Korea as a potential foe and a prime reason for
considering an expensive system to defend the United States against
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Albright said last month on a trip to Asia that American
troops would remain in South Korea indefinitely to maintain
strategic stability in the Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops have been stationed there for a half-century on the
theory North Korea otherwise might send its forces rushing
southward across the 38th parallel truce line.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said in June she might use the talks with a senior
North Korean official to try extend a freeze in North Korea's
nuclear weapons program and to curb the spread of North Korean
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I meet with lots of people,'' she said the time. ''Stay
tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   Several defense and security analysts as well as Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
have suggested that the stationing of U.S. troops in Korea should
be reconsidered in light of moves toward reconciliation on the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is at Camp David, Md., participating in U.S.-hosted
negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Towns finding it hard to care for aging cemeteries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALTA, N.Y. (AP) - The state is littered with 2,000 aging
nondenominational cemeteries that have neither funds nor
caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   Cemeteries that are abandoned have either reached capacity or
the families that used them died out or moved away, leaving no one
to tend the plots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the abandoned cemeteries that are receiving attention
today are getting it through volunteer and local fund-raising
efforts. Local towns have many fiscal demands. Cemeteries are not
at the top of their list,'' said Scott Trent, a spokesman for the
Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunning Street Rural Cemetery Association in Malta is a
typical of case.
</P>
<P>
   When the association was incorporated in the 1830s, the cemetery
was at the rural town's heart with the parade ground. The earliest
grave dates to 1775, when the area was wilderness. Now, the
graveyard shares that location with shopping centers and fast-food
restaurants.
</P>

   Gerald Winters, the association's secretary-treasurer, said he's
required to hold state-mandated meetings for cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting is set by a 1940 state law, which is designed
to have the cemeteries maintained and properly run. It sets out
requirements for the cemeteries' financial operation so that local
governments don't inherit a fiscal burden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never have anyone attend,'' Winters said. ''They're all
down here.''

<HEADLINE> Mutant 'X-men' Overpower Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ''X-men'' have good box-office genes.
</P>
<P>
   The comic-book adaptation about genetic mutants opened at No. 1,
delivering a superhuman debut of $57.5 million, according to studio
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-highest opening gross this year, just below
the $57.8 million ''Mission: Impossible 2'' took in over its first
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-Men'' also had the best debut ever in July, the
fourth-highest opening of all time and the best ever for a
non-sequel or prequel. ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' and ''Star
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' are Nos. 1 and 2, followed
by ''Mission: Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the immortal words of Phil Rizzuto, 'Holy cow,''' said Tom
Sherak, head of distribution for 20th Century Fox, which released
''X-men.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Scary Movie,'' last weekend's top film, slipped to second
place but held strong with $26.1 million, pushing its take to $89
million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in 3,025 cinemas, ''X-men'' averaged $19,008 a theater,
compared to $8,280 in 3,152 locations for ''Scary Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The two movies, plus solid returns for holdover films, helped
lift the overall box office for the second straight weekend after a
slump in June. The top 12 movies grossed $148.8 million, up 39
percent over the same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men'' accounted for 38.6 percent of that overall gross and
far exceeded predictions by industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything over $40 million would have been great,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the
box office. ''We knew this would be the No. 1 movie, but it
performed way beyond expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   With two robust weekends, Hollywood is back on track to match
last year's record summer revenues of $3 billion. So far this year,
summer grosses are about even or may be slightly ahead of last
summer's, Dergarabedian said. Final studio figures for the weekend
will be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men,'' based on the Marvel comic series that debuted in the
1960s, tells the story of a battle between good and evil among
mutants who are scorned and mistrusted by the rest of humanity. The
cast includes Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Halle
Berry and Anna Paquin.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men'' received generally favorable reviews. Its PG-13 rating
opened up a huge teen audience, and the movie had strong appeal for
older movie-goers who may have read the comic books as children.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Shakespearean-trained actors Stewart and
McKellen also helped ''X-men'' draw adults, Sherak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What did Alec Guinness do for 'Star Wars?''' Sherak said.
''It's the same thing here. They gave 'X-men' the look of a real
movie, not a comic-book movie. They added credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In limited debuts, the ensemble drama ''The Five Senses''
averaged $14,000 a theater at two New York City movie houses.
''Chuck &AMP; Buck,'' a dark comedy about a man's obsession with a
boyhood buddy, averaged $10,000 a cinema in seven theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''X-men,'' $57.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Scary Movie,'' $26.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Patriot,'' $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Disney's The Kid,'' $10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Chicken Run,'' $7.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Big Momma's House,'' $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Shaft,'' $2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Facts about obesity in the United States  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Some 97 million American adults, or 55
percent, are considered overweight or obese.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of
obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs
nearly $100 billion annually. That includes costs for weight loss
treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight people are at increased risk of illness from:
</P>
<P>
   -high blood pressure and other heart disease,
</P>
<P>
   -adult-onset diabetes,
</P>
<P>
   -stroke,
</P>
<P>
   -gallbladder disease,
</P>
<P>
   -osteoarthritis,
</P>
<P>
   -certain cancers,
</P>
<P>
   -lipid disorders,
</P>
<P>
   -respiratory problems and
</P>
<P>
   -sleep apnea, a disorder that primarily strikes overweight men,
causing them to repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping. Besides
causing fatigue, it decreases the amount of oxygen and increases
the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain.
</P>
<P>
   NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive
abdominal fat - meaning a waist circumference of more than 40
inches in men and more than 35 inches in women - and people with a
body mass index of 25 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level
considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight - roughly 221
pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Troops Intervene in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Belgian troops evacuated election
registrars from a Serb town in Kosovo after learning that Serbs
opposed to internationally sponsored elections were heading to the
area to disrupt registration, the NATO-led peacekeeping command
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Saturday in Leposavic, the northern Kosovo
town where local Serbs had expressed willingness to register for
municipal elections set for October.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that about 40 hard-line Serbs were en route,
Belgian soldiers escorted registrars working for the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe ''from the registration
point to safety,'' NATO said. No injuries or destruction of
property were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday had been the deadline for Kosovars of all groups --
Albanian, Serb, Turkish, Gypsies and others -- to register for the
October elections.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations needs substantial participation from all
ethnic groups to give legitimacy to the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated development Sunday, angry ethnic Albanians
blocked the main highway leading to southern Kosovo after Swedish
troops refused to allow a wedding party to drive past a Serbian
village flying the Albanian flag.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Serbs in the village countered with their own road block,
snarling traffic on the main highway leading south from Pristina to
Kosovo's second-largest city, Prizren. NATO-led peacekeepers,
backed by armored personnel carriers, kept the two groups separate.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the standoff began, hundreds of ethnic Albanians,
including truck drivers and other motorists, had gathered before a
cordon of Swedish soldiers, taunting them and accusing the Swedes
of behaving worse than the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish soldiers tried to convince the crowd that it was too
dangerous to ride though a Serb village waving an Albanian flag.
Several men complained that the refusal to allow them to fly the
flag was an admission that NATO does not have full control of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development reported Sunday, Serbian police have
stepped up questioning ethnic Albanians and searches of their homes
in an area adjoining Kosovo province. It followed a series of
attacks on police, an ethnic Albanian group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a series of recent explosions, many (ethnic) Albanians
have been detained and their houses searched, which has increased
political tensions,'' said the statement by the Party for
Democratic Action representing ethnic Albanians in the volatile
region.
</P>
<P>
   The area, known as Presevo Valley, is home to a sizable ethnic
Albanian community, adjacent to the Kosovo province where NATO last
year took over control from the Serbs following a bombing campaign
that ended ethnic repression by Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Vials found on beach not 'radioactive,' say police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two small glass vials labeled ''radioactive''
and found on Rockaway Beach in Queens were recovered by Board of
Health officials on Sunday, and a preliminary report indicated they
were harmless.
</P>
<P>
   The thee-inch capsules, containing a yellow fluid, were neatly
lined up side by side with the labels facing upward, said Sgt.
Andrew McInnies, a police department spokesman. That seemed to
suggest that someone had left them there to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   A Parks Department employee came across them about 1:15 p.m. on
the beach that was busy with weekend bathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''A preliminary examination showed they weren't radioactive,''
McInnies said.
</P>
<P>
   The vials were taken by Board of Health officials for further
tests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: NJ crowded, wealthy, well-educated  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   New Jersey remains the most crowded state in the
nation, with
growing suburbs and a diverse, well-educated population, according
to a Rutgers University report forecasting the 2000 Census.
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Hughes, the author of the report ''Anticipating Census
2000: New Jersey's Emerging Demographic Profile,'' said the trends
shown indicate that affordable housing and labor shortage will
become important issues over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,100 people per square mile, Hughes - who is dean of
Rutgers' School of Planning and Public Policy and the state's chief
demographer - said New Jersey is by far the most crowded state in
the country, and has a population density greater than that of
Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend noted in the report is that established suburbs
such as Dover, Brick, Woodbridge and Edison, have grown as large or
larger than cities such as Trenton and Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnically, New Jersey will be the state that most closely
resembles the makeup of the United States as a whole, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Asian population grew faster than any other, surging
71.5 percent over the past decade. During the same time, the black
population grew 15 percent, while the white population grew 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's total foreign-born population stands at 17 percent,
according to the report, up from 15.4 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Residents continue to earn more than the rest of the country.
According to the Rutgers report, the median household income was
$49,303 in 1998 - 31 percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The number of educated residents also increased. In 1990, 27
percent of people 25 or older held bachelor's or postgraduate
degrees. That figure reached 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the population is aging, and a decreasing number of
20- to 34-year-olds will create a tight labor market that could
send up wages. He said immigrants and the children of baby boomers
will need affordable housing, which could be difficult to obtain as
the state looks to limit development.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife agents kill black bear after attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STILLWATER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A wildlife rehabilitator is
caring for two seven-month-old black bear cubs after state wildlife
officials had to kill its aggressive mother for charging people and
attacking a pet dog in Sussex County.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife said the
state's policy is to euthanize any bear caught in an unprovoked
attack on animals or people.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's safety issue involved, its most unwise to take a
chance,'' Bob Eriksen, a supervising biologist with the state
agency, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions. ''If
we released her back into the wild, she could potentially cause
injury. We're erring on the side of human safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The 175-pound female bear wandered into a residential
neighborhood near Plymouth Lake on Thursday, scaring a woman in a
wheelchair so much she toppled over trying to get away.
</P>
<P>
   The bear left the area, but later attacked a mixed-breed dog
sitting on the porch of a Stillwater home. The dog's owners, Susan
and Adam Snover, rushed outside to wrest the dog away from the
bear. The bear stood on its hind legs and growled, then went across
the street and swiped at a woman leaving her house.
</P>
<P>
   Fish, Game and Wildlife agents, summoned by residents, shot the
bear with a tranquilizer dart after it charged one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The immobilized bear was then taken away and killed Saturday,
although authorities aren't saying how or where.
</P>
<P>
   Her cubs, which were not harmed when they were captured, likely
will be released in the wild in September, according to Eriksen.
</P>
<P>
   The bear was the third euthanized by state wildlife officials
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about bears threatening people and damaging property
have escalated in some rural and suburban parts of New Jersey, and
the state has authorized a black bear hunt for the first time in 29
years. Wildlife officials hope to reduce the estimated population
of about 1,000 black bears by about 175 bears.
</P>
<P>
   Among those lodging recent complaints in Sussex County is Susan
Snover. Last month a different bear broke into her car to get at a
bag of groceries inadvertently left there.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you live in bear country and you're thinking of feeding the
bears, don't,'' Eriksen said. ''It's not doing them any favors.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Parents Threaten  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Parents of missing government soldiers
threatened on Sunday to enter rebel-controlled territory in Sri
Lanka's north to search for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The parents believe that more than 500 soldiers are being held
captive by separatist guerrillas in the Wanni jungles. Individuals
and organizations require authorization both from the government
and the rebels to enter the area controlled by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this time we are not given approval to visit the Wanni
jungles where our children are being held, we will do it by
force,'' said Chandani Nanayakkara, a spokeswoman for The
Association of Relatives of Servicemen Missing in Action.
</P>
<P>
   Nanayakkara's son, a 27-year-old air force pilot, has been
missing since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he is prisoner in Wanni because those servicemen who
have been released by the LTTE have told us so,'' she said. ''We
know that the LTTE is willing to receive us and we have spoken to
international humanitarian organizations to provide us escorts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the month nearly 2,000 members of the
Nanayakkara's group will ask President Chandrika Kumaratunga
permission to enter the jungles. Nanayakkara said the parents want
to visit their children and speak on their behalf to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the LTTE had allowed 28 relatives of 15 prisoners
to visit them in custody and later released six of them.
</P>
<P>
   Between April and May, the Sri Lankan military suffered losses
when the rebels overran several key towns and installations in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But government forces blocked the rebel advance last month after
obtaining new warplanes, multi-barrel rocket launchers and other
armaments from Israel, Pakistan and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has given the number of combatants captured during
the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for the minority
Tamils who comprise 3.2 million of Sri Lanka's 18.6 million people.
More than 62,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Send Message to Barak  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Chanting ''The country must not be
lost,'' at least 100,000 right-wing protesters massed in Tel Aviv
on Sunday to send a strong and personal message to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the majority, and the majority will win!'' shouted many
of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late prime
minister was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are
often held.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from
settlements in the West Bank, from homes they fear they might lose
in a final peace agreement with the Palestinians. Others were
members of the opposition Likud party or other right-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come here to say to Barak that he cannot sign away
everything,'' said Nili Gerber, 46, from Mevasseret, a suburb of
Jerusalem. She wore a sticker on her chest saying, ''We are the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wore T-shirts saying: ''Jerusalem is one.'' Others held
banners that attacked the prime minister personally: ''The nation
has decided,'' one said. ''Barak is dangerous to Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues of territorial compromise, especially the emotional
question of Jerusalem, are key stumbling blocks in the talks
between Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David,
which in their sixth day were being described by all sides as
extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Likud leader Ariel Sharon stepped up his harsh attacks on Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before us, to my regret, and I say it with sorrow, is a prime
minister who threatens his people with terrorism, with war, with an
intefadeh (Palestinian uprising), and enlists world leaders,
ministers and political activists to join in his threats,'' Sharon
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sharon who brought a motion of no-confidence in Barak to
parliament last Monday, the day the prime minister left for Camp
David -- a motion that Barak barely survived.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he is willing to cede settlements in highly
populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank as part of a peace
agreement. The Palestinians seek to establish an independent state
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 200,000 Jewish settlers have moved to the West Bank,
home to 1.5 million Palestinians, since Israel captured the area
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Yigal Elhaik, a 43-year-old computer programmer,
immigrated from France only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This endangers the people,'' he said of Barak's feared
concessions. ''We will be encircled by Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason we are a nation is because the nation is over 3,000
years old,'' said Bentsion Willinger, 50, from the Kedumim
settlement. ''If Barak wants to give up parts of Israel, he gives
up parts of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, security forces evacuated some 30 young Jewish
settlers from a renegade outpost in the West Bank they'd set up to
protest possible Israeli concessions to the Palestinians at the
Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and policemen dragged off young women linked
arm-in-arm. The defiant settlers sang Israel's national anthem as
they were taken away.
</P>
<P>
   In Nablus, in the northern West Bank, some 1,000 Palestinians
held a rally calling on Arafat not to make concessions to Israel at
Camp David. A cross-section of Palestinian groups organized the
rally -- from Arafat's Fatah faction to Hamas, a militant Islamic
group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here because we know that the Palestinian side is
under pressure at Camp David, and we want to say that any
concession by the Palestinian side does not represent us and we
will reject it,'' said Jamal Saleem, a member of the Hamas
leadership in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, four Israeli buses on their way to
pick up settlers for the right-wing demonstration took a wrong turn
into a Palestinian refugee camp north of Jerusalem. Young
Palestinians threw rocks and iron bars at them and set them on
fire. The drivers were beaten and robbed but escaped with minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The army sealed off the main southern entrance to the nearby
Palestinian city of Ramallah and sent troops into the camp, the
army spokesman said. A crowd of about 150 stoned the soldiers, who
responded with stun grenades, a military source said, but no
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions simmered in Hebron for a second day as Palestinians and
Jewish settlers shoved each other in the town's market. Fistfights
broke out, Palestinian youths burned tires in alleyways, and others
threw stones toward Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Generals Meet With Putin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Top defense officials who have been feuding over
the status of Russia's missile forces traveled to a Black Sea
resort Sunday for a second round of closed-door meetings with
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Gen. Igor Sergeyev, is fighting a proposal
from Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, head of the General Staff, to downgrade
Russia's missile forces by folding them into the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Putin summoned the two to the Kremlin in Moscow on Saturday
after warning them against airing their differences in public -- a
response to a strongly worded outburst by Sergeyev on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev and Kvashnin then flew to Putin's vacation residence in
Sochi on the Black Sea for another meeting Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's spokesman Alexei Gromov said the meetings were connected
to preparations for an upcoming meeting of Russia's advisory
Security Council, and the participants made no public statement
about the missile dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev and other generals think Russia must depend on nuclear
forces because of the deterioration of its conventional forces due
to economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin and his supports think Russia needs more conventional
weapons to meet threats such as the rebellion by independence
fighters in Chechnya.

Broome County District Attorney Gerald F. Mollen said.
</P>
<P>
   After a review of witness statements and 911 tapes, Mollen said
trooper Todd Keister will not face a grand jury in connection with
the June 26 shooting of John M. Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a police investigation came to the conclusion that
Keister acted appropriately when he shot Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Mollen say Rock ignored orders to drop a shotgun,
which he had when police arrived at his house following a 911 call
placed by his wife Wendy. Rock asked police to shoot him and, from
about 20 feet, pointed the gun at the officers, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Rock had said after the incident her husband was
distraught and surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   Police say John Rock underwent ''substantial emotional strain''
for several weeks before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, the death of John Rock was a tragic occurrence,''
Mollen said. ''But there is not reasonable ground to believe that
his death was the result of criminal misconduct by any person.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine is 59 miles south of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Nix Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP leaders in the House and Senate said they
are willing to work with President Clinton to add prescription drug
coverage to Medicare but will not accept a government-run plan that
covers everybody, as Clinton demands.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Clinton
''is in his all-out political mode,'' unwilling to talk ''with us
seriously this year on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, repeated GOP opposition to providing
prescription drug coverage as part of the overall Medicare program.
That's what both Clinton's plan and one proposed last week by Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
would do.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed and sent to the Senate a Republican plan
that would allow insurance companies to offer the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he was willing to work with Roth but wouldn't commit
to considering his approach, which is likely to cost seniors less.
</P>
<P>
   ''That just depends on the structure of the program,'' Armey
said on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Listening to the American people, we want it to be
voluntary,'' Armey said. ''It's very important to seniors that they
feel some sense of jurisdiction over their own lives. We want those
seniors who are happy with what they have ... not to be forced out
of that and into some government program.''
</P>
<P>
   Under all three plans, participation would be optional.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill would make benefits at varying levels
available in 2003 and would cost $155 billion over 10 years.
Clinton's plan would provide the same benefits for all, starting in
2002 and at a 10-year cost of $253 billion. The start-up time and
cost for Roth's proposal are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pushing Republican to accept his drug plan, offering
in exchange to go along with their effort to eliminate the
so-called ''marriage penalty,'' a tax quirk that makes many couples
pay more than they would if each partner was single.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott, R-Miss., said he has no interest in using tax dollars
to help provide coverage for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Gates? Donald Trump? We're going to subsidize their
prescription drugs? Please.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott contended a large problem is just getting Clinton to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not engaged with us seriously this year on anything,''
Lott said. ''He's not serious about the prescription drugs. We
could come up with something there, and we're going to work to get
that done. But we want to help those that need the help.''

<HEADLINE> Poll finds most think the terminally ill have right to end life  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Nearly all New Jersey residents believe
terminally ill patients have the right to be taken off life support
machines if they wish, according to the latest
Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, only one-fifth of those surveyed said they had
discussed the issue with their health-care provider. And only
one-third were ''very confident'' their health care wishes would be
followed, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disconcerting that so few New Jersey residents have
spoken with their doctors about treatment wishes,'' said Joel
Cantor, director of Rutgers' Center for State Health Policy, which
helped conduct the poll that was released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patients cannot expect health care providers to be responsive
unless they clearly communicate their wishes to medical
professionals,'' Cantor said. ''Doctors and patients must share
responsibility for improving communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 802 New Jersey adults, conducted from
June 8 through June 13, found 88 percent of respondents think any
mentally competent person who is terminally ill should be allowed
to refuse life-saving medical treatment. Also, if a patient who is
unable to speak hasn't made his or her wishes known in advance,
relatives should still be allowed to discontinue life-saving
medical treatment, according to 74 percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   While 63 percent of respondents said they had discussed their
wishes for health care during a life-threatening illness with a
relative or close friend, only 18 percent said they had discussed
that issue with their doctor or other health provider. Naturally,
senior citizens were much more likely than young people to have
brought up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between simply relieving pain and extending life
as much as possible, 70 percent said they would minimize pain, 20
percent said they would extend life and the rest were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings included:
</P>
<P>
   -Just 33 percent were very sure that if they had made their
health care wishes known, doctors and hospital staff would follow
those wishes; 42 percent were somewhat confident.
</P>
<P>
   -Only 15 percent thought doctors and hospital staff are doing an
excellent job relieving pain for patients with life-threatening
illnesses; 46 percent thought they are doing a good job, 23 percent
said they are doing only a fair job and 5 percent said medical
personnel are doing a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   -While 38 percent said doctors and hospitals staff are doing a
good job handling the emotional needs of dying patients, only 10
percent said they are doing an excellent job; another 32 percent
said it was only a fair job and 9 percent said it was a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-month-old New Jersey Comfort Care Coalition, a nonprofit
group including some two dozen organizations of medical
professionals, public and private policymakers, educators and
clergy, paid for the poll. The coalition wants to encourage changes
that can make end-of-life care more compassionate and comfortable,
rather than dehumanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The survey shows that the coalition has a lot of work ahead,''
executive director Gary L. Stein said in a statement. ''It points
to the importance of informing the public about the right to expect
better pain management and overall care for life-threatening
illnesses and the need for individuals to discuss preferences for
health care with their providers and loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The coalition will use this valuable public input to craft its
ongoing outreach, education and policy efforts,'' Stein said.

<HEADLINE> Long Island high school students hurt in school bus accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALLAMUCHY, N.J. (AP) - Eight members of a Long Island high
school football team, the team's coach and a bus driver were
injured Sunday when another driver fell asleep and swerved into
their bus, police said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey State Police said Michael Ferraro, 60, of Nesconset,
N.Y., was westbound on Interstate 80 at about 8:40 a.m. when he
fell asleep and swerved into the rear of the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver, Robert Robustelli, 30, of Lindenhurst, N.Y.,
lost control of the vehicle, which skidded across three lanes,
overturned on its side and slid into a small ravine, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's car stopped on the shoulder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the Jericho High School football team were
injured - including one who lost the tip of an index finger - as
were Robustelli and the coach, police said.

	   MAINE, N.Y. (AP) - A woman and her granddaughter were injured
when they jumped from a second-story window to escape their burning
house.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Bailey awoke just after midnight Saturday smelling
smoke and feeling the heat of the fire around her, fire officials
said. She grabbed 7-year-old Shannon Latavish and leapt out the
window.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey broke her leg and suffered burns; she was in serious
condition at Wilson Memorial Regional Medical Center Saturday.
Latavish suffered burns and smoke inhalation; she was released from
the hospital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's husband, Ranson Bailey, also suffered burns. By the
time firefighters arrived, fire could be seen in every window of
the house, said Maine Fire Chief David Silverstein. It took six
hours to put the fire out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was visible from 2 miles away,'' he said. ''It was just a
ball of flame.''
</P>
<P>
   A cause for the fire has not been determined but an investigator
said they are looking at an electrical problem.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While Loren Roberts made it look easy in
winning the 33rd Greater Milwaukee Open, Franklin Langham was
working hard just to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   Langham made a difficult up-and-down for birdie on the 72nd hole
to salvage sole possession of second place. His third runner-up
finish this season put the fourth-year pro in solid position to
challenge for a top-40 finish and a spot in next year's Masters.
Langham was born in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped from a five-way tie with a 10-foot birdie putt Sunday
after an excellent chip from the long rough between the 18th green
and the bleachers. His total of 268 allowed him to take home
$270,000 instead of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no clue what it was worth,'' Langham said of his final
putt. ''I just knew I had to go for it, and I made a nice birdie on
18.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no apologies for finishing second, mainly because of
Roberts' outstanding play.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see your chances slipping away,'' Langham said. ''He
got off to a fast start, and I got off to a slow start. He did just
what you have to do when you have the lead. He played solid all
week. He just never let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate, Mathew Goggin, Kenny Perry and J.P. Hayes tied for
third place at 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   Langham began the day just two strokes behind Roberts, who
birdied three of his first four holes. But Langham -- who lost the
Doral-Ryder Open in March after Jim Furyk caught him from six
strokes behind with seven holes to play -- never considered victory
out of reach until Roberts holed a 25-yard chip from the fairway at
No. 12, putting Roberts at 24 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking about Furyk's (comeback),'' Langham said. ''I
thought I could do it too -- until 12, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NEEDS A HIGH FINISH: Casey Martin entered the GMO with $91,554
in PGA Tour earnings. He was 161st on the money list, and the only
player on tour allowed to ride a cart needs to get moving if he
hopes to retain his playing privileges by finishing in the top 125.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I'm way down on the list, but one good tournament
will take care of that,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He went 68-71-73-68 at the GMO. His final round lifted him from
70th to 56th place for a check of $5,550.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   QUICK MOVE: Joe Durant started Sunday's play 11 shots off the
lead and in a tie for 18th place. After birdies on the first four
holes, he moved among the leaders and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   He also birdied No. 9 for a 5-under 30 before posting a 1-under
35 on the back nine to finish at 14-under 270.
</P>
<P>
   That tied him for seventh with Russ Cochran, who also started
fast with an eagle on the par-4 second hole. Durant and Cochran,
playing in the same group, each received $80,625.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CHEESEHEADS CHARGE: J.P. Hayes led the final day's charge of
Wisconsin players to a high finish in the GMO.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is from Appleton, started the final round six shots
off the pace. He carded a 2-under 69 for a 269 to earn $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been a good tournament if Loren Roberts hadn't
shown up,'' Hayes said with a grin. ''It would have been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee native Skip Kendall made an eagle on the par-5 fourth
hole for the second straight day, helping him to fourth place at
the time. He finished with a 68 for a 13-under 271 and tied for
ninth place with John Rollins, Olin Browne, Chris Perry and Frank
Lickliter.
</P>
<P>
   Madison native Jerry Kelly played his best golf in the opening
round, shooting 65. But he didn't break par the rest of the
weekend, sandwiching two even-par 71s around a 72 to finish at 279.
He tied for 47th to earn $6,278.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he went out in 39 on the back nine before making three
birdies on the front nine to get to even for the day. He hit one
shot inside two feet on a par-3, but that didn't provide much
pleasure. ''It was too late for a boost,'' he said. ''I was gone by
then.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard to have fun out there. It was so frustrating,
wanting to do so well here. I blew up early, trying to steer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pewaukee's Mark Wilson finished at 278 after shooting a 70
Sunday. He placed 43rd to collect $8,500. Madison's Steve Stricker
followed his 74 Saturday with a 68 Sunday for a 281 total. That
left him tied for 63rd, collecting $5,200.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe next year,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said it's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of us from Wisconsin is going to win it one of these
years,'' he said. ''I hope it happens pretty soon, because we're
not getting any younger.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DIVOTS: Defending champion Carlos Franco shot two 73s on the
tournament's final two days to tie for 70th. After successfully
defending his 1999 Compaq Classic title in New Orleans in May, he
could have become just the 10th golfer in tour history to defend
two titles in the same year. ... Early finishers Sunday posted some
impressive rounds, including a 63 by John Rollins and a 64s by Olin
Browne and David Morland IV. Morland climbed from 63rd to 24th,
earning $21,938. ... Browne's scorecard included three 2s, all on
par-3 holes. ... The bottom three finishers were veterans Fuzzy
Zoeller (286), Craig Stadler (288) and Brad Fabel (289). They were
the only three players finishing above par in the field of 81 who
made the cut from the original field of 156. ... In his seven
career victories, Roberts has set tournament records five times: in
the 1996 GMO and MCI Classic, the 1997 CVS Charity Classic, 1999
Byron Nelson Classic and 2000 GMO. The career money leader in the
GMO, Roberts now has won $962,277.76 in 18 GMO appearances. He
missed the cut only twice, in his first appearance in 1983 and in
1993. ... Since the tourney moved from Tuckaway Country Club in
Franklin to Brown Deer Park in 1994, Roberts has two wins and two
runner-up finishes in the GMO. Last year he tied for 46th.

<HEADLINE> Emotional Clinton denies ever using anti-Semitic slur  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - Angry, exasperated and emotional, Hillary
Rodham Clinton on Sunday firmly denied allegations from a
forthcoming book that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to unequivocally state it never happened,'' the first
lady said after taking the unusual step of inviting reporters to
the garden of her Westchester home for a hastily scheduled press
conference to discuss the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation comes from a book due out this week, ''State of a
Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,''
by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for Bill Clinton's
unsuccessful Congressional campaign in Arkansas in 1974, as
claiming that Mrs. Clinton called him a ''Jew b-------'' after Bill
Clinton lost the election. Fray's wife said she witnessed the
incident, and a third person, Neil McDonald, claimed to have heard
the obscenity as he stood outside the room.
</P>
<P>
   Previous biographies of the Clintons have also said there was an
argument between Fray and Mrs. Clinton, but none of those books
mentioned any slur.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Clinton Senate campaign released copies of a
handwritten letter from Paul Fray to Hillary Clinton, dated July 1,
1997, in which he states: ''I have wronged you. I ask for your
forgiveness because I did say things against you, and called you
names, not only to your face - but behind your back ... names that
are unmentionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray adds: ''At one time in my life, I would say things without
thinking, without factual foundation ... I beg your forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she was releasing the letter to show that ''there's
a history of these kinds of charges coming from the people in
question. They've been false in the past. They're false now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign also released a statement from President
Clinton in which he said: ''I was there on election night in 1974
and this charge is simply not true. It did not happen. My wife has
stood for social justice and tolerance and against racial and
religious hatred and bigotry for as long as I have known her. It's
unfortunate that people would try to exploit false charges like
this in an election rather than look at what she has done for her
entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton characterized the controversy as ''a continuation
of the politics of personal destruction that I think is so bad for
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her news conference, the allegation had not been widely
reported outside of weekend stories in the New York Post and the
New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   She indicated that her advisers had debated the best way to
respond, saying: ''We had a lot of difficult conversations about
it, because my policy for the last eight years has largely been
just to absorb whatever insult, whatever charge, whatever
accusation anybody says, and not respond because they are so
outrageous and so unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the suicide of her friend Vincent Foster, she
added: ''I've been accused of everything, from complicity in murder
to you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she decided to issue a full-force denial in this case to
ensure that ''anyone who tries to get someone else to believe this
will at least have to say, 'Well, she says it's not true.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice filled with exhaustion and exasperation as she added:
''You're darn right it's not true. It's absolutely false. I'm just
sick and tired of this kind of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, her voice broke with emotion and she appeared to
be swallowing a sob as she said: ''I'm very angry. But you know, I
learned a long time ago that the people who generate this kind of
stuff are really hoping to divert attention from what's important
in a campaign or what any of us are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester, who is Jewish, stood next to
Clinton during the press conference and told reporters she came to
offer support because ''there's no way Hillary could make a
statement like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only the third time reporters have been invited on the
Clinton property since she moved there in January.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent in the New York Senate race,
Rep. Rick Lazio, was repeatedly asked by reporters to speak about
the controversy during two public appearances Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's best if I don't comment on it,'' he told
reporters in upstate Norwich.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer, the author, defended his claim, telling CNN Sunday
that his research also showed that ''Mrs. Clinton, who says she's
never used such language, heard that kind of language while growing
up.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pipeline Blast Kills Dozens  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Just days after an explosion in southern
Nigeria killed 200 people scavenging fuel, an unrelated pipeline
blast Sunday left dozens dead, witnesses and reporters said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest explosion occurred in the early morning on a river
between the villages of Ifie and Ijala, 3 miles south of the oil
port of Warri, a reporter for Lagos' Vanguard newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims were believed to be vandals using
sophisticated pumps to suck the fuel from the pipeline into metal
drums loaded on several boats, witnesses said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what sparked the blaze, which caused the fuel
drums to explode and spread a slick of fire across the water
surface. A number of boats were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheddy Ozoene, a spokesman for the Delta State government, said
16 people were confirmed dead and 10 were seriously injured. He did
not rule out the possibility of other casualties. In the past,
government officials have downplayed the seriousness of pipeline
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's blaze was extinguished within a few hours, Ozoene
added.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James Ibori was ''deeply saddened'' by the latest accident
and ''particularly worried'' by its occurrence so recently after an
explosion north of Warri killed 200 people and injured dozens of
others last Monday, Ozoene said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know why this is happening around the same time and
around the same area,'' he said.

<P>
   Pipeline vandalism, known as ''scooping,'' is common in Nigeria
despite the risk of a deadly fire or punishment including
prosecution or being shot on sight by police.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, more than 700 people were killed in a pipeline
blast in Jesse. Since then, the government has tried to educate
villagers about the danger of scavenging pipeline fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty and residents' anger at the government and oil
industry for allegedly polluting the environment and financially
neglecting the oil-rich Delta have kept the illegal practice alive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims in last week's explosion were poor
villagers, including young children, who were scooping up the fuel
in containers to sell along the roadside. The victims' families
hurriedly buried bodies in shallow graves and whisked many of the
injured into hiding to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have blamed organized crime cartels of organizing the
pipeline-scavenging business and some have accused police and state
oil company officials of also being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of oil imported by the United States.

   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - Angry and emotional, Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Sunday firmly denied allegations from a forthcoming book
that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to unequivocally state it never happened,'' the first
lady said during a hastily scheduled news conference to discuss the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation comes from a book due out this week, ''State of a
Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,''
by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for Bill Clinton's
unsuccessful Congressional campaign in Arkansas in 1974, as
claiming that Mrs. Clinton called him a ''Jew b-----'' after Bill
Clinton lost the election. Fray's wife said she witnessed the
incident, and a third person, Neil McDonald, claimed to have heard
the obscenity as he stood outside the room.
</P>
<P>
   Previous biographies have mentioned the argument but none
mentioned any slur.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Clinton Senate campaign released copies of a
handwritten letter from Fray to Hillary Clinton, dated July 1,
1997, in which he states: ''I have wronged you. I ask for your
forgiveness because I did say things against you, and called you
names, not only to your face - but behind your back ... names that
are unmentionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray adds: ''At one time in my life, I would say things without
thinking, without factual foundation ... I beg your forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she was releasing the letter to show that ''there's
a history of these kinds of charges coming from the people in
question. They've been false in the past. They're false now.''
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't comment what sort of statements Fray was
apologizing for in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign also released a statement from President
Clinton in which he said: ''I was there on election night in 1974
and this charge is simply not true. It did not happen. My wife has
stood for social justice and tolerance and against racial and
religious hatred and bigotry for as long as I have known her. It's
unfortunate that people would try to exploit false charges like
this in an election rather than look at what she has done for her
entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer on Sunday defended his claim. He told CNN that his
research also found that ''Mrs. Clinton, who says she's never used
such language, heard that kind of language while growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton indicated that her advisers had debated the best
way to respond to the allegations, saying: ''We had a lot of
difficult conversations about it, because my policy for the last
eight years has largely been just to absorb whatever insult,
whatever charge, whatever accusation anybody says, and not respond
because they are so outrageous and so unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she decided to issue a full-force denial to ensure that
''anyone who tries to get someone else to believe this will at
least have to say, 'Well, she says it's not true.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''You're darn right it's not true. It's absolutely false,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, who is Jewish, stood next to Clinton during the
press conference and told reporters she came to offer support
because ''there's no way Hillary could make a statement like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent in the New York Senate race,
Rep. Rick Lazio, declined to comment on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 9, Marlins 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- B.J. Surhoff homered in a four-run sixth inning
and the Baltimore Orioles avoided one jam after another Sunday in a
9-5 victory over the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields hit a three-run homer for the Orioles, who were
coming off three straight losses to Atlanta. Baltimore (39-51)
avoided falling a season-high 14 games under .500 and improved to
3-7 against Florida since interleague play began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Wilson had three RBIs for the Marlins, who went 3-for-20
with runners in scoring position and stranded 15 runners. Florida
got at least one runner in scoring position in every inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd went 3-for-3 with two walks, and Marlins right
fielder Mark Kotsay had three assists, one short of the major
league record.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles paid a price for attempting to be aggressive on the
basepaths. Two runners were thrown out trying to steal, two more
were tagged out seeking to stretch single into doubles and another
was caught off first base on a flyball.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, because the Orioles got 16 hits off five
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore trailed 4-3 in the sixth before Surhoff homered on the
second pitch from Vic Darensbourg (4-1), and three batters later
Charles Johnson hit an RBI double off Ricky Bones. Ivanon Coffie
then delivered his first major-league hit, an RBI single, and Brady
Anderson followed with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick and Albert Belle hit RBI singles in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills (2-0) got the win and Mike Timlin, the sixth
Baltimore pitcher, got five outs for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins got a run in the first inning when Floyd walked with
two outs and scored on a double by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Florida's Luis Castillo singled and scored when
Floyd bounced a double past the drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   After having would-be base stealers thrown out in each of the
first two innings, the Orioles took a more direct approach in the
third, going up 3-2 when DeShields followed a pair of walks with a
drive over the right-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   A sacrifice fly by Wilson made it 3-3 in the fifth. Kotsay threw
out Anderson and DeShields at second base in the bottom half, tying
a major league record for assists by an outfielder in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Florida went up 4-3 in the sixth. After Orioles starter Pat Rapp
gave up a walk and a single, Chuck McElroy walked Floyd to load the
bases and Mills walked Wilson on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo recorded his major league-leading 39th steal. He
went 2-for-6 and is 17-for-36 during an eight-game hitting streak.
... DeShields' homer was his first since May 7. ... Rapp is the
Marlins' career leader in wins and losses.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Charges to Second Players Win  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Raymond Floyd birdied three of the last
four holes and won his second Senior Players Championship title by
one stroke when Dana Quigley bogeyed the last hole Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, the 1996 champion who started the day at 9 under, six off
the pace, shot 6-under-par 66 for a 15-under 273 total.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who has never won a major championship, shot a 71 to
tie for second with Larry Nelson. Nelson had a round of 67 despite
playing the last seven holes without a putter.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite, seeking his third win and second major of his first
season on the senior circuit, took a two-stroke lead over Quigley
into the final round, but shot himself out of contention with a
final-round 76.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Hale Irwin, also seeking his second major
title of the season, had a round of 66 to tie Mike McCullough at
275. McCullough shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's 12-foot birdie putt up a ridge at No. 18 got him to 15
under and pulled him into a tie with Quigley, playing in the final
threesome of the day, one group behind Floyd's group.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who spend 13 years as a club pro in Rehoboth, Mass.,
before joining the Senior PGA Tour, needed only to par the final
hole to force a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   But he pulled his tee shot left, down the bank guarding some
marshland. Quigley, who strained his left leg slashing the ball
out, left his approach short of the green and ended up two-putting
from 25 feet for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   When Quigley's putt to save par curled right of the hole, Floyd
-- watching from nearby -- got a champion's hug from his wife, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, the battle seemed to be between Quigley and
Kite.
</P>
<P>
   With Kite making some uncommon mistakes, Quigley made a three
stroke swing on the front nine, going from three strokes behind to
one ahead at the turn.
</P>
<P>
   As a little yellow airplane buzzed overhead pulling a banner
reading: ''Play for Pay,'' Kite left a makable 6-foot birdie put
short at No. 3, a 547-yard par 5. He got a got a break when
Quigley's 1-footer for birdie lipped out, but this was clearly a
sign that Kite might be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, playing in the 99th straight tournament for which he's
been eligible, rolled in a 20-foot putt to save par from the sand
at No. 4, and picked up a stroke when Kite two-putted for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the battle was on and Quigley led Kite by one stroke at
the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Kite looked like he might be getting things together when he
birdied No. 11 to even the match at 15 under. But he hit his tee
shot into the water at the 12th, failed to get his approach on the
green after a drop, and made double-bogey to fall into a tie with
the hard-charging Nelson at 13 under, two back of Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, playing in the threesome with Nelson in the group just
ahead of Kite and Quigley, joined the hunt with birdies at No. 11
and 12 to go 13 under, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kite birdied the par 5 13th from 4 feet and closed within one
shot of the lead as Quigley found a greenside bunker with his
approach and settled for par.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, Kite's swing let him down.
</P>
<P>
   His approach to No. 14, the signature hole at the TPC of
Michigan, landed in some thick brush on the face of the bluff along
the long marsh fronting the green. Kite's third shot hardly moved
and he finally made a left-handed swing to get the ball on the
green where he two-putted for double-bogey to drop three strokes
off the pace at 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, however, bogeyed the hole and now led by just one --
over Irwin and Floyd. Irwin birdied the 16th to get to 13 under but
his charge ended with pars on the last two holes.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-foot birdie at the par 3 15th got Quigley back to 15 under,
however, restoring his two-stroke edge.
</P>
<P>
   But only briefly as Floyd birdied No. 16 to get to 14 under.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, meanwhile, putting with a 3-iron after bending his
putter after missing a putt earlier on the back side, eagled the
par-5 17th from 15 feet to jump into a tie with Floyd at 14 under,
one back of Quigley. But a par at the home hole ended Nelson's
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Kite's tumble continued with a bogey at No. 16 to fall
hopelessly out of contention at 11 under. His second shot on No. 17
was short and in the water for another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who has won four major championships on the senior
circuit to go along with his four majors on the regular PGA Tour,
is the third two-time winner of the Senior Players Championship,
joining Arnold Palmer and Dave Stockton.

<HEADLINE> Clubs out of luck in search for dealers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - The phone calls come in several times a day to
Joel Lauer's school for casino dealers. Downtown joints need craps
dealers, blackjack dealers, newly trained, to run the table games
at the Strip's less-fortunate stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's a really bad situation they say, 'Send someone right
now,' '' Lauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Casino executives say record low unemployment levels nationwide
have made it more difficult to find qualified front-line workers
and managers.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the Las Vegas megaresort construction and the
national spread of casino gambling, there's a constant demand for
dealers, housekeepers, computer experts and managers at properties
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown's El Cortez is known as a break-in house, the sort of
place where dealers go to complete what serves as an apprenticeship
before moving on to the big-tip gambling halls of the Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While hourly wages generally are similar from Fremont Street to
the Strip - about $5.15 - it's the tips that lure hungry rookies to
Las Vegas Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than earning $35 a day at Fremont Street casinos, dealers
on the Strip earn $100 to $200 nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Cheung has been working at the El Cortez for 27 years. The
pit boss says he's regularly on the phone with local dealer schools
searching for help.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, new dealers spent 18 to 24 months learning
their trade at Jackie Gaughan's hotel, Cheung said, but now they're
gone within four months. The Strip needs them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the allure of casinos in Illinois, Indiana,
Missouri and 21 other states that steal Las Vegas workers.
</P>
<P>
   The result: casino floors dotted with relatively underskilled
dealers and managers who require intensive on-the-job training to
prevent customer frustration and con-man hustles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quality is not as high as before,'' Cheung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST SENECA, N.Y. (AP) - An 18-year-old boy was critically
injured when he fell off a 60-foot cliff as he fled police who were
investigating a loud house party.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people scattered at 3:45 a.m. Saturday when West Seneca
police showed up at 20-year-old Douglas Gorecki's house to check on
neighbor's complaints. During his flight, Joshua Hill ran through
brush and tree cover in Gorecki's back yard and fell off the cliff,
onto the rocky shore of Cazenovia Creek. Police speculate he never
saw the drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered massive head injuries and was in critical condition
Sunday in the trauma intensive care unit at Erie County Medical
Center in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragic accident brought on by consumption of alcohol by
underage individuals,'' Detective Lt. Dale H. Wight said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorecki, who threw the party while his parents vacationed in
Florida, was charged with creating a criminal nuisance and
violating the town's noise ordinance. He also was taken to the
hospital in a distraught emotional state because of the accident,
Wight said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Hill had brought his own beer to the keg party
and was sharing it with a friend.

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- J.T. Snow hit a go-ahead, three-run homer
in the sixth inning Sunday as the San Francisco Giants beat the
Texas Rangers 6-4 for their 10th win in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's homer, which cleared the right-field wall of the Giants'
new bayside ballpark but fell just short of a splash landing in
McCovey Cove, came off Esteban Loaiza (5-6) and put San Francisco
ahead 4-3. It followed Barry Bonds' leadoff walk and Jeff Kent's
single. Bobby Estalella added an RBI single off Francisco Cordero
later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia extended the Giants lead in the eighth with a solo
homer that left fielder Rusty Greer complained was interfered with
a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Estes (9-3), who hasn't lost in six starts since June 10
against Seattle, allowed four runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings.
Alan Embree allowed a seventh-inning sacrifice fly to Greer, and
Robb Nen got three outs for his 20th save in 25 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza gave up five runs and eight hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez put the Rangers ahead with a run-scoring grounder
in the first, but Bonds hit an RBI double off the center-field wall
in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants manager Dusty Baker said he will rest Jeff Kent on
Monday, which would be just the second time this season the second
baseman hasn't started. Kent, who leads the National League with 85
RBIs, recently had stomach flu and dropped 12 pounds. ... Baker
needs two more victories to match Leo Durocher with 1,160 for third
place on the Giants' career list. ... Livan Hernandez is scheduled
to make his 100th career start Monday against Ryan Glynn. ... David
Segui started at first base Sunday, marking his 1,000th career
appearance at the position. ... Sunday was Until There's a Cure
Day, the Giant's annual fundraiser for AIDS research and treatment.
The Giants and the Rangers wore red ribbon insignias on their
uniform.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks Intensify  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton carried his Middle East
summit talks into a sixth day Sunday focused on the contentious
issues that separate Israel and the Palestinians in their reluctant
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day in which the president burrowed into details. He
met twice with American mediators and experts, who have grappled
with the issues over the long haul, and then Clinton held a joint
meeting with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''These issues are difficult. The atmosphere can be tense,''
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said as Palestinians floated
reports of progress and Israelis dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, a longtime advocate of
accommodation with the Palestinians, told Israel's army radio that
talks were at a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard at this point to give some kind of impression of
optimism more than yesterday or the day before yesterday, because
there has not been a breakthrough,'' said Beilin, the architect of
the 1993 accords that began Israel's retreat on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like to wrap up by late Tuesday an agreement on
all key issues, including what is to become of Jerusalem and how
much land a Palestinian state will encompass. He is scheduled to
fly Wednesday to Japan for an eight-nation economic summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to say whether Clinton would be able to keep
his commitment. Nor would the spokesman say how Clinton was doing
in try to prod the two sides into a pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that there is a news blackout, we are not going to
comment on any progress or lack of progress,'' he said as Clinton
began an evening session with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   All sides have agreed to refrain from discussing with reporters
the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Clinton sat at dinner between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak. While not disclosing the substance of
their talks, Lockhart said, ''The dinners have always had a
positive feel to them because of the inherent atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ''I don't want to create the false impression that
because they come together each evening for a meal in a positive
atmosphere that that permeates all the discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak entered negotiations prepared to relinquish more land to
the Palestinians, give them a foothold in Jerusalem, permit
thousands of refugees to be reunited with relatives in Israel and
dismantle most Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, Arafat held to his primary demands: a state
with its capital in Jerusalem, control of virtually all of the
territories and return to Israel of some 2 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is likely to turn on whether Barak sweetens his offer
or Arafat compromises. And the clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Gadi Baltiansky, the Israeli spokesman, said Barak would not
like to stay away from Israel for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political support is shaky. Three parties have quit his
coalition government, and Foreign Minister David Levy refused to
accompany the prime minister to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional breakout at home, Israeli security forces
evacuated 30 young Jewish settlers from a renegade West Bank
outpost they had set up to protest possible concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''the country must not be lost,'' at least 100,000
protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday to send a strong message to
Barak that his people would not accept broad concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian delegation sources at Camp David signaled optimism
Sunday about concluding an overall accord. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, they reported progress on some of the issues on the
table. Until now, Palestinian assessments had been largely
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jerusalem, several Israeli Cabinet ministers who spoke by
telephone with Barak said there was no basis for a claim of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was particularly downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am worried,'' Levy told reporters in Jerusalem. ''The
situation there is far from an easy one, and there is no sign that
the gaps are narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine National Council,
told CNN, ''I certainly would not hold my breath because it's not
easy.'' She cited the contentious issues of Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   --A Sunday report in The Washington Post that the United States
might spend $15 billion or more over the next few years to
implement a peace deal was described as premature by the Senate
majority leader. ''I think that's way too high, but we'll just have
to see,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' He
added: ''We want Middle East peace, but we better be very careful
with how those dollars are used.'' For example, the idea of paying
resettlement costs for Palestinian refugees bothers some senators,
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   --The presidential campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and
Republican George W. Bush said the candidates were called Saturday
by Barak and given updates on the talks. The campaigns
characterized the conversations as friendly and reported that Barak
said both the Israeli and Palestinians delegations were working
diligently.

<HEADLINE> Female Street Luger Makes Debut  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- She has a spray of fuchsia hair, wears a
helmet that says ''Spanked by a Chick,'' and expresses herself
through exclamations such as ''rad,'' ''gnarly'' and
''absolutely!''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Pamela Zoolalian.
</P>
<P>
   A speed queen of her own domain, Zoolalian is the only female
street luge competitor in the Gravity Games, a showcase for
alternative athletes with daredevil impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Running through July 23, the games feature 14 events in seven
different ''adrenaline sports,'' including aggressive inline
skating and downhill skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   Zoolalian has mastered street luging, a sport where competitors
lie down on modified skateboards and race at 60 mph. She soars down
pavement, takes sharp turns and propels herself with brute upper
body strength.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing she doesn't have working in her favor is gravity.
</P>
<P>
   At 110 pounds, she weighs half as much as some of her
competitors, a factor she says scares most females away from the
sport. For her, it just means she's ''got to go bigger, fall harder
and get up quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's what gave me the level of respect that I've
gotten because the guys see me just take the hardest knocks, get
up, shake it off and go again,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Zoolalian finished 23rd Sunday in the four-man street luge
competition, and 16th in the six-man street luge.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are high in this game. Competitors ''lean'' steer with
their upper body and brake with their feet ''Barney Rubble style.''
The smell of burning rubber hangs in the air and smoke sometimes
puffs from the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   While luging, Zoolalian goes through a pair of thick-soled
tennis shoes a day and has to be especially careful about braking
with parts of her feet where skin has been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   One bad move could land her on top of another competitor -- or in
a bale of hay, as she did two years ago, smashing her ankle in
three places.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's just four people side by side going through the
tightest part of the course and we all trust each other and know
that we can make it and we do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to keep the wheels on the ground, but that doesn't
stop some people from going airborne. ''We're going at mach speed
with nothing to protect us but just our wits, so to speak,'' she
said. ''I mean, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoolalian has been luging since 1995. She began after she saw
the sport on ESPN, then ran into a friend who took her to Home
Depot for a two-by-four, some plywood and aluminum tubing. They
took a 2 a.m. renegade run and she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Colabella, 37, a competitor who has known Zoolalian
since she joined the sport, says she is not easily scared off. He
recalls a time when she spun out of control, flew off her board and
cartwheeled in the air. The impact left her with a bad shoulder
abrasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''She got right back on her board and went down and practiced
the rest of the night,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Zoolalian could just be the thing the games need to attract more
than men, says Gravity Games spokesman Andy Erbelding. ''The kind
of publicity that she's been generating ... it's going to be great
for the sport, period, especially for other females who want to
come and try it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoolalian, a junior girls sportswear designer from Pasadena,
Calif., won't reveal her age on the philosophy that her strides
shouldn't be measured by the number of years she's had to
accomplish them.
</P>
<P>
   She's proud of what she's done and says the risk is worth it.
And besides, she knows she's already here against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   That must be worth something.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys know that in the right situation ... I can absolutely
kick their butt,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Canada Tornado Toll Reaches 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- The death toll from a tornado that
devastated a Canadian campground rose to 10 Sunday, after a victim
in an Edmonton hospital died overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not identify the man, but he was believed to be
one of three critically injured patients at the Royal Alexandra
Hospital. Another two remained in stable condition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They were among hundreds hurt Friday evening when a tornado
ripped through the Green Acres trailer park and campground on the
shores of Pine Lake. Rescue workers continued checking the wreckage
of the campground Sunday, and it was feared more victims might be
found by divers combing the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find survivors had been hampered by the lack of an
accurate list of people staying in the 429 trailers parked on the
edge of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many people were here? We really don't know,'' Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Constable Dan Doyle said. ''That's the
dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine McFadden of the regional health authority said more than
130 people received a range of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Police and the medical examiner were not releasing victims'
names Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Red Deer hospital worked through Friday night
repairing scores of fractures. The regular staff was augmented by
200 extra nurses and 50 doctors, including some from other
provinces who were passing by or in Red Deer attending a gospel
music conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a tremendous response,'' McFadden said. ''It has been
very overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The twister razed trailers and launched debris clear across the
lake. One witness said the clouds boiled up like smoke from a
campfire as the storm descended. Some boats were blown right across
the lake. One 14-foot aluminum boat was wrapped like paper around a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The worst came true for Scott Provan, whose mother was killed by
the twister. He was driving in from Calgary to meet his parents,
who were camping at Pine Lake, when he saw a wall of black in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the Green Acres trailer park and campground
moments after the tornado hit, Provan was greeted by an eerie
silence. Then he began hearing the desperate cries for help and
seeing the bloodied victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was walking around in a daze,'' Provan said Sunday.
''I couldn't comprehend what was happening. There were people
walking around all over the place covered in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trailers were on fire, probably fueled by propane, but
the flames quickly died under the pelting rain and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he found his weeping and injured father, who broke
the news to him. His father was taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Dudley, an emergency preparedness expert with Environment
Canada said even if people in the park had been warned, they might
not have been able to escape from harm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since it was on the ground only minutes before it got here,
there was very little time to get out,'' Dudley said. ''The access
route out of this park led right into the path of the tornado, so
there's very little they could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists were watching the storm build intensity in the
Rocky Mountain foothills all afternoon Friday. A number of alerts
were issued to news outlets before a severe thunderstorm warning --
which included the potential for tornadoes -- was issued at 6:18
p.m., 40 minutes before the storm struck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still trying to figure out if anyone heard it,'' said
Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Palsky, 68, was at a concert in Red Deer when news of the
tornado was announced in the auditorium. He and his wife rushed
back to find that rescuers had cut her parents from the wreckage of
a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife's mom and dad are in the hospital. They are both in
their 80s. It took us two hours to find them. They are both OK,''
Palsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch tourist Ewe Pulsch was still shaken a day after the storm.
He said clouds appeared to circle from three different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Two women camping with his group were taken to the hospital.
They managed to capture the storm on video but Pulsch said: ''I
can't watch it now. I'm still shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Help arrived late Saturday in the form of 100 soldiers from
Edmonton, along with a team of military divers and 10 field
engineers with experience in moving heavy debris.
</P>
<P>
   The shattered main building of the park was turned into a
makeshift morgue.
</P>
<P>
   As divers dragged the lake, assisted by police helicopters with
infrared search technology, others on land sifted through the
demolished vehicles and campers. Elsewhere, police and civilian
search teams using dogs hunted for survivors or bodies.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala 1, United States 1, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAZATENANGO, Guatemala (AP) -- With the heat building and the
clock running down, it looked as if the United States would open
World Cup qualifying with a victory on one of the most remote parts
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Then Carlos Ruiz scored in the 88th minute, lifting Guatemala
into a 1-1 tie Sunday and sending the Americans home with just a
point instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. team dominated the first half and took a 1-0 lead
on Ante Razov's injury-time goal, outshooting Guatemala 7-2, the
Guatemalans outshot the Americans 14-3 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And the home team tied it when German Ruano sent a long pass
downfield and Dwight Pezzarossi outjumped Greg Vanney, heading the
ball into the path of Ruiz, who beat defender Robin Fraser and
goalkeeper Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes earlier, Freddy Garcia nearly tied it when his
corner kick skimmed off Fraser's head and bounced off the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We earned an important point on the road,'' U.S. coach Bruce
Arena said. ''The conditions were difficult with the travel and the
heat, but it wasn't something we weren't expecting and it wasn't
something we weren't prepared for. Winning at home and taking
points on the road is what World Cup qualifying is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Razov scored for the third straight game. Earnie Stewart took
the ball at the top of the penalty area and sent it back to Claudio
Reyna, who quickly passed to Razov.
</P>
<P>
   Razov's shot deflected off defender Luis Swisher and beat
goalkeeper Edgar Estrada with 34 seconds to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The game originally was scheduled for Guatemala City but was
moved by the home team to this inland town, about 100 miles away.
The gametime temperature at Mazatenango was about 93 degrees, about
10 degrees warmer than in Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the heat was a big factor,'' Arena said. ''But I
thought the Guatemala players benefited from it more in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two nations in each of the three semifinal groups
advance to the six-nation finals of the North and Central American
and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a number of good opportunities, but only came through
when it was urgent,'' Guatemala coach Julio Cesar Cortes said. ''We
wanted to win but were very lucky to get a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other Group E game, Costa Rica was at Barbados. Next
Sunday, the United States is at Costa Rica before opening the home
portion of its schedule against Barbados on Aug. 16 at Foxboro,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In Group C, Mexico won 1-0 at Panama; and in Group D, Honduras
won 5-2 at El Salvador and Jamaica won 1-0 at St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
Notes: ESPN couldn't get its own feed on the air for the first
half and had to use the Guatemalan feed, with the Spanish-language
announcers occasionally heard in the background. ... Razov was
playing his 10th international game. ... The Americans returned to
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., immediately after the game.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rickey Henderson passed Babe Ruth on the career
hits list and scored the go-ahead run after his eighth-inning
triple Sunday as the the Seattle Mariners beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 6-3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was 3-for-5, moving into 35th place with 2,875 hits,
two more than Ruth. His first-inning double gave him 477, moving
past Zack Wheat into 50th place that list.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-3, Henderson opened the eighth with an
opposite-field triple off Russ Springer (2-3), a drive that fell
under the glove of right fielder Jason Conti and rolled into foul
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore walked and Henderson scored on Mike Cameron's
grounder, easily beating the throw from second baseman Jay Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plesac relieved and forced in a run with walks to John
Olerud and Stan Javier. Henderson added an RBI single in the ninth
off Matt Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa (3-5) pitched a perfect seventh, Arthur Rhodes had a
1-2-3 eighth and Kazuhiro Sasaki finished for his 21st save in 23
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Nelson Figueroa, making his third major league start,
allowed three runs and six hits in 5 1-3 innings. Seattle's Paul
Abbott gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings
</P>
<P>
   Arizona went ahead in the second on Conti's RBI triple, but
Seattle took a 3-1 lead in the fourth on Javier's sacrifice fly and
Joe Oliver's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa singled in the fifth, his first hit in three major
league at-bats, and scored on Bell's RBI groundout after he reached
third on an error on Tony Womack's infield single. Luis Gonzalez
followed with a game-tying single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Edgar Martinez struck out as a pinch hitter in the eighth,
ending a 13-game hitting streak. ... Arizona's Damian Miller was
1-for-4, ending his streak of four consecutive two-hit games. ...
The Mariners are 10-6 against the NL; the Diamondbacks are 5-8
against the AL.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Toll Free-Gambling,0288  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The FBI is investigating a gambling ring
connected to organized crime that uses a toll free 1-800 telephone
number and an offshore office in the Dominican Republic to take
bets.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and prosecutors say payoffs and collections are
made by members of a Mafia-linked group headed by one of western
New York's longtime bookies, Benjamin ''Sonny'' Nicoletti of
Lewiston in Niagara County.
</P>
<P>
   Nicoletti has not been charged, but the U.S. attorney's office
has filed papers in U.S. District Court regarding the suspected
gambling ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't talk about the case beyond what is stated in court
papers, but I can tell you, as far as the government concerned,
this arrangement is illegal,'' prosecutor Anthony M. Bruce said.
''Bookmaking has been outlawed in New York state. So if you have a
bookmaking operation and part of the bookmaking activity takes
place in New York state, we would definitely consider that to be
illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicoletti's attorney, Joel L. Daniels, declined to comment on
the allegations, except to say that he is aware the FBI is trying
to build a bookmaking case against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is based on allegations that Nicoletti is a
member or associate of the Buffalo La Cosa Nostra family and, as
such, controls illegal gambling in the Niagara Falls area,'' FBI
Special Agent Robert W. Utz said in court papers. ''Nicoletti
profits handsomely from this arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials believe the 1-800 ring allegedly run
by Nicoletti has been in operation since at least 1997 and takes in
millions of dollars in sports wagers each year.

Mideast Peace Talks Continue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton carried his Middle East summit talks
into a sixth day today focused on the contentious issues that separate Israel
and the Palestinians in their reluctant peacemaking. It was a day in which the
president burrowed into details. He met twice with American mediators and
experts, who have grappled with the issues over the long haul, and then Clinton
held a joint meeting with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. Clinton wants to
reach an agreement on all key issues by late Tuesday, including what is to
become of Jerusalem and how much land a Palestinian state will encompass.

Protesters Shout Messages to Barak

   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- At least 100,000 right-wing protesters massed in Tel
Aviv on Sunday Chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' to send a strong and
personal message to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad
concessions to the Palestinians. Many crowded into Rabin square, the site where
the late prime minister was assassinated in 1995 and shouted: ''We are the
majority, and the majority will win!'' Much of the crowd, estimated at 150,000,
had come by bus from settlements in the West Bank, from homes they fear they
might lose in a final peace agreement with the Palestinians. Others were members
of the opposition Likud party or other right-wing parties.

vice president of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said the delay in hearing
the cases is more evidence of ''persecution against pro-independence''
activists. The pro-independence protesters remain in jail awaiting trial because
they refuse to post bond, saying they do not recognize the federal court's

Bush: Abortion No Litmus for VP

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the urging of conservative Christians that he pick

presidential selection would be based on factors other than the candidates'

on the Family, who recently said the Republican nominee, ''cannot and will not''
be elected president if he ''does not energize his base'' of conservative
Christians.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Raymond Floyd birdied three of the last four holes
and won his second Senior Players Championship title by one stroke when Dana
Quigley bogeyed the last hole today. Floyd, the 1996 champion who started the
day at 9 under, six off the pace, shot a 6-under-par 66 for a 15-under 273
total. He's won four major championships on the senior circuit to go along with
his four majors on the regular PGA Tour. He's also the third two-time winner of
the Senior Players Championship, joining Arnold Palmer and Dave Stockton.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Race Held in Berlin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Europe's first elephant races went off without a
hitch Sunday despite protests by animal protection activists,
including French film diva Brigitte Bardot. Competitors were
rewarded with treats of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 spectators showed up at Berlin's Hoppegarten for the
event featuring six circus elephants from Africa and six from
India, paired off in as many races.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 to 35-year old elephants, urged on by the shouted
commands of their jockeys, pounded down 325-yard long stretch to
finish the course in about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Maharaja Cup'' was initiated by Ravindra Gujjula, the
Indian-born mayor of the small town of Altlandsberg, just east of
Berlin. Gujjula came to then-East Berlin in 1973 as an exchange
medical student and became a citizen in 1993, the year he was
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gujjula said before the races he saw them as a chance to promote
Indian culture in Germany and as way to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of India.
</P>
<P>
   At the races Sunday, Gujjula again defended them saying the
''the animals have fun.'' He also said that the number of
spectators showed it was a success, but that he had no further race
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists had been campaigning against the event
for the past month since news of it came out. But their petition
drives and fax campaigns and even a complaint filed with local
prosecutors failed to get it stopped.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Peacekeepers Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARU, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Helicopters on Sunday ferried 170 U.N.
peacekeepers to safety as other troops retreated on foot, ending a
dramatic rescue mission two months after the soldiers were
surrounded and cut off by Sierra Leonean rebels, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The air evacuation from the eastern town of Pendembu to nearby
U.N.-controlled Daru was complicated by gunfire from the rebels,
who have repeatedly embarrassed the U.N. force with attacks and
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Later a convoy of U.N. soldiers who assisted in the rescue,
along with a few of the freed troops, returned safely to Daru by
inching back on a muddy, pitted road after protecting the
helicopter landings Sunday, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes it is over,'' U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said.
''Everyone is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day operation, codenamed ''Khukrii,'' after a sharp
Indian knife, began Saturday morning when a team of Ghanaian,
Indian and Nigerian troops supported by British and Indian
helicopter gunships helped 222 Indian peacekeepers and 11 military
observers break out of the rebel stronghold of Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
   The troops' U.N. base had been under siege since early May. The
peacekeepers were never disarmed by the rebels, but the renegades
had recently begun preventing food and medicine convoys from
reaching the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Haringer Sood, an Indian officer who was among the trapped
soldiers, said the peacekeepers burst out of the base with guns
ready, catching the Revolutionary United Front rebels by surprise
in the surrounding jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started to break out it was a shock to the RUF
surrounding us,'' Sood said. ''They just did not know what had hit
them ... They saw us coming out all charged up and they just ran
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rebels pursued and shot at the escaping peacekeepers, who
fired back, Sood said. Sixteen vehicles stuffed with the
peacekeepers' supplies and belongings formed a convoy, Sood added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sustained gunfire, most of the troops walked 20 miles
down the muddy stretch of road to Pendembu, while 40 others -- the
observers and 29 injured and ill peacekeepers -- were flown out
Saturday. Kailahun is 200 miles east of Freetown near the Liberian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Near Pendembu, the freed peacekeepers linked up with another
U.N. contingent which fought its way up from the south. The two
groups spent the night in the town and most of the freed detainees
were flown to Daru by helicopter Sunday morning, while the relief
column provided covering fire, Indian Maj. Anthanarayan Arun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that could be taken out (by air) were taken out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pendembu, where the rebels had a major base, was virtually
destroyed in heavy fighting and the U.N. troops seized weapons and
equipment there that the rebels had stolen from peacekeepers in
May, said Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetley, the commander of Sierra Leone's
U.N. force, known as UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue contingent was returning Sunday by road to Daru. A
U.N. official said a number of Indian military drivers, who had
been among the detainees, were with the convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue came two months after the rebels reignited Sierra
Leone's eight-year civil war by launching attacks and capturing 500
U.N. hostages. Those hostages were disarmed, and released after
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the war, the rebels have systematically
killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians in a bid to gain
power through fear. They have abandoned three different peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Four peacekeepers were injured Saturday, but there were no known
U.N. casualties in Sunday's fighting, Arun said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels suffered numerous casualties in Saturday's fighting,
according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Daru, an impoverished farming town battered by years of
fighting, provides a key defensive base for the United Nations,
with its hillside trench defenses and clear view of surrounding
grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a sense, Daru is home,'' Arun said. ''It is as safe as any
fortified military locality can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jetley praised the rescue mission as a success, adding that the
peacekeepers planned further ''robust'' operations to secure Sierra
Leone towns threatened by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that by what has happened today, we have sent the
right message to the right people that UNAMSIL is a robust force,''
Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the freed observers, British army Maj. Andrew Harrison,
said he was informed of the rescue mission a day in advance when he
was sent a cryptic message by satellite phone disguised as a chess
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I can't be objective, but I felt it was time for
action -- and indeed swift and decisive action was taken,'' he said
after arriving being flown Sunday evening to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   During an initial period of captivity in May prior to joining
besieged U.N. troops, Harrison said he was threatened both
physically and verbally by the rebels, but declined to reveal
details. He praised the rescue operation as ''extremely
professional and extremely swift -- it's of great credit to the
people involved.''

<HEADLINE> France Honors Occupation Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Jewish leaders, Holocaust survivors and politicians
gathered in Paris Sunday for a national memorial day honoring
thousands of Jews who suffered crimes at the hands of the French
state during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The national day of recognition, voted on by parliament in
February, also honored those who helped or protected Jews during
the nation's wartime collaboration with the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   The frankly worded law recognizing ''victims of the racist and
anti-Semitic crimes of the French state'' marked another step in
France's acknowledgment of its role in deporting thousands who
later died in Nazi camps, and the day coincided with the 58th
anniversary of one of the worst incidents of collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people gathered at the former site of the Velodrome
d'Hiver, a Paris cycling stadium where at least 13,000 Jews were
rounded up on July 16 and 17, 1942 before being deported from
France to death camps.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Hajdenberg, president of CRIF, the representative council
of Jewish organizations, said France had ''deconstructed and
rebuilt'' its history within the past five years to take
responsibility for its wartime crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confronting its past with lucidity and courage, France emerges
stronger after this ordeal, and is calm at the last stage of a long
process,'' he told those gathered near a memorial marking the site
of the stadium, which was razed in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Some 75,000 Jews, including 12,000 children, were deported from
France to Nazi death camps between 1941-44.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a presidential decree established July 16 as a day
honoring victims of the roundups, and the anniversary was
commemorated regularly. The new law goes further, directly
incriminating the French state in the wartime crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago at a ceremony marking the stadium roundup,
President Jacques Chirac became the first president to publicly
acknowledge France's role in the deportations, issuing a
long-awaited public apology.
</P>
<P>
   Hajdenberg thanked Chirac for ''daring to break a taboo and
allowing the French to question their myths and their self-image.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Chirac's history-making speech, France has searched its
soul during revelations of systematic looting of Jewish assets by
the Vichy regime, and during the high-profile trial of Maurice
Papon, the former Vichy official convicted in April 1998 for
complicity in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin signed a decree
granting monetary compensation to Jewish children who were orphaned
during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's ceremony, Jean-Luc Melenchon, France's minister for
professional education, said the day of memory should be ''a day of
mourning and shame for the French.
</P>
<P>
   ''No generation of French people should feel unscathed by this
crime,'' he said.

   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Shane Bertsch won his first Buy.Com Tour
title Sunday, closing with a 4-under-par 68 for a four-stroke
victory over Tim Straub in the Upstate Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch, who earned $72,000, had a 19-under 269 total on the
Verdae Greens Golf Club course. Straub finished with a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch was coming off a career-best 64 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt comfortable heading to the first tee, but was a little
shaky on the first hole,'' Bertsch said. ''I have to admit I didn't
want to have too many 5-footers early and I had one on the first
hole and missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vance Veazey shot a 72 to finish third at 274, and Matt Peterson
was another stroke back after a 69.

<HEADLINE> US Crews Win 4 Rowing Medals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Sarah Garner and Christine Collins
finished second in the women's lightweight double sculls Sunday as
the United States crew teams won four medals at the Rowing World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Garner and Collins led for much of the race but were unable to
hold the lead in the final 500 meters, finishing in 7 minutes, 9.48
seconds -- 1.73 seconds behind Romania's Constanta Burcica and
Angela Alupei.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also won the bronze medals in the men's eight,
and women's quadruple and double sculls.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's eight, the crew of Phil Henry, Jamie Koven, Erik
Mueller, Mike Wherley, Ted Murphy, Sebastian Bea, Wolf Moser, Mike
Callahan, and Pete Cipollone had a time of 5:36.50. Britain was
first, followed by Australia. The Amercian team included only two
members of the three-time defending world champion men's eight --
Wherley and Cipollone.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's double sculls, Ruth Davidon and Carol Skricki
finished third behind Germany and Lithuania. Davidon and Skricki,
who also won the bronze in a World Cup race at Vienna last month,
had a time of 7:01.00 -- 5.68 seconds behind the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The USA1 team of Kelly Salchow, Laurel Korholz, Jen
Dore-Terhaar, and Hilary Gehman took the bronze in the women's
quadruple sculls, finishing 9.85 seconds behind gold medal-winning
Germany (6:19.68). Russia was second. The USA2 crew of Julia
Chilicki, Kate MacKenzie, Elizabeth Smith, and Leslie Burns Rawley
finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In other men's races, Conal Groom and Steve Tucker finished
sixth in the lightweight double sculls, behind Italy II, France,
Germany, Britain and Italy I; and Sean Hall, Ian McGowan, Jake
Wetzel, and Nick Peterson finished sixth in the quadruple sculls,
trailing Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia I and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft finished fifth in the final of the
women's pair, in which Romania, Australia and Canada took the top
three places.
</P>
<P>
   Four-time Olympic champion Steve Redgrave received a jolt when
the British coxless four finished fourth. The British quartet,
favored to win the gold at the Sydney Games, had lost in a photo
finish to New Zealand in Saturday's semifinal. The collapse in the
final was even more startling -- a finish behind Italy, New Zealand
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Germany won the Lucerne World Cup Regatta title with a fine team
performance, giving them the overall Rowing World Cup for a fourth
successive year with a total of 143 points. Australia was second on
100 points, while Britain was third with 93 points.

   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) -- In its first game since 13 fans died
from a stampede during a World Cup qualifier last weekend, Zimbabwe
beat the Seychelles 5-0 Sunday in a qualifier for the African
Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The game was moved to Barbourfields Stadium after FIFA banned

tear gas into the stands July 9, setting off the stampede, during
Zimbabwe's 2-0 loss to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwean team wore black arm bands in respect for the
casualties, and a minute of silence was observed before the game.
</P>
<P>

Peter Ndlovu and Nqobizita Ncube scored one goal each. Zimbabwe
advanced, winning the home-and-home series 6-0.

By The Associated PressAir Canada wants binding arbitration in pilot talks
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) - Air Canada said Sunday it has proposed binding
arbitration to settle the impasse in contract talks with its
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Calin Rovinescu, the airline's chief negotiator, said the
proposal was made Saturday, the day after contract negotiations
broke off.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the pilots association were expected to announce
Monday whether they intend to return to the bargaining table or to
take other measures.
</P>
<P>
   The other action could include starting rotating strikes or
giving the required 72 hours' notice for a full-scale strike that
could begin as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Canada announcement came on a weekend when union members
met in Toronto to review how the last two weeks of their contract
talks have gone.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had been bargaining since June 28, two days after
the pilots voted 92 per cent in favor of a strike to back their
contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, whose two-year contract expired April 1, say they're
paid far less than their counterparts who fly the same model of
planes for U.S.-based airlines.

Dr. Henry Morgentaler makes plea for more access to abortion
services
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) - The stabbing of a doctor who performs abortions
has reignited an emotionally divisive debate and prompted the
country's most famous abortion crusader to plead again for better
access.
</P>
<P>
   After expressing shock and outrage over the attack on Dr. Garson
Romalis, Dr. Henry Morgentaler lamented the hodge-podge state of
abortion accessibility in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to remain optimistic in the face of concerns that the
number of abortion providers appears in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis was stabbed outside his medical clinic Tuesday by a
suspect who escaped, but his injuries were not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time the Vancouver doctor had been attacked.
He was seriously wounded in 1994 when he was shot in the leg with a
high-powered rifle by a sniper hidden outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis became the first of five abortion doctors to be shot,
including one who was killed in New York state two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion accessibility is a theme dear to Morgentaler, and every
attack on an abortion provider heightens his concern.

Edward and Sophie introduce new, relaxed royal style in Prince
Edward Island visit
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTETOWN (AP) - Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of
Wessex, concluded their successful tour of Prince Edward Island on
Sunday, ending their first foreign state visit as a couple and
introducing a new royal style - and star - to fans.
</P>
<P>
   Royal watchers were dazzled by Sophie, and there were frequent
comparisons with Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a
Paris car crash three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The countess, a London businesswoman who married Prince Edward a
year ago, appeared relaxed and happy as she ploughed through the
busy three-day visit filled with walkabouts, endless receiving
lines and small talk with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay, who dined with
Sophie, said he was impressed with her thoughtfulness and her
commitment to helping poor and troubled families.
</P>
<P>
   Edward opened the annual meeting of the Canadian branch of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Charlottetown, urging
delegates to think carefully about the pros and cons of democracy.

Internationally acclaimed Canadian baritone Louis Quilico dies
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) - World renowned Canadian baritone Louis Quilico,
best known for playing the cursed hunchback jester in the opera
Rigoletto more than 500 times, died Saturday of complications from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old opera star suffered a blood clot after knee
surgery in June. He died Saturday from a cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   His niece, Anne-Marie Quilico, was among several Montreal
relatives preparing to leave for Toronto on Saturday to pay a
hospital visit to the singer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're rather floored by this,'' she said. ''We weren't
expecting it at all. It just happened suddenly and was a shock to
the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1925 in Montreal where his father owned the city's first
bicycle shop on popular rue St-Denis, Quilico made his stage debut
there at age 29 in a production of Boris Godunov.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the leading baritone quickly rose to stardom playing
more than 80 roles in his 46-year career at opera houses in
international cultural centers such as Vienna, Buenos Aires, Paris,
and Florence, Italy. He spent 25 years with the Metropolitan Opera
in New York city.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he appeared regularly with the Canadian Opera Company
and with the Opera du Quebec.

<HEADLINE> 2 Jump-Offs at US Track Trials  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Not since 1936 had there been a
jump-off to determine a berth on the U.S. Olympic track and field
team. On Sunday there were two.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's pole vault and women's high jump, it took the track
and field equivalent of overtime to determine the final Olympic
competitors in each event.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Acuff cleared 6 feet, 3&AMP;frac12; inches in a jump-off with Tisha
Waller to earn the third and final berth on the women's high jump
team. Chad Harting cleared 18-5&AMP;frac12; in the pole vault to win a
jump-off with Derek Miles and Pat Manson in the pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff, coming back from injuries that were the result of a car
crash three weeks ago on, of all places, Olympic Boulevard, in Los
Angeles, said she'd never experienced such pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cried afterwards,'' she said. ''I've never cried at a track
meet before. It made me cry. Make this jump and go to the Olympics.
Don't make it -- stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Waller, a three-time U.S. Outdoor champion, could hardly believe
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a height I usually could make blindfolded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COLOR OF VAULTING: As one of the few blacks who compete in the
pole vault, Lawrence Johnson thinks his color has worked against
him at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about it a lot,'' he said. ''I think I tend to get
under-ranked a lot of times because of that. But to me it's whoever
shows up to compete. The media can't make someone a champion. The
ranking won't make somebody a champion. It's who shows up and is
ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won Sunday's event to earn his second trip to the
Olympics, said he hopes he's an inspiration to young black
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even now, looking at the pole vault in high school and even
more so in college, I see a wave of black athletes starting to pole
vault,'' Johnson said. ''I really enjoy that. It's not something we
should shy away from. We should jump into everything.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CRASH DECISION: An auto accident ruined Bob Kennedy's plans to
double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the American record holder in the 3,000 and 5,000 and
considered the country's best distance runner, chose to skip Friday
night's 10,000 and run in Monday's 5,000 because he didn't think he
was in good enough shape to do both.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough decision,'' Kennedy said Sunday. ''For the last
12 months I've really, really wanted to run the 10, double at the
Olympic Trials and run the 10 in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with recent circumstances, the auto accident, that really
took me out of my training for quite awhile. I felt I didn't have
enough time, assuming I make the team, to prepare properly for the
10,000 meters at the Olympic Games at the level that I wanted to
compete at. That's the reason I chose the 5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the accident occurred May 8 a quarter-mile from his
home in Indianapolis. He was stopped behind a car that was
attempting to make a left turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''A car just hit me from behind going about 50 mph, pretty
hard,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   At first Kennedy felt fine. In five days of training, he had no
problem.
</P>

   ''On the sixth day, after a long run, my back just went crazy
and I couldn't run for quite awhile after that,'' he said.

   The doctor diagnosed it as a bruised vertebrae.

   CHINESE IMPORT: Chen Yueling is going back to the Olympics,
this time representing the United States instead of China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen won the gold medal in the 10,000-meter walk for China in
the 1992 Barcelona Games. On Sunday, she earned a spot on the U.S.
team by finishing second to Michelle Rohl in the 20,000-meter walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be wonderful to be able to go back to the Olympics,''
said Chen, who still holds China's 20-kilometer national record.
''I represented China before and now I can do the same for the USA.
I want do my absolute best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen didn't have an easy time in Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ''My stomach was hurting for the last 12 (kilometers) of the
race,'' Chen said. ''I felt the pain and it got worse as we went
on. I just told myself to keep going for another lap.''

   OLYMPIC SPIRIT: Marion Jones says she and her shot-putter
husband, C.J. Hunter, plan to get to Sydney early so she can soak
up some of the Olympic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a big women's soccer fan, so I plan to go see some of my
fellow Carolinians play on the team,'' she said. ''Of course I'm a
big women's basketball fan and C.J.'s a big wrestling fan, so we'll
get out and do some fun things. But once the competition begins
I'll be all business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who helped North Carolina to an NCAA women's basketball
championship, said she has talked to her Olympic idol, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, about what it's like at the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to experience the Olympic spirit that everybody talks
about,'' Jones said. ''I've talked to Jackie about it and she says
it's unlike anything you've ever experienced. C.J.'s tried to
relate to me how it feels, and on and on. That's what I want to
experience. That's what I want to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't think her celebrity status will get in her way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get to Sydney and I want to see what it's all
about,'' she said. ''I don't think it's hit me yet that I'm going
to be an Olympian.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Alzheimer's Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Federal researchers will get an additional
$50 million over the next five years for research into prevention
and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including the potential for a
vaccine, the White House said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Reagan's daughter Maureen Reagan, an activist
in the fight against the disease her father suffers from, welcomed
the announcement but said much more is needed. The organization
Maureen Reagan represents, the Alzheimer's Association, wants $100
million for research this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disease just gets worse every day,'' she said on CNN's
''Late Edition.'' Asked how the former president is faring, she
said, ''When I say not so good, Alzheimer's families know what I'm
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the White House was announcing a request for
research proposals that will total $50 million over five years.
Chris Jennings, White House health policy adviser, explained that
Congress is certain to fund at least this much Alzheimer's
research, based on President Clinton's budget request and the
popularity of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help build on preliminary findings made public
last week about the search for a vaccine against the progressive,
degenerative brain disease that afflicts 4 million Americans. The
aging of the baby boom generation will push the total to 14 million
by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Research ''provides new hope not only for Americans who are at
risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in the future but for those
who are already in its early stages,'' Clinton said in a statement
from Camp David, Md., where he is attending a summit conference
with Middle East leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmaceutical company said last week that preliminary results
from the first human study of a possible Alzheimer's vaccine
suggest the experimental compound is safe. Scientists said it is
far too soon to tell if the vaccine will do patients any good.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Pharmaceuticals' experimental vaccine raised hopes last
year when the company discovered that, in mice, the compound could
ward off and even reduce the brain-clogging plaque that is a
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Elan has begun small studies in people to see if the vaccine is
safe. If so, the company hopes to launch larger studies, possibly
by the end of 2001, to test whether the vaccine might slow
progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease disrupts the way the brain works, affecting
the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language.
Neither the cause nor the cure has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, one in 10 people over the age of 65 and as many as
half those over 85 have Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The disease costs the American health care system as much as
$100 billion a year, the White House said. The average lifetime
cost of caring for a patient with Alzheimer's disease has been
estimated at $174,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is more clear than ever that the nation must continue its
strong bipartisan support for biomedical research on the causes,
treatments, and cures for Alzheimer's disease and other diseases
affecting millions of Americans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was asked on
CNN whether the Clinton administration is stepping up its attack on
Alzheimer's partly because of pressure from Republicans in Congress
who have complained that Clinton was doing too little.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties have been competing with each other to put more
money into basic research, into clinical trials, particularly into
these prevention efforts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything we can do in the prevention area both here and abroad
makes a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Kennedy Crash Marked  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- One year ago, a late-night plane crash off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard claimed the life of one of America's
favorite sons.
</P>
<P>
   An entire nation grieved the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
Flowers were mounded outside the New York building where the couple
had lived, and photos of the former president's son filled the
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the first anniversary of the July 16, 1999, crash
passed quietly as relatives and friends mourned in private.
</P>
<P>
   A small driftwood memorial was built on the Vineyard's Philbin
Beach, closest to the area where the plane went down. But aside
from the wooden cross, which bore only the words: ''John, Carolyn
and Lauren,'' little was done to publicly recognize the tragic
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial,'' said Anne
McGhee, a Harvard University professor who has a home on Martha's
Vineyard. ''We just know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Freeman, mother of Carolyn, 33, and Lauren, 34, released a
statement from her home in Greenwich, Conn., last week saying the
family would not mark the anniversary publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., an uncle to Kennedy, 38,
planned to spend the weekend with his family at the Kennedy
compound in Barnstable's Hyannis Port section.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very quiet,'' said Barnstable Police Officer
James Ellis. ''We've had patrols out all week and we haven't had a
problem yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the waters late
at night, seven miles south of the Kennedy home on Martha's
Vineyard as he was flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory
Kennedy's wedding. The National Transportation Safety Board
determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy
likely became disoriented in the night sky.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Wins 400 at US Track Trials  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Johnson had no interest in
making history Sunday. He'll save that for September in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson held back a little while winning the 400 meters in 43.68
seconds Sunday in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, the
fastest time in the world this year. He beat the rest of the field
by nearly a full second.
</P>
<P>
   The time was just a half-second off the world record of 43.18 he
set last year in the World Championships. If he had run at top
speed Sunday, that record might have been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good the whole way. I worked the curve not as
aggressively as I usually do, because I felt I had a comfortable
lead,'' Johnson said. ''I wasn't trying to run any spectacular time
today, I was just trying to win the race. There's no reason to take
a risk at the Olympic trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Johnson will save his best in the 400 for Sydney, where
he'll attempt to become the first Olympian to win that event twice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has said all along his objective in the trials was to
win the 200 and 400, and make the U.S. Olympic team in both events.
He has not been concerned about his times, and even agreed to wear
a heart monitor and sensors on his ankles during races to measure
his body's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective is to feel smooth and easy. The objective is to
take it as easy as possible and relax,'' he said Saturday after
winning his semifinal heat. ''At this point, I really don't think
there's anything in my race I need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved to the front at about 100 meters Sunday and
clearly was the leader halfway through the race. His time matched
the 10th best in history -- Johnson has run eight of the fastest 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson will start preparing for this coming Sunday's 200,
where a duel with 100 champion Maurice Greene looms. The event is
the last of the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the defending Olympic champion in the 200, and holds
the world record in that event. Greene and Johnson have been
sniping at each other in recent days, adding some verbal intensity
to the upcoming showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an athlete, I'm not a trash talker,'' Johnson said. ''All
the things I've said this year have been in defense of what has
been said about me.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt Parliament Approves Changes  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's parliament, which some opposition
groups say is unconstitutional, unanimously endorsed amendments to
the election law Sunday, making the judiciary the only
vote-monitoring body, a member of Parliament said.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament, in recess since June, was called back into session
for this extraordinary meeting to discuss the amendments decreed by
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an unprecedented unanimous vote and all members
attended the meeting,'' said Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who heads the majority
National Democratic Party in Parliament. ''The majority, the
opposition and the independent members of Parliament all voted for
the amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, the Higher Constitutional Court ruled that only
members of the judiciary can head the committees overseeing polling
booths in parliamentary elections. A four-decade-old system
allowing civil servants to oversee the committees was
unconstitutional, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the ruling, Mubarak issued a matching decree, saying
the judiciary has the sole right to monitor the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling also allows elections to be held over three
weeks instead of on a single day, giving judiciary personnel time
to travel around the country. The more than 40,000 polling stations
also will be reduced to 18,000 to make it easier for the 6,000
judiciary personnel, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament that endorsed Mubarak's amendments on Sunday was
elected under the old law, which is now unconstitutional. Some
opposition parties have since raised questions about the
parliament's legitimacy, but the court stipulated that its ruling
was not retroactive, which would have created political chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Zeid said the ruling will be effective as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders and civil rights activists who have been
campaigning for independent supervision of the elections praised
the ruling, saying they hope November's parliamentary elections
will be more fair.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Wafd leader Yassin Serag-Eddine told Parliament that
Mubarak's quick response to the ruling ''proves his adoption of
democracy and freedom,'' Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Elections in the past have been marred by complaints of fraud,
charges the government denies. Mubarak's National Democratic Party
routinely sweeps the votes and currently controls 97 percent of the
seats in the 444-member parliament.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Rockies Pitcher Returns  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Seven months after being accused of pointing a gun
at his wife's head, Bobby Chouinard is trying to show the Colorado
Rockies he has put his problems behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, who returned to the majors Sunday for the first time
since his arrest on an aggravated assault charge, has stopped
drinking and attends counseling sessions twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Bible study is as much a part of his routine as studying
opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody makes mistakes, and obviously you want to redeem
yourself and make amends,'' Chouinard said. ''That's what I'm
trying to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old right-hander went 5-2 with a 2.68 ERA for the
Arizona Diamondbacks last season. His future became clouded when
police said he hit his wife Erica and pointed gun at her head on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Chouinard later said she was drunk and asked that the
charge be dropped, but her husband faces a trial Oct. 23. The
couple is still together, and Erica planned to be in the stands
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you get on the field, it's a little bit like a release,''
Chouinard said. ''You worry about baseball and pitching. You don't
worry about your legal issues and your trouble outside baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chouinard's request, the Diamondbacks released him before
spring training and Colorado signed him to a minor league contract
on June 17. Chouinard had a 3.63 ERA in nine games at Triple-A
Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not my job on the face of the earth to judge people,''
said Rockies general manger Dan O'Dowd, who talked to several
people before signing Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an organization, we don't condone this type of action, but
if we determine that somebody is deserving of a second chance,
we'll give them a second chance. Obviously if anything like this
comes up again with Bobby, he understands the consequences for his
career and his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's been told what will happen if he slips up,
Chouinard says simply: ''I think that's self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard was recalled from the minors after left-hander Scott
Karl was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower
back.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies on Sunday also placed catcher Scott Servais on the
15-day DL with a strained right calf and recalled catcher Ben
Petrick from Colorado Springs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Peace Talks Very Difficult  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday that he is
more optimistic about Middle East summit talks than when they began
six days ago but said the negotiations are more difficult than any
he's dealt with in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''God, it's hard,'' Clinton said in the first official
assessment of the talks' progress. ''It's like nothing I've ever
dealt with. All the negotiations with the Irish, all the stuff I've
done with the Palestinians before this and with the Israelis, the
Balkans at Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was hopeful that Israelis and Palestinians could
reach agreement on the contentious issues that still divide them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more optimistic than I was when they first got here,'' he
said. ''We might make it -- I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be totally misleading if I said I had an inkling that
a deal is at hand,'' he added. ''That's just not true. But we're
slogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his comments in an interview with the New York
Daily News on Sunday after burrowing into details of the talks. He
met twice with American mediators and experts, who have grappled
with the issues over the long haul. Clinton then held a joint
meeting with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, and he was
meeting Sunday evening with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really troubling is that they (the leaders) know that
if they make a peace agreement, half their constituencies will be
angry at them for a while,'' he said, according to a transcript
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying,'' the president said. ''It's so hard. My heart
goes out to them. It's really hard. It's the hardest thing I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A news blackout in force since the summit began prohibits the
parties from discussing the progress of the talks. But White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton's comments did not violate the
agreement, saying only the United States was allowed to speak about
the substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   As talks continued, Palestinians floated reports of progress and
Israelis dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, a longtime advocate of
accommodation with the Palestinians, told Israel's army radio that
talks were at a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard at this point to give some kind of impression of
optimism ... because there has not been a breakthrough,'' said
Beilin, the architect of the 1993 accords that began Israel's
retreat on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like to wrap up by late Tuesday an agreement on
all key issues, including what is to become of Jerusalem and how
much land a Palestinian state will encompass. He is scheduled to
fly Wednesday to Japan for an eight-nation economic summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped to finish up in time for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Clinton sat at dinner between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak. While not disclosing the substance of
their talks, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ''The dinners
have always had a positive feel to them because of the inherent
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart added: ''I don't want to create the false
impression that because they come together each evening for a meal
in a positive atmosphere that that permeates all the discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak entered negotiations prepared to relinquish more land to
the Palestinians, give them a foothold in Jerusalem, permit
thousands of refugees to be reunited with relatives in Israel and
dismantle most Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, Arafat held to his primary demands: a state
with its capital in Jerusalem, control of virtually all of the
territories and return to Israel of some 2 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is likely to turn on whether Barak sweetens his offer
or Arafat compromises. And the clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Gadi Baltiansky, the Israeli spokesman, said Barak would not
like to stay away from Israel for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political support is shaky. Three parties have quit his
coalition government, and Foreign Minister David Levy refused to
accompany the prime minister to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional breakout at home, Israeli security forces
evacuated 30 young Jewish settlers from a renegade West Bank
outpost they had set up to protest possible concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''the country must not be lost,'' at least 100,000
protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday to send a strong message to
Barak that his people would not accept broad concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian delegation sources at Camp David signaled optimism
Sunday about concluding an overall accord. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, they reported progress on some of the issues on the
table. Until now, Palestinian assessments had been largely
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jerusalem, several Israeli Cabinet ministers who spoke by
telephone with Barak said there was no basis for a claim of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was particularly downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am worried,'' Levy told reporters in Jerusalem. ''The
situation there is far from an easy one, and there is no sign that
the gaps are narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine National Council,
told CNN, ''I certainly would not hold my breath because it's not
easy.'' She cited the contentious issues of Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   --A Sunday report in The Washington Post that the United States
might spend $15 billion or more over the next few years to
implement a peace deal was described as premature by the Senate
majority leader. ''I think that's way too high, but we'll just have
to see,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' He
noted that paying resettlement costs for Palestinian refugees
bothers some senators.
</P>
<P>
   --The presidential campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and
Republican George W. Bush said the candidates were called Saturday
by Barak and given updates on the talks. The campaigns
characterized the conversations as friendly.

<HEADLINE> Rare Reptiles Killed in Australia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- About a thousand rare snakes, lizards
and other exotic creatures died Sunday in a fire at one of
Australia's most popular wildlife parks.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze tore through the Australian Reptile Park and Wildlife
Sanctuary north of Sydney, causing more than $600,000 worth of
damage and killing crocodiles, snakes, lizards, frogs, turtles and
platypuses.
</P>
<P>
   Two small turtles plucked from the smoldering ashes of the park
were the only animals known to have survived, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they had been unable to pin down the cause
of the fire and were continuing to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point there is nothing to indicate that it was of
suspicious origin,'' New South Wales Fire Brigade Captain Martin
Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old park was a popular tourist attraction, winning a
number of awards, including 1998 Best Regional Tourist Attraction
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It was also home to Australia's top snake and spider venom
milking station, providing antidotes to hospitals around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty firefighters took three hours to put out the fire after it
spread through the park's breeding enclosures and offices shortly
after midnight, fire brigade captain Martin Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   Park staff, many of whom had spent years collecting the rare
animals, underwent grief counseling Sunday, and buses full of
tourists were turned back from the gutted building.

about Middle East summit talks than when they began six days ago but said the
negotiations are more difficult than any he's dealt with in his presidency.
''God, it's hard,'' Clinton said. ''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with. All
the negotiations with the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians
before this and with the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.'' But he said he was
hopeful that Israelis and Palestinians could reach agreement on the contentious
issues that still divide them.

Protesters Chant Messages to Barak

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' at least
100,000 right-wing protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday to send a strong and
personal message to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad
concessions to the Palestinians. ''We are the majority, and the majority will
win!'' shouted many of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late
prime minister was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are often held.
Much of the crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from settlements in the
West Bank, from homes they fear they might lose in a final peace agreement with
the Palestinians.

   HAVANA (AP) -- After a 10-hour visit to Cuba that included a meeting with
President Fidel Castro, three U.S. senators called for an end to American trade
sanctions and improved relations between the two countries. While saying they
believe that Cuba still must open up its economy and grant freedom of expression
to its citizens, Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, and Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., said that it was time for Washington and Havana to improve
relations. The American lawmakers said improved relations would benefit both
countries and help prepare Cuba for an eventual change in leadership.

Hillary Clinton Denies Using Slur
</SUBHEAD>

   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today firmly denied
allegations from a forthcoming book that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years
ago. ''I wanted to unequivocally state it never happened,'' the first lady said,
angrily and emotionally, during a news conference. The allegation comes from a
book due out this week, ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill
and Hillary Clinton,'' by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for Bill Clinton's unsuccessful
Congressional campaign in Arkansas in 1974, as claiming that Mrs. Clinton called
him a ''Jew b-----'' after Bill Clinton lost the election.

first track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics. After
fouling on her first two attempts in the preliminaries, Jones soared 22 feet,
1&AMP;frac34; inches to reach the final. After leaping into the lead on her fourth
try with a wind-aided 22-7, then being overtaken by Dawn Burrell at 22-10 later
in round four, Jones responded with the winning jump of 23-0&AMP;frac12;, her best
in a year.

<HEADLINE> End to Cuba Sanctions Called for  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- After a weekend visit to Cuba that included a
10-hour meeting with President Fidel Castro, three U.S. senators
called for an end to American trade sanctions and improved
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   While saying they believe that Cuba still must open up its
economy and grant freedom of expression to its citizens, Sens. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, and Pat Roberts, R-Kan.,
said that it was time for the Washington and Havana to improve
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The American lawmakers said improved relations would benefit
both countries and help prepare Cuba for an eventual change in
leadership. Castro, who will turn 74 next month, has been the
nation's top leader since the triumph of the 1959 Cuban Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In their meetings with Castro and other top leaders, the
senators said they got the impression that a peaceful succession in
leadership was a primary concern. After arriving in Havana on
Friday, the senators met with Vice President Carlos Lage, National
Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon and a number of Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   During their stay, the lawmakers also discussed Cuba's human
rights situation with a group of the nation's best known political
opponents at the residence of Vicky Huddleston, head of the U.S.
Interests Section in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   While many Castro foes assume that the leader's passing will
automatically open the door to a market economy and representative
democracy, communist leaders maintain that the current government
and economic model will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''My impression is that (Castro) thinks it will be smooth and
that the tenets of what he believes will be preserved,'' Roberts
told an afternoon news conference before the three headed back to
the United States after their weekend visit. ''I don't think he is
planning on retiring anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the lawmakers said that the United States does not
have to wait for a change in leadership to begin improving
relations that could benefit people living on both sides of the
Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said a first step would be to lift U.S. trade
sanctions against Cuba that have been in place for nearly four
decades. All three support growing moves in Congress to eliminate
restrictions on sales of food and medicine to the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the embargo must go,'' Baucus said. ''It gives Fidel
Castro an excuse for failed economic policies.'' Just as important,
''it hurts American farmers'' who are looking for new markets for
their products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuba is no national security threat to the United States,''
Baucus said. ''We believe that the era of unilateral sanctions
should be fading away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cold War has been over for 10 to 12 years now,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, however, said that Cuba must be willing to do its part
by initiating market reforms that will make American trade with
Cuba viable. ''Free trade must involve sales to individuals and
realistic financing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas senator said he supported increased cooperation by
the two countries on issues of mutual concern, such as drug
interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program proposed by Republican Sen. Arlen Specter
following his visit to Cuba a year ago, about $1 million had been
set aside for joint interdiction efforts, Roberts said. He did not
provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Akaka, meanwhile, expressed interest in increased
educational exchanges between the two countries that would allow
American students to visit Cuba and Cuban students to visit the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cooperation in education could create a dialogue,'' Akaka
said.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Angels 5, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Reliever Alan Levine fielded Eric Owens'
bases-loaded bunt with two outs in the 10th inning, but dropped the
ball as he went to throw it to first and the San Diego Padres beat
the Anaheim Angels 6-5 in a wild finish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did San Diego waste a three-run lead in the ninth, but
Trevor Hoffman and Anaheim's Troy Percival, two of baseball's most
feared closers, both blew saves.
</P>
<P>
   After Padres rookie pinch-hitter Kory DeHaan doubled leading off
the 10th and took second on Ben Davis' groundout, Angels manager
Mike Scioscia pulled out all the stops. Al Martin was intentionally
walked and Scioscia went to a drawn-in, five-man infield against
rookie Kevin Nicholson, who struck out.
</P>
<P>
   With the infield back to normal, Ryan Klesko was intentionally
walked to load the bases. Owens pushed a bunt down the first-base
line and Levine (1-2) could have had a routine out, but dropped the
ball for an error as DeHaan scored.
</P>
<P>
   Donne Wall (3-2) pitched a scoreless 10th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres led 4-1 entering the ninth, but the Angels jumped on
Hoffman for four runs and four hits with just one out, with Mo
Vaughn hitting a towering two-run homer for a 5-4 lead. Kevin
Stocker, who hit a two-run triple, was aboard for Vaughn's 24th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth blown save in 27 chances for Hoffman, and only
his second at home since the beginning of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Percival then blew his sixth save in 27 chances. Al Martin
doubled leading off the ninth, was sacrificed by Nicholson and,
after pinch-hitter Klesko walked, scored on Owens' sacrifice fly.
Percival loaded the bases when he hit Ruben Rivera and walked Bret
Boone, but Phil Nevin struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Darin Erstad went 3-for-5, pushing his major
league-leading total to 152 hits, and Garret Anderson went 4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 4-0 lead when Boone, Joe Vitiello and Davis
homered with none out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit a leadoff homer to left, his 18th, to snap a scoreless
tie. After Nevin singled, Vitiello, making his Padres debut after
being promoted from Triple-A Las Vegas, hit an opposite-field shot
to right. Davis followed with an impressive homer that hit an
advertising sign on the face of the second deck, just inside the
left-field foul pole. All three homers came off Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Vitiello, who played 205 games with the Kansas City Royals from
1995-99, became the first position player to have a quick impact
for the Padres this year after a promotion from the minors. He went
3-for-4, tying his career high for hits.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Adam Eaton allowed one run and eight hits in 6 1-3
innings, struck out seven and walked two. Since beating Milwaukee
in his big league debut on May 30, Eaton has seven no-decisions and
one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, who beat San Diego during interleague play in 1998,
allowed four runs on six hits in six innings, struck out seven and
walked one.
</P>
<P>
   After wasting some big scoring chances earlier, the Angels got
their first run in the seventh when pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro
singled and scored on Erstad's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' leadoff batter reach base three of the first four
innings, but failed to score. Anaheim batters were 0-for-8 with
runners in scoring position in the first four innings, including
the fourth, when the Angels loaded the bases with none out. Eaton
walked Vaughn and Tim Salmon and gave up Anderson's single to
center that advanced Vaughn only to third. Eaton then struck out
Troy Glaus and retired Bengie Molina and Adam Kennedy on flyballs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson was back in the lineup after missing Saturday's
game at Los Angeles with a tender right knee. ... Vitiello became
the 45th player to play for the Padres this year. The club record
is 48 in 1991. ... Vitiello hit .350 with 11 homers and 46 RBIs for
Las Vegas and was voted player of the game in the Triple-A All-Star
game on Wednesday after going 3-for-4 with a double, triple and
three runs scored. ... OF Dusty Allen, who went 0-for-12 in nine
games, was optioned back to Las Vegas to make room for Vitiello.
... Vitiello started at 1B in place of Klesko, who came in with a
2-for-20 slump. ... Padres RHPs Brian Boehringer and Carlton Loewer
are scheduled to undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Raptors' Carter To Pay Puma $13.5M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Toronto Raptors star Vince Carter must
pay a sports apparel manufacturer more than $13.5 million in
damages for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston arbitrator's decision was announced Sunday in a
statement on Westford-based Puma North America Inc.'s Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Carter signed an endorsement deal with Puma in 1998 shortly
after being drafted by the Raptors, but announced late last year
that he had terminated the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator also issued an injunction ordering Carter not to
endorse or wear the apparel or footwear of Puma's competitors for
three years, and ordered Carter to pay Puma's lawyers' fees and
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator also dismissed Carter's claims against Puma.
</P>
<P>
   Jochen Zeitz, chief executive and chairman of the German
company, said in the statement ''the company is extremely pleased
with the outcome and feels completely vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Puma's Los Angeles lawyers, Norman Oberstein and Howard Horwitz,
said there will be more discussions with Carter and his
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign LB Darrin Smith  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIBODAUX, La. (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints signed free-agent
linebacker Darrin Smith to a one-year contract Sunday, leaving just
defensive end Darren Howard, the teams' first-round draft pick, out
of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's reportedly got the league minimum $440,000, though
incentives could push the deal to $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We discussed a lot of things,'' Smith said. ''I wanted a
multiyear deal, but we couldn't come up with it. I'm happy with the
deal I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith reported to camp late Saturday night and was on the
practice field Sunday. He can play either inside or outside
linebacker, but will be worked at left outside linebacker behind
Keith Mitchell to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll bring to us a veteran who can play all three positions
(at linebacker),'' said general manager Randy Mueller. ''He's good
in coverage, is real smart and is just the consummate pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an eight-year veteran who spent the last two seasons with
Seattle, played for Philadelphia Eagles in 1997 after spending the
first four years of his career with the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints released safety Amp Campbell to make room on the
roster for Smith.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Manager Johnson in Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was
hospitalized Sunday after experiencing dizziness caused by an
irregular heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 57, was in stable condition at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center in Inglewood. Dr. Michael Mellman, one of the
Dodgers' team physicians, said Johnson wasn't in danger and will
remain at the hospital for tests. This is the second such episode
involving Johnson within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things like this happen in individuals who have had this
problem before, so I wouldn't read anything into this at all,''
Mellman said. ''Right now there is no major problem. I'm very
comfortable with his status at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was driven to Verdugo Hills hospital in the morning by
his wife Susan and evaluated in the emergency room, where the his
problem was diagnosed. Several hours later, he was transported by
ambulance, at Mellman's request, to Centinela Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very unhappy about being in the hospital,'' Mellman said.
''And he's not very happy with me, because I told him to go to the
hospital instead of coming to the game tonight. That's Davey
Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Melman, who is treating Johnson until he selects a cardiologist
for the manager, wouldn't estimate the time until all the tests are
back. But he said he'd know more in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still gathering all the information,'' general manager
Kevin Malone said about two hours before the Dodgers played
Pittsburgh. ''I think the health of Davey is much more important
than anything else right now. We just hope we get him back as soon
as possible, and that he's feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played 13 seasons in the majors and helped
Baltimore win two World Series, reportedly has been in danger of
losing his job because of the Dodgers' 45-44 record heading into
Sunday night's game against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through this for six years in New York,'' Johnson was
quoted as saying in Saturday's Los Angeles Times. ''It didn't kill
me, and it didn't make me age 20 years in one year -- which it can
do. After the number of years I've been managing, I'm not going to
let it happen to me in LA. Believe me, it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in his second season as Dodgers manager, also managed
Baltimore for two seasons, Cincinnati for three and the New York
Mets for seven. In 1986, he guided the Mets to the World Series
title.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lives and dies with this,'' said catcher Todd Hundley, who
was called up to the majors for the first time by the Mets a week
before Johnson's firing in 1990. ''This year has taken a toll on
all of us, physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Tracy, in his second season as the Dodgers' bench coach,
will run the team in Johnson's absence. Tracy's last managerial
experience was in 1994, with Montreal's Triple-A Ottawa farm club,
when Malone was in his first season as the Expos general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''I received a phone call this morning alerting me to the fact
that Davey had been put in the hospital,'' said Tracy, who held a
closed-door clubhouse meeting that Malone attended. ''I made the
players aware of Davey's situation, and that's about it.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Was Scared of Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Michael Irvin was frightened about
spending 20 years in prison, the penalty that loomed if he broke
probation after pleading no contest to felony drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise you it was scary,'' the former Dallas Cowboys
receiver told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in an interview
published Sunday. ''So I'm glad it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin retired last week, a week after his probation ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry to the people I hurt,'' he said. ''I have said it
before, I have said it 100 times. You can never say it enough. I
don't know if people will ever forget it. They shouldn't. It is my
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 34, who is going into broadcasting, holds nearly every
major career or single-season team receiving record, and also
helped the Cowboys win three Super Bowls in four years.
</P>
<P>
   He caught 750 passes for 11,904 yards over his career. At the
time of his final play, in which he was temporarily paralyzed after
landing awkwardly on the turf at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium,
both figures were ninth in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   After pleading no contest in '96, he said, the fear began to
creep in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried about somebody saying I did something to set
them up, and I had no grounds to fight back,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You realize how one little thing can mean 20 years for you ...
But then you realize it ain't just me. I can do all of those things
and it still might not work out for me. That's scary.''

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Writer Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Journalist Alexandre Jose Barbosa
Lima Sobrinho, longtime president of the Brazilian Press
Association and believed to be the world's oldest practicing
writer, died Sunday of multiple organ failure. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima, as he was best known, was admitted Thursday night
into the intensive care unit of Casa de Saude Sao Jose with
respiratory problems. His condition worsened over the weekend and
he died Sunday morning, media reported.
</P>
<P>
   A respected political journalist and former politician, Barbosa
Lima was present during a number of key moments in the country's
political history.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of the press, he often said, is not a privilege of the
journalist, but a ''sacred right of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he ran for vice president in support of presidential
candidate Ulysses Guimaraes in a campaign against the
military-ruled Arena party. Despite the opposition's effort,
Congress supported Gen. Ernesto Geisel for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Barbosa Lima linked arms with millions of
Brazilians who took to the streets demanding that the military step
down and power be returned to the people.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, Congress turned to him to represent the Brazilian
people in signing a congressional document impeaching former
President Fernando Collor de Melo.
</P>
<P>
   His prolific career as a writer included 70 books and more than
5,000 articles he wrote for Jornal do Brasil, one of the country's
oldest daily newspapers. His last weekly column hit the stands the
morning he died.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist at heart, he defied corrupt politicians and
wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   On his 100th birthday, Barbosa Lima said there were two things
that had kept him living so long -- his wife Maria Jose, to whom he
was married for 68 years, and the will to fight for his country,
Globonews television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima was a three time congressman and governor of the
northeastern Pernambuco state.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima lived with his wife in the house they built decades
ago in Botafogo, a middle-class neighborhood in Rio's southern
district and where he kept a personal library containing some
60,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Despite old age, Barbosa Lima often displayed notorious good
humor and zest.
</P>
<P>
   About the glaucoma that claimed his ability to see with his
right eye, he once told Veja magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that's my glory as a leftist.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima is survived by his wife Maria Jose, three children,
and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was scheduled for Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> NFL Training Camp Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- While everyone focuses on the return of
running back Jamal Anderson, a healthy Chris Chandler might be just
as important if the Atlanta Falcons are to be playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson injured a knee in Game 2 a year ago and missed the rest
of the season after rushing for a club-record 1,846 yards in the
Falcons' run to the Super Bowl the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   He's back and practicing at Atlanta's training camp at Furman
University and hopes to be fully recovered by the start of the
regular season on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, meanwhile, has showed up in the best shape of his
career, and coach Dan Reeves is hoping for an injury-free season
and big things from his quarterback, who was an All-Pro in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our record shows we're a much better football team when he's
healthy,'' Reeves said. ''So just like Jamal, we're better when
he's in there, we're much better when Chris is in there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, 34, entering his 13th NFL season and fourth with the
Falcons, has a 24-16 record in 40 regular-season starts with
Atlanta, missing eight games due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Chandler missed four full games -- two with a
strained hamstring, one with flu-like symptoms and another with rib
and shoulder injuries. In addition, he started but failed to finish
four other games due to injuries. The Falcons finished 5-11, one
year after a 14-2 regular season and a Super Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
Patriots
</P>
<P>
   New England opened its first training camp under new head coach
Bill Belichick, who was hired Jan. 27 to succeed Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the team before they were given physicals Sunday
morning, Belichick stressed the Patriots had a ''relatively short
amount of time'' to prepare for the first preseason game on July 31
against San Francisco in Canton, Ohio, and the opener Sept. 3
against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thinks about ''Monday Night Football'' and ESPN
highlights and all the notoriety and all that comes from being a
pro football player,'' Belichick said. ''But the reality of it is
there's a lot of blood, sweat and tears that need to be
(sacrificed) on the field starting with training camp, and that's
what the players need to focus on and understand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the bigger part of the picture. The dessert comes
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots opened camp with a number of roster moves,
including making official the re-signing of six-time Pro Bowl left
tackle Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The team also signed defensive ends Bobby Hamilton and Brandon
Mitchell and waived wide receiver-kick returner Tony Gaiter.
</P>
<P>
49ers
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice reported to San Francisco 49ers training camp early
again, this time at the request of trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess they wanted to see what the old man could still do,''
the star receiver said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is plenty. Rice made the catch of the day Sunday,
stabbing, with one hand, Tim Rattay's pass thrown behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's left knee held up, despite the three surgeries he had on
it in 1997, after tearing two ligaments in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's Rice's right knee that bothers him now. He
practiced sparingly during the first half of last year because of
persistent swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have my fingers crossed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice took the field with 34 rookies Sunday, and is already
taking the new players under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in the huddle telling them what to do, telling them how
to get a feel for the coverage,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ''I
sat back and kind of watched it, and it was kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
Browns
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland signed third-round draft choice Travis Prentice to a
four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, a running back from Miami of Ohio, holds NCAA records
with 468 points, 73 rushing touchdowns and 78 total touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Prentice practiced with
the team Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The signing leaves the team with one unsigned draft choice,
second-round pick Dennis Northcutt, a wide receiver from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Eagles
</P>
<P>
   While practice for the team's veterans doesn't officially begin
until Thursday, defensive end Hugh Douglas and offensive tackle
John Welbourn joined Philadelphia rookies in training camp Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were injured last year. Douglas was limited to four
games because of a knee and torn biceps injury, while Welbourn tore
his left patellar tendon in the first half of the first game and
missed the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles began the rookie portion of their training camp
without first-round draft pick Corey Simon, a defensive tackle from
Florida State, or Bobby Williams, a right guard from Arkansas,
their second choice of the second round of April's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the Eagles announced that defensive end Michael
Mason, signed last week after a stint in NFL Europe, failed his
physical and that wide receiver Rondel Menendez was placed on the
reserve/did-not-report list.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox Sees Strong U.S. Ties  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President-elect Vicente Fox said in an
interview broadcast Sunday that he sees ''a great opportunity'' in
Mexico's border with the United States and assured critics that he
will not try to impose a religious morality on the country.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of Coca-Cola for Mexico, Fox told interviewer
Hector Aguilar Camin that Mexico ''can build a great relationship
with the United States'' and said his nation is ''the envy of
almost any other country in the world for being the neighbor of the
largest market in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he saw the United States as a threat or an ally, Fox
replied, ''Without doubt, an ally. And welcome to globalization.
For me it is a great opportunity.'' he spoke on the program Zona
Abierta, broadcast by the national Televisa network.
</P>
<P>
   The embrace of the cross-border relationship is a break from the
often-prickly stance of past Mexican governments, most famously
stated long ago by former dictator Porfirio Diaz: ''Poor Mexico: so
far from God and so close to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, said the challenge was to ''close
the difference in income of a worker on the U.S. side with a worker
on the Mexican side,'' which he said would ease immigration and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to give ''a human face'' to economic growth,
and added, ''we have to grow and grow quickly in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has proposed a brisk 7 percent overall economic growth for
next year, prompting some analysts to fear the economy could
overheat into inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the president-elect insisted ''it is perfectly possible to
improve the real income of workers without impacting inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox repeated campaign assurances to the poor that he would
modify, but not eliminate, two key aid programs. He said
administration of some programs would be shifted from federal hands
to states and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox again denied allegations leveled during the campaign that he
planned to privatize the oil industry, saying such a move would
require ''a change of culture'' to gain the acceptance of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to make the national oil company, Pemex, more
businesslike and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favored easing limits on foreign investment in the
related petrochemical sector to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also repeated his hopes for a democratic transition in Cuba,
but rejected the U.S. policy of trying to isolate the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that a policy of isolation, a policy of not
having relations does not contribute anything to having Cuba become
a country of the market and a country of democracy. And I hope that
that happens very soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that 73-year-old Cuban President Fidel Castro, ''at his
age should now be preparing Cuba's passage to democracy and we
should all collaborate in that and in helping that it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's interpretation differs radically with that of Castro, who
insists that Cuba already is more of a democracy than most other
countries. Castro has repeatedly said the country will not abandon
socialism even after he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to calm fears of Mexico's liberals and leftists who
believe his government will take its cues from the Roman Catholic
Church when formulating social policy, Fox said he was a practicing
Catholic: ''not one of the best, but yes, I am a Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   He assured, however, that he believes in the separation of
church and state and said it ''would be unjust'' to have religious
education in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said it was ''indispensable'' that Mexico continue to
reduce its growth rate and said couples should be informed of ''the
birth control methods available,'' though he said he believes that
life begins at conception.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not want to change Mexican laws that outlaw
most abortions and noted that his own children are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he favored ''absolute liberty ... in all senses, not
only for minorities but for sexual preferences, liberty of religion
and creed, liberty of information, of communication, liberty of
creation and innovation in all senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even liberty,'' he added, ''for discotheques after midnight.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Journalist Lima Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Journalist Alexandre Jose Barbosa
Lima Sobrinho, longtime president of the Brazilian Press
Association and believed to be the world's oldest practicing
writer, died Sunday of multiple organ failure. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima, as he was best known, was admitted Thursday night
into the intensive care unit of Casa de Saude Sao Jose with
respiratory problems. His condition worsened over the weekend and
he died Sunday morning, media reported.
</P>
<P>
   A respected political journalist and former politician, Barbosa
Lima was present during a number of key moments in the country's
political history.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of the press, he often said, is not a privilege of the
journalist, but a ''sacred right of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he ran for vice president in support of presidential
candidate Ulysses Guimaraes in a campaign against the
military-ruled Arena party. Despite the opposition's effort,
Congress supported Gen. Ernesto Geisel for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Barbosa Lima linked arms with millions of
Brazilians who took to the streets demanding that the military step
down and power be returned to the people.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, Congress turned to him to represent the Brazilian
people in signing a congressional document impeaching former
President Fernando Collor de Melo.
</P>
<P>
   His prolific career as a writer included 70 books and more than
5,000 articles he wrote for Jornal do Brasil, one of the country's
oldest daily newspapers. His last weekly column hit the stands the
morning he died.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist at heart, he defied corrupt politicians and
wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   On his 100th birthday, Barbosa Lima said there were two things
that had kept him living so long -- his wife Maria Jose, to whom he
was married for 68 years, and the will to fight for his country,
Globonews television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima was a three time congressman and governor of the
northeastern Pernambuco state.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima lived with his wife in the house they built decades
ago in Botafogo, a middle-class neighborhood in Rio's southern
district and where he kept a personal library containing some
60,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Despite old age, Barbosa Lima often displayed notorious good
humor and zest.
</P>
<P>
   About the glaucoma that claimed his ability to see with his
right eye, he once told Veja magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that's my glory as a leftist.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima is survived by his wife Maria Jose, three children,
and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was scheduled for Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> Study finds Pennsylvania's lottery to be among nation's most efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - An independent study of ''lottery
efficiency'' - how much money goes to payouts and profits as
opposed to administrative expenses - shows Pennsylvania's lottery
to be one of the nation's most efficient. The study also shows New
Jersey gives the highest percentage of its lottery funs to state
programs for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes less than a week after Auditor General Robert P.
Casey Jr. said the lottery tried to cover up a botched $1 million
game. He also said the lottery routinely circumvented basic
accounting procedures and balked at responding to auditors'
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia A. McQueen, the author of the efficiency study, said
her results cannot be held up as a defense to Casey's findings. But
she said her study can assure Pennsylvania players that a fairly
large share of their money serves the lottery's purpose of funding
programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, released Tuesday, Casey's staffers detailed
repeated purchasing violations between July 1997 and May of this
year. His report also cites abuses of perks and a possible cover-up
of a botched million-dollar spin game that led to the retroactive
payment of a $1 million jackpot to a former Monesson woman this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are able to return an awful lot of the money that they
generate, and it's admirable that they do that,'' McQueen said.
''Within the context of what it set out to do, it does very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The rankings were published in a recent issue of International
Gaming and Wagering Business magazine, and were based on fiscal
1999 results. The study has Pennsylvania ranking at the top in the
nation for returning 40.5 percent of its ticket sales to the state
for programming.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania ranks second in two categories: The percentage of
money from total sales, after prize payouts, that goes to senior
programs and in the costs to generate $1 in program revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania gave 83 percent of its lottery sales money, after
prize payouts, to senior programs. That made it second only to New
Jersey, which contributed 85 percent to the programs its lottery
funds. The study shows the state spends 23 cents to generate each
$1 in program revenue. Only New Jersey, which paid 21.4 cents, did
better.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's lottery also placed fourth in a ranking of
spending to generate $1 in sales. Pennsylvania spent 9.3 cents for
each dollar in sales generated; Massachusetts was at the top,
spending 7.6 cents per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery and state Revenue Department officials were not reached
for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen's study also gauged ''lottery effectiveness,'' defined
as a lottery's ability to penetrate the marketplace, as measured by
total game sales as a percentage of personal income.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania finished back in the pack in that category, ranking
16th of 38 state lotteries. The market share of 0.51 percent
indicates residents spend $1 out of every $200 to play the lottery.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Abortion Not Major VP Factor  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush said Sunday that his vice
presidential selection would be based on factors other than the
candidates' views on abortion, despite the urging of conservative
Christians that he pick an anti-abortion running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was responding to James Dobson, the president of Focus on
the Family, who recently said the likely Republican nominee,
''cannot and will not'' be elected president if he ''does not
energize his base'' of conservative Christians by picking a person
who opposes abortion. The Texas governor said he gets ''all kinds
of interesting advice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to pick somebody who can be president of the United
States and somebody with whom I can get along,'' he told ABC's
''This Week'' in a rare talk show appearance. ''I'm going to take a
lot of factors into consideration: obviously issues matter, a
person's voting record matters, where they're from matters, their
gender matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed, Bush would not say whether he thinks picking a running
mate who supports abortion rights would hurt his chances in
November. Each time he was asked about abortion, he repeated that
his criteria were simply qualifications and chemistry, along with
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hadn't ruled anybody out from selection,
including Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Christine Todd
Whitman of New Jersey, who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not yet decided if he would announce his
running mate decision before or during the party convention in
Philadelphia starting July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic opponent, repeated his
belief on NBC's ''Meet The Press'' that Bush would take away a
woman's right to choose whether to get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will protect a woman's right to choose. Governor Bush has
sworn to take away a woman's right to choose,'' Gore said. ''He has
told (evangelists) Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson that he will
make appointments that will be very pleasing to them. That's not
difficult to interpret.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he opposes parental notification, which would require
teen-agers to get a parent or guardian's permission before getting
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat brushed aside questions about whether consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, nominee of the Green Party, is cutting into
his support, saying voters eventually will want to pick ''between
two stark choices'' -- Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the final analysis, it is likely that most people
will see this as a two-person contest and cast their vote on
that,'' Gore said. Recent polls have suggested Nader could hurt
Gore in important states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said Sunday on CBS' ''Face the Nation'' that he was not
concerned what effect he might have on other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be running if I were worried about taking votes
away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' he said. ''Nobody is
entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   --Bush countered Gore's criticism about a projected $610 million
shortfall in the Texas budget by noting that the state is running a
surplus that could run as high as $1 billion, and there is plenty
to cover any needed adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush reiterated his belief that every person put to death in
Texas was guilty. Gore said he supports the death penalty, but
thought Illinois' Republican Gov. George Ryan made a wise decision
in calling for a moratorium after errors were found in that state.
</P>
<P>
   --On Social Security, Gore said he would encourage people to
invest retirement savings in the stock market in addition to a core
Social Security fund that lawmakers could not touch. Bush said
people should have the option to invest their Social Security funds
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush said he would expand research on an anti-ballistic missile
system. Gore was more cautious, saying the decision was still
President Clinton's, but that, ''It's only responsible to
investigate whether or not it's possible ...''
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to criticism that his administration mishandled $33
million in federal school lunch money, Bush said that, in fact,
Texas was ''higher than the national average'' in signing up poor
children for subsidized meals.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore defended his administration's 1996 campaign fund-raising
tactics, saying he still believes a California event he attended at
a Buddhist temple was not a fund-raiser. ''There was no request for
funds. No money changed hands,'' he said. Gore has denied knowing
anything about the $60,000 in illegal donations that followed his
appearance at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Bush's running mate, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, conceded Bush may pick a candidate who does not oppose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, a former Republican and
staunch opponent of abortion, said any discussion of Bush choosing
a running mate who favors abortion rights was just talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Bush is blowing smoke,'' Buchanan said on CBS' ''Face the
Nation.'' ''He would have an explosion at his convention.''

<HEADLINE> P.M. Blair Warned Advisers in Memo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair warned close advisers in
a recent memo that his government was in urgent need of
eye-catching initiatives to reverse a growing image of being ''out
of touch with gut British instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the leaked, three-page memo by two newspapers
on Monday brought an angry response from Blair's Downing Street
office which warned that whoever handed it over to the media would
face ''very serious'' consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Signed ''TB,'' the April 29 letter called for a stronger stand
on issues ranging from defense and illegal immigration to family
issues and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should think now of an initiative, e.g. locking up street
muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite which sends a message
through the system,'' it said. This should be done soon and I,
personally, should be associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the new policies should portray the ''toughness'' of
a government ''standing up for Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was written at a point when the government was under
sustained attack from the opposition over crime figures, the sale
of car manufacturer Rover and a rise in asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength
in defense. But all of these things add up to a sense that the
government -- and this even applies to me -- are somehow out of touch
with gut British instincts,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Blair has trumpeted his government's economic
record and promised new money for health, education, policing and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came after several weeks of turmoil in which his
leadership abilities were questioned by a major fundraiser, he was
booed and heckled during a speech to the normally benign Women's
Institute, and his 16-year-old son was arrested for being drunk in
a public square.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has fueled speculation that a general election
might not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, a father of four, said it frustrated him that his
personal values weren't better reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is bizarre that any government I lead should be seen as
anti-family,'' he wrote, calling for ''two or three eye-catching
initiatives that are entirely conventional.''

<HEADLINE> British Official Starts Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's top law enforcement official touched off
a debate Sunday about the nature of Englishness, saying soccer
hooliganism, racism and thuggery all have their roots in a
distorted national self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw called for an effort to redefine what
it means to be English, to tackle the hostility toward foreigners
that he said seems not to be shared by residents of Scotland and
Wales, which make up the rest of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had all the global baggage of the empire and a lot of
jingoism here. And I think it's very important that we redefine not
only what it means to be British, but also what it means to be
English,'' Straw said on GMTV's ''Sunday'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Straw noted that much soccer violence has been caused not by
hardcore hooligans but by a larger group of ''racist and xenophobic
white males'' who link English patriotism with wrapping themselves
in the Union Jack and abusing foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud of not only being British, I'm also proud of being
English. But I am also pretty worried that others try to capture
and distort this definition,'' Straw said.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said both he and Prime Minister Tony Blair are committed
to improving race relations in Britain. But he conceded that the
Home Office and ''almost every public institution I can think of''
suffers from the institutional racism pinned on the Metropolitan
Police by a sweeping independent report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The culture is changing in this place and in many good private
organizations,'' Straw said of the Home Office. ''What's important
now is that we put this legal duty on every organization -- not just
negatively not to discriminate, but positively to promote racial
equality at the workplace as well as elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw's counterpart in the opposition Conservative Party, Ann
Widdecombe, criticized his remarks, saying thuggery is not a
''peculiarly English'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberal Democrat spokesman Simon Hughes said Straw made a
valid point.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems beyond doubt that England particularly has a severe
and continuing problem with a consistent current of aggression and
violence,'' Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Official: Bad Meat Killed Tigers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Twelve Royal Bengal tigers died in an
Indian zoo after eating contaminated meat, a laboratory official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, authorities at the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneshwar,
the capital of Orissa state, said the tigers died last week of
sleeping sickness, a disease carried by tsetse flies.
</P>
<P>
   But tests by Calcutta's Pathological Laboratory, run by the
federal government, established that the deaths were caused by the
consumption of decomposed and contaminated cow meat, an official at
the laboratory said on condition of anonymity. The official helped
carry out the tests.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from zoo officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, India's Supreme Court ordered a federal investigation
into the tigers' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Nandankanan zoo had conducted autopsies and cremated the
tigers before federal investigators arrived, saying it acted to
keep the skins from reaching the black market.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo is home to India's largest collection of tigers. It had
56 of the rare cats. Now it has 44.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the dead animals were white tigers.

<HEADLINE> Indian Leader Bernie Whitebear Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bernie Whitebear, a longtime advocate for Indian
recognition who led a foundation working on behalf of Seattle-area
tribes, died Sunday after a long battle with colon cancer. He was
62.
</P>
<P>
   Whitebear first gained notoriety when he helped lead the
''invasion'' of Fort Lawton in northwest Seattle in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He and others pushed through the gates at the 1,110-acre Fort
Lawton property and declared they were reclaiming it after plans
were announced to list the fort as surplus and turn it over to
Seattle for a city park.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation lasted for three months and drew national media
attention and a visit from Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Congress eventually ordered the city to negotiate with the
Indians, and Whitebear's group, the United Indians of All Tribes
Foundation, was offered a 99-year lease on a 20-acre parcel of the
land. Today, the Daybreak Star Art Center stands in the city's
Discovery Park.
</P>
<P>
   Whitebear worked until his death to try to expand the center to
include a museum, performing arts center and ''potlatch house'' to
accommodate up to 1,500 people for the traditional feast.
</P>
<P>
   His United Indians of All Tribes Foundation has grown to 110
employees and a budget of $5 million and offers 13 educational,
counseling and other programs to an estimated 4,500 people each
year.

Clinton: Peace Talks Complicated
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Although Middle East summit talks are more difficult
than any talks he's dealt with in his presidency, President Clinton said today
that he is more optimistic than when they began six days ago. ''God, it's
hard,'' Clinton said in the first official assessment of the talks' progress.
''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with. All the negotiations with the Irish,
all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with the Israelis,
the Balkans at Dayton.'' But he said he was hopeful that Israelis and
Palestinians could reach agreement on the contentious issues that still divide
them.

Protesters Send Message to Barak
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- At least 100,000 right-wing protesters massed in Tel
Aviv on Sunday chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' to send a strong and
personal message to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad
concessions to the Palestinians. ''We are the majority, and the majority will
win!'' shouted many of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late
prime minister was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are often held.
Much of the crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from settlements in the
West Bank, from homes they fear they might lose in a final peace agreement with
the Palestinians.

End to Cuba Sanctions Called for
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- After a weekend visit to Cuba that included a 10-hour meeting
with President Fidel Castro, three U.S. senators called for an end to American
trade sanctions and improved relations between the two countries. While saying
they believe that Cuba still must open up its economy and grant freedom of
expression to its citizens, Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii,
and Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said that it was time for the Washington and Havana to
improve relations. The American lawmakers said improved relations would benefit
both countries and help prepare Cuba for an eventual change in leadership.
Castro, who will turn 74 next month, has been the nation's top leader since the
triumph of the 1959 Cuban Revolution.

Hillary Clinton Denies Using Slur
</SUBHEAD>

   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today firmly denied
allegations from a forthcoming book that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years
ago. ''I wanted to unequivocally state it never happened,'' the first lady said,
angrily and emotionally, during a news conference. The allegation comes from a
book due out this week, ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill
and Hillary Clinton,'' by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for Bill Clinton's unsuccessful
Congressional campaign in Arkansas in 1974, as claiming that Mrs. Clinton called
him a ''Jew b-----'' after Bill Clinton lost the election.

Sunday. Not only did San Diego waste a three-run lead in the ninth, but Trevor
Hoffman and Anaheim's Troy Percival, two of baseball's most feared closers, both
blew saves. After Padres rookie pinch-hitter Kory DeHaan doubled leading off the
10th and took second on Ben Davis' groundout, Angels manager Mike Scioscia
pulled out all the stops.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Hits Western Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.6 shook western Japan on Monday morning, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was centered about 12 miles underground in the western
part of Tottori prefecture (state), the Meteorological Agency said.
Tottori city, the capital of the prefecture, is 310 miles, west of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Tottori said no damage or injuries were reported from
the tremor, which struck at around 8:00 a.m. and was felt in wide
areas of western Japan, including the cities of Hiroshima and
Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   A quake of magnitude 4 can shake houses and buildings and cause
hanging objects such as lamps to swing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
it sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Kennedy crash marked quietly  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - One year ago, a late-night plane crash off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard claimed the life of one of America's
favorite sons.
</P>
<P>
   An entire nation grieved the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
Flowers were mounded outside the New York building where the couple
had lived, and photos of the former president's son filled the
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the first anniversary of the July 16, 1999, crash
passed quietly as relatives and friends mourned in private.
</P>
<P>
   A small driftwood memorial was built on the Vineyard's Philbin
Beach, closest to the area where the plane went down. But aside
from the wooden cross, which bore only the words: ''John, Carolyn
and Lauren,'' little was done to publicly recognize the tragic
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial,'' said Anne
McGhee, a Harvard University professor who has a home on Martha's
Vineyard. ''We just know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Freeman, mother of Carolyn, 33, and Lauren, 34, released a
statement from her home in Greenwich, Conn., last week saying the
family would not mark the anniversary publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., an uncle to Kennedy, 38,
planned to spend the weekend with his family at the Kennedy
compound in Barnstable's Hyannis Port section.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very quiet,'' said Barnstable Police Officer
James Ellis. ''We've had patrols out all week and we haven't had a
problem yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the waters late
at night, seven miles south of the Kennedy home on Martha's
Vineyard as he was flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory
Kennedy's wedding. The National Transportation Safety Board
determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy
likely became disoriented in the night sky.

<HEADLINE> Montesterio Sets 1500-Meter Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) -- Ricardo Montesterio, already qualified
for Venezuela's Olympic team for the second straight time, easily
won the 1500-meter freestyle Sunday at the USA Swimming Challenge
Long Island Open.
</P>
<P>
   Montesterio, a 21-year-old junior at Florida, had a meet-record
time of 15 minutes, 30.85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started swimming when I was seven years old,'' he said. ''I
accepted a scholarship to Florida not only for my ability in the
pool, but also to get a good education
</P>
<P>
   ''No question, I've been able to achieve both thus far. (Gators
coach) Greg Groy has been a great help and has improved my
technique tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Americans followed the South American, and bettered the
minimum time of 16:03.69 necessary to qualify for the U.S. Olympic
Trials at Indianapolis on Aug. 9-16.
</P>
<P>
   Dan DeMarco of Great Neck, N.Y., was second in 15:33.55,
followed by Fran Crippen (15:36.20) of Germantown, Pa., Brendan
Neligan (15:45.04) of Hempstead, N.Y., and John Cole (15:55.86) of
Paramus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Montesterio, a member of Venezuela's national team since 1994,
was the Southeastern Conference gold medalist in the 1500
freestyle, and a bronze medalist in the 400 freestyle earlier this
year. He also won silver medals in both races at the South American
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Montesterio finished 20th in the 1500 and 24th in the 400 at the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He's looking for a better showing in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''A medal would be great,'' said Montesterio, who also finished
third in the longer distance in last year's Pan American Games.
''However, being realistic, I'm shooting to make it in the top
eight in both races. That would be a reward for all the hard work
I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Maurer of Winnetka, Ill., a graduate of Stanford and a
member of the American gold medal-winning 400 relay team at the
Atlanta Olympics, easily qualified for the Indianapolis trials with
a time of 1:02.33 in the 100 backstroke. The 25-year-old Maurer was
also third in the 100 backstroke in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Richelle Fox, of Rye, N.Y., earned a trip to the trials too,
with a meet-record 1:01.47 in the women's 100 butterfly. Alice
Henriques (1:02.66) of Newtown, Pa., was runner-up, also bettering
the 1:03.09 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men, Dan Shevchik of Wilton, Conn., a sophomore at
Harvard, advanced by winning the 100 backstroke in a meet-record
time of 58.56. Michael Phelps (meet-record 55.01) of Baltimore, and
Tad Sayce (55.96) of Cambridge, Mass., finished 1-2 in the 100
butterfly to also gain a trip to Indianapolis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two days after a shocking loss in the
200-meter backstroke, Lenny Krayzelburg reasserted himself with a
victory in the 100 back in the Janet Evans Invitational on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming in his home pool on the Southern California campus,
Krayzelburg won in 54.60 seconds -- one second off his world record
-- in his last competition before next month's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg had a body-length lead on the field with 25 meters
remaining and increased his margin approaching the wall. Bart
Kizierowski of Mission Viejo was second in 56.09.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Peirsol, a 16-year-old from Irvine, stunned Krayzelburg in
the 200 back Friday, an event in which Krayzelburg holds the world
record. Peirsol was sixth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a lot better. I was a bit down on Friday, but you have
to put a race like that behind you and focus,'' Krayzelburg said.
''That was my goal, to forget about the swim on Friday and not show
my competitors I might have a weak spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg plans to decrease his daily yardage and stop lifting
weights over the next three weeks in preparation for the trials
Aug. 9-16 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good confidence booster,'' he said of his
victory. ''I know I've done all the work. I'm not too worried about
the 200. With rest that's going to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson wrapped up a successful three-day meet by winning
the 100 butterfly. She won in 58.48 seconds, ahead of Dara Torres
in 58.91.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was going really well, but I took a huge breath of water. I
couldn't get more air,'' Thompson said. ''It was tough getting to
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson finished with two victories, including an American
record in the 100 free Friday, and two second places.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meet was really good for me mentally and
performance-wise. I had two best times,'' she said. ''It's a great
springboard for what's going to happen at trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two finishers in each event in the trials qualify for
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Staciana Stitts of Carlsbad won the 100 breaststroke in 1:09.49.
Penny Heyns of South Africa, the '96 Olympic champion who finished
second in the 200 breast Saturday, scratched the final. Amanda
Beard of Irvine, who finished second to Heyns in Atlanta, was
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to come here and get some good races in. I'm really
happy where I am,'' Beard said. ''I'm the underdog. I think I
should put some expectations on myself or else I won't push myself
as much.''
</P>
<P>
   In other events, Katie Zimbone of Boston won the 1,500 freestyle
in 16:57.36; Ryk Neethling of South Africa won the men's race in
15:20.24; and Mike Mintenko of Canada won the 100 butterfly in
53.52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Bedford of Colorado Springs, Colo., won the 100 backstroke
in 1:01.99, while '96 Olympic champion Beth Botsford of Tucson,
Ariz., was fourth; and Morgan Knabe of Canada won the 100
breaststroke in 1:03.58.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Malar of Canada won the 200 individual medley in 2:15.12,
ahead of '96 Olympian Kristine Quance-Julian of Los Angeles; and
Atilla Czene of Hungary won the 200 IM in 2:02.54.

<HEADLINE> Ceremony Held for TWA Flight 800  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- Families and friends of the victims of the
TWA Flight 800 explosion broke ground for a new memorial Sunday on
the Long Island shore not far from where the plane went down four
years ago killing all 230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 families, from as far away as Australia, were joined by
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and U.S.
Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, who attended on behalf
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the family members, it was an extremely emotional time --
this is something they have wanted for a long time,'' said memorial
project spokesman Frank Lombardi. ''It's a special place. It brings
them as close as they can to their family members.''
</P>
<P>
   A private ceremony was scheduled for Monday, the anniversary of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have raised about half the money needed for the $1.5
million project, which they hope to have built by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece for the memorial will be a 12-foot granite wall
with the names of the victims. Surrounding the wall will be a
contemplative garden, which Lombardi described as a series of
private areas for people to sit and reflect about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had just left New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport for Paris on July 17, 1996, when an explosion sent it
plummeting into the ocean. Investigators determined the explosion
occurred in the Boeing 747's center fuel tank, but theories have
persisted that flashes seen in the sky seconds before the explosion
may have been a missile.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board plans to meet next
month to go over reports and evidence from the crash and determine
a final cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAZATENANGO, Guatemala (AP) -- With the heat building and the
clock running down, it looked as if the United States would open
World Cup qualifying with a victory on one of the most remote parts
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Then Carlos Ruiz scored in the 88th minute, lifting Guatemala
into a 1-1 tie Sunday and sending the Americans home with just a
point instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. team dominated the first half and took a 1-0 lead
on Ante Razov's injury-time goal, outshooting Guatemala 7-2, the
Guatemalans outshot the Americans 14-3 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And the home team tied it when German Ruano sent a long pass
downfield and Dwight Pezzarossi outjumped Greg Vanney, heading the
ball into the path of Ruiz, who beat defender Robin Fraser and
goalkeeper Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes earlier, Freddy Garcia nearly tied it when his
corner kick skimmed off Fraser's head and bounced off the far post.

   ''We earned an important point on the road,'' U.S. coach Bruce
Arena said. ''The conditions were difficult with the travel and the
heat, but it wasn't something we weren't expecting and it wasn't
something we weren't prepared for. Winning at home and taking
points on the road is what World Cup qualifying is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Razov scored for the third straight game. Earnie Stewart took
the ball at the top of the penalty area and sent it back to Claudio
Reyna, who quickly passed to Razov.
</P>
<P>
   Razov's shot deflected off defender Luis Swisher and beat
goalkeeper Edgar Estrada with 34 seconds to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The game originally was scheduled for Guatemala City but was
moved by the home team to this inland town, about 100 miles away.
The gametime temperature at Mazatenango was about 93 degrees, about
10 degrees warmer than in Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the heat was a big factor,'' Arena said. ''But I
thought the Guatemala players benefited from it more in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   The top two nations in each of the three semifinal groups
advance to the six-nation finals of the North and Central American
and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a number of good opportunities, but only came through
when it was urgent,'' Guatemala coach Julio Cesar Cortes said. ''We
wanted to win but were very lucky to get a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other Group E game, Barbados rallied past visiting
Costa Rica 2-1 on goals by Lewellyn Riley (50th minute) and Michael
Forde (84th) after Alexander Madrigal (47th) had put Costa Rica
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, the United States is at Costa Rica before opening
the home portion of its schedule against Barbados on Aug. 16 at
Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In Group C, Mexico won 1-0 at Panama on Miguel Zepeda's goal
with four minutes left, and Trinidad and Tobago stopped Canada's
15-game unbeaten streak, winning 2-0 at Edmonton, Alberta, on goals
by Angus Eve (43rd) and Dwight Yorke (73rd).
</P>
<P>
   In Group D, Honduras won 5-2 at El Salvador as Carlos Pavon
Plumer scored twice (41st and 61st minutes) and Samuel Caballero
(12th), Dany Turcios (38th) and David Suazo (85th) scored one
apiece. Elias Montes (seventh) and Mauricio Cienfuegos (88th)
scored for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica won 1-0 at St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Onandi
Lowe's goal in the 23rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Notes: ESPN couldn't get its own feed on the air for the first
half and had to use the Guatemalan feed, with the Spanish-language
announcers occasionally heard in the background. ... Razov was
playing his 10th international game. ... The Americans returned to
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., immediately after the game.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gunmen Release All Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROLLING HILLS ESTATES, Calif. (AP) -- Gunmen who held six people
hostage in a botched jewelry store heist released their three
remaining captives and were arrested Sunday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The three hostages -- two men and a woman -- and the two gunmen
walked out of the shop about 11 a.m. All of the hostages were
unharmed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Cmdr. Bill McSweeney said the gunmen finally
surrendered because of ''excellent negotiators and exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert James Miller, 47, of Los Angeles, and Matthew Lou Ross,
48, from Michigan, were booked for investigation of robbery. They
were being held on $1 million bail each, Sgt. Brenda Cambra said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 17-hour ordeal began about 5:20 p.m. Saturday after
two men dressed in business suits and claiming to be police
detectives entered Morgan's Jewelers, pulled out handguns and began
robbing the store.
</P>
<P>
   An employee activated a silent alarm, and sheriff's deputies
arrived on the scene as two men with briefcases and weapons were
leaving the store, McSweeney said. As soon as the men saw the
officers, they hurried back inside, he said. Six people, all
employees or owners of the store, were taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 deputies surrounded the store and cleared out the
surrounding strip mall as negotiators communicated via telephone
with the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Shopper Bob Dunbar said deputies initially told people in the
mall to duck for cover inside shops and then told them to evacuate.
''They yelled 'Get down! Get away!''' he said. ''It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The first hostage, a woman, was released sometime after 3 a.m.,
nearly 10 hours after the ordeal began. A man was released after 6
a.m., and another woman was released about three hours later,
leaving the store with her hands raised over her head.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7 a.m. one of the gunman asked for an attorney,
authorities said. They called that an encouraging sign that the
standoff would peacefully. It was not clear whether the gunman's
request was granted.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects surrendered without a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Hills Estates is about 30 miles southwest of downtown
Los Angeles.

Clinton: Peace Talks Difficult
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he is more optimistic
about Middle East summit talks than when they began six days ago but said the
negotiations are more difficult than any he's dealt with in his presidency.
''God, it's hard,'' Clinton said in the first official assessment of the talks'
progress. ''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with. All the negotiations with
the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with
the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.'' But he said he was hopeful that Israelis
and Palestinians could reach agreement on the contentious issues that still
divide them.

   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Right-wing protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday
chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' to send a strong and personal message
to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad concessions to
the Palestinians. ''We are the majority, and the majority will win!'' shouted
many of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late prime minister
was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are often held. Much of the
crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from settlements in the West Bank,
from homes they fear they might lose in a final peace agreement with the
Palestinians.

   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair warned close advisers in a recent
memo that his government was in urgent need of eye-catching initiatives to
reverse a growing image of being ''out of touch with gut British instincts.''
The publication of the leaked, three-page memo by two newspapers on Monday
brought an angry response from Blair's Downing Street office which warned that
whoever handed it over to the media would face ''very serious'' consequences.
Signed ''TB,'' the April 29 letter called for a stronger stand on issues ranging
from defense and illegal immigration to family issues and crime.

allegations from a forthcoming book that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years
ago. ''I wanted to unequivocally state it never happened,'' the first lady said,
angrily and emotionally, during a news conference. The allegation comes from a
book due out this week, ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill
and Hillary Clinton,'' by former National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for Bill Clinton's unsuccessful
Congressional campaign in Arkansas in 1974, as claiming that Mrs. Clinton called

Remains of Dakota Warrior Buried
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MORTON, Minn. (AP) -- Almost 138 years after he was executed for leading a
bloody uprising that left hundreds of white settlers dead, the remains of a
Dakota Indian warrior have been buried with all the honors due a chief. Marpiya
Okinajin, known as Cut Nose, was one of 38 Indians hanged in Mankato, Minn., on
Dec. 26, 1862, in what is believed to be the largest mass execution in U.S.
history. After the hangings, the bodies were tossed into a shallow grave, but
later that night they were dug up for anatomical studies. Cut Nose's skull ended
up on display in the office of Dr. William Mayo and was discovered years later
at the Mayo Clinic, founded in Rochester by Mayo's sons.

<P>
	   SHIRLEY, N.Y. (AP) - Families and friends of the victims of the
TWA Flight 800 explosion broke ground for a new memorial Sunday on
the Long Island shore not far from where the plane went down four
years ago, killing all 230 people on board, a death toll that
included seven people from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 families, from as far away as Australia, were joined by
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and U.S.
Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, who attended on behalf
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the family members, it was an extremely emotional time -
this is something they have wanted for a long time,'' said memorial
project spokesman Frank Lombardi. ''It's a special place. It brings
them as close as they can to their family members.''
</P>
<P>
   A private ceremony was scheduled for Monday, the anniversary of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have raised about half the money needed for the $1.5
million project, which they hope to have built by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece for the memorial will be a 12-foot granite wall
with the names of the victims. Surrounding the wall will be a
contemplative garden, which Lombardi described as a series of
private areas for people to sit and reflect about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had just left New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport for Paris on July 17, 1996, when an explosion sent it
plummeting into the ocean. Investigators determined the explosion
occurred in the Boeing 747's center fuel tank. But theories have
persisted that flashes seen in the sky seconds before the explosion
may have been a missile.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board plans to meet next
month to go over reports and evidence from the crash and determine
a final cause.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 10, Royals 7  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa homered twice to pass Joe
DiMaggio on the career list and had four RBIs to lead the Chicago
Cubs over the Kansas City Royals 10-7 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   During a nine-game hitting streak, Sosa has six home runs and 11
RBIs, including four homers in his last three games that raised his
season total to 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has 80 RBIs, homered in the first on an 0-2 pitch by
Dan Reichert (3-6) for a 2-0 lead, then connected in the third for
another two-run homer, pulling Chicago to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had 363 homers, moving into 50th on the career list, two
ahead of DiMaggio. The crowd of 36,815, the second-largest of the
year at Kauffman Stadium, booed Reichert when he walked Sosa in the
fifth. Sosa struck out in the seven and grounded out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood (4-6) won for the first time in four starts since
June 21 against Atlanta, giving up seven runs, 10 hits and three
walks in five innings. He struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Aguilera got three outs for his 18th save in 24 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert allowed eight runs, six hits and six walks in 4 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 4-2 lead in the first on RBI singles by Mike
Sweeney and Mark Quinn, and Todd Dunwoody's soft two-run single to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs shortstop Ricky Gutierrez fumbled Sweeney's second-inning
grounder, allowing Johnny Damon to score.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa, who went 4-for-5, homered for a 6-4 lead in the
third, but Henry Rodriguez and Glenallen Hill chased Reichert in a
five-run fifth, and Willie Greene's two-run triple off Jay Witasick
put the Cubs ahead 8-6. Joe Girardi followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Dunwoody's bloop RBI single pulled the Royals to 8-7 in the
bottom half. Gutierrez hit a run-scoring single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the first time the Cubs had scored in double digits
since May 14, when they lost 16-15 at Montreal. ... Sosa has
homered in 33 different stadiums and has homered in three straight
games 17 times. ... He has 41 multihomer games, including two this
season. . ... Ralph Kiner is 49th on the home-run list at 369. ...
In 54 previous at-bats in Kauffman Stadium, Sosa was batting .222
with no home runs. ... Damon's two stolen bases increased his
league-leading total to 27. ... Royals 2B Luis Ordaz made a nice
play in the second on Greene's popup into shallow right field, a
basket catch with his back to the infield. ... Kansas City's major
league-leading total of home runs allowed climbed 152. ... The
Royals' wives collected 9,562 pounds of food for needy Kansas
Citians in their annual drive.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Air Force To Vote Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Leaders of a vintage airplane collectors
group known as the Confederate Air Force say they'll call a vote to
decide whether to change the group's name because of concerns it
may be costing them business at airshows.
</P>
<P>
   Since the uproar began over the Confederate battle flag recently
removed from the South Carolina Statehouse dome, attention has been
drawn to the use of symbols linked to the Confederate era and
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's name has nothing to do with the Civil War --
the name stuck after somebody painted it on the tail of a fighter
plane in the 1950s. The group's 8,500 members maintain about 140
airplanes that flew during World War II and fly some of them at air
shows across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While some members object to changing the name, saying doing so
would be bowing to political correctness, board member V. Neils
Agather said after the board's decision Saturday that putting it to
a vote is the right move.
</P>
<P>
   If 75 percent of members say the Confederate Air Force needs a
new name, a committee make recommendations, which would be voted on
by the membership in 2001.
