<HEADLINE> Russia to Have Good Harvest This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia is to get an
exceptionally big grain harvest this year - almost 80 million
tonnes, Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced today in his
radio address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Yeltsin said that the
reason of the harvest is not only a good weather, but also the new
organization of farm labour.
</P>
<P>
The president meanwhile pointed out the problems in the
agro-industrial complex, saying "there is a shortage of investments,
efficient managers, and machinery, while the things we have are
supplied for 'extravagant' prices".
</P>
<P>
Russia should ensure its food independence and food
security, he said and emphasized that Russia must not only
provide itself with all the food but must also to export it.
</P>
<P>
In his address Yeltsin also noted the problem of privatization
of the state land, saying that "land in Russia must be sold and
bought. Just as customary in all the civilized world. It must be
the property of the farmer and he must decide himself what to do
with it."

<HEADLINE> South Korean Won Hits New Low Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean won tumbled to a
new low Friday, breaking the 910-won level for the first time as
the U.S. dollar surged against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The won started today's trading at 910 won to the dollar, and
then slid to 913.30 won in the morning trading.
</P>
<P>
After a series of interventions by the Bank of Korea (BOK), the
South Korean currency stopped its fall at around the 912-won
level, the highest since the nation introduced an average market
rate system in March 1990.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean monetary unit has depreciated by 7.5 percent
against the U.S. banknote since the end of last year, when the
won-dollar parity rate stood at 844.20.
</P>
<P>
"To keep the foreign exchange rate stable, we will continue to
strongly intervene to sell U.S. currency in both spot and forward
trading," said Lee Eung-baek, chief of BOK's Foreign Exchange
Division, adding that BOK would not let the won fall further.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency dealers attributed the won's continuous fall
against the dollar to the latter's strength against the Japanese
yen in international foreign exchange markets, and the high demand
for dollars by domestic businesses in imports settling.
</P>
<P>
They also cited the Japanese banks' moves to temporarily
collect their short-term, foreign currency loans to South Korean
banks in order to meet the capital adequacy ratio recommended by
the Bank for International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
Despite a strong supply of dollar by the South Korean central
bank, concerns over the possibility of a credit crunch resulting
from recent bankruptcies and financial troubles at major domestic
conglomerates continue to weigh on the South Korean currency.

<HEADLINE> Bonn, Paris Still at Odds over Unemployment, EU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The 70th Franco-German summit
ended today in the historic eastern German town of Weimar leaving
differences unresolved over such issues as unemployment and the
European Union reforms, despite a strong show of unity in efforts
towards a peaceful and powerful Europe.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and France stressed the importance of the upcoming
November EU meeting in Luxembourg on employment. German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl told a news conference after separate talks today with
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
that the two countries would hold intensive talks on the
unemployment issue.
</P>
<P>
On how to combat Europe's high unemployment, Germany has been
opposing new EU spending for any job program, deeming job
creation largely a national task. However, Prime Minister Jospin,
known to favor state-run job schemes, has been urging concerted
EU action.
</P>
<P>
Germany is now suffering from a postwar high jobless rate of
11.4 percent, and France's unemployment is currently 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, President Chirac made it clear that
Paris would hold firmly on to its position that the EU
institutional reform should be given priority to taking in new
members.
</P>
<P>
"These reforms are a prerequisite for expansion -- and if they
do not come then there will be no expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl however noted that reforms and expansion were not
contradictory in principle and should go on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the three leaders all reaffirmed that the single
European currency, the euro, would be introduced on time in 1999
and according to the stability criteria.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France, two partners at the center of European
integration, have been feared to miss the economic targets to
qualify for the euro, forcing postponement of the project.
However, signs of economic upturn in Europe have eased the
worries.
</P>
<P>
Concerning their differences over the future European central
bank, Kohl said: " We are completely sure that we will be able to
find out a reasonable solution."
</P>
<P>
Germany has been in favor of an independent central bank while
Paris enjoying to see political control over it.
</P>
<P>
Saying that France also hoped for an independent central bank,
Jospin added it was important that all EU countries joining the
euro should achieve a better coordination of their economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day consultations, France and Germany agreed to
expand cooperation in the fields of telecommunications and
aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Apparently moving closer on the issue of reforming Europe's
Airbus Industrie into a for-profit company, both sides agreed to
give "a European response" to the merger between American aviation
giants Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
German media reports quoted a French government source as
saying that the transformation of the four-nation Airbus
consortium would be realized by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed during the summit that their two
telecom companies should buy a 7.5 percent stake in each other.
</P>
<P>
As one of the concrete achievements of the summit, foreign
ministers of the two countries today signed the establishment of a
joint Franco-German university with a view to harmonizing
university studies in the two countries and to mutually
recognizing degrees.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, the leaders all stressed that the
future cooperation between their two countries was crucial.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France must once again provide a new thrust to
bring Europe forward, said Kohl.

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- People throughout the country
celebrated today's successful conclusion of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the formation
of the new Party leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
They jointly pledged to study and carry out decisions made at

</P>
<P>
Awangdanba, a local farmer who once posed for a photo with CPC
General-Secretary Jiang Zemin, said: "The good policies of the
Party have enabled Tibetan farmers to gain prosperity, and the
Tibetan people will forever whole-heartedly follow the leadership

Common Chinese citizens praised the fact that Deng Xiaoping
Theory has been adopted as the guiding ideology for the Party.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Hongqi, a retired factory worker from Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan Province, said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping left his theory to
guide reform and our country will undoubtedly become more powerful
under its guidance and the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core."
</P>
<P>
A Sichuan farmer named Huang Shulin said, "The Party Congress
has not only clarified orientation for China's future development,
but has more importantly written Deng Xiaoping Theory into the
Party Constitution. Farmers are now reassured."
</P>
<P>
The prefectural committee in Baise Prefecture in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region where Deng Xiaoping had fought for the
CPC revolutionary cause assigned over 3,000 cadres to help local
farmers study Jiang Zemin's report to the Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yuan, a former Red Army solder who escorted Deng Xiaoping
from Donglan to Hechi in 1931, said: "The third collective Party
leadership is energetic and high-spirited, and will lead the
country to victory on the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>

"The new leadership has confirmed Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology and we are 100 percent reassured."

<HEADLINE> French Catholic Church to Apologize to Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Roman Catholic Church of
France will apologize to Jews for the silence it maintained when
German Nazi occupiers deported tens of thousand of French Jews to
death camps during the Vichy collaboration period from 1941 to
1944.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for the French Catholic Church to
formally recognize its wartime anti-Semitic attitude and behavior.
</P>
<P>
The church has been blamed in the past for offering hideouts to
former Nazi collaborators, such as former chief of the Lyon
militiamen, Paul Touvier, who hid in a church compound in southern
France for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Although some bishops and priests tried to protect and help
Jews from 1942, most church priests remained silent and failed to
speak out when Nazi atrocities took place, said Jean Dujardin,
secretary of the church's espiscopal committee in charge of
relations with Judaism.
</P>
<P>
A communique published by the French Catholic Church today said
that several prominent figures of the church will attend a
ceremony on September 30 at the former site of the concentration
camp of Drancy outside Paris, from where 64,000 Jews were
transported to death camps in Germany and Nazi occupied countries.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris and the President of
the Episcopal Conference of France, Louis-Marie Bille, as well as
bishops of the Paris region and French departments where Jews were
rounded up and deported.
</P>
<P>
A declaration by the bishops of France on the "attitude of the
bishops of France during the war" will be read by Bishop Olivier
de Berranger of Saint-Denis, a city outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
He will try to tell "to which degree had the negative vision
on Jews that the Church had carried for centuries helped prepare a
field in which the Nazi ideas could have established themselves
without resistance" during World War II in France.
</P>
<P>
French historian Pierre Pierrard said in his book "Jews and
French Catholics" that the church welcomed anti-Semitic laws
drafted by Marshal Petain in 1940, which cast out the Jews from
the French society.

<HEADLINE> Cook Reiterates UK Stance on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook today reiterated Britain's stance towards European
economic and monetary union (EMU), saying Britain is unlikely to
join the union at the outset in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC radio, Cook said that Britain is unlikely to be
among the founding members of EMU.
</P>
<P>
"We've always said that it is unlikely Britain will be joining,
partly because we are a new government with a big agenda to do,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that if the single currency goes ahead
and if it is a success, then in the longer term it will be
difficult for Britain to stay out.
</P>
<P>
Cook added that Britain will not make its decision about
whether to join in 1999 until around the turn of the year, because
"it has to be based on the outturn figures for this year".
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the positive tone towards EMU shown in the
recent remarks of senior ministers reflected Prime Minister
Blair's desire not to stand in the way of other European Union
(EU) countries that are determined to launch EMU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Britain will hold the rotating EU presidency in
the upper half of next year, it is keen to retain influence over
the planned EMU even if it does not join itself right now.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Euro-Parliament Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed and
expressed its satisfaction with a resolution on Cyprus passed by
the European Parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides said at a press
briefing that the resolution covered all aspects of the Cyprus
problem and referred to all necessary measures to be taken to help
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, tabled by all political groups in the European
Parliament, denounced the joint declaration signed by the Turkish
Cypriot and Turkey in July as "illegal, provocative and not
conducing to creating the right negotiating climate for the talks
on Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We consider it as one of the best resolutions ever approved on
the Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey calls for
"gradual economic and financial integration and partial
integration on security, defense and foreign policy matters"
between both sides.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament's resolution criticized the stance of
the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to the U.N.-sponsored
peace talks last month aimed at resolving the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash reportedly set the freezing of accession negotiations
between Cyprus and the European Union, scheduled early next year,
as a precondition to progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution welcomed the outcome of the recent meetings
between President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash in Nicosia on
humanitarian issues and measures concerning investigations into
the fate of the missing people of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It also welcomed the recent announcement that Clerides and
Denktash will meet again to discuss security issues.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops on the east Mediterranean island and
took over the northern third in the wake of a failed coup by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The Turkish Cypriots
declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the international community have been
trying for decades to reunite the island as a bi-communal,
bi-zonal federation through peace talks, but no tangible results
have so far been achieved.

UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Mr. Ted Turner, the
Vice-Chairman of Time Warner Inc., had announced to contribute one
million U.S. dollars to support the goals of the United Nations,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today in a statement issued
by the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the U.N. chief said the funds would not
offset the 1.5 billion dollars that the United States owed the
United Nations because the world body could not accept
contributions from private citizens for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Mr. Turner's intention was to acknowledge the reform
efforts of the United Nations and to support the humanitarian work
the United Nations did such as lifting landmines and aiding
refugees and children in need.
</P>

The Secretary-General thanked Turner by saying "He has shown

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state,
General Sani Abacha is in a very sound state of health, his chief
press secretary David Attah said Thursday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Attah's comment came as the first official reaction to the
recent reports by some Nigerian magazines that Abacha is
suffering a serious liver illness.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a group of state house reporters that
Abacha's public appearance in the last few days ought to have put
to rest the speculations that he was ill.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, Abacha has attended the opening session
of the 27th annual conference of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants. He also met with the transition implementation
committee and out-going Russian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"Our head of state is in a very sound state of health. I even
find it difficult to keep pace with him," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Attah assured the reporters that Abacha will attend next
week's workshop dubbed "Towards a Stable Policy", jointly
organized by the State House Correspondents' Association and the
office of the chief press secretary to the head of state.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Nigeria's Special Duties Minister
Alhaji Wada Nas said in a statement in Lagos Thursday that there
is no truth in the reports that Abacha is ill.
</P>
<P>
He accused the magazines of failing to provide any evidences
in their reports and called them "agents of destabilization" who
have their "base motives".

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Kicks off Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government
released Thursday more than 10 million U.S. Dollars for the
take-off of its Family Economic Advancement Program (FEAP) to
reinforce the poverty alleviation effort.
</P>
<P>
The program, according to FEAP Director-General Abdullahi
Aliyu, is aimed to create one million jobs and establish 7,500
cottage industries mainly in the rural areas every year.
</P>
<P>
These activities are expected to contribute about two percent
to the gross national product annually between 1998 and 2010,
Aliyu told a news briefing in the capital of Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government, which puts high hope on the program, has
budgeted 4.3 billion Naira (about 51 million U.S. Dollars) for
its execution this year.
</P>
<P>
The sum of 1.07 billion Naira, or about 13 million U.S.
Dollars, released Thursday is the first part of it.
</P>
<P>
According to the director-general, the money will facilitate
the take-off the job creation scheme which involves granting
about 500,000 Naira loan to private investors for establishing
one cottage industry across the country.
</P>
<P>
The cottage industries will be set up and run on a family
basis, which will use the abundant local raw materials and
agricultural produce to produce goods suitable for the local
market.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth implementation of the program, FEAP has been
set up as a government agency according to a decree earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Henceforth all agencies providing loans to individuals and
organizations for small industries will now channel their funds
through FEAP to harmonize loan disbursement.
</P>
<P>
The loans to be channeled to the full-fledged parastatal
include those given by the national directorate of employment,
People's Bank of Nigeria, Ministry of Industries and other
ministries.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member governing board has set up the program with
Nigeria's first lady, Mrs. Maryam Sani Abacha as the patron.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Cost Nigeria Heavily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria loses about 20 billion
Naira (about 240 million U.S. dollars) a year to road accidents,
according to a government official.
</P>
<P>
The losses arose from medicine, hospital equipment and vehicle
spare parts to repair damaged vehilces, Alhaji Baba Gana Ibrahim,
deputy director of the national uniform licensing scheme, said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official did not disclose how many road accidents took
place in a year, but blamed about 80 percent of them on the human
factor, particularly the incompetence of most drivers, beside
vehicular and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
At a national road traffic regulation workshop, the official
urged state road traffic officers to implement the government's
road-worthy certificate scheme for vehicles effectively.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, vehicle owners will be given certificates
after their vehicles have been inspected.
</P>
<P>
The official said this would help ensure that only
well-maintained vehicles plied the nation's roads as part of
efforts to check the rate of accidents.

Chief Secretary of State in the military government Solomon
Musa said,"Some of the security personnel have even taken over
the whole chiefdom, chased out authorized officials of the
Department of Mineral Resources and are issuing tickets for
mining licenses and diamond plots."
</P>
<P>
Solomon Musa condemned in no uncertain terms this behavior of
the officers concerned and hereby warned them to desist from this
ugly practice with immediate effect, or face very severe
disciplinary action, state radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the statement is "a radical departure from
past positions taken by the government on diamond mining in the
country."
</P>
<P>
According to the observers, "The government has taken a bold
move to name some members of the RUF, which is now in alliance
with the military since the May 25 coup, as perpetrators in
illegal diamond mining which has been free for all even under the
ousted civilian government of Tejan Kabbah."
</P>
<P>
A Sierra Leonean geologist said Sierra Leone produces about
one million carats of diamonds every year but many of these are
smuggled out through Guinea and Liberia and are not reflected in
official records.
</P>

Many of the miners are Nigerians, Gambians, Senegalese and
Malians as well as Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-combatants to Be Accommodated: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today said it is imperative for the ruling ZANU (PF) party
to create useful roles for the former freedom fighters, most of
whom are living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is the first secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union (PF), was addressing the 31st session of
the party's Central Committee meeting. High on the agenda of the
meeting is the issue of war veterans.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans held demonstrations in July over the
suspension of their payments under the War Victims Compensation
Fund.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, imperative that we find them a useful role
in the party where their tremendous and varied experiences as
participants in the liberation struggle can continue to be not
only a source of our proud history, but also of inspiration to
the younger generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the war veterans, who had displayed the virtues of
loyalty, commitment, courage, bravery, unity and discipline
during the war of liberation, can provide the hard core of the
party which can help withstand the influence of "the unseasoned
and inconstant elements always ready to go with the wind, the
opportunists".
</P>
<P>
"The party and government have decided to define and set up a
package for each war veteran along the lines traditionally,"
Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The package will enable the veterans to enjoy benefits such as
free education, priority in allocation of accommodation and free
health services.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also lashed out at factionalism within the provincial
offices, saying the party has to immediately and effectively
resolve the differences in order to avoid unmanageable conflicts
arising from the present divisions.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Unionists Urge Renewal of EU/ACP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa's trade
unionists today said the Lome IV Convention, a preferential trade
arrangement between developing countries and the EU due to expire
in 2000, should be renewed and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
A joint Commonwealth Trade Union Coordinating Council (CTUC)
believed that the convention is unique as it provides " a
progressive framework for the developing world in the face of the
global free market drive".
</P>
<P>
The unions from the 10 southern African countries were
examining the future of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries after Lome IV Convention during a five-day workshop
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Lome IV Convention "should be renewed and strengthened beyond
the year 2000". The big difference from other trade bloc
agreements around the world is that Lome IV Convention has a big
potential to help developing countries tackle economic
globalization, said Gibson Sibanda, a CTUC executive member.
</P>
<P>
He said Lome also underpins sustainable development because it
combines preferential trade, development and aid packages with
partner organizations.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization, he said, is not a sufficient
solution for human progress in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Other conclusions reached include that Lome IV Convention's
future is critical to southern Africa in areas such as
preferential trade and development cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The delegates held that it is also essential to maintain the
bloc of ACP countries together to negotiate in unity and
solidarity with the EU and that Lome should have the values of
cooperation, partnership and human rights for better economic and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out Lome IV Convention has not reached its full
potential in such areas as human resource development, education
and training, women and gender issues and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Unions were urged to shape a role and strategy that
will contribute to the priorities of Lome plans and projects by
working with governments and other organizations in civil
society.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention is the comprehensive trade, aid and
development agreement between the 15 countries in the EU and 71
countries in the ACP.
</P>
<P>
The convention is currently being reviewed and the EU has
launched a debate on the issue.

<HEADLINE> WFP Airlifts Food to Pointe Noire of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
today began airlifting emergency food for 60,600 displaced people
in Congo's Pointe Noire area.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today said that the first WFP
Boeing 727 carrying 16 tons of beans and oil touched down this
morning in Pointe Noire, second largest city in Congo after
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Between today and tomorrow, WFP will make a total of 8
flights, delivering 132 tons of beans and oil to the area where
there are already cereal stocks of 1,300 tons.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that the cereal stocks to be used as a
one-month distribution package would be distributed beginning
from Monday to the extremely vulnerable people in the area, who
have fled from the Brazzaville area.
</P>
<P>
The original population of Brazzaville is estimated at 900,000
and 250,000 of this population still remain in the city.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Brazzaville population have fled to the
south of the country and about 300,000 could be in the southern
provinces including the Pointe Noire area.
</P>
<P>
Another 150,000 people are believed to have moved northward,
but they are virtually inaccessible to aid agencies due to the
on-going conflict, the release said.
</P>
<P>
WFP has originally planned to send the beans and oil for the
Pointe Noire people to Kinshasa by river barge, but low water
levels on some passages of the river have caused the barges
stranded.
</P>
<P>
In view of this situation, WFP has quickly responded by
mounting an airlift directly to Pointe Noire from Luanda, Angola
and barges will continue their journey once the water level
of the river rises.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, WFP airlifted 87 tons of beans and oil from
Luanda to Kinshasa in five flights for the 28,000 refugees in
Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Crashed Planes' Pieces Collected From Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Burned pieces, deflated
life-jackets and personal effects from two planes have been
unloaded at Namibia's western port city of Walvis Bay.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said the items, from one of the
two military planes believed to have collided off the Namibian
coast last Saturday, were brought to Walvis Bay by a fishing
vessel which travelled 33 hours from the scene.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known if the burnt pieces belong to the German
military plane or the American air force transport aircraft,
which crashed over the south Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
An international sea and air search mission from South Africa,
France, Germany and the United States has been combing the crash
area since the collision occurred last week.
</P>
<P>
Only a woman body believed to be from the German plane was
found on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A South African air force spokesman said today that weather
conditions have improved in the searching area, giving the
operation better chances of success.
</P>
<P>
New search areas have been identified and eight aircraft are
scouting for wreckage, possible survivors or bodies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The German plane was carrying 24 people to South Africa. The
U.S. aircraft, with nine crew members on board, was on its way
home from Namibia where it had dropped mine-clearing equipment.

UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Mr. Ted Turner, the
Vice-Chairman of Time Warner Inc., had announced to contribute one
billion U.S. dollars to support the goals of the United Nations,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today in a statement issued
by the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the U.N. chief said the funds would not
offset the 1.5 billion dollars that the United States owed the
United Nations because the world body could not accept
contributions from private citizens for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Mr. Turner's intention was to acknowledge the reform
efforts of the United Nations and to support the humanitarian work
the United Nations did such as lifting landmines and aiding
refugees and children in need.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General thanked Turner by saying "He has shown

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Increase Education Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The government plans to
increase its financial allocation to education from the present
17 percent of its budget to 22-25 percent in the coming years in
a bid to implement its "strategic program" for education.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Arnoldo Nhavoto, Minister of
Education at a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal the specific percentage or amount
of money involved, saying that it depends on which plan will be
carried out for the "strategic program".
</P>
<P>
Under the first plan, the enrolment rate for first grade
student in primary school is to grow from the current 75 percent
to 86 in the year 2000, and to 95 percent in 2006, to 100 percent
in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The second plan sees a faster growth, which stipulates the
increase of enrolment rate to 90 percent in the year 2000, 95
percent in 2006, and 100 percent in 2010.
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, children of six year old may go to school.
However, due to limited classrooms, many kids cannot go to school
until after the prescribed age. Only 15 percent of the newly
enrolled 300,000 kids go to school at six.
</P>
<P>
Nhavoto disclosed that the 16 years of civil war has destroyed
60 percent of school buildings. Only 40 percent of schools were
still operating in 1992, when the peace agreement was signed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With efforts made by the government, 96.7 percent of school
buildings have been rehabilitated, he said, adding it is
estimated that all schools would be restored in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the number of students from grade
one to four in primary schools have increased from 1.2 million in
1992 to the present 1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
The government will also enhance quality education through
improving school buildings and educational equipment, as well as
teachers' training, he noted.

<HEADLINE> FAO Pledges Aid to Ethiopia's Irrigation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Diouf, director
general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) who is currently visiting here, today pledged FAO's
assistance to Ethiopia's small-scale irrigation program.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported that, in his talks with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Diouf said Ethiopian
agriculture is almost entirely rain-fed and as a result, it is
persistently affected by erratic natural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
FAO is ready to assist Ethiopia in the implementation of the
small-scale irrigation program to bring the country's agriculture
out of its extreme dependence on rain, Diouf noted.
</P>
<P>
The program is an outcome of an agreement between Ethiopia,
China and the FAO, and will be first implemented in arid regions
of the Amhara and Tigray National States of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia currently irrigates about 3 percent of its
potentially irrigable land, compared with the 50 percent by
China, which feeds one-fifth of the world's population with only
7 percent of the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
The FAO chief arrived here today for a two-day visit. He also
met with Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada today.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government, Military Discuss Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government officials
and the senior generals today discussed the threat of the S-300
missiles to be purchased by Cyprus, vowing to block the missile
transfer with all necessary means.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff officials, including Deputy Chief of General
Staff Cevik Bir, briefed Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and other
Cabinet members on the latest development on the Cypriot missile
program, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The possible delivery of the S-300 missiles purchased by Greek
Cypriots from Russia has constituted a serious threat to the state
security of Turkey itself, the military officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials urged the government to take all possible methods
to block the transfer of the anti-aircraft missiles to the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported recently that the Russian-made missiles
would be transported into the eastern Mediterranean island soon,
causing grave concern from the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
If all diplomatic efforts end fruitless, the last option of
the counter-measures is to destroy these offensive missiles, the
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
After the military briefing on the Cypriot missile program,
Yilmaz told the press that the Turkish government would not allow
the deployment of the S-300 missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The missiles can be turned into offensive weapons with slight
modifications, Turkey will not remain indifferent to this
development, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government and the General Staff would
cooperate closely to block the delivery of the surface-to-air
missiles to the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister also urged Russia to take a
sensitive stance, saying its missile deal with Greek Cypriots
will endanger not only Turkish Cypriots' but also Turkey's
security.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Turkish army and police should tighten
security measures in the air space and in the Turkish Straits to
block the missile delivery.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government purchases around 150 S-300 missiles
from a Russian industrial company in accordance with a deal
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accusing the Cypriot government of
buying such missiles from Russia, vowing to lauch a military
strike on the weapons if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, however, argued that it imported the
Russian-made missiles for defense purpose, adding these missiles
are not directed against any country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed on the island and took over the northern third of it
following a pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots. A breakaway
republic was set up by Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus, which
is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Repel Any Attacks: Army Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian high-ranking Army
officer said today that Iran is fully prepared to fight back any
attacks or transgressions by foreign powers, especially the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Friday prayer goers at Tehran University, Major
General Seyyed Yahya Safavai, commander of Iran's elite Islamic
Revolution Corps (IRGC), warned that Iran faces major threat from
the presence of the U.S. forces in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is working to destabilize the region "by
supporting Turkey's secular government and the Zionist entity
(Israel)" to weaken Iran's role of maintaining regional peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly deployed the Fifth Fleet of the navy
and a total of 20,000 troops in the Gulf region, which has 60
percent of the world oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Safavai said the U.S. views Iran as its major regional enemy,
so "it tries to have an active presence in the region to stand
against Iran."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "IRGC forces and volunteers would
immediately, effectively and decisively respond to any form of
aggression and attack from alien enemies."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he called on the Iranian forces to further
strengthen itself, saying that he saw "the need for further
beefing up the armed forces."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's conservative
Islamists today continued their Friday demonstrations to protest
the newly adopted eight-year compulsory education law.
</P>
<P>
Around 700 protesters gathered outside the Beyazit Mosque in
Turkey's largest city of Istanbul after their prayer services,
shouting anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
They, dispersed by the security police, demanded for revision
of the education law and continuous operation of the religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
In central Turkey's Konya, the stronghold of the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party, a group of Islamists rallied on the street,
shouting slogans against the law.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters clashed with the police in Adiyaman in
southeastern Turkey, and 40 people were taken into custody for
disobeying police disperse orders.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's conservative Islamists stared to hold anti-government
demonstrations every Friday after the Parliament approved the law
in August.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a large number of religious schools will be shut
down, which is regarded as a heavy blow to the conservative
religious force.
</P>
<P>
The education reform launched by the Yilmaz government, with
the support of the military, is aimed at curbing the rapidly
growing fundamentalism in the secular republic.

<HEADLINE> Advocacy Group Says "Brady Law" Helps Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- States that require
background checks on prospective handgun purchasers are reducing
interstate gun trafficking in the United States, says a study by
The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.
</P>
<P>
The organization said Friday that figures from the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms shows that checks and
waiting periods required by the so-called "Brady law" had a major
and positive effect.
</P>
<P>
"This research demonstrates that the law that carries my
husband's name is doing even more than it was designed to do in
keeping guns out of the hands of criminals," Sarah Brady, the
center's chairwoman, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Sarah's husband, James Brady, was the former White House press
secretary. He was wounded with President Reagan in an
assassination attempt on the president in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight states have their own Brady laws and many law
enforcement officials in the others have continued the checks.
</P>
<P>
The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence found that states
requiring checks since the Brady law went into effect in 1994 are
up to 86 percent less likely to be sources of guns used in crimes
in other states than they were prior to the law's enactment.
</P>
<P>
The study covered the period between 1989 and January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the Brady law has helped to keep guns out of
the hands of thousands of criminals and others who are not
competent to possess a firearm," said R. Gil Kerlikowske, Buffalo,
New York, police commissioner and president of the Police
Executive Research Forum.
</P>
<P>
The study focused on four states -- Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi
and Georgia -- where data suggested handguns were easy to purchase
before Brady Law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month thee Justice Department reported that police
background checks blocked 173,000 illegal handgun sales since
enactment of the Brady law, including 70,000 in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in June that the federal government
could not force state and local authorities to conduct Brady's
background checks, but left intact its five-day waiting period for
a handgun purchase.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Support Small Business Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 18 economies of
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) agreed here today to take
measures that will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).
</P>
<P>
"Ministers committed to strengthen the SME Agenda and to
provide policies and activities that will provide meaningful
results to SMEs," said a joint statement released at the end of
the Fourth APEC Ministers' Meeting on SMEs.
</P>
<P>
SMEs comprise over 90 percent of all enterprises in the Asia
Pacific region and contribute between 30-60 percent of GDP of APEC
economies.
</P>
<P>
They generate about 35 percent of the region's exports and
account for 32-84 percent of employment in APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
Yet, due to their relatively small size, most SMEs encounter a
lot of difficulties in penetrating new markets and developing the
necessary skills and technology to improve their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the ministers reached consensus on
a framework for APEC SME activities to benefit small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The framework will be presented to the APEC economic leaders
for adoption at their summit slated for November in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to provide solutions to help SMEs and remove
barriers to their growth," John Manley, Canada's industry minister
and chairman of the ministerial meeting, told a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have laid the groundwork for a more dynamic contribution by
SMEs to each APEC economy, and their greater contribution to
international trade within the region," said Manley, who was
flanked by other APEC ministers.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, five issues of particular importance to
SMEs were discussed at the meeting, namely access to markets,
technology, human resources, financing and information.
</P>
<P>
On access to markets, the ministers called for harmonization of
standards, customs procedures, professional qualifications,
investment laws and taxation procedures.
</P>
<P>
On access to technology, the ministers agreed that information
and communications technologies can provide opportunities for SMEs
in a knowledge-based economy. They welcomed initiatives to
transfer technology from industrialized to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On access to human resources, the ministers discussed the
implications of an emerging knowledge-based economy on the need
for constant training and skills upgrading for SMEs in both
developed and developing countries and welcomed initiatives on
this regard.
</P>
<P>
On access to financing, they reviewed the results of a recent
consultation of APEC business associations and welcomed the
initiatives of the export credit agencies to take the lead in

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Electric Corp to Reduce Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric
Corporation announced today that it has decided to reduce power
supply due to low volume of water reserves at two of its three
dams.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Mehret Dibaba, deputy general
manager for the corporation's operation sector, said the amount
of water that entered the Koka and Melkawakena dams during this
year's rainy season (June to September) has been very low
compared to that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The in-flow to the two dams is therefore reduced by 43 and 33
percent respectively, causing energy crisis in the corporation's
interconnected power system for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
This, Dibaba said, has dictated the corporation's decision for
the alternate disruption of power supply with a view to
economizing what is available, and all month distribution of
power supply for fixed hours a week during 1997 to 1998 across
the country.
</P>
<P>
He thus urged the public and administrations of factories and
organizations to make frugal use of power supply, thereby joining
hands in the corporation's bid to effectively utilize power that
could be generated throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia enforced a 13-hours weekly power cut from December
1995 to June 1996. The emergency measure was lifted in June last
year following good rains at the dams of the hydro-power
stations.

<HEADLINE> US Congressmen Support Canadians Exempt From Border Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- More U.S. Congressmen
support Canadians in being exempted from a law that calls for
extensive tracking of every entry and exit of visitors to the
United States, a Senate spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"There has yet to emerge an opponent to exempting Canada,"
said Steve Hessler, a spokesman for Senator Spencer Abraham, who
chairs the Senate subcommittee on immigration.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is exploring methods to exempt Canadians from
the law, Hessler said.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was signed by President Bill Clinton a year ago,
requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to
create a system by next September to track the entry and exit of
foreigners in order to crack down on people living in the U.S.
illegally.
</P>
<P>
The law has been intensely criticized by Canadians, who are
concerned that the system will mean long lines at the border.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canadians paid more than 50 million trips to the
U.S., according to the Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials at the U.S.-Canadian border ask visitors what
their nationality is and often just wave them in with only a
question or two. Visitors are not stopped on their way out of the
U.S.

<HEADLINE> 091954 Zambian President Blames Europe for Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today blamed European countries for the internal
conflicts now sweeping through Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said in Kitwe, northern Zambia, that the rule of law in any
country is the strongest foundation for peace and it took Europe
over 1,000 years to democratize and that the African continent
was only decolonialized about 40 years ago, therefore it should not
be expected to be a conflict free zone.
</P>
<P>
When he opened a workshop on peace building strategy in a
civil society, he said "Europe took over 1,000 years to
democratize, how do they expect Africa to do this in less than 40
years. I blame them for most of these African conflicts."
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation Television quoted
him as saying that Africa has a long way to go before the
conflicts are fully managed but its people must start by
understanding that only a popularly elected government has the
right of power to rule the sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
He warned that absence of the rule of law in any country is a
recipe for internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
The other major contributor to the conflicts in Africa, added
Chiluba, is the slave trade by European nations.
</P>
<P>
Despite historical background, he said, Africa is now fully
responsible for what is happening on its continent now as much as
Zambians are responsible for what is occurring here.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government will not relent on its
mission of establishing institutions that contribute to peace
such as the human rights commission.

WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Japan have agreed on U.S.-Japan defense guidelines, which provide
the framework for Tokyo to give key military support to American
forces whenever the two countries consider there is a crisis in
Asia, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
"The defense guidelines... provide guidance for our political
leadership and for our military planners in terms of roles and
missions, about how the United States and Japan would respond in a
crisis -- a crisis that challenges Japan and a crisis in the
surrounding arena," said Kurt Campbell, the Pentagon's deputy
assistant secretary for Asian and Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen will meet with their Japanese counterparts next week
in New York for the culmination of almost two years of work on the
revision of the U.S.-Japan defense guidelines, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Asian countries are wary of any offensive use of
Japan's large and high-tech Self-Defense Force in the region
despite Japan's pledge to abide by restriction of its Constitution
against such deployment.
</P>
<P>
There are 47,000 American troops stationed in Japan.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid an
average of 1.8 percent more in August for the goods and services
included in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket from a year
earlier, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
This annual rate of price increase was identical to those
reported for June and July, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian consumers have paid more for transportation in the
form of higher gasoline prices, vehicle insurance premiums, new
vehicle prices and air fares since August last year.
</P>
<P>
They also paid more for food, clothing, university tuition,
cigarettes, and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
However, they benefited from lower interest rates when they
renewed mortgage loans and bought big-ticket items, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Between July and August, Canadian consumers paid more for
gasoline, clothing, footwear and alcoholic beverages and food. The
net effect was a 0.1 percent rise in the CPI.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it did not offer new aid food to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in connection with four-party
peace talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
"We have not and will not link North Korea's participation in
the four-party talks to other issues including food and therefore
the U.S. has made no such proposal (of new food aid)," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to earlier speculation that Washington and
Seoul had proposed 100,000 tons of monthly food aid to the DPRK as
Pyongyang was willing to attend the four-party peace talks in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that there had been no change in U.S.
policy for that matter.
</P>
<P>
"Decisions on food assistance are based on humanitarian
reasons. We do not use food as a political weapon. American food
aid to North Korea and four-party talks are independent of each
other. No change in that policy has been or is being
contemplated," he said.

Taiping Village, Linli County, Hunan Province, which Jiang

</P>
<P>
People throughout the nation share the common view that the
congress presented a blueprint which can be realized through the

The key to implementing the decisions of the congress centers
on firmly holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory in

</P>
<P>
Managers of large and medium-sized enterprises in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, held discussions

</P>
<P>
The managers shared the common view that adopting Deng Xiaoping
Theory as the Party's guiding ideology fits the requirements of

this particular contribution marks the historic significance of
the congress.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 members from the "Students Research Society on Deng

"The Chinese people are reassured by the fact that the Party
has established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle by
writing it into the Party Constitution," said Dong. "Young
students are more confident about the future of the Party, the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Airlifted From North Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. staff and foreign aid
workers trapped in Afghanistan's beleaguered town of
Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 kilometers north of Kabul, were
airlifted to Pakistan today, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Two U.N. planes were sent to Afghanistan's northern military
garrison of Shibarghan and neighboring Uzbekstan to fetch 15 U.N.
employees and three international aid workers, said Sarah Russell,
spokesperson for the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) for
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Two planes of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) have flown in 35 foreign aid workers to Islamabad so far.
</P>
<P>
"We have left essential staff in Mazar-e-Sharif and have not
suspended our operations," Russell said.
</P>
<P>
She said two foreigners and hundreds of Afghan employees of
various U.N. offices are still working in the stronghold of the
anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
The stranded foreigners were flown out after Afghan warring
groups offered to hold fire if the United Nations wanted to
evacuate its staff and foreign aid workers.
</P>
<P>
They had been trapped in Mazar-e-Sharif since the Islamic
Taliban militia launched attack on the northern town early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces briefly held the airport of Mazar-e-Sharif,
about 18 kilometers east of the town but lost the control to the
opposition forces a few days after.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, the U.N. offices in Mazar-e-Sharif
were ransacked and looted by gun-toting youth and losses are
estimated to run into millions of U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Freeze of Normalization with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today urged Arab states to freeze
normalization process with Israel until the Mideast peace march
makes progress.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded address at the 108th session of the Arab
League foreign ministers council that opened here today, Arafat
said Arab participation in multilateral talks should be linked up
to bilateral talks between Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Calling for unifying Arab stance, he urged Arab countries to
implement the resolutions adopted at the 1996 Cairo Arab Summit
that recommended to freeze Arab-Israeli normalization until an
Israeli compliance with the peace commitment is realized.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Mideast peace process is facing a real crisis
because of Israel's anti-Arab policies and mass punitive measures
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish state wishes to change Jerusalem's demographic
characteristics and impose a new status quo on the city before the
start of any future final settlement talks with the Palestinians,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of failing to honor any of its
obligations to redeploy its troops, open the safety passage and
crossing-points and release Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
"Israel did not only pursue its settlement activities but also
deliberately continue to disown all peace agreements," he said,
adding that Israel denies the Palestinian right to existence in a
way that threatened the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem in March. The crisis heightened after suicide bombings
hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4, killing altogether 25
people and wounding more than 300 others.
</P>
<P>
After the bombings, Israel imposed harsh closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which caused losses of nearly 6 million
U.S. dollars a day for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meetings, 18 Arab foreign ministers are
expected to examine the destructive outcome of the Israeli
policies on the long-crumbling Mideast peace process and discuss
Israel's practices in occupied Arab territories, as well as the
cut of services to Palestinian refugees due to a financial crisis
facing the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Welcomes Cooperation with Syria in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Tourist Authority
welcomed a proposed all-round and coordinated cooperation with
Syria in tourism, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Authority chief Sirwan Abdul-Kader was quoted by the INA as
saying that Iraq is looking forward to coordinating with Syria in
arranging the visits of the citizens of both countries and
organizing religious or cultural travels between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Iraqi tourist ties are longstanding and the
potential of tourist cooperation between the two sides is great,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official voiced hope for reviving the tourist
exchanges as soon as possible to boost the economic development
of the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iraq and Syria which were severed in 1980
due to Damascus's support to Iran in an eight-year Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88) have improved remarkably since a Syrian delegation paid
a visit to Iraq in May, the first in the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two countries exchanged delegation visits that
led to the reopening of joint borders in June and the signing of
trade protocols as a prelude to political rapprochement.

<HEADLINE> G7 Hopes to See Thailand Implement IMF Reform Vigorously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7)
major industrialized nations hope that Thailand would implement an
International Monetary Fund program of reform vigorously, Japanese
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Thai authorities to implement vigorously the
Fund program and continue to cooperate with the international
financial institutions," Mitsuzuka told a press conference after a
meeting of G7 financial ministers and central bank governors.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on the importance of minimizing contagion, and
we will continue to monitor closely developments in Asian
markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht has dropped 30 percent since it was floated on
July 2 after Thailand had spent billions of dollars in a vain
effort to defend the currency against speculators. The crisis has
spread to its Southeast Asian neighbors including the Philippines,
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF later arranged a 17.2-billion-US dollar rescue package
to aid the ailing Thai economy in return for a program of reform.
</P>
<P>
Japan's central bank governor, Yasuo Matsushita, said that
although the currency crisis has not settled down and the
short-term economic slowdown is unavoidable, the prospects for the
region are good in the long run as the fundamentals remain
favorable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Japan's massive external surplus with the United
States, the finance minister admitted that the US concern was
"expressed" at the meeting. "They said as a friend they had
grounds to be worried."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held prior to the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings
scheduled for September 23-25 in Hong Kong, was the first one in
Asia for seven years. G7 finance ministers last met in 1990 in
Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Other topics discussed at the meeting included economic
developments in the G7 countries, the recent progress toward the
Economic and Monetary Union in Europe, debt problems facing some
developing countries as well as IMF-related issues.

for the further advancement of the Chinese Nation due to the fact
that it summerized the experiences of the nation during the past
two decades, especially those since 14th Party National Congress
held in October 1992, provided a completed and systematic
explanation of the principal guidelines of the Party during the
primary stage of socialism, and outlined the nation's strategic
trans-century goals;
</P>
<P>
-- Jiang Zemin's report and the revised Party Constitution,
which declares that the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory will
be upheld forever, reflected the common will of the Party, Army
and people as a whole;
</P>
<P>
-- The composition of the Party's new leadership reflect the
fact that the Party Central Committee has further realized the
replacement of the older generation with younger people and the
cooperation between the two generations of leadership; and
</P>
<P>
-- The Party leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is a
glorious model of holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and is a faithful and reliable successor of the great cause
of building socialism with Chinese Characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Prosperity Means Opportunity for All: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that Asia's prosperity will pose
no threat to the rest of the world and instead, it will bring
opportunities for everyone.
</P>
<P>
"You have nothing to fear from the prosperity and well-being of
Asia; you have everything to gain," Mahathir said in a keynote
speech at a seminar organized by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"For our prosperity, we contribute to your prosperity and the
rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is full of opportunities, not just for Asia, but for
everyone," Mahathir said on the first day of four days of seminars
prior to the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF
scheduled for September 23-25 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir advocated a policy of "prospering your neighbors",
saying: "If you help your neighbors prosper, you prosper along
with them." He cited the win-win case of Japan and Malaysia, in
which Japan gained a huge trade surplus while Malaysia learned
technical know-how and expertise.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at international speculators who he said stirred
up the recent currency turmoil in Southeast Asia. "Their profits
came through impoverishing others, including very poor countries
and poor people."
</P>
<P>
He strongly attacked this zero-sum game, in which "you win,
others lose. You prosper at the expense of others'
impoverishment."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian currency ringgit has fallen significantly in
recent weeks, resulting in a de facto devaluation of 20 percent in
the currency turbulence. Mahathir expressed his bitterness that
after 30 years of toil and sweat, Malaysia was pushed back a
decade.
</P>
<P>
One of the tiger economies in Southeast Asia, Malaysia once
served as a model of healthy growth, with an annual GDP growth of
eight percent, inflation down to four percent and no foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"We have the money but not enough to defend ourselves" when
Southeast Asian tigers were targeted by currency speculators, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also blamed "the great powers" for the currency crisis
and said they do not want to see Asia prosper. "If countries in
Europe and North America can be enormously prosperous, we don't
see why we can't be allowed to be a little prosperous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the differences between Asia and other continents, he
said Asian countries should brush aside what they have been told
to do, and do as they think they should do.
</P>
<P>
"Think of Asia opportunities, and seize them," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Haze Condition Improving in Sarawak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The air quality in
Malaysia's Sarawak State where a state of haze emergency was
declared yesterday improved today.
</P>
<P>
The Air Pollutant Index (API) reading in Kuching, Sarawak's
capital, declined to 446 at 5 p.m. today from 503 at noon,
according to a Department of Environment statement.
</P>
<P>
Cloud-seeding began in Sarawak today, with an Air Force Charlie
130 aircraft used for the operation above the Kuching
International Airport in a bid to create artificial rain,
according to reports from Kuching.
</P>
<P>
However, government clinics in Sarawak have reported a drastic
increase in cases of haze-related diseases such as conjunctivitis
and asthma cases among children just a day after the state was put
on haze emergency, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak Medical Department Director Mohamed Taha Arif was
quoted as saying the number of children treated statewide for
conjunctivitis rose more than 10 times from 13 on September 18 to
154 yesterday. Asthma cases among children nearly doubled from 50
to 95 and those of upper respiratory tract infection cases also
jumped from 252 to 390 while bronchitis cases went up from eight
to 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's National Disaster Relief Management
Committee Chairman Mohamed Rahmat told reporters here today that
the state of haze emergency in Sarawak will be reviewed on
September 22.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is the national operations
director, will hold a meeting with relevant ministers to discuss
whether to revoke the declaration, Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the haze emergency declared yesterday is still in
force and that even though the API readings in Kuching have gone
down, further monitoring is still required at least for the next
72 hours.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages War Games Against Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 Iranian army
soldiers staged a counter-offensive war game against chemical
attacks on Friday, the fourth day of military maneuvers, near
Qom, 150 kilometers south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian daily Jomhuri Islami reported that the armored
and mechanized rangers of the army repelled the chemical attacks
by the hypothetical enemy and cleared the area of chemical
contamination during the war games.
</P>
<P>
Iranian forces and civilians came under Iraqi chemical attacks
during the 1980-88 war between the two countries. Since last year,
defense against chemical attacks has become an integral part of
most military and civil defense maneuvers in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Mohammad Mehrvarz was quoted by the daily as saying
the the maneuvers were the practical exercise of a legitimate
defense. "We have utilized the worthwhile experience of the era of
the Sacred Defense (war with Iraq) in these maneuvers," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the maneuvers started on Tuesday in a
900-square-kilometer area south of Qom Salt Lake and will
continue till the end of the Defense week which will begin on
September 22.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported here today that the second
phase of the maneuvers continued this morning in Koushk-e Nosrat,
near Qom.
</P>
<P>
In the maneuvers today, the Airborne Division of the Army
provided defensive coverage for tanks such as T-72, Chieftain
and Dhol-Faqar, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paratroopers belonging to Brigade-55 of the Airborne
Division of the Army also took part in today's operation which
cut off the connection between the enemy and its surrounding
forces.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Major General Seyyed Yahya Safavai, Commander of
Iran's Islamic Revolution Corps (IRGC), said that Iran will
further beef up its armed forces in order to deal with aggressions
of foreign powers, especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Iran faces major threat from the military
presence of the American forces in the Persian Gulf, adding "the
aliens are working on creating a destabilizing effect by
supporting Turkey' laical government and the Zionist entity as
the new powerful force in the region."
</P>
<P>
This is designed to "defuse Iran's powerful and decisive role
in bringing peace and security in the Persian Gulf region, Central
Asian Republics and the Caucasus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that Iran is fully prepared to stand
against any attack or transgression, adding "IRGC forces and
volunteers will immediately, effectively and decisively respond
to any form of aggression and attack from alien enemies."

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Economy Still in Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 20 (Xinhua)-- Ministry of Finance
officials of Sierra Leone Friday disclosed that the economy of
the west African state continues to register a negative growth
with a deficit of over 8.5 million U.S. Dollars as of September 3
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to records available, since the May 25 coup which
overthrew the civilian government, a mere 4.3 percent of monthly
expected revenue of 9.4 million dollors has been registered.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the military government depends on vault
financing," an official from the Finance Ministry, who asked not
to be identifed, said, adding that " This kind of financing is
not only non-sustainble and inflation generating, but also unable
to provide adequate funds for development and recurent
expenditures."
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of 1997, monthly government
revenue averaged 7.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the month of July after the coup, it fell to 406,000
dollars. During peace time, government generated 70 percent of
its revenue from Customs, 16 percent from income tax, two percent
from mining industry, five percent from road user charges and
seven percent from other sources.
</P>
<P>
Due to security and liquidity problems, Customs operation was
grounded as a result of non arrival of vessels.
</P>
<P>
The closure of business and banks hamper operation of the
income tax department, which collected only 16 percent of its
targeted revenue and fell drastically from 759,600 dollars in May
to nil in June but increased to 38.600 dollars in July after the
reopening of few middle level businesses and the state -run
Sierra Leone Commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The British owned Barclays and Standard Chartered Banks are
still shut.
</P>
<P>
All other revenue generating area are not functioning.
</P>
<P>
The records also showed that while the current average monthly
expenditure was estimated at 9.9 million dollars for 1997, 8.9
million dollars was spent by the military government from mid
June to mid July.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the government-owned Daily Mail,
Head of State Koroma said, "government revenues are drying up but
expenditures must be met."
</P>
<P>
"We are exercising fiscal and monetary controls and try to
ensure that every cent spent is for a purpose and fully accounted
for," he added.

<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent World Bank study said
that Bangladesh had been relatively stable since the June 1996
elections but the new government had had limited success in
slicing inflation and attracting foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The study, published this week in Washington by a panel of
World Bank economists on South Asia's integration into the world
economy, noted that the Bangladesh government has yet to tackle
trickier reforms, such as privatization of loss-making public
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The study said that there are many major challenges in
Bangladesh such as the reduction in the fiscal deficit, weak
macroeconomic conditions and high protectionism, a weak legal
system, administrative inefficiency and the restricted role of the
local private sector.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned factors have drawn investors' concerns, the
study added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh originates
mostly from Asia unlike other countries in South Asia where FDIs
also come from other sources, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh ranks the 106th among 114 developing countries with
regard to openness to trade, the study noted, adding that
Bangladesh is also ranked lowest among five South Asian countries
in matters of market creditworthiness.

JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has said that an effective way to curb
increasing illegal immigrants in the country is to help its
neighbors to create more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga
Province at the weekend, Mbeki said that rather than deporting illegal
immigrants, South Africa should create projects to ensure that these
countries were economically viable to provide job opportunities
for their own people.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was referring to immigrants who continued to illegally
cross the border into South Africa from impoverished neighboring
Mozambique and Swaziland in search of jobs and better prospects.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to deport illegal immigrants from neighboring
countries would both be difficult and costly for South Africa,
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the Maputo Development Corridor which has been
developed jointly by South Africa and Mozambique as a good
example in providing job opportunities to people in these area.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are more than three million
illegal immigrants from neighboring countries staying in South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Promises Not to Run for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today that he will step down when his term ends next
year and "will not run for re-election."
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the promise upon his arrival in General Santos city,
the Southern Philippines, from a 10-day, four-nation visit.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully satisfied with having served as your president for
one six-year term as mandated in the constitution," President
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, the president serves a
single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
But during the past two years, Ramos' ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) and some mass
organizations have been campaigning for charter changes to lift
the term limits of the president and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
The charter change campaign has met strong resistance from the
opposition parties and the Catholic Church, which are scheduled to
stage an anti-charter change rally in Manila tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that over one million people are expected to
attend the rally, which may bring about political instability in
the country if clashes between pro-charter-change members and
protesters.
</P>
<P>
The government and the military have warned of possible bomb
explosions and attacks by extremists during the rally.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Ramos is trying to forestall a political
crisis by making his promise upon his return from a trip to
Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement, Ramos also said that a survey by his
cabinet indicates that a great majority of people want charter
changes, "but, after the May 1998 elections."
</P>
<P>
The survey showed a ratio of three to one favoring charter
change after the 1998 elections rather than before the elections,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"So, what other good news is there?" Ramos said, "I will not
run for re-election."
</P>
<P>
"As an outgoing president, I will see to it that there will be
an orderly transfer of the presidency and all its powers to my
elected successor, whoever he or she maybe."

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Splits Over Ousted President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, which is in the
forefront of resolving the crisis in Sierra Leone, said Friday
that the military junta became split over whether to restore the
country's ousted president or not.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council
(AFRC) in the capital Freetown Friday, 30 of the 40 members moved
for the restoration of ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the
Nigerian defense headquarters disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to defense spokesman Godwin Ugbo, the refusal of 10
AFRC members to reason with the other 30 led to a free for all
brawl among the council men at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The junta has been suffering unanimous international
condemnation since the coup that overthrew the legitimate
government in May.
</P>
<P>
West African countries, supported by the international
community, have enforced economic embargo and sanctions to flush
out the junta.
</P>
<P>
Members of the military government and their families are
refused to leave the troubled country, as one of the sanction
measures.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the 30 council members who called
for restoration of constitutional rule at the meeting had sought
for safe passages for themselves and their families out of the
country as condition for the handover.
</P>
<P>
Captain S. A. Musa, the Chief Secretary of the Sierra Leonean
military government who moved the motion, was quoted as
cautioning the AFRC that " We cannot run a country when both
local and international community are against us".
</P>
<P>
Such persuasive statements from Musa drew negative reactions
from Eldred Collins, Secretary of Trade and Industry, noted the
spokesman, who is the director of defense information.
</P>
<P>
Collins, along with nine other council members, vowed that the
restoration of President Kabbah would be resisted, the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Calls for Reversing Decline of Official Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 24 developing
countries today urged developed nations to reverse the declining
trend of official development assistance (ODA) to the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
"The percentage of combined donor GNP (gross national product)
devoted to ODA has continuously declined over the past 50 years
and in 1996 fell to its nadir," said a communique issued at the
end of the G-24's 57th ministerial meeting here.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers "emphasized the need to reverse
this declining trend in order to help recipient countries
alleviate poverty and reach sustainable growth," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference later, Antonio Casas Gonzalez, chairman
of the G-24, also said the ministers "emphasized the very
significant contribution of the developing world in the growth of
the global economy."
</P>
<P>
"This should be appropriately reflected in the decision-making
processes of the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs)," said
Gonzalez, who is also president of the Central Bank of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
BWIs refer to the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), both were established under the agreement reached in
Bretton Woods in the United States 53 years ago. The World Bank
and the IMF will hold their joint annual meetings in Hong Kong
next week.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the need for adequate technical assistance
and financing assurances to help developing countries to move
toward capital account convertibility, the communique noted that
the liberalization of the capital account should not be made a
condition for the use of the IMF's resources.
</P>
<P>
The communique also warned that the capital account
liberalization process could put additional stress on the
economies that are already straining to adjust to globalization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed the "timely response" of the IMF to the
immediate problem in South-East Asia and the substantial support
package mobilized by Thailand's neighbors, saying that they are a
demonstration of regional solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed full support for cooperative
international efforts to combat transnational bribery, money
laundering, and other forms of economic crime.
</P>
<P>
The ministers voiced concern at the slow progress in
implementing the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs).
</P>
<P>
"While they (ministers) note the preliminary agreements to
implement the HIPC initiative, they call for a timely finalization
 of those agreements in order to allow eligible countries to
benefit from the initiative," said the communique.

<HEADLINE> G7 Calls for Avoiding Excessive Currency Depreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7)
industrialized nations, reviewing the recent financial turmoil
that has swept Southeast Asia, said today that "excessive currency
depreciation" should be avoided to prevent the re-emergence of
large external imbalances.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed recent developments in exchange and financial
markets," said a statement issued at the end of a meeting of the
finance ministers and central bank governors of Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that exchange rates should reflect economic
fundamentals and that excess volatility and significant deviations
from fundamentals were undesirable," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context we emphasized the importance of avoiding
excessive depreciation where this could lead to the re-emergence
of large external imbalances," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to monitor developments in exchange markets and to
cooperate as appropriate," it added.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Gradual Capital Account Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- International financial
experts today called on developing countries to be prudent about
liberalizing their capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred senior bankers and researchers urged
countries to be fully prepared before allowing free inflows and
outflows of capital.
</P>
<P>
They reached consensus on the issue at a seminar on capital
account liberalization here today, which was part of a series of
events before the annual meetings of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Guitian, director of the IMF Monetary and Exchange
Affairs Department, said that while benefits of liberalizing the
capital account far exceed potential costs, risk-control mechanism
should be in place to reduce the possibility of any financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that free capital movements facilitate a more
efficient global allocation of savings and help channel resources
into their most productive uses.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out that negative results will be possible
without first strengthening prudential supervision over the
banking system and financial market.
</P>
<P>
Governments should establish a sound basis of macro-economic
policy framework, tighten financial supervision and improve the
structure of the economy so as to reduce risks from any sudden
market changes, Morris Goldstein, a U.S. economist, said.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to phase the process of capital account
liberalization appropriately and retain proper capital controls in
the transition period, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that so far all the most advanced economies have
opened their capital accounts while 139 countries have freed
controls on current account transactions.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAROTONGA (Cook Islands), September 19 (Xinhua) -- The 28th
South Pacific Forum ended here this afternoon after adopting a
communique centering on regional trade, security, climate change
and nuclear shipments.
</P>
<P>
Heads of states and governments of the 16 member countries were
meeting here for the past three days to discuss the issues facing
the South Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the leaders "acknowledged the importance of
public accountability to economic development and agreed to
implement legislation, supported by administrative measures to
counteract undesirable financial activities in the region, noting
that such activities undermined development."
</P>
<P>
The forum urged developed states to honor their obligations and
commitments to provide financial assistance to the Pacific island
states.
</P>
<P>
It supported the establishment of the proposed trade office in
the People's Republic of China and welcomed the offer by China to
contribute funding for the office.
</P>
<P>
Climate change was the heated-debated issue at the forum.
However, the final communique said that forum leaders recognized
that participants at the Kyoto Conference in December, where
developed countries are expected to agree mandatory cuts in their
CO2 emissions, may adopt different approaches, but all forum
members are unified in their support of the principles set out in
the communique.
</P>
<P>
They urged all participants of the conference to pursue
vigorously an outcome which would produce the highest level of net
reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally
binding protocol or other legal instrument.
</P>
<P>
Pacific small island nations are particularly concerned that
the rising sea level caused by climate change will bring damage to
their environment and tourist and fishery industries.
</P>
<P>
On radioactive waste shipments, the forum agreed that
"shipments of plutonium and radioactive wastes through the region
posed a continuing concern and agreed to adopt a consistent
position on the issue, taking into account the risks of an
accident occurring and the consequences of such an accident."
</P>
<P>
"It reiterated the expectation that such shipments should be
carried out in a manner which addressed all possible contingencies
and the concerns of relevant countries."
</P>
<P>
The forum noted the efforts of Japan, France and the United
Kingdom in providing information about recent shipment, and
expressed the hope that this would continue.
</P>
<P>
The next forum is to be hosted by the Federated States of
Micronesia at a date to be finalized by the host country in
consultation with the Forum Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Theft Rampant in S. African Gold Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- About five billion Rand
(1.1 billion U.S. Dollars) in gold bullion were being stolen a
year in South Africa, local daily Saturday Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the amount of gold stolen from all the mines vary
between 10 and 15 percent of the total production. It was
affecting the viability of the mines, mine managers were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa's gold mines could produce 10 percent more
per annum, we could probably employ 80,000 more miners," James
Watt, a metallurgist, said.
</P>
<P>
Some illegal dealers were earning up to 10,000 rand a day
selling gold nuggets to overseas-based syndicates, informed
sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The preferred destination for bootlegged bullion was
Switzerland, but Britain and India also had a passion for the
precious metal, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to get an accurate figure, but we estimate
1.6 billion Rand (340 million U.S. Dollars) worth of gold is
ending up in Swaziland alone," said Andre Fourie, operations
manager for security at Gold Fields, a well-known gold producer
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gold was reportedly smuggled through customs at
Johannesburg international airport and Durban's airport and
harbor.
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with crooked miners and crooked security
guards on the mines, and there are a lot of syndicates," said
Superintendent Henk Van Rensburg of the Diamond and Gold Unit in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The highly-organized syndicates had infiltrated nearly every
South African mine and were capable of refining gold, forging
transport licenses and export papers, and accessing foreign
networks to sell their products, Rensburg said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Foreign Ministers Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 Arab foreign
ministers met at the Arab League (AL) headquarters here today to
discuss the crumbling Mideast peace process and the Palestinian
cause.
</P>
<P>
High on the two-day meeting's agenda are Israeli practices in
occupied Arab territories, the Jewish settlement expansion, and
the cut of services to Palestinian refugees due to a financial
crisis facing the U.N. Relief and Work Agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss conditions in the occupied
Syrian Golan Heights, the planned Turkish-Israeli war games,
Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and the situation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The 108th AL Ministerial Council meeting, chaired by Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, will also dwell on the
planned U.N. reforms and the Arab demand to have a permanent seat
at the U.N. Security Council as well as a host of other issues of
Arab concern.
</P>
<P>
The session's 44-item agenda includes inter-Arab cooperation
and executive steps to establish a pan-Arab free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
will address the inaugural session on the current crisis facing
the peace process and the Israeli suppressive practices against
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour meeting here on Friday night of foreign
ministers from Egypt, PNA, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, an
identical stance was adopted on a number of issues, which will be
verbalized into resolutions at today's session, said Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats reaffirmed their rejection of the Israeli policy,
their commitment to the land-for-peace principle and Madrid terms
of reference, as well as full support of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's speech on August 5 in Washington which
outlined a balanced U.S. policy towards the peace parties.
</P>
<P>
Albright left the region on September 15 after visiting Israel,
the Palestinian territories, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
Lebanon. Her visit is largely considered in the Mideast as a
positive step by the U.S. to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said the possibility of
freezing the normalization process with Israel still exists.
</P>
<P>
"This is a principled stance until the Israeli position
demonstrates that there is some change," Abdul-Meguid said in an
interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
This freeze includes putting on hold all steps made to
normalize ties with the Jewish state as part of the peace process
and to boycott multi-lateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been deadlocked since
March when Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem. And the five-month crisis heightened after five
suicide bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4 that
killed 25 people and wounded more than 300 others.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Economy Stronger Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Swedish government expects
the national economy to grow 2.3 percent in 1997 and 3.1 percent
in 1998, up 0.6 percentage points compared to the previous
estimation in the Spring Budget Bill with rapidly increasing
private consumption.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remains low and government finances have developed
more positively than expected, said the government's 1998 budget
bill presented Friday by Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink to
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It said that the surplus in the balance on current account is
expected to reach 70 billion Swedish kronor (about 9.2 billion US
dollars) in 1998, or approximately 4 percent of GDP (gross
domestic product).
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the country is estimated to be at 2 percent by the
end of this year and drop to 1.5 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improved economic situation, the Swedish government
will fail to fulfil its target of halving visible unemployment by
the year of 2000, which would bring unemployment rate down to 4
percent. The figure is now expected to be 4.5 percent in the year
2000.

</P>
<P>
The queen was not on the helicopter when the accident took
place, reportedly due to the bad weather.

<HEADLINE> French Press Comment on 15th CPC Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Major French newspapers today
commented or carried reports on the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), saying the CPC has shown its
determination to push forward economic reform and drive through
the campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The national daily Le Figaro said if China needs a new team of
leadership having the courage to adapt to the new epoch, the seven
members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau have
decided to make up such a team.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that by presenting his six other colleagues in
the Political Bureau in the People's Great Hall today, the CPC
General Secretary Jiang Zemin had no doubt that the new Chinese
leadership can respond to the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing to the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau also showed the CPC's
determination to fight corruption and further develop economic
cooperation with other countries, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Another national daily Le Monde said in its editorial that six
months after the demise of Deng Xiaoping, the CPC led by Jiang
Zemin is pushing forward economic reform and does not hesitate to
"knock over" the orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the CPC this week decided to let private
capital flow into state enterprises, which it said had been so far
untouched by the reform.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund "rivaled each other" in praising the economic achievements of
China and its new decisions on economic reform when they were
holding their annual sessions in Hong Kong this week.
</P>
<P>
"These gestures bring about a good climate. One can better feel
it when taking into account the policy of Chinese government in
Hong Kong and its announcement to reduce customs duties on the eve
of China's admission into the World Trade Organization. All
converge to give the impression that China is anxious... to
integrate itself into the international community," said le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the participants of the 15th CPC National
Congress were more representative of all walks of the Chinese
society than before, and that many delegates expressed their views
freely in front of the media.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said that the make-up of the new Chinese
leadership reflects the two "great poles of interests for the
moment" in China: economic reform and the fight against
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Chalks Revenue Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Total revenue of the Kenyan
government fell short of the target by 6.3 billion Shillings
(112.7 million U.S. Dollars) during the 1996/97 fiscal year,
according to the latest Quarterly Budget Review.
</P>
<P>
The governmental revenue reached 149.2 billion Shillings (2.7
billion Dollars) in the year, making up 27.5 percent of Gross
Domestic Product. The target was 155.5 billion Shillings (2.83
billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
All major revenue items, such as income tax, customs duty,
excise duty, and value-added tax on imports, under-performed
compared to the targeted levels, said the review made by the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall on import duties was due to the decline in
import volumes during the second and third quarters of the fiscal
year, even with the appreciation of the Shilling against the hard
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The drop in sales of beer and cigarettes, the two most
important revenue items under the excise tax area, adversely
affected revenue.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's First AIDS Hospital to Open soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's first ever HIV/AIDS
patients' hospital will open in the next two weeks, local mass
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Proprietor Pola Donck from the Netherlands was quoted as
saying here on Friday that 20 patients could be accommodated at
same time in the 200,000-U.S.-dollars hospital.
</P>
<P>
She said she embarked on the project to serve the people with
AIDS after her brother died for the disease in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a coincidence that I have found myself in Zambia
for this project. I have come to like the peoople here because of
their hospitality. This is to emphasize the fact the HIV/AIDS
patients deserve care."
</P>
<P>
Donck urged Zambians to talk more about AIDS because "an enemy
you always talk about will ultimately reverse, but if you keep
quiet about it, he will attack you a second time."
</P>
<P>
A Dutch nurse is expected to come and work voluntarily at the
hospital while a resident Catholic nun will also voluntarily
oversee the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Donck will be here for next two years before she finally hands
over the hospital to the local Catholic sisters.
</P>
<P>
Donck's next project is to construct an orphanage also in
Lusaka for children who are victims of collapsing families due to
the deaths of parents from either AIDS or other tragedies of
life.

Governors at the forthcoming annual meeting starting in Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran has condemned the United
States of recent nuclear test while hindering peaceful use of
atomic energy in Iran, Iran's official news agency IRNA said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement by the Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Friday night as saying that the
U.S. had been blocking peaceful measures supervised by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) while that country had
itself been conducting destructive atomic tests.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.S. impediments in peaceful use of
atomic energy was contrary to Washington's commitment to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Due to its hostility against the Iranian nation, the spokesman
said, the U.S. has ignored Iran's atomic energy use for peaceful
purposes and adopted a discriminatory attitude vis-a-vis NPT.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the role of IAEA as the sole legal body to
supervise nuclear activities for peaceful purposes, adding that
it was the only agency which could sanction peaceful performance
of countries in using nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the advanced members of NPT were duty
bound to unconditionally assist other member states for the
peaceful application of atomic energy needed in their development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Iran is now building a 1,000 megawatt nuclear power nuclear
plant near the southern port of Bushehr with help of Russia which
will help Iran complete the project by supplying equipment and
facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel for operation.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report, Tehran has shown interest in
purchasing nuclear power facilities from India.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has pressured Russia and other
countries for not having nuclear cooperations with Iran and it is
accusing Tehran of seeking weapons of mass destruction. But
Tehran denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Grows in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade at
current prices grew by 8.4 percent in August on a three-month
moving average basis, with increases scored in both exports and
imports, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that non-oil domestic exports increased by 7 percent
while re-exports increased by 6.6 percent. Oil exports grew
moderately by 1.9 percent and non-oil imports continued to
increase, by 10 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports rose by 5.5
percent. This was the third consecutive month of positive growth,
though slightly lower than the 6.7 percent increase recorded in
July.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that while domestic exports of semiconductors
continued to expand strongly by 23.1 percent and that of printed
circuit boards assembled increased by 13 percent, export growth of
disk drives moderated to 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, re-exports rose steadily by 7.2 percent on a
monthly basis, due mainly to re-exports of electronics and related
products to the European Union and the United States, it said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports increased strongly by 14.1 percent in the
month, reflecting largely increases in electronics components and
parts, the TDB said.

<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The principal result of the Franco-German summit in Weimar is
its success in rubbing out the memory of the previous summit held in
June in Poitiers, France, which was dominated by the reserve of
France over the EU stability pact on monetary union.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany said Friday they were moving ahead on a
series of issues without announcing concrete projects except some
cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
The most astonishing gesture by France during the summit was
the imprompt visit paid by President Jacques Chirac to the former
site of the Buchenwald concentration camp outside Weimar, where
60,000 Jews and others were killed by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
-- Different from the referendum held in Scotland last week
which overwhelmingly adopted a project on local parliament as was
proposed by the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Wales voted Friday with only a 6,721-vote marginal majority to
adopt a project by the government to set up its own
parliament: only 50.3 percent voted for the project, and 49.3
percent voted against.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 11,000 historical and cultural sites in France are
open to the public today and Sunday, on the occasion of the
National Patrimony Days. Some historical monuments, museums,
schools and government buildings are open for the first time to
the public, while many historical and cultural sites remain closed
because they have not finished their renovation and restoration.
</P>
<P>
-- Ted Turner has decided to pay the debt of the United States
owing to the United Nations. The amount of one billion US dollars
that the creator of CNN decided to give the United Nations was
equal to the arrears owed by the most powerful, but least
generous, member of the United Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> 50 People Injured in Blast in West Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A powerful blast near the
police station in the Croat-controlled western Mostar Thursday
wounded 50 people, the Herzegovina-Neretva Cantonal Interior
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that three security guards of the police
headquarters were seriously injured and one of them were
immediately sent to a Croatian hospital by a SFOR (Multinational
Stabilization Force) armoured carrier.
</P>
<P>
The blast destroyed 56 apartments in the building and about 44
cars around the building, said the minister for internal affairs
of Croatia in the Mostar region.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which was reportedly caused by a car bomb, was
the worst in Bosnia since the Dayton peace accords ended three and
a half years' civil war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We are obliged to warn that this act ensued an orchestrated
media campaign against Croats and is the worst in a line of
terrorist acts against Croats who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"
said Kresimir Zubak Friday, the Croat member of the
Bosnia-Herzegovina three-member Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Zubak urged the relevant bodies to investigate into the case
and punish the criminals.
</P>
<P>
Mostar, 50 miles southwest of Sarajevo, is divided into the
Croat-controlled west and Muslim-controlled east.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners of both sides had opposed the joint police force, a
sign of the desire of some to forget the divisions created by
bitter Muslim-Croat fighting in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Although the Muslim-Croat war ended in 1994 with the creation
of a US-brokered Muslim-Croat federation, tensions have remained
in Mostar, one of Bosnia's most war-damaged area.

<HEADLINE> India Dares Suzuki to Withdraw from Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The bitter row between the
Indian government and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation over the
management of a joint venture took an ugly turn on Friday as
Indian Industry Minister Murasoli Maran dared Suzuki to withdraw
from the venture, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up on August 27 when the board of Maruti
Udyog Limited, a 50-50 Indian-Japanese joint venture to
manufacture cars, appointed an Indian government nominee, RSSLN
Bhaskarudu, as the company's new managing director.
</P>
<P>
Despite several efforts, the problems between the partners
could not be resolved and Suzuki finally moved to the Delhi High
Court filing a petition to stay the appointment of Bhaskarudu as
managing director.
</P>
<P>
Taking a hard stand on the fight with Suzuki, Industry Minister
Maran said on Friday that the Japanese company "is welcome to walk
out of Maruti Udyog (the joint venture)."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will continue to support
Bhaskarudu's appointment as managing director of Maruti Udyog.
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of people waiting," he warned. "All the
major automobile majors in the world are in India. They are
waiting to jump at the opportunity (to replace Suzuki)."
</P>
<P>
Suzuki has contended that according to the agreement between
the Indian government and Suzuki, the managing director's
appointment could be made only on obtaining its concurrence.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on Friday, the Delhi High Court reserved its order
till Monday on the Suzuki petition challenging the nomination of
Bhaskarudu as managing director.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers 10.5 Million Dollars for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to contribute
10.5 million U.S. Dollars to help reduce Uganda's debts to the
African Development Bank (ADB), reported the local daily, The
Monitor, today.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Friday by the British High
Commission said that unveiling a five-point plan proposed by the
British government to resolve the debt problems of poor
countries, the British government urged other countries to follow
British lead in writing off aid loans to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The British decision follows an agreement by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year to Uganda's
eligibility as the first country to benefit from the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to the initiative, the two multilateral financial
institutions together with the regional development banks, will
reduce the value of their outstanding loans to eligible
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-point plan, Britain also pledged to cancel the
remaining debt due to the United Kingdom from lower income
Commonwealth countries.
</P>
<P>
The ADB portion of the debt relief for Uganda will be 23
million U.S. Dollars. But the bank is able to finance only part
of this - some 6.8 million U.S. Dollars from its own resources.
</P>
<P>
Britain's bilateral contribution of 10.5 million U.S Dollars,
together with contribution totalling 5.6 million U.S. Dollars
from Norway and the Netherlands, mean that the cost of reducing
Uganda's debts to the ADB will now be covered in full, the press
release said.

<HEADLINE> Ten Buried Alive as Building Collapses in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 people,
including a pregnant woman, were buried alive Friday after a
three-story building collapsed in Kenya's capital Nairobi, the
East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy struck in Eastleigh in northeastern Nairobi around
10:00 a.m.. The building housed a supermarket on the ground floor
and self-contained residential houses on the first and second
floors. Its third floor was still under construction.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people teamed up with the police and firemen
from Nairobi City Council in a rescue operation that lasted for
hours. But they had only managed to save five people by 1:00
p.m..
</P>
<P>
A one year old infant was the first to be saved from the
debris. Four men were also dug out later taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Victims trapped under thick heaps of debris could be heard
crying out for help, but little could be done other than just
continue digging, an exercise which was proving futile when the
rescuers finally reached huge slabs of concrete.
</P>
<P>
The structure was surrounded by extensions which seemed poorly
planned. This hindered the access of bulldozers, crane tractors
and fire engines.
</P>
<P>
Looters had a field day as they stole sodas and gulped them on
the spot. Others carried away radios and televisions before the
police arrived at and guarded the area.

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Intervenes to Curb Rupee Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Reversing its role as a
seller of dollars in the last one month, the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) bought 25-50 million U.S. dollars on Friday to arrest the
appreciation of the rupee, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank stepped in when the Indian currency
strengthened to 36.25 rupees against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the past one month that the apex bank
acted to arrest the strengthening of the rupee.
</P>
<P>
The "reverse intervention" by the RBI sent out a signal that
the informal band is fixed at 36.25-36.60 rupees per dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The two-way intervention has made it clear that the apex bank
has fixed a band to stem volatility in the market which will
enable exporters and importers to cover their positions without
speculations," a corporate treasurer in a private company was
quoted as saying.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has

Province in western Kenya where the disease had claimed more than
100 lives in the past two months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Moi Criticizes IMF, World Bank for Introducing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi complained that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank are introducing new conditions for further Assistance even
when Kenya agreed to restructure the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times today quoted President Moi as saying Friday at
Kabarnet town, west Kenya, that the two organizations want the
Kenyan government to divorce itself from the sector.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that the conditionality is not possible since the
government had a vital stake in such areas as rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the call for strict regulations in the energy
sector, including the monitoring of power supply in the national
grid, decrying "too much internal interference" by foreign people
claiming to be friends of the country.
</P>
<P>
Moi accused local organizations like the Federation of Kenya
Employers of colluding with the IMF and World Bank to sabotage
government efforts to initiate reforms in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
President Moi reiterated that the lapsing of a crucial loan
package by the IMF amounting to 205 million U.S. Dollars was
purely political.
</P>
<P>
Following the IMF decision to suspend the loan to Kenya on
July 31, Moi met and held discussions with high ranking officials
from the two organizations on the restructuring of the energy
sector and other areas.
</P>
<P>
However, even after Kenya met their conditions, Moi said, the
two organizations were still introducing new conditions.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Kenyan people to remain united to be able
to overcome economic blackmail from international organizations
and maintain their dignity.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has formed a
nation-wide Chemical Management System (CMS) to prevent human beings
and the environment from hazardous chemicals, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A resolution was passed this week in Dar es Salaam at the climax
of a three-day workshop on chemicals management and safety, acting
Government's Chief Chemist Vera Mpore said in an interview with the
local newspaper Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Mpore said that the resolution was reached after realizing that
there was no any other means to prevent human beings and the
environment further from increased hazardous chemicals, apart from
formulating the chemicals' management system.
</P>
<P>
She noted, "It was also felt that in a number of countries,
including Tanzania, there was a need for a harmonized system of
classification, labeling and making of chemicals."
</P>
<P>
After learning that Tanzania was soon becoming a dumping ground of
foreign products unit for human consumption, a committee comprising
various food, chemicals and industrial activists met in February
this year to study a national profile.
</P>
<P>
"It was after going through the national profile when we
concluded that the need to deal with the rampant and hazardous
chemical was unavoidable," Mpore said.

FUZHOU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Three processing companies
have commenced operations in the Fuzhou Bonded Zone in east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the companies signaled the zone's increasing

export products processing base for Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
The zone, one of China's 15 free trade zones, has approved more
than 380 projects related to foreign trade, processing, storage
and exhibitions, with said projects involving a combined
investment of 430 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The zone's foreign trade volume for the first half of this year
amounted to 91.62 million US dollars, up 96.9 percent on last year's
same period.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which neighbors on Mawei Port, one of China's ten
leading ports, has in recent years tapped the full advantages of
international marketing networks and inland raw materials to
develop its processing industry and entrepot trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local sources report that a number of overseas-funded
processing enterprises will go into operation within the year.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Malawi is
to carry out a joint feasibility study next month to tame Songwe
river in Mbeya Region to reduce floods during rainy seasons, said
a news dispatch from Mbeya.
</P>

<P>
Mphande added that it will also look into the possibility of

Lake Nyasa is shared by Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique and in
most cases its floods cause havoc to residents living in the
shores of the lake.

Songwe river borders Karonga area in Malawi and Songwe in
Tanzania. It sometimes changes borders, diverting its course to

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai Residents Turn to Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Shanghai
residents, who are widely known for their adeptness at turning a
profit, have in recent years turned to real estate, a new
investment target which offers high returns and low risks.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Beijing-based Zero
Investigation Co. shows that 1.6 percent of the Shanghai people
are involved in real estate investment.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the increasingly strong economic strength of
local people is the main factor for the recent recovery of the
real estate market in the largest metropolitan area in China.
</P>
<P>
Local savings deposits at the end of July this year stood at
222.04 billion yuan (26.75 billion US dollars), up 26.2 percent on
the previous year's period. In addition, local urbanites expended
37 percent more for housing in the first six months of this year
than in the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many residents are currently earning profits by purchasing and
then leasing low-priced housing, with a number of investor buying
apartments in the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also introduced a series of
preferential policies to boost the local real estate market, with
local banks providing mortgage loans the purchase of homes.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish market has prompted real estate developers to
adopt innovative methods to promote sales.

<HEADLINE> Plan to Help African Girls in Science Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Female Education in
Mathematics and Science in Africa (FEMSA) is devising a national plan
of action to promote participation of girls in science subjects.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was revealed Friday in Arusha, northern Tanzania,
by FEMSA coordinator Joseph O'Connor at a consultative meeting of the
UNESCO on girls and women in science and technology in Africa.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said that the plan will incorporate initially four
countries -- Cameroon, Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda, and it will begin
with national seminars for senior education officers, gender activists
and university representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha meeting was also told that the African Forum for
Children's Literacy in Science Teaching (AFCLIST) is closely
monitoring the science education projects in sub-Saharan countries to
ensure that they effectively promote girls' participation and
performance.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are underway to establish a center of excellence in gender
studies in mathematics, science and technology at the Makerere
University in Uganda, according to a paper titled "AFCLIST and the
promotion of girls' education in science and technology" that was made
public in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The center will, among other things, monitor gender equity within
AFCLIST and develop gender sensitization training.
</P>
<P>
The project will be a joint venture between AFCLIST, the forum
for African Women Educationalists, FEMSA and the University of Oslo,
Norway.

<HEADLINE> Clear Regulatory Framework Vital to Asian Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Government efforts are
urged to work out a clearly-defined regulatory framework in order
to accelerate private participation in the long-run,
capital-demanding infrastructure projects, according to a seminar
here today.
</P>
<P>
Several leaders from both public and private sectors took part
in the morning seminar, which focused on "Infrastructure
Development in Asia: Accelerating Private Participation."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that Asia will require 1.5 to two
billion U.S. dollars for infrastructure development in the next
ten years, and today less then 15 percent of the financing comes
from the private sector. How to move the 15-percent ratio up
turned out to be a hot topic in today's discussion.
</P>
<P>
Montek Ahluwahlia, Finance Secretary of India said: "Government
policies need to be clearly defined to create a regulatory
environment and a level playing field between private and public
sectors in infrastructure development."
</P>
<P>
The Indian official said that Asian governments have recognized
that private participation is necessary not just for lack of
financial resources, but for the purpose of enhancing economic
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Toyoo Gyohten, president of Japan's Institute for International
Monetary Affairs, listed three concerns in attracting private
investment in infrastructure development -- project risk,
transaction cost and financing problems. He said that weakness in
regulatory framework, frequent government intervention and lack of
coordination between central and local authorities all contribute
to project risk.
</P>
<P>
"The host countries' commitment is the first and foremost
priority," said Gyohten, who once worked for the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
His view was shared by those from the private sector. Karl
Hermann Badman, Chief Financial Officer of the Siemens AG, said:
"A stable legal and regulatory framework is the prerequisite for
implementing infrastructure projects." The other crucial point is
the economic soundness of the project, according to the German
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Wu, managing director of Hong Kong-based Hopewell
Holdings Ltd., asked Asian governments to grant national treatment
to foreign investors. "Any investment, either domestic or foreign,
is concentrated on creating new wealth. Foreign investors only
take a small fraction of the wealth," said Wu, whose company has
invested widely in power plants, roads and bridges in China and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the seminar agreed that the recent currency
turbulence in Southeast Asia would not produce a lasting damage to
the infrastructure projects in the region, and would not deter
investors in a long term. But they stressed the importance of
developing domestic financial market, which can speed up the
infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour discussion on Asian infrastructure was among a
series of seminars, organized by the World Bank and the IMF before
their joint annual meetings, scheduled for September 23 and 25 in
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Speaks at G-24 Ministerial Meeting  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese finance
official today called on the international community in general,
and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
particular, to increase cooperation to prevent and alleviate the
adverse impacts of speculative activities to the world economy,
particularly the economy in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Invited to speak at the 57th Ministerial Meeting of the Group
24, comprising 24 developing countries, China's Vice-Minister of
Finance Liu Jibin said that the massive international capital
flows in developing countries' capital markets can not only
promote economic development, but also bring unstable factors.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the developing countries are required to further
study how to reasonably liberalize and effectively administer
their capital accounts, Liu said. "The recent currency turmoil in
Southeast Asia has once again sent us a warning signal."
</P>
<P>
The IMF should be extremely cautious in promoting opening the
capital account convertibility, and should first assist the
developing countries to study the pressing problems before
liberalizing the capital account, and provide them with technical
assistance and policy advice, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that, in promoting capital account
convertibility, the Fund should respect the sovereignty of members
and the existing jurisdiction of other international treaties,
allow sufficient flexibility for the members with immature
conditions under the transitional arrangements, and assist them in
proceeding toward capital account convertibility in an orderly and
healthy manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed China's support for an increase in quotas under
the Eleventh General Review of Quotas to strengthen the IMF's
financial capability.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, the share of the developing countries
 in the world economy has constantly increased, he said. However,
he added, their quota share in the Fund and capital share in the
World Bank have been declining.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO,Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
all higher.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market closed encouragingly this week, on
unexpected late buying on the last trading day, sparked by fresh
covering in the futures.
</P>
<P>
September South closed substantially higher to 1,475 riinggit
(about 491.6 U.S. dollars) per ton, up 105 ringgit (about 35 U.S.
dollars) from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The market is likely to remain favorable next week on technical
buying support, dealers said, adding that however, further
movement would depend on the performance of the futures market and
the currency factor was also expected to determine movement next
week.
</P>
<P>
Throughout this week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was
very firm with its price all the way up on renewed buying
interest, hitting a 24-month high at the close.
</P>
<P>
The metal settled the week at 16.44 ringgit (about 5.48 U.S.
dollars) per kg, up 78 sen from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Local tin gained strong support from overseas buyers as the
metal was cheap based on the depreciating local currency Ringgit
which breached the 3.0000 level to the U.S. dollar on the first
trading day and was quoted at 3.0340/90 to the U.S. dollar on the
final trading day, triggering heavy demand for the local tin.
</P>
<P>
This week's accumulated turnover extended to 643 tons compared
with 545 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was dominated by Europeans, Japanese and locals.
</P>
<P>
The strong rise on the London Metal Exchange (LME) also spilled
over to the local front which contributed to the strong gain on
the KLTM.
</P>
<P>
The local metal market is expected to consolidate next week.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, October RSS One was
4.0 sen higher to 260.50 sen (about 86.83 U.S. cents) per kg
compared to last week, while SMR added 2.5 sen to 259.50 sen
(about 86.5 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber is expected to continue its bullish ways next
week due to the cheaper ringgit and demand from Europe, traders
said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Improves Investment Climate for Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Supreme Soviet today
adopted a law to attract more foreign capital and promote domestic
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all joint ventures producing motor vehicles and
spare parts are exempted from taxes in importing necessary
materials before the year of 2008. Besides, those companies are
permitted to import the tax-free goods listed by the Ukrainian
cabinet and their domestic products can be sold without paying
value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
The preconditions are that the investors must fund no less than
150 million U.S. dollars in the fixed assets and those ventures
must employ Ukrainians who account for no less than 90 percent of
the whole staff workers.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian cabinet expressed its satisfaction with the
passing of the law, saying that it will help change the bad
impression of foreigners on the Ukraine's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had issued some preferential policies to foreign-funded
enterprises since 1994. But the parliament cancelled part of those
to increase government revenue at the beginning of the year, which
has resulted in the evacuation of a few large companies of the
United States and Japan from the country.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Qualifies for Volleyball World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban men spikers
secured their berth to the World Cup by winning its sixth straight
regional championship in Puerto Rico Friday night.
</P>
<P>
With superior work at the net, Cuba defeated the United States
in straight sets 15-11, 15-11, 15-4 to take the title of the North
and Central American and Caribbean championship.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans did not concede a single set in five games in a row,
and the United States failed to pose real challenge in the finals
to the volleyball powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"We were not really a threat to beat Cuba tonight, and that's
disappointing," lamented U.S. coach Doug Beal.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had their best shot in the second game by clawing
to 11-9 before Ihosvany Hernandez, Cuba's towering outside hitter,
began to take over the game.
</P>
<P>
"We came to qualify for the World Cup, and this is an important
moment for us," said Cuban coach Juan Diaz.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said his team has pinned its hopes on the 2,000 Olympics
as it was about half rookie players.
</P>
<P>
Canada finished third behind the United States after defeating
Mexico 15-9, 15-8, 13-15, 15-9 earlier Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Cuban captain Hernandez was named the tournament Most Valuable
Player.

<TEXT>
<P>
Liu urged the IMF and the World Bank to take full account of
this problem in designing quota distribution and capital
distribution proposals respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said that China appreciates the IMF's unremitting efforts in
addressing the one-time special allocation of special drawing
rights (SDR).
</P>
<P>
"On the premise that the general allocation of SDRs according
to the long-term global needs for international liquidity is not
undermined, we support the Managing Director's latest proposal to
have the one-time special allocation of SDR 21.4 billion," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that private capital flows to developing countries
reached a record level of 245 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, which
was equivalent to 4.5 percent of developing countries' total
gross domestic product that year.
</P>
<P>
However, Official Development Aid (ODA) declined further, which
was only 41 billion U.S. dollars. Liu said that the role of ODAs
can not be replaced by private capitals. While aid effectiveness
is emphasized, the quantity of aid should not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Liu urged developed countries, from the long-term standpoint,
to take concrete measures to promptly reverse the declining trend
of ODA, and shoulder the international responsibilities, which
fall squarely on them.
</P>
<P>
For the foreseeable future, infrastructure development of
developing countries will still mainly rely on public sector
investments, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, while facilitating the private capital flows to
infrastructure sector of the developing countries, the World Bank
should continue to strengthen its direct financial support to the
public sector sponsored infrastructure projects in the developing
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu commended the World Bank and the IMF for their efforts, and
hoped that the creditors concerned, in particular the Paris Club
members, will honor their commitments in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
With regard to its bilateral debts, he said, China is going to
resolve them through bilateral channels on a case-by-case basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' world
investment report for 1997 has rated India's performance in
foreign direct investment inflows as "remarkable," local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report said that foreign direct investment in India
exceeded portfolio investment inflows for the first time in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
It added that India has become an attractive destination even
for transitional corporations from Asian countries, particularly
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, outflows from South Korea to India are
outstripping those from the United States and the United Kingdom,
traditionally India's largest trade and investment partners.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, foreign direct investment inflows into India surged by
about 34 percent to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars. In 1995, foreign
direct investment increased by 47 percent to 1.9 billion dollars
from the previous year.

</P>
<P>
This week saw profit-taking taking its toll on prices for most

Lack of fresh leads and concerns over the weakening ringgit
continued to weigh on prices, particularly on index-linked

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi health
authorities have speeded up efforts to control the spread of
dengue in the Indian capital, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities on Friday ordered removal of all
coolers installed in government offices. Coolers, in which there
are built-in water pools for air conditioning, are believed to be
major breeding points of the dengue-causing aedes mosquitoes in
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities are now planning to even ban
coolers in households if the coolers continue to show high
breeding of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, restrictions on the dress for school students were
also relaxed on Friday so that the students could come to school
wearing full-sleeved shirts and trousers.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities heaved a sigh of relief as no new
dengue cases were reported from the Indian capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of dengue patients remained at 23. However,
the virus now seems to be traveling to the south of the capital
with three confirmed cases being reported from South Delhi on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The posh colonies in South Delhi, where many coolers were
installed, were the worst hit by the dengue epidemic last year
which claimed hundreds of lives.

participants expected to exceed 6,000.
</P>
<P>
The program, with the theme "Asia and the World: Capital,
Competitiveness, and Community", will include some 40 highly
interactive sessions, in which global experts will present a wide
range of perspectives for audience discussion.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that the seminars will focus on areas including
finance and capital markets, infrastructure development,
governance and sustainable development, regional and country
opportunities, and China's partnership in world development.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa said that the annual meetings being held in Hong
Kong are a "vivid testimony" to Hong Kong's status of a world
economic and financial center, and also to Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has witnessed rapid economic growth for the past
decades and become one of the most dynamic regions in the world,
he noted, adding that Hong Kong will continue to play an active
part in world growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions after his speech, Tung expressed concerns
about the financial crisis in Southeast Asian countries, but held
that the stock market of Hong Kong will not be affected heavily by
 the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's stock market will maintain stability as it has
drawn lessons from the previous crash in the late 1980s and enjoys
a sound basis in the respects of market rules and market
operation, Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Ministers Call for More Openness from WB, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from five
Commonwealth countries, including Britain, called for greater
openness by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in their debt sustainability analyses.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a news conference at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center this morning, they, representing 53
member-countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, also called on
the World Bank to look at the position of severely indebted
countries whose debts are owed primarily to multilateral
institutions so that they have as much chance as others of early
and full debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the press conference, Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku said all members of the organization would continue
to pay attention to debt issues and provide assistance in
preparing debt sustainability analyses.
</P>
<P>
Present at the press conference were also Gordon Brown, British
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Vasant Bunwaree, Mauritian Minister
of Finance, Trevor Manuel, South African Minister of Finance,
Brian Kuei Tung, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Finance, and
Gamini Peiris, Sri Lanka's Minister of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs and Deputy Minister of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said that the finance ministers of the Commonwealth
meet annually for discussing urgent issues prior to the annual
meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The ministers arrived in Hong Kong early this week for the
WB/IMF meeting, directly from the annual meeting of the
Commonwealth Finance Ministers which was held in Mauritius on
September 16-17.
</P>
<P>
At the Mauritius meeting, the ministers discussed a wide range
of issues, including the world economic situation, IMF and World
Bank issues, multilateral debt, the political process and
management of economic change, the private capital flow issues and
cooperation between all the Commonwealth member-countries, Anyaoku
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, Gordon Brown briefed about
his new proposals on the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs)
Initiative, called the Mauritius Mandate, which seeks to
enable all HIPC countries to have embarked by 2000 on the process
of securing a sustainable exit from their debt problems.
</P>
<P>
The Mandate also aims by the millennium to have firm decisions
on the amounts and terms of debt relief for at least
three-quarters of the eligible poor countries, and will help up
to 300 million people living in the world's poorest countries and
contribute to the international target of halving by 2015 the
proportion of the world's population living in absolute poverty,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Four other finance ministers, in their turn, stressed the need
to accelerate implementation of the HIPC Initiative and strengthen
cooperation between the well-developed countries and the
less-developed ones.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves First Project Financing in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import
Bank today approved its first project financing on the African
continent for the 210 million U.S. dollars sales of equipment and
services for the Jorf Lasfar Power Project in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
During the construction phase of the project, the Ex-Im Bank
will guarantee political risk. Upon project completion, the Bank
will either replace the guarantee with a direct loan, or continue
to provide political risk protection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ABB Energy Ventures, Inc. and CMS Generation are two
sponsors of the project which, when complete, will supply over 30
percent of Morocco's electricity needs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. companies will build, own and operate two 350-megawatt
coal-fired electrical generating units for the Jorf Lasfar power
plant.
</P>
<P>
The latest transaction brings the total authorizations of the
Ex-Im Bank's 3-year-old Project Finance Division to more than five
billion dollars. Project finance authorizations are expected to
hit a record 2.6 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1997, which
ends on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is a federal government agency that backs U.S.
exports. In the past five years, the Bank has authorized a total
of 65.6 billion dollars of financing involving more than 10,000
transactions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
said here today that the anti-corruption measures taken by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be
held strictly within the ambits of their operations.
</P>
<P>
Invited to speak at the 57th ministerial meeting of the Group
24, composed of developing countries, Chinese Vice-Minister of
Finance Liu Jibin said that corruption is a global phenomenon and
both developing and developed countries need to take actions to
combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-corruption is an internal affair of a sovereign
country and the content of anti-corruption far exceeds the
operations mandates of both Bretton Woods Institutions, Liu
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that developed countries should not use development
assistance as an excuse to interfere in developing countries'
domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, when helping the developing countries, the
multilateral development institutions should strictly adhere to
their respective Articles of Agreements and mandates, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Any encroachment on non-economic activities will not only
damage the images of these institutions, but also shake the
members' confidence in them, Liu added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Prosperity to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's prosperity will
continue under the "One Country, Two Systems" concept, said Donald
Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China here today.
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast briefing, Tsang said that a few months ago, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified Hong Kong as an
"advanced economy", which was a vote of recognition of Hong Kong's
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"Now the World Bank and IMF are holding their Annual Meetings
in the Hong Kong SAR. This is a vote of confidence in the HKSAR,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, he noted, the HKSAR government has full
autonomy in formulating its own monetary and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to safeguard free flow of capital and the
Hong Kong dollar remains the only legal tender in Hong Kong as
before," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. dollar link is still being maintained and
the stronghold for maintaining the link is the combined assets of
the Exchange Fund and the Land Fund totaling 81 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that before Hong Kong's return to China, there were
skeptics who casted doubt on whether the guarantees enshrined in
the Basic Law would be honored at all. Facts have dispelled such
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
"Business is as usual here. The strong feeling of stability
and enthusiasm is palpable everywhere you go in Hong Kong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the liquidity, the transparency and sound
regulation will continue to be the underlying strength of Hong
Kong's market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the rapid economic growth in the Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong's role as China's international financial
center is expected to grow in parallel.

BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has proposed to set
up an Asian fund to restore the region's financial stability, but
the fund seemed to have a long way to go as ASEAN finance
ministers postponed a decision on it.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) said Friday at the conclusion of the first
Asia-Europe finance ministers' meeting held here that further
discussion and the participation of key economies in Asia will be
needed.
</P>
<P>
The ministers had not formalized cooperation to deal with
Southeast Asia's financial crisis as they still need the
International Monetary Fund to play a key role, Thai Finance
Minister Thanong Bidaya said.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam discussed the matter
late Thursday, but the discussions were inconclusive, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim Friday said that Thailand's fund proposal received
support, but further discussions on the matter are needed and East
Asian economies should be involved.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN finance ministers will meet again early next month in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before the ASEAN economic ministers'
meeting. The establishment of the fund is expected to be among the
topics for discussion at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Protection Effective in South China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, has made noticeable achievements
in protection of its farmland by resorting to administrative,
economic and legal measures.
</P>
<P>
The city increased its total farmland areage by approximately
880 hectares from last year to the end of June, compared to a
decrease in farmland acreage over previous years.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou had a total of 168,650 ha of arable land at the end
of 1996, a per-capita average of less than 0.025 ha, far less
the national average. So it began to take active measures to ban
non-agricultural use of land.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the city has cultivated 13,756 ha of land, 6,225 ha
of which are used for farming, to basically balance the increases
and decreases of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has charged 8.5 billion yuan for the
land-use rights for 2,531 ha of land in urban areas over the past
five years, which are mainly spent on infrastructure and land
improvement for farming.
</P>
<P>
To speed up land management according to law, the city of
Guangzhou has also worked out 16 codes, regulations and policy
documents concerning land protection, and dealt with more than 200
cases in violation of land use, saving a total area of 530 ha.

(195 million U.S. dollars), up 11 percent over the same period of
last year, according to the latest government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka enjoyed a trade balance with its imports from Britain
standing at 10 billion rupees (169 million dollars) from January
to June this year. In the corresponding period last year, it
imported 6.7 billion rupees (113 million dollars) of British
goods.
</P>
<P>
The statistics said that the increase of trade was a reflection
of continuing strong demand on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The most popular Sri Lankan goods in Britain is clothing, while
a wide range of British goods and services, most notably cereals,
power generating and telecommunications equipment, medicines and
paper products, are easy to find market in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts said this year's stronger demand in Sri
Lanka for foreign goods was a sign of better economic conditions
in the country.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Cedric Pioline
twisted his back to surrender to Johan Van Herck on Friday, giving
Belgium a 2-0 lead in the Davis Cup tennis qualifying in Ghent,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the hope looked faint for France to stay in the Davis
Cup's elite World Group.
</P>
<P>
Belgian top player Filip Dewulf strolled to a 3-0 victory over
Fabrice Santoro with his powerful forehand. Dewulf, who ranked
39th, sent an ace with the final ball to finish 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Pioline, top French player, was once seemly cruising to an easy
win as the 1997 Wimbledon finalist took the first two sets 6-4,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
As Van Herck fought back to take the third set 7-5 with the
home spectators behind him, Pioline appeared to have twisted his
back in returning serve. Although he struggled on into the fourth
set, he had to threw in the towel at 4-1 down.
</P>
<P>
Pioline was scheduled to play the doubles match Saturday before
taking on Dewulf in the reverse singles Sunday.

GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Favored Switzerland got off to
a slow start but took a 2-0 lead over South Korea at the Davis Cup
World Group qualifying tie on Friday in Locarno, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Marc Rosset, ranked 22nd in the ATP, was pushed to two
tie-breakers before trouncing world number 298 Lee Hyung Taik 6-3,
7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) in front of only 500 spectators.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, famous for his big serves, finished with 15 aces but
was clearly not playing to his usual potential.

Ivo Heuberger, who ranked 197th in the ATP rankings, solidified
Switzerland's lead with a convincing 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory over
South Korean Yoon Yong-Il.

Saturday, pitting Rosset and Lorenzo Manta against South Korea's

<HEADLINE> Four-Party Meeting on Korea Issue Ends Without Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The second round of
four-party preparatory meeting on the Korea issue ended here this
afternoon without reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, involving China, the United States, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of
Korea, was designed to make preparations for a plenary session on
peace in Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that the four delegations
conducted wide-ranging and in-depth discussions in an effort to
define an agenda for the formal talks.
</P>
<P>
They reached certain common understanding on some of the issues
discussed but were still deeply divided on the agenda issue, the
sources said, adding that the parties will continue to consult
with each other.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted a DPRK official as saying that the
parties have failed to reach agreement on the agenda of the
conference, not because of the lack of will. "The only thing we
need here is patience and time," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official told reporters after the meeting that the
participants had made "some slight progress" but clearly it was
insufficient to begin official talks of the four parties.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegations worked very hard to explore a number of
options to resolve the differences, but "regretfully" serious
attitude still lacked during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there are plans for further meetings, he said that
"the offer for peace talks is still on the table, but we have no
plans for further meetings."
</P>
<P>
"We have an established channel which is available for the use
of either side", he added.
</P>
<P>
The first round of preparatory talks was held last month, also
in New York.

ABU DHABI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- With a goal ruled offside,
Japan had to settle for a scoreless draw against home squad the
United Arab Emirates here on Friday in the second-round Asian
World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Masami Ihara swung in his clean header in the 75th minute but
teammate Norio Omura was caught offside by linesman Miniandi
Alagokofen ahead of the play.
</P>
<P>
The shocked home fans were saved from the brink of breaking
tears as Malaysian referee Mohammed Abdullah nullified the goal to
their relief.
</P>
<P>
The draw left both Japan and the Emirates with 1-1-0 records
and four points, two behind Group B leader South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Due to heat and humidity, Japan started the match cautiously,
leaving all the initiatives to the home team in the first 15
minutes. But the temperatues also affected the home squad and
Japan managed to take control of the game.
</P>
<P>
Emirates keeper Mohsin Mussabeh denied the Japanese several
chances while Japanese striker Kazuyochi Miura was closely marked
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates will meet Japan again in Tokyo on October 26.
</P>
<P>
Only the group winner qualifies automatically for France. The
runner-up enters a playoff with the Group A runner-up for a third
berth. The playoff loser than faces Australia for another place
in the 32-nation finals.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Help to Improve Red Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
has made tremendous advances over the last decade in improving the
productivity of its red soil, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has a tropical climate with high temperatures and
humidity. A high mineral content, especially of iron and aluminum,
and man's destruction of the environment gradually made the soil
acid, sticky and porous.
</P>
<P>
The level of organic matter in the soil dropped and people
eventually gave it the name "red desert" since it was such poor
land. This red soil accounts for 64.8 percent of the total
province, a higher percentage than in any other provinces south of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, large scale and scientific exploitation and
utilization of Jiangxi's red soil began in earnest. In 1986 the
first phase of the project was launched. It involved 276.48
million yuan (33.3 million US dollars), including a 30 million
dollars loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The first phase covered an area of 20,000 hectares and included
land reclamation, crop planting, agricultural infrastructure
improvement, poultry raising, processing agricultural produce,
scientific training, relocation of some farmers to mountainous
areas, etc.
</P>
<P>
The project used a family farm concept, with production carried
out by family units. A system of independent business accounting
gave the farmers sole responsibility for their losses and profits,
promoting the farmers' initiative.
</P>
<P>
The project promoted several changes in agricultural
management: from a low standard exploitation to a high standard
comprehensive management, from spontaneous utilization to planned
exploitation of suitable scale, from extensive farming to
intensive cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the red soil reclamation project was
completed in 1990, taking 50 months instead of the 72 months
specified in the loan agreement. The ecosystem was optimized. The
forest coverage rate rose from 18 percent to 33 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Press Hails Free Trade Pact With Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A Nicaraguan newspaper today
hailed the signing of a free trade pact with Mexico as a first
step to enter the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and his Nicaraguan
counterpart Arnoldo Aleman announced Thursday night that they have
finished the negotiations and signed a bilateral free trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The "La Tribuna" daily said that this agreement could lead
Nicaragua into the world economy. "But it is too soon to sing
victory," it cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The road has been bumpy since 1991 when the Violeta Chamorro
government started the process, the paper said. "Mexican tariff
barriers to Nicaraguan goods caused the suspension of negotiations
in 1994."

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Regulates Domestic Grain Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
been quite successful in regulating and controlling its domestic
grain market, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Since grain production directly affects people's livelihood,
prices must be regulated by the state when market influences are
negative.
</P>
<P>
Major measures include the adoption of the policy of protective
purchase pricing and the establishment of a grain risk fund,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to strengthen the function of the local purchasing
departments as the state's major distribution channel for
stablizing the price, the government opened its other hand, filled
with money -- thus removing the fear of further losses.
</P>
<P>
The grain risk fund, set up in 1994, plays an active role in
maintaining reasonable amounts of grain in reserve and reinforcing
the government's ability to regulate grain markets.
</P>
<P>
Up to August this year, the government-owned grain purchasing
departments had purchased 12 billion kilograms of summer grain,
5.7 billion kilograms more than what were collected over the same
period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's decentralization policy
has helped the recovery of its exports, said Cuban Foreign Trade
Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization policy allowed 281 local firms to be
engaged in international trade and other important trade
mechanisms to operate such as bonded warehouses, industrial parks
and duty-free zones, he said in an article published by the Granma
Daily today.
</P>
<P>
There are some 570 representative offices of foreign firms in
the country, which play an important role in the exporting sector,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the state firms to increase and diversify
the trade of non-traditional products, which are expected to earn
some 300 million U.S. dollars in export revenue in 1997.

<P>
ABU DHABI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait won its away game
2-0 against Qatar in Doha on Friday in the second-round Asian
World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Jassim al-Huwaidy blasted into the net with his right-footed
kick in the 18th minute before Bashar Abdullah added the second in
the 89th minute in a perfect counter attack.
</P>
<P>
The win raised the morale for the Kuwaiti as they lost the
opener 2-1 to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for a 1-0-1 slate in Group A
with three points, one behind group leaders Iran and Saudi Arabia
which drew 1-1 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of attacks kept Qatar's goalie Yunis Ahmad busy in
saves one after another, making Qatar looked disorganized for most
of the game.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's first real chance came in the dying minutes of the
first half when Nasser Kamil's shot was saved by Kuwait's
goalkeeper Khaled al-Fadli.
</P>
<P>
The group winner qualifies automatically for France with the
runner-up entering a playoff with the second-placed team from

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Denies Mass Deportation of Nicaraguans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica today rejected an
allegation that it has deported large numbers of Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua claimed last week that 1,024 Nicaraguans were
deported from Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Immigration Director Mercedes Bevacqua said that
Nicaragua's figure does not agree with reality. She said that only
30 to 40 Nicaraguans are deported in a normal day and 60 on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
She said that the 1,024 cases mentioned by the Nicaraguan
authorities include persons rejected at the border when they
intended to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican authorities say that more than 300,000
Nicaraguans are residing, most of them illegally, in this
country. They account for nearly 10 percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguans in Costa Rica normally work in the agricultural
sector, especially in the northern regions. Some of them, however,
work as domestic assistants in the urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Province Aims for Sustained Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Meilin Model Base of
Ecological Agriculture is located in south Jiangxi, a mountainous
area which was dubbed "desert in the south."
</P>
<P>
The base, however, has turned into a place of "green mountain
and clear water" after years of work with the province's Mountain,
River and Lake Project since the middle 1980s, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive development model is applied to develop, as a
whole, the agriculture, husbandry, fishery and commerce of an area
to fight soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
On the top of the mountain, trees and grasses are planted; at
the middle of the mountain, fruit trees are grown; at the foot of
the mountain, animals and poultry are raised; and in the valley,
water is dammed for fish, forming a multi-layered, integrated
agricultural system.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, products from the base are sold, earning
money for the farmers.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the total production of the base more than quadrupled
that before the Mountain, River, Lake Project was
launched. Thirty-six hectares of the 39 hectares bare mountain
have been forested to completely control soil erosion,
strengthening the ecology.
</P>
<P>
When President Jiang Zemin visited the base in September 1996,
he praised the combination of poverty-relief with comprehensive
development for improving the environment.
</P>
<P>
At least 112 large bases for comprehensive development such as
Meilin have been successfully established in line with the
Mountain, River and Lake Project in Jiangxi Province. There are
also 26 experimental model bases to address nine problems,
including comprehensive development in the mountain and lake
areas, reformation of the Red Soil hilly land, and desert land.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Players Enter Six Finals in World Acrobatics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese players
displayed inspiring fighting power, entering six finals of the
seven events at the on-going 1997 World Sports Acrobatics
Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the second round of the men's pair competition, Chinese
world champions Song Min and Li Renjie, who are tipped to win all
three titles of the event, consolidated their dominating position
by running away with a total of 19.96 points.
</P>
<P>
However, in the women's pair's tempo clashes, China's new
combination Liao Xinxin adn Lao Peiling, who topped the event's
ranking in the first round, almost lost their leading spot to
Ukrainian arch-rivals by scoring only 9.80 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese duo was expected to fight fierce battles in order
to win the top honor in the event.
</P>
<P>
The men's tumbling event was the Chinese squad's Achilles
tendon, with no hope of winning any of its three titles. However,
Chen Bo and Zhao Gang beat the tide to squeeze into the final,
giving a morale boost to their compatriots.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese players in the mixed pair, women's and
men's groups events have maintained their favorable positions to
book their berths in the finals.
</P>
<P>
About 14 of the 21 titles of the World Sports Acrobatics
Championships would be unveiled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinse delegation, which pocketed eight titles in 1996, is
likely to fight a uphill battle over the next two days.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Summit to Accelerate China's TWO Accession: Ruggiero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Renato Ruggiero said here today that he hopes the
upcoming summit between Chinese and U.S. leaders will accelerate
China's accession to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
are scheduled to meet next month in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope that President Jiang's meeting with President
Clinton will accelerate China's accession," Ruggiero told
Xinhua. "To this point China has made great strides in preparing
itself for accession to the WTO, but more work needs to be done."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero believes that the time for China's accession will be
ripe when all the parties to the negotiation can agree on the
terms.
</P>
<P>
When asked if China should join the WTO as a developing country
or as a developed country, Ruggiero said that China is "both a
developing country and a developed country."
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, a visitor to the Pudong Development Area (of
Shanghai) would come away with the impression that China is a
highly advanced developing country. The skyscrapers of Shanghai
and Beijing give the same impression," Ruggiero explained.
</P>
<P>
"But, much of China, particularly in the western provinces, is
quite poor and would certainly be classified as a developing
region."
</P>
<P>
So one has to judge the Chinese economy sector by sector and
case by case and should not take a one-sided approach, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero has visited China several times, a country he thinks
interesting with both thousands of years of history and modern
dynamism which truly makes it "a country of the future". During a
visit to China last April, he visited some relatively poor regions
besides Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The deepest impression left on me by my visits has come from
the Chinese people themselves, who are extraordinary in their
energy and hospitality," Ruggiero said. "The changes that I have
encountered on each visit are remarkable. In fact the China of
today is very different from the China of my first visit. These
differences can be seen in virtually every aspect of the Chinese
society."

KUWAIT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea outscored its
Japanese rivals 78-76 in a close final to take the 19th Asian
Men's Basketball Championship in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Friday.

From a 40-43 deficit at half break, South Korea who upset China
in the cross match Thursday, spared no efforts in each turn of the
ball and clawed back to beat the Japanese by a slim margin of two
points.

</P>

In the third-place play-off, China beat host Saudi Arabia 96-68

<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran put up a spirited fight

their winning streak intact as each scored victories in their
respective openers in the group.

TEL AVIV, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers stab
to death a Palestinian boy during a night search, and the boy's
father revenges by slaughtering an Israeli couple on their wedding
night.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people are blown into parts in a bombing attack, and
others who are driven crazy slay a laborer mistaken as the
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Bleeding. Revenge. Killing. All makes a common scene between
the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But the scenes are not real in themselves -- they are from
"Murder," a new show being played at Tel Aviv's Cameri Theater to
full houses and shed upon the spotlight of the media and even the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Playwright Hanoch Levin and director Omri Nitzan said they are
attempting to drive home a message to both the Palestinians and
Israelis: murder spawns murder, violence begets violence and the
victims on both sides are innocent -- and peace is the solution.
</P>
<P>
The play was written amid consecutive violent events a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At least 25 people have died in violence since last July,
hundreds since the Oslo peace agreement reached four years ago,
and tens of thousands, or maybe more, for generations, while
neither Palestinians nor Israelis would possibly give up their
claims of rights over the same piece of land.
</P>
<P>
The play was staged at the darkest time for the four-year-old
Middle East peace process, which is shadowed by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline policy towards the
Palestinians and radical Islamic fighters' bombing plots, with
each factor founding on the other in a vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
With hopes for peace progress evaporating one after another,
there has even been a talk on the possibility of a full-fledged
war between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"You and I and the very next war,
</P>
<P>
for us all a blessed thing.
</P>
<P>
You and I and the very next war,
</P>
<P>
perfect peace it will bring," the dying Israeli bride and groom
sing.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, former Labor Prime Minister and one of the
leading architects of the Israeli-Arab peace process, lauded the
anti-war theme. "The aim of the play is to strongly reflect the
opposition to war," he said in an interview with Xinhua after
seeing the play.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Handgun Control Law Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today said a study by the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence confirms "what we've known all along" -- the Brady gun
law "is helping to keep guns out of the hands of criminals."
</P>
<P>
The anti-gun law is named after former press secretary James
Brady, who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan. It was passed in 1993 after bitter
congressional battles.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said that while the Supreme
Court ruled against background checks to implement the Brady law,
many states are conducting the checks voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven states in the country have their own Brady laws.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the president said the study shows the Brady law
has worked to help disrupt illegal gun trafficking patterns,
making it more difficult for gun traffickers to do business.

situation. She criticized the politicians for just talking instead
of taking actions.

"We don't know what is the answer, we cannot predict the
future," she said, adding that she and her colleagues did not
hate the Arabs despite the recent suicide bombings in Jerusalem
that killed dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
The play, performed by a group of talented Jewish and Arab
actors, is just one of the peace activities witnessed in the
country recently. Over 10,000 Israeli peace activists gathered
here five days ago to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the
signing of Oslo accords and demand the government to keep the
peace process going ahead.

Levin and Nitzan have been awarded "Theater Man of the Year" by
the largest-circulated Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot for the

<HEADLINE> US Congress Gives Clinton Power to Kill B-2 Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House-Senate
negotiators on the purchase of more B-2 bombers today agreed to
let President Bill Clinton, who opposes the purchase, make the
decision.
</P>
<P>
In completing work on a 247.5 billion U.S. dollars defense
bill, lawmakers also voted to cut off money for the Bosnia
peacekeeping mission by next June unless Clinton comes to Congress
with reasons why the troop deployment should be extended.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said repeatedly that the Air Force has higher
priorities than the B-2 and can get by with the 21 aircraft
already in service or on order.
</P>
<P>
The legislation completed by members of House and Senate
defense appropriations subcommittees still must win full committee
and floor approval before going to the president.
</P>
<P>
But such major compromises are seldom changed in the final
steps toward passage of a bill.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the House voted narrowly to add 331 million
U.S. dollars that could be used to begin buying as many as nine
more B-2 bombers in the coming years. One B-2 is roughly two
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had sought 174 million U.S. dollars to continue
modernization and upgrades on the existing B-2 fleet, which cost a
total of 44 billion U.S. dollars to develop and build.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the defense bill would provide a total of
331 million U.S. dollars and it would be up to Clinton to decide
whether to use the money for new aircraft or for modernization of
the existing fleet.
