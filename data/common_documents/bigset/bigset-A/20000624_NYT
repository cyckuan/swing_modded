HARRY USHER, 61, TOP AIDE FOR THE PROFITABLE 1984 OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Usher, who as the right-hand man to Peter Ueberroth helped
to make the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games by far the most
successful financially, died Thursday in Secaucus, N.J. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he apparently suffered a heart attack at the
AmeriSuites in Secaucus, where he was staying during a business
trip as a corporate consultant.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Meadowlands Hospital said he was pronounced
dead at the hospital's emergency room. He underwent open-heart
surgery in 1975 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   From 1964 to 1979, Usher was a lawyer specializing in
entertainment law in Los Angeles and in Beverly Hills. When
Ueberroth became head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing
Committee, he chose Usher, who had done legal work for him, as
second in command.
</P>
<P>
   That was a troubled time for the Olympics. In 1972 at the Munich
Games, Arab terrorists murdered Israeli athletes. In 1976 the
Montreal Games ended with a $1 billion deficit. In 1980 the United
States and other nations boycotted the Moscow Games.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city officials, fearing a huge deficit, refused to
guarantee the financial stability of the 1984 Games. Ueberroth and
Usher recruited the U.S. Olympic Committee as co-guarantor of the
first privately financed Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a national and international level there was a feeling that
this could be the last hurrah of the Olympics,'' Usher once
recalled. ``On a local level there was continuous doubting and
debate whether the Games could be sustained without public money.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of losing money, as the Olympics traditionally had,
these Olympics produced a profit of more than $225 million. The
money was divided among the U.S. Olympic Committee, amateur sports
in Southern California and America's individual sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   Anita de Frantz of Los Angeles, a vice president of the
International Olympic Committee, described Usher's role as an
``extraordinary contribution to the Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher was a hands-on leader. No expense of $1,000 or more could
be paid without his approval, and for a time he had to approve
every outgoing letter. Once, he got on an elevator at the
committee's offices and saw stacked boxes of computers. If they
could be left there, he reasoned, the committee had too many
computers. So he issued an order: no more computer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC awarded him the Silver Olympic Order. He was also
honored by the governments of France and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Lester Usher was born March 6, 1939, in Jersey City. In
1961 he received a bachelor's degree from Brown University, where
he was Phi Beta Kappa. In 1964 he received a law degree from
Stanford, where he was editor of the law review.
</P>
<P>
   After the Olympics, he became the second and last commissioner
of the United States Football League, a short-lived rival to the
established NFL. The new league was so short of money that one
team, the Los Angeles Express, put its 28 cheerleaders on
indefinite leave to save $980 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Usher explained his commissioner's job by saying, ``I am not
here to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic, but I'm here to
take this ship forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after his league had won a $1.32 billion suit against
the NFL but was awarded only $1 (trebled to $3 under antitrust
laws), it died.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1990, he was married to the former Jo Misselhorn,
now the alumni director of Kenyon College in Ohio. In 1991 he
married the former Jane Ellison, the dean of the Annenberg School
of Communications at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; four children from his first
marriage, Lindsay Clark, Timothy Usher and Jennifer Usher, all of
San Francisco, and Katie Usher of Seattle; and two sons by his
second marriage, Samuel and Jackson Usher of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When Ueberroth learned of Usher's death, he said: ``He had
boundless energy. He was a comrade and a partner of mine in a
historic endeavor of the city of Los Angeles. He will be a sorely
missed pal.''

L.A. CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO GIVE DEMOCRATS $4 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with arguments they might embarrass the city
otherwise, the Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to give $4
million to help cover a shortfall facing organizers of the
Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   In its 8-5 vote, the council also decided to make Mayor Richard
Riordan and developer Ed Roski Jr. pay as well by requiring the
Democratic National Convention Committee to use all the $1 million
letters of credit each man had committed for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and Roski were briefed by convention officials and
agreed to the terms, even though the letters of credit originally
were designed to cover any cash shortage the organizers faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me, if this city is being asked to come up with
some money, we ought to make sure they use up all they have,'' said
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who made the proposal along with
several other conditions before she agreed to vote for the
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial inclination when I heard about this was to vote
against it. All my staff and all my political advisers wanted me to
vote against it. I was asked what I wanted to vote for it, and
these are my conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other major conditions she demanded were to make
Pershing Square, across from the Regal Biltmore Hotel, the official
protest site for the convention and also to create a special ad hoc
committee to review police security plans.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Maurice Moore said the Los Angeles Police
Department opposed both proposals, but the council approved them to
win Goldberg's support. The issue is expected to be raised again
next Wednesday when Police Chief Bernard C. Parks briefs the
council on security planning.
</P>
<P>
   The vote represented a major victory for convention planners,
who are heading into the final six weeks leading up to the event,
to be held Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to have an expanded partnership with the city
and are glad we will be able to go ahead with all our work,'' said
Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the Host 2000 Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The money is needed by July 1, she said, and will go primarily
for work at Staples Center, where the convention will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the spending were council members Laura Chick,
Mike Feuer, Cindy Miscikowski, Joel Wachs and Rudy Svorinich. Those
voting in favor were Bernson, Padilla, Goldberg, Ruth Galanter,
Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Nick Pacheco and Mark Ridley-Thomas.
John Ferraro and Rita Walters were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, a candidate for mayor next year, has led the opposition
to the $4 million payment, saying it's an example of why the public
has such distrust of government and secession movements are
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ```People are looking to us to spend their money wisely, on
services they need, and not to bail out some politically powerful
people,'' Wachs said. ``People are looking at what we are doing and
will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four opponents on the council argued that convention
officials should be required to live up to the original deal: that
it would completely finance the campaign through private funds,
aside from $7 million in in-kind services the city is providing for
security and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost like a bait-and-switch,'' Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said it will set a precedent regarding the city's
credibility if it is willing to agree to changing the terms of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, leading the effort to allocate the funds, blasted
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all are a bunch of turkeys,'' Holden shouted. ``This is
such hypocrisy. We give thousands of dollars every year to the
Academy Awards and other events. This is an important event for the
city and we should do all we can to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez also defended the spending as an investment that will
see a $135 million return due to the influx of some 35,000 visitors
including delegates, media representatives and others.
</P>
<P>
   The action prompted some mixed emotions among downtown business
people.
</P>
<P>
   While supporting the spending, they opposed the designation of
Pershing Square as the official protest site.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schatz of the Central City Association said the park,
located on a square block in the heart of the Central Business
District, is directly across from where delegates and national
officials will be staying and will present other security problems
since the jewelry district is just to the east of it.
</P>
<P>
   Several others from the Central Business District also raised
concerns about traffic problems that would be created both on the
street level and with the Metro Rail system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they argued that the site that had been designated
is on a large parking lot adjacent to Staples Center, where stage,
microphone and bathroom facilities will be provided.

DAVIES FEELS COZY WITH TWO-SHOT LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Shortly after arriving at DuPont Country Club
this week, Laura Davies felt good about her chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in the locker room, and I hear all the whining
about it's long and it's tough, I just love it,'' Davies said.
``They get a tough course, it's a major championship, and there's a
lot of whining that goes on. They like the shorter, easier courses.
I like the longer, tougher courses.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the second round Friday, Davies also likes her chances
to win another McDonald's LPGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ending her day with three consecutive birdies and shooting a
5-under 66, Davies was 6-under (136) for the tournament. She held a
two-stroke lead over Wendy Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who shot a 69, was 4- under for the tournament, while Jan
Stephenson, who also shot 69, was tied for third place at 3-under
with Stefania Croce, who shot 67. Karrie Webb, trying to win her
third consecutive major, was even par (142), six strokes behind
Davies after a second-round 70.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Davies has won three times at
DuPont _ in 1993, before the event was a major, and at major
championships in 1994 and 1996. Driving the ball is her strength,
and the layout at DuPont, which gives her an opportunity to cut
loose off the tee, plays into her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the courses we play all year, this is the only one that
genuinely makes it a real advantage to the long hitters,'' Davies
said. ``That's why I love it so much, because I can get out there
and have some fun with the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fun is rarely a problem for Davies, who at age 36 remains
one of the tour's most jovial players. She has won four majors and
18 LPGA tournaments, yet she leaves her game at the course, and
admits she does not like to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always said, `If I can't see the range, I won't go to
the range,''' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's domination of the LPGA Tour for the last 18 months has
forced Davies to reassess her ways. Davies did not win an LPGA Tour
event last year, and now she spends time at the range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been dedicated to anything, but I'm certainly
practicing a bit more,'' Davies said. ``If I want to be better, and
I want to win on a consistent basis, I've got to practice that
little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off Friday. Davies made six birdies and only one bogey,
and she nearly made a hole in one at the par-3 No. 17, hitting an
8-iron shot from 156 yards that stopped just inches from the cup
for an easy tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear the crowd getting louder and louder, and I really
thought it was going in,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   The three players closest to Davies are facing a difficult
challenge, particularly on this course and in a major championship.
Ward has never won a major. Croce, a 30-year-old player from Italy,
has never won a tournament. And Stephenson, who is 48, has not won
a tournament since 1987, when she was one of the tour's best
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course suits Laura to a tee,'' said Stephenson, who has
rebuilt her career and her swing after injuring her hand in 1990.
``If I hit in the rough, I have to chip out. Laura can power her
way through.''
</P>
<P>
   So Davies entered the weekend feeling confident about her game,
and comfortable in her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I come expecting to win,'' Davies said. ``But I
fancy my chances every time we come here.''

RENOWNED FRENCH JOURNALIST MICHEL DROIT, 77, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michel Droit, a man of letters and a journalist who was a member
of the Academie Francaise, died on Thursday in La
Celle-Saint-Cloud, a suburb of Paris. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Droit's writing, which included more than 20 novels and other
books during half a century, was rich as well as prolific.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known literary works included his 1964 novel, ``Le
Retour'' (``The Return''), which won a Grand Prix of the Academie
Francaise. The novel recounts the difficult return to France by
former French settlers in Algeria who had been ejected after
Algeria gained its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Another well-known work is ``L'Homme du Destin: Charles de
Gaulle'' (``Man of Destiny: Charles de Gaulle''), a five-volume
biography published in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But Droit was better known among his compatriots for having been
the sole interviewer of de Gaulle in the three television
interviews that the general granted during his lifetime. They were
held while he was president of France, in 1965, 1968 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Droit also did other work in television, radio and print
journalism, and his political views were outspokenly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Droit was elected to the Academie Francaise, whose 40
members are often called ``the immortals.''
</P>
<P>
   Droit, whose father was an artist, was born in Vincennes,
outside Paris. He studied at the prestigious Ecole Libre des
Sciences Politiques, but he dropped out to join the French
Resistance against the German occupation during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be a radio correspondent covering French army
units in that war, and he was on hand for de Gaulle's arrival at
the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Droit was editor in chief at the French state
television organization and served as editor in chief of the
literary weekly Figaro Litteraire for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He also held posts at the conservative newspaper Le Figaro for
20 years. When he was elected to the Academie Francaise, Le Figaro
declared that it took courage ``for him to openly call himself
reactionary, a partisan of order and of virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   He was made an officer of the Legion of Honor and received other
French military and civilian honors.
</P>
<P>
   He married Janine Bazin in 1947, and they had a daughter,
Corinne, and a son, Eric.

ESCAPEE'S RELATIVES FORCED
 TO `DRESS UP`
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY CRAIG HARRIS 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Two female relatives of a jail escapee were forced
to put on wigs, fake noses, glasses and extra makeup in a Maricopa
County Sher iff's Office investigation into how convicted murderer
Tasha Wolf got out.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But the court-ordered dress-up ses sion earlier this week for
Betsy Brewer, Wolf's mother, and Wolf's sister failed to produce
damaging evidence, said Richard Gierloff, the family's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Gierloff, who declined to identify the sister, said the session
``pushed the limits'' of routine investigative meth ods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brewer women were eliminated as suspects,'' Gierloff said.
``It was obvious they (investigators) didn't get what they were
hoping to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Wolf was sen tenced to life in prison for
the 1995 shooting deaths of two drug dealers. She lured them to an
ambush, where they were tied up and injected with heroin before she
and accomplices killed them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Wolf and cellmate Darlene August dressed as men and
escaped from the Estrella Jail for less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's father, Paul Brewer, was arrested in May and was
suspected of providing wigs, clothing, money and a car to Wolf and
August.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who was acting as Wolf's private investigator until
the escape, has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dave Trombi wouldn't confirm or deny the dress-up session,
but said Paul Brewer still is an ''investigative lead'' in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he (Gierloff) wants to divulge that information to you or
be stupid to do that, he can,'' Trombi said. ''It is still an open
and ongoing investi gation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gierloff declined to elaborate on why the women were asked to
put on the disguises.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you why they put on the wigs. It was a legitimate
reason that I'm not taking issue with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it does push the limits of a discovery device.''

Astros fire coaches McCraw, Ruhle; 
Spilman, Hooton named successors
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When a team is struggling, and firing the manager is
not a desirable alternative from a financial or public-relations
standpoint, the coaching staff is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Astros hitting coach Tom McCraw and pitching coach Vern Ruhle
found that out firsthand Friday when they were relieved of their
duties prior to the opener of a three-game series against the San
Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, McCraw and Ruhle are casualties _
some might say scapegoats _ of a disappointing season that has seen
the Astros go from three-time defending National League Central
champions to the team with the worst record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a team falls dramatically short of its expectations,
it's time to examine what you can do to get back on track,''
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``(Manager) Larry (Dierker)
and I talked about this, and we felt that with the new direction
we're taking, we might benefit from a fresh approach. It's too bad
that Vern and Mac are casualties in this, but in no way is this an
insinuation that they are the reason we are where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Spilman replaced McCraw, and Burt Hooton takes over for
Ruhle. Spilman has been the Astros' minor-league field coordinator
for the past 2{ years, and Hooton was the pitching coach at Class
AA Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vern and Mac did everything they could do to make us pitch and
hit better,'' said Dierker, who has two more years worth $1.5
million remaining on his contract. ``As a player, after being with
coaches for a while, you feel like you know everything they know
because they've told you everything they know. Sometimes (players)
tend to tune you out. They do that to me sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hunsicker said Dierker's job was never in jeopardy
during the evaluation of the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, the manager's status has not and will not
be an issue this year,'' Hunsicker said. ``This is an isolated
incident. I don't anticipate any other (staff) changes.''
</P>
<P>
   If other moves are forthcoming, they likely will involve
players. Although the Astros don't figure to be major dealers at
the trading deadline, they could make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky they don't fire players,'' said righthander Jose
Lima, who fell to 1-11 with Friday's 10-3 loss to the Giants. ``If
they did, everyone in this room would be fired. I'd probably be the
first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad to see this happen, because Vern and Mac are both
great guys. Vern has been like a father to me, and Mac is one of
the greatest guys I've ever been around. I'm going to remember
those guys for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw and Ruhle had sterling track records during their tenures
with the Astros, which began when Dierker was hired prior to the
1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   During McCraw's tenure, the Astros set a franchise record for
runs in back-to-back years, scoring 777 in 1997 and 874 in 1998,
when they were second in the league in hitting. And under his
tutelage, young hitters such as Carl Everett and Richard Hidalgo
came into their own; Daryle Ward, Lance Berkman, Mitch Meluskey,
Julio Lugo and Glen Barker began to show signs of being legitimate
big-league batters.
</P>
<P>
   One day before his firing, McCraw said he was looking forward to
teaching the next generation of Astros. He won't get that
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk away from this experience feeling like I did the
best I could,'' McCraw said. ``That's all you can do; do your best,
and let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio
issued what were believed to be the first ``no comments'' of their
careers _ quite a statement in its own right. When the two players
who have been the team spokesmen on so many other issues declined
to address this one, it's obvious how they felt about the moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things were going, I knew something was going to
happen,'' McCraw said. ``You have to throw something out to the
public when things are going as poorly as they were going for us,
and the hitting and pitching coaches are the most visible
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' pitching staff ranked among the top three in the NL
during Ruhle's first three years on the job, and he helped Lima,
Darryl Kile, Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton and Billy Wagner put
together career years.
</P>
<P>
   But entering Friday's game, the Astros ranked 14th in pitching
and 13th in hitting in the National League, prompting management to
pull out the pink slips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' Wagner said. ``I really do. Vern and Mac are
great people, and they had a big impact on the success we've had
around here for the past three years. It's too bad that when the ax
falls, it has to take some good people with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ruhle, who pitched for the Astros during the 1980s:
``Everyone is kind of surprised by it, including me. But I
understand the business side of it, and I thank the Astros for the
opportunity. I'll always consider myself a special part of the
Astros family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of success during my time here, and I feel like I
helped a lot of guys get better. Things are starting to come
around, but they were a little slow in coming around, maybe too
slow. Perhaps that's why I find myself in the situation I'm in
today.''

BOTTENFIELD TO RETURN, SAYS SHOULDER OK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Bottenfield returns to the starting
rotation tonight after missing two starts because of tendinitis in
his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield came to the Anaheim Angels from the St. Louis
Cardinals in the trade for Jim Edmonds after winning 18 games in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is 4-5 with a 5.21 ERA, but some of his problems can be
linked to his sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield first felt something was wrong in the shoulder in
mid-May, but he tried to pitch through it. His results showed there
was something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In his first eight starts this season, Bottenfield allowed three
earned runs or fewer seven times. But in his past five starts, he
allowed fewer than three earned runs only once.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shoulder affected his control, Bottenfield said he
had great command of his pitches during a simulated game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to control the ball for 65 pitches, which I've not
been able to do for quite some time,'' he said. ``I expect to go
out there (tonight) and throw anywhere from 100 to 115 pitches. I
don't expect to feel anything in my shoulder, just be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said the two weeks off were good for him in that he
worked hard on his conditioning, building up leg strength and
losing some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some definite goals in mind for the two weeks,'' he
said. ``It was something I needed to do to keep me busy and not
just sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson surgery?: Pitcher Jason Dickson is expected to make a
decision in the next day or two on whether or not to have
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson had surgery to repair a torn labrum in March of 1999 and
missed the entire 1999 season. He came back and made the starting
rotation out of spring training, but landed on the DL with a
strained hip.
</P>
<P>
   But after coming back from the strained hip, he began to feel
pain in his shoulder, possibly a result of favoring the hip. He
landed on the DL a second time.
</P>
<P>
   While on a rehab assignment, the shoulder pain became too much
to ignore, and Dickson finally told trainers.
</P>
<P>
   If Dickson decides to try to rehab the shoulder without surgery,
there are no guarantees he'll regain his health. If he decides to
have the surgery, he'll likely miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something mechanical, with the way I throw,''
Dickson said of his recurring shoulder troubles. ``Maybe my labrum
is weak. Maybe it was reinjured during rehab. You really don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocker out: Shortstop Kevin Stocker was a late scratch Friday
night because of a sore left knee. Benji Gil started in Stocker's
place.

A FILLY CARRIES THE STORY OF A HOLOCAUST VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ark., Ind., Fla., Calif., Poland)   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a Vietnam veteran from Arkansas who was moved by the
story of a little-known heroine and victim of the Holocaust. So
Fletcher Clement decided that a racehorse should bear the name of
Roza Robota, a young Polish woman who was instrumental in a brief
uprising at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   His idea, though unorthodox, was that he could help tell her
story, and in the simplest of ways, he has. The tale of the young
woman who bravely lost her life is retold each time the racehorse
Roza Robata runs, even if its heard only within racing circles.
</P>
<P>
   It will be told again Saturday at Belmont Park where Roza Robata
the racehorse _ though partly misspelled because of an
administrative error _ will make her 31st career start among a
field of six in the prestigious Grade I, $250,000 Hempstead
Handicap. The 5-year-old mare has won eight races, earned $583,430
in purses and, according to those who have been associated with
her, has displayed a remarkable energy and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very hesitant and a little worried that I would offend
Jewish people by combining this horrific episode with horse
racing,'' said Clement, 57, a commercial real estate broker who
made the decision to name the horse after Robota. ``But I checked
around with some friends of mine who are Jewish, told them the
story and finally decided that it would be nice to honor this
courageous lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Berenbaum, former director of the Research Institute at
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, and currently a
distinguished visiting professor of Holocaust Studies at Richard
Stockton College in California, said Roza Robota is little known
outside scholarly circles. He acknowledged that some may be
offended by a horse carrying the name of a tragic figure from one
of the most horrific periods of world history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be those who are offended,'' he said. ``I'm not.
It's an opportunity to use the name of a horse to tell a story that
is not well known about a person who should be remembered in the
annals of heroism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Bloomfield, director of the Holocaust Museum, said: ``It's
complicated. If the motive is to memorialize this young woman and
spread awareness about the Jewish resistance, which is not well
known among the public, it is very admirable. However, there may be
some survivors who might feel that connecting the Holocaust to a
racehorse, which represents how people spend leisure time, would be
a trivialization of an enormous tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this unusual story is Clement, who for almost
30 years, has bought and raced horses. For even longer, he has
studied what has gone on in the world. He was a history major at
the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. He developed an interest in
the Holocaust after serving as a communications specialist in the
Army Special Forces from 1965-66 in Bu Dop near the Cambodia
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe as a veteran it gave me an affinity for people in
untenable positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s he came across a photograph of Roza Robota and
the story of her role in the Oct. 7, 1944, uprising by the Jewish
Sonderkommando of Auschwitz-Birkenau _ the all-male detail forced
to work in the death camps. For weeks leading up to the uprising,
Robota, along with three young other women, smuggled gunpowder in
small amounts out of a munitions plant they were assigned to as
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising ended badly, although one crematorium was
destroyed. Several hundred prisoners escaped, all of whom were
caught and killed by German forces the same day, Bloomfield said.
Later that day, Bloomfield said, an additional 200 prisoners were
executed by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a significant act of resistance,'' Berenbaum said. ``It
was not a decision to live but a decision on how to die. It gave
the victims a personal death in the impersonal process of
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, on Oct. 10, Robota was arrested with the other
women. She was beaten and tortured, and then on Jan. 6, 1945,
Robota, Regina Safirsztain, Ella Gartner, and Esther Wajcblum were
hanged _ just 12 days before the Germans abandoned the camp as
their war effort began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only in the deed was she brave, but so were her last
words,'' Berenbaum said. ``She said, `Be strong, have courage,' as
the trap doors opened.''
</P>
<P>
   The story haunted Clement, especially after he visited Auschwitz
in the mid-1990s. In April 1997, he attended the Ocala Breeders
sale in Florida in the hopes of adding to his small stable. A
self-described ``bottom fisher,'' Clement is in the majority of
horse buyers who enter the bidding process long after the
wealthiest owners, with their private jets and deep pockets, have
abandoned the sales ring.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to land a colt he fancied when the bidding reached
a too- rich $20,000, Clement became captivated by a spirited,
dark-brown 2-year-old filly. She was already named Firey May Day,
but there was something about the way she held her head up. He
bought her for $12,000 and thought hard about changing her name to
Roza Robota. He didn't take the decision lightly.
</P>
<P>
   The Jockey Club, which registers the names of thoroughbreds,
allows a name change if a horse has not yet raced, as was the case
with Roza Robota. What's in an actual name is reviewed by the
organization, which approved 40,853 names in 1999 alone. The rules
for naming a horse range from a maximum of 18 characters including
punctuation, for example, to outlawing notorious names, and
requiring written permission from famous living people.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to find horses with names that are linked to
real people or real events. Among the recent Triple Crown
competitors, there was Hugh Hefner, named for the Playboy Magazine
founder, and Impeachment, whose name was derived from the colt's
sire, Deputy Minister and his dam, Misconduct, although the horse's
owner, Cot Campbell, acknowledged the name had special resonance
due to the proceeding the U.S. Congress took against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, a horse named Irgun was a strong contender for
the Kentucky Derby until being sidelined with a sore foot. Irgun
was named after the Jewish underground group that fought the
British and the Arabs a half century ago in what is now Israel. And
26 years ago, a horse named Chris Evert _ after the tennis star _
was the best 3-year-old filly in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners treat the naming of horses as a game and try to get
racy or nonsensical names with personal significance past the
organization. Mike Pegram, owner of 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real
Quiet, named his champion filly Silverbulletday after the brand of
beer he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 71 percent of the people get their first preference with
names,'' said Buddy Bishop, The Jockey Club registrar. ``We are
very careful. But you always can get a name nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that no one at The Jockey Club recognized the name
Roza Robota. Clement says he believes he turned the name in with
the correct spelling and it came back ``Robata.'' If not, he will
accept blame for the mistake. While campaigning the horse in her
campaigns as a 2- and 3-year-old, Clement told the story as often
as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Roza Robata did well for Clement, earning more than $100,000 and
winning the Grade 3 Honeybee Stakes in Arkansas. After that race,
Clement put her up for auction as a brood mare at Keeneland in
Lexington, Ky. Roza Robata was bought for $150,000 by Ron McKee who
thought she had more races left before being relegated to breeding.
Last spring, after she won the Fairway Fun Stales at Turfway Park,
McKee heard from a friend and sometime partner named Jimmy Iselin.
It was Iselin who was aware of the life of the real Roza Robota. He
told McKee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fascinating,'' said McKee, an Indianapolis businessman.
``Everyone I tell is intrigued.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clement and McKee say that Roza Robata is the best race
horse they have ever owned. They also feel compelled to pass on the
tale of the woman the mare is named for. Even though it's a horse,
involved in a sport in which sentiment often takes a back seat to
the cold calculations of betting, Clement says he believes the
story of a brave young woman is being passed on, and that her
memory is being honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a footnote in the Holocaust annals,'' Clement said.
``She shouldn't be.''

L.A. CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO GIVE DEMOCRATS $4 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with arguments they might embarrass the city
otherwise, the Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to give $4
million to help cover a shortfall facing organizers of the
Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   In its 8-5 vote, the council also decided to make Mayor Richard
Riordan and developer Ed Roski Jr. pay as well by requiring the
Democratic National Convention Committee to use all the $1 million
letters of credit each man had committed for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and Roski were briefed by convention officials and
agreed to the terms, even though the letters of credit originally
were designed to cover any cash shortage the organizers faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me, if this city is being asked to come up with
some money, we ought to make sure they use up all they have,'' said
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who made the proposal along with
several other conditions before she agreed to vote for the
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial inclination when I heard about this was to vote
against it. All my staff and all my political advisers wanted me to
vote against it. I was asked what I wanted to vote for it, and
these are my conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other major conditions she demanded were to make
Pershing Square, across from the Regal Biltmore Hotel, the official
protest site for the convention and also to create a special ad hoc
committee to review police security plans.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Maurice Moore said the Los Angeles Police
Department opposed both proposals, but the council approved them to
win Goldberg's support. The issue is expected to be raised again
next Wednesday when Police Chief Bernard C. Parks briefs the
council on security planning.
</P>
<P>
   The vote represented a major victory for convention planners,
who are heading into the final six weeks leading up to the event,
to be held Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to have an expanded partnership with the city
and are glad we will be able to go ahead with all our work,'' said
Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the Host 2000 Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The money is needed by July 1, she said, and will go primarily
for work at Staples Center, where the convention will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the spending were council members Laura Chick,
Mike Feuer, Cindy Miscikowski, Joel Wachs and Rudy Svorinich. Those
voting in favor were Bernson, Padilla, Goldberg, Ruth Galanter,
Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Nick Pacheco and Mark Ridley-Thomas.
John Ferraro and Rita Walters were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, a candidate for mayor next year, has led the opposition
to the $4 million payment, saying it's an example of why the public
has such distrust of government and secession movements are
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ```People are looking to us to spend their money wisely, on
services they need, and not to bail out some politically powerful
people,'' Wachs said. ``People are looking at what we are doing and
will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four opponents on the council argued that convention
officials should be required to live up to the original deal: that
it would completely finance the campaign through private funds,
aside from $7 million in in-kind services the city is providing for
security and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost like a bait-and-switch,'' Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said it will set a precedent regarding the city's
credibility if it is willing to agree to changing the terms of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, leading the effort to allocate the funds, blasted
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all are a bunch of turkeys,'' Holden shouted. ``This is
such hypocrisy. We give thousands of dollars every year to the
Academy Awards and other events. This is an important event for the
city and we should do all we can to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez also defended the spending as an investment that will
see a $135 million return due to the influx of some 35,000 visitors
including delegates, media representatives and others.
</P>
<P>
   The action prompted some mixed emotions among downtown business
people.
</P>
<P>
   While supporting the spending, they opposed the designation of
Pershing Square as the official protest site.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schatz of the Central City Association said the park,
located on a square block in the heart of the Central Business
District, is directly across from where delegates and national
officials will be staying and will present other security problems
since the jewelry district is just to the east of it.
</P>
<P>
   Several others from the Central Business District also raised
concerns about traffic problems that would be created both on the
street level and with the Metro Rail system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they argued that the site that had been designated
is on a large parking lot adjacent to Staples Center, where stage,
microphone and bathroom facilities will be provided.

INSURANCE LAWYER GETS IMMUNITY FOR HEARINGS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The woman who has emerged as the key whistle blower
in the investigation of Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
will be given immunity when she testifies Monday before an Assembly
committee, sources told The Chronicle Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Ossias, a San Francisco lawyer in the Department of
Insurance, has been subpoenaed to testify before the Assembly
Insurance Committee. She has been identified as the person who gave
confidential documents to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly investigators expect Monday's hearing to be explosive,
with new information that will call into question the truthfulness
of statements by Quackenbush and his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush will be given an opportunity to respond on Thursday,
and one member of the committee says the evidence made public to
date gives the commissioner a lot to respond to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very important for Mr. Quackenbush to categorically
refute the evidence now in possession of the committee involving
how the foundations were established and the tactics used to raise
money,'' said Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Northridge, who
represents the area hardest hit by the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Insurance Committee held three days of intensive
hearings earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are investigating allegations that Quackenbush
coerced insurance companies into paying $12 million to two
nonprofit foundations he created. The payments allegedly allowed
the insurers to avoid paying as much as $3.7 billion in fines for
improperly handling policyholder claims after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the payments to the foundations were used to promote
Quackenbush's own political agenda and that none of the money went
to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ossias' lawyer disputed statements by the Department of
Insurance that she was coerced by the Legislature into handing over
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suggestions that were made that she was used by the Assembly
for political purposes are simply groundless,'' said Doran
Weinberg. ``I think it will be clear on Monday that she acted
entirely on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O. ``Spike'' Helmick
confirmed Friday that Ossias received some immunity during the
administrative investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As a state employee, Ossias must answer questions about her job
that are posed during a state investigation. Under the law, the
information she provides as part of that investigation cannot be
used against her in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   The department could choose administrative action, including
dismissal, Helmick said. The Assembly's immunity will protect her
from any prosecution, however.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said the law
does allow the Legislature to confer immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conferring of immunity by the Legislature could present
legal hurdles for prosecution of someone under the penal code,''
said Sandy Michioku, a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The documents Ossias provided to the committee, called market
conduct exams, are sensitive audits detailing insurers' alleged
claims-handling violations following the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The exams have assumed a significant role in the deepening
political scandal surrounding Quackenbush. They deal with the same
insurance companies that were allegedly convinced to contribute to
the foundations, allegedly to avoid fines.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say state regulators found that some insurance
companies had tendencies to lowball policyholder claims and delay
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias was in charge of reviewing market conduct exams and
making recommendations for fines.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's top aides have testified that there were never any
fine recommendations and that the settlements were worked out
because the charges in the exams would not stand up in court.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, the Assembly Rules Committee issued more
subpoenas for Monday's hearing late Thursday after a floor session
called to pass a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the new list are three of Quackenbush's top aides,
all of whom have appeared before, but have not given testimony
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to get further information,'' said Rich Zeiger,
a spokesman for the committee. ``The testimony of some of the new
witnesses may bear on the testimony they gave earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   All witnesses appearing before the committee on Monday have been
subpoenaed and will testify under oath.

GOV. DAVIS THREATENS VETO IF BUDGET LACKS TAX CUTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis renewed his threat Friday to veto
a $3.6 billion cut in vehicle license fees unless lawmakers send
him nearly $100 million in tax cuts sought by businesses.
<P>
   The Assembly pledged to do what Davis wants but the leader of
the state Senate said he wasn't inclined to approve the tax cuts in
the form Davis wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has not been in contact with me on this issue,''
said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ``But
vetoing the license fee thing would only make Republicans upset. I
don't think Democrats would be too worked up about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a week-long stalemate, lawmakers sent Davis a $95 billion
spending plan Thursday for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sharp increases in public school spending, the budget
includes a cut of 32.5 percent in the annual fees California's 27
million owners of motorcycles, trailers, trucks and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Counting previous cuts in license fees of 35 percent, vehicle
owners _ starting next year _ will pay 67.5 percent less in fees
than they did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was that tax cut which crumbled Assembly GOP opposition to
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said Friday that tax cut is in jeopardy unless
lawmakers approve tax breaks he wants in the form Davis initially
proposed them.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a threat some Democrats find too frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats would be happier if the license fee reduction
didn't drain $3.5 billion from state coffers because that would
allow for more spending on social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' threat is ''like the scene in `Blazing Saddles' where the
sheriff puts a gun to his (own) head,'' said one Democratic
lawmaker who asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor claims the tax cuts he wants benefit the
high tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday those businesses should be rewarded because their
success helped fuel the state's $12.3 billion cash windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in building on our strengths,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton takes a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give people business tax cuts to spur economic activity in
down times. The economy is so good now _ we're making so many
millionaires and billionaires _ I don't know how much more
encouragement they need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, only a few of the tax cuts Davis wants help high tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One research and development credit primarily helps aerospace.
Another tax break is aimed at Central Valley manufacturers. Another
is a $100 million one-time credit to persons who donate land to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another gives a $500 credit to persons who care for seniors at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the tax cuts do help high tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbyists argue the tax breaks are needed to keep
California competitive with other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you have development in Austin? Why do you have Silicon
Alley outside Boston? Why do you have the Research Triangle in
North Carolina? Because those states are providing economic
incentives and a better educated workforce,'' said Chris Micheli, a
lobbyist representing business backing some of Davis' cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the high tech tax cuts, one would help employees whose
graduate school tuition is paid by their company, which often
happens in high tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt the first $5,250 of the tuition from the
worker's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants the tax cut to apply to all employees, regardless of
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Burton limited the tax cut to employees earning $50,000 or less
a year and said the tax cut would expire after five years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants the state's main research and development credit,
which allows business to subtract those costs from tax liability,
to climb from 12 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Burton wants to hold it to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another tax credit Davis wants would allow companies to carry
forward 65 percent of the losses from previous years to offset
revenue when the company turns a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Burton lowered that to 60 percent of losses. Lawmakers have
already sent that tax cut to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the governor's own estimates, his idea would cost the state
$198 million ten years from now,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Assembly Republican leader Scott Baugh of
Huntington beach, said the Assembly planned to ``put the governor's
tax relief package out of our house'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are always happy to provide more tax relief,''
said Jamie Fisfis, Baugh's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Any action the Assembly takes is subject to Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at each proposal on its individual merits,'' Burton
said. ``If the license fee gets vetoed we can always turn around
and give working families with kids a tax break instead.''

BIG INNING GIVES JONES MORE THAN HE NEEDS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The choice was obvious but not easy. Bobby J. Jones
had seven years in the major leagues and the pride that goes with
it. But the Mets' right-hander was pitching poorly, and because of
off-days in the schedule, the plan was to skip him for two turns
through the rotation. The Mets wanted Jones to go to Triple-A
Norfolk for a while, to stay sharp and, just maybe, rediscover
something. Jones had enough major league service time to veto the
demotion, but he accepted it and is glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   Building off two starts in the minors in which he tinkered with
his delivery and fortified his curveball, Jones returned Friday
night and pitched eight strong innings, leading the Mets to a 12-2
victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored nine runs in the third inning, one shy of the
highest single-inning total in franchise history. But Jones hardly
needed that much support. He allowed five hits and one run, walking
two and striking out eight. Those were better numbers than he
posted at Norfolk (10 innings, 15 hits, seven earned runs), but
numbers did not matter there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an opportunity to work on things without having that
much pressure on you,'' Jones said of his stay in the minors. ``I
think that I needed that, to go down there and just be able to work
on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones does not throw hard, and his assortment of pitches is
considered below average. But he has been able to master that stuff
well enough to have made an All-Star team and to have started three
times on opening day. At Norfolk, he threw more fastballs than
usual, searching to rediscover his command of the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He also adjusted his delivery. Jones had altered it in spring
training, pumping his hands together in front of his body in an
effort to get the ball out of his glove quicker. At Norfolk, he
found a way to remove the ball on time while keeping his hands at
chest level, and he noticed he was getting better downward movement
on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked to improve his curveball, and the combination
devastated the Pirates. In his last start for the Mets, a 13-5 loss
at Yankee Stadium on June 10, the Yankees swung and missed at only
two of Jones' first 47 pitches. Friday night, he got better results
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' leadoff hitter, Warren Morris, struck out swinging
on a high fastball. Jason Kendall was next, and he swung through an
outside fastball _ 87 mph on the Mets' radar gun, which manager
Bobby Valentine believes is probably the slowest in the National
League _ for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero then swung and missed at two curveballs before
popping out on a fastball for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first batter, every pitch was crisp,'' Valentine said.
``You can't really tell what you're going to get _ things change in
a hurry in our game _ but the first inning was the perfect inning.
He threw crisp pitch after crisp pitch, right where Mike was
sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets' nine-run third put them ahead by 10-1, Jones
told catcher Mike Piazza that he wanted to continue using all his
pitches, to pitch as if the score was 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had something to prove tonight,'' Jones said. ``I had to
stay with my game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He stayed with it, but the first batter of the fourth, Cordero,
stroked a double down the left-field line. Jones escaped the inning
scoreless, getting two fly outs and fanning Aramis Ramirez,
squelching a big inning before it could start.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his victory over Arizona on May 19 and an abbreviated
April start in which he strained a calf muscle, Jones had allowed
at least three runs in an inning in all of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   His focus never wavered, Valentine said. Jones is not expressive
when he pitches, and people can mistake that for nonchalance. But
Valentine said he observed a ``determined competitor'' Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may think that he doesn't care,'' Valentine said.
``He cares as much as anybody that there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets supported Jones (2-3) with a run on a bases-loaded balk
in the second, but the Pirates tied the score, 1-1, in the third.
That was the last time the game was close.
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on and one out in the third, the Pirates rookie
starter Bronson Arroyo went up and in with a fastball to Piazza,
who turned on it and looped it into the left-field bleachers for a
three-run homer. The Mets had a 4-1 lead, Piazza had his 21st home
run (and third in his last three games), and a rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   With two men on, Jay Payton's bouncer took a bad hop and ruined
the Pirates' chances of an inning-ending double play. One run
scored, and three batters later, Melvin Mora drove in three runs
with a double.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates helped out with two errors in the third, and by the
time Piazza fanned to end the inning, the Mets had scored nine runs
in an inning for just the fifth time in their history. The Mets
have scored more runs in an inning only once, when they posted a
10-run sixth on June 12, 1979, against Cincinnati.

L.A.'S PUBLIC TRANSIT DREAM STALLS IN OPENING OF LAST LEG OF RED 
 LINE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The final leg of the Los Angeles subway system
opens for business Saturday offering a dream ride _ from the San
Fernando Valley to downtown L.A. in only 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the end of the line for subways in Southern
California. The new Red Line subway turned out to be the most
beautiful, cleanest, most expensive and least productive subway
system ever built in the United States, a kind of gorgeous failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles subway is an eye-opener in more ways than one.
The trains are clean and fast. The fares are low (only $1.35 each
way). The subway runs on the honor system; there are no fare gates.
</P>
<P>
   There are also no graffiti. In three days of riding at all hours
this week, only one scrawl was found, put on car 546 by someone
named Joey.
</P>
<P>
   The stations themselves are works of art: The station at the
famous corner of Hollywood and Vine has a ceiling made of film
reels, benches that resemble low-rider cars and pillars that look
like palm trees. At the Hollywood and Western station, the walls
glitter with multicolored tiles. There is a light show with cars,
trucks and trains at one entrance to Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new shopping-dining complex above the Hollywood
/Highland station, complete with a theater where the Academy Awards
will be staged. The main Hollywood stations celebrate showbiz; the
new North Hollywood station features images of the Gabrileano
Indians, the missions of the Spanish period, the ranchos of the
Mexican times, Amelia Earhart, and the old Big Red Cars of the old
Pacific Electric Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The stations and trains are busy, but not crowded; there's
always a seat. ``I ride it every day,'' said Patrick Moran, a
deputy district attorney. ``I like it. I wish it went farther.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said John Campbell, a visitor from Lake
Elsinore, who was riding for the first time. ``It's the best
E-Ticket ride I've ever been on. It's wonderful. I am impressed and
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles subway is also a cautionary tale complete
with unrealistic expectations, cost overruns, scandals,
mismanagement, political battles and even a methane explosion
during construction.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is clear that the three new stations opening
today will be the last. With the new stations, the subway will be
17.4 miles long and cost $4.7 billion, or $270 million a mile.
</P>
<P>
   When construction began 15 years ago, subway backers said the
system would ease congestion on the freeways and be the center of a
network of lines running to the San Fernando Valley, to the ocean
at Santa Monica, to East L.A. The Red Line subway, they said, would
carry 300,000 passengers a day by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Red Line has 59,750 one-way riders a day. The North
Hollywood extensions opening today are expected to bring the
ridership up to 100,000 daily, only a third of projections. This
compares with a weekday ridership of 1.16 million on the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus system.
</P>
<P>
   This is the automobile capital of the world _ there are more
than 7 million cars in the Los Angeles basin, probably the only
place in the world where there are more cars than licensed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge expenditure of money on transit, neither the
subway nor the bus system has lured passengers away from the
freeway in significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, over the past 15 years, public-transit use in the Los
Angeles basin has declined by 25 percent, both in market share and
in absolute numbers. In terms of traffic, said John Cox, who
monitors freeway congestion at  &UR; traffic.tann.net,  &LR; the subway ``is
lost in the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. situation is much different from in the Bay Area, where
BART carries 327,000 riders daily _ up by 10 percent in a year and
up by 22 percent over the past 15 years. In addition, the San
Francisco Muni Metro rail lines carry about 130,000 more. The
Muni's Mission Street bus lines alone carry 63,000 daily riders _
or nearly 4,000 more than the L.A. subway.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers and the huge cost have helped erode support for
the L.A. subway.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who served two years as Metropolitan
Transit Authority chairman, will be on hand to open the stations
today, but like other L.A. political figures, has given up on more
subways. ``I wish we had never started the whole thing,'' he said
once. ``Fixed rail is not the answer to the transportation needs of
our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents
the district served by the new line, once was a big subway
supporter. But the problems and the cost overruns changed his mind,
and he led the 1998 fight to approve Proposition A, which banned
use of transit sales tax money to plan or build more subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you believe subway is right, if you can't afford it,
what's the point?'' he said. ``We can't sustain this. Who are we
trying to kid?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no organized opposition and the measure passed by an
overwhelming margin, effectively clipping the wings of the subway
builders. Plans to extend the subway west to Santa Monica and to
the east side were scrapped. Saturday's ceremonies mark the
beginning of a new service and the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The rail network has been pared back. Besides the Red Line
subway, MTA operates the Blue-Line to Long Beach with light rail
trains similar to those in San Jose or Sacramento and the Green
Line from Norwalk to Redondo Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Long Beach line has met expectations. It carries 60,000
riders a day. The Green Line, which runs down the middle of the
Century Freeway, has 20,000 riders _ about a third of the
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Where rail transit flunked, said Mark Pisano, executive director
of the Southern California Association of Governments, was at the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   He said his agency, which represents county governments,
evaluated rail systems in terms of effectiveness. ``They didn't
perform well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the association figures show fully allocated costs
for the Red Line subway come out to $1.15 per passenger mile, which
means a 17.4-mile ride from Union Station to North Hollywood would
cost $20.01 to provide. The full fare is $1.35.
</P>
<P>
   There are no subway extensions in the region's transportation
plan. Instead, plans call for improved and faster bus service,
special truck lanes on freeways, better technology for drivers,
toll roads, and perhaps even magnetic levitation trains, provided
they are privately financed.
</P>
<P>
   But the big costs only wounded the subway. What killed it was
politics and a series of embarrassing mistakes. There were huge
cost overruns. Construction problems produced a giant sinkhole on
Hollywood Boulevard, and even some of the stars on Hollywood's Walk
of Fame were swallowed up.
</P>
<P>
   Workers building the line on Wilshire Boulevard produced a spark
that set off methane gas under a Ross Dress for Less store. The
resulting explosion injured 21 people.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, work had to be stopped when construction crews ran
into a series of ancient fossils. On yet another occasion, a
Metropolitan Transportation Authority consultant was convicted of
bribing an MTA official. There were three deaths in construction
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bus Riders Union sued the MTA claiming that the
agency had diverted money needed for bus improvements into rail.
They called the subway and two other rail operations ``racist
transit.''
</P>
<P>
   This in a city where 80 percent of the transit riders earn less
than $20,000 a year, and 66 percent of the riders are nonwhite.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was live and in color on L.A. television, which is
famously short on news and long on entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drew a lot of media attention,'' said Keith Killough, the
transportation authority's deputy executive officer for planning.
``Some of it overblown. It eroded political and public support.''
</P>
<P>
   Killough and others in the system are proud of what was built.
The job was huge: Tunnels were dug 900 feet deep under the Santa
Monica Mountains, and workers moved enough dirt to fill the Rose
Bowl 31/2 times. The project used enough steel to build 90,000
cars, enough concrete to build a sidewalk from Los Angeles to
Boston and enough waterproof plastic liner to make 550,000
umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a grand project,'' Killough says.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California will grow by 7 million people and 4 million
jobs in 20 years, according to the association of governments'
estimates. That's the equivalent of adding two cities the size of
Chicago to the area.
</P>
<P>
   And then, said Killough, ``people will forget all the travails
we had to get here, and they will marvel at the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Killough expects people to take to the North Hollywood line,
which runs under the crowded Cahuenga Pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ask is that you should try it,'' he said. ``See what
you think, and then let us know if we should do more.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not believe this is the end of the line for subways.
``It is only a brief moratorium,'' he said.

DALAI LAMA IN MARIN TO SHAPE FUTURE OF AMERICAN BUDDHISM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There was the Dalai Lama, surrounded by Tibetan
lamas in maroon and yellow robes, Thai monks draped in orange and
an assortment of California Buddhists wearing everything from blue
jeans to the traditional Zen vestments of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most extraordinary thing about a private
gathering of 220 Asian and Western Buddhist leaders in Marin County
this week was that half of the assembled teachers were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked the Dalai Lama if there could be a woman Dalai
Lama,'' said Jack Kornfield, a Buddhist teacher and co-founder of
Spirit Rock Meditation Center near Woodacre, Calif., which hosted
the unprecedented five-day assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say much of the discussion at the sessions, which
were closed to the public and the non-Buddhist press, revolved
around efforts to nurture an American incarnation of this ancient
spiritual practice and to overcome centuries of sexism and
sectarianism in Asian Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddhism is a huge world religion,'' said Kornfield. ``We have
our fundamentalists, and we have our Unitarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but Buddhism, American-style, simmers in a
meditative melting pot where teachers and students from various
Asian schools have come together for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 2,000 years, they've mostly only heard rumors about each
other,'' Kornfield said. ``The Burmese misunderstood the Tibetans,
or the Tibetans couldn't understand why the Japanese were hitting
each other with sticks. There's a history of sectarianism, rivalry
and put-downs that we want to avoid in America. It's an issue the
Dalai Lama is very interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, there are between 2 million and 3
million practicing Buddhists in the United States, an eclectic mix
of Asian immigrants and Western converts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main questions that emerged at the Marin County
gathering was how to separate Buddhism's essential teachings from
its Asian trappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama talked about how important it is for us to
stick to the basics _ to cultivating compassion and freeing
ourselves from anger and greed,'' Kornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Another topic was how to make Buddhist practice more available
to low-income students and people of color. That discussion comes
amid concerns that the relatively high prices charged by some
retreat centers and teachers are turning American Buddhism into an
elitist practice and inhibiting its growth.
</P>
<P>
   In prosperous Marin County, Buddhism is booming at centers like
Spirit Rock and Green Gulch Farm, a retreat at Muir Beach run by
the San Francisco Zen Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a scholarship program and try not to turn people
away,'' said Kornfield. ``One of the problems is there are few
Latino or black dharma (Buddhist) teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dalai Lama was the best-known Buddhist at this week's
Marin County meeting, many other leading U.S. and European teachers
from the three major Buddhist schools _ the Theravada, Vajrayana
and Zen/Pure Land traditions _ attended the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on the agenda were Buddhism on the Internet,
Buddhism and psychology, scientific research about the benefits of
meditation, developing meditation practices best suited for Western
seekers and finding new ways to increase the dialogue between
sects.
</P>
<P>
   There were also sessions on educating children about Buddhism,
training meditation teachers and getting more involved in social
justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   American Buddhism traces its roots to the teachings of
Siddhartha Gautama, a wealthy prince who lived in the foothills of
the Himalayan mountains six centuries before Christ. According to
Buddhist lore, the prince left his palace one day and was suddenly
awakened to the real world of suffering, sickness and death.
</P>
<P>
   After meditating in a forest retreat, the man who would be
Buddha realized that the root of suffering was attachment and
desire, an obsessive craving that stifles compassion and inner
peace. He began preaching a ``middle way'' between self-denial and
self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has long been a magnet for American Buddhists. The
religion was first brought here by Chinese laborers during the Gold
Rush. But it really blossomed in the 1960s, when relaxed
immigration laws brought a new wave of Asian immigrants and
spiritual teachers from China, India, Tibet and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional leadership styles _ where the teacher is
all-powerful _ soon led to numerous scandals involving sex, money
and abuses of spiritual authority.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pioneer roshis and lamas of the 1960s and 1970s have
died, leaving the next generation of Buddhist practitioners to find
new, more democratic, forms of temple leadership.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barbara Gates, co-editor of Inquiring Mind, an
American Buddhist journal published in Berkeley and a participant
at the Spirit Rock conference, ``there were some interesting
discussions with the Dalai Lama looking at some of the dangers of
having devotion to a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornfield said today's Buddhist devotees are less naive about
the powers and purity of gurus, lamas and other meditation masters.
``A lot of centers have established clear, ethical guidelines that
apply to teachers and students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case at Spirit Rock, where the retreat center is run
by a 17-member teacher's council.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco Zen Center, founded in 1962 by the late
Japanese Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki, a pair of rotating co-abbots
now serve seven-year terms and share power with an elected board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Abbess Blanche Hartman, the first woman to lead the Zen Center,
came to Marin to talk about the role of women in Buddhism and how
to interest young people in Zen meditation. ``I'm 74 years old now,
so my main function is to try to pass this on to the next
generation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Buddhist journalist allowed into the private meeting was
Helen Tworkov, founding editor of Tricycle, a Buddhist magazine
published in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some discussion about the inequality between nuns
and monks in Asia,'' she said. ``There were things that have never
happened before, like a nun from the Thai forest tradition
addressing the Dalai Lama.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of a future female Dalai Lama, the current
Dalai Lama has said that is possible, although few observers of
Tibetan Buddhism expect it to happen anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the gathering at the bucolic Spirit Rock retreat in the
rolling hills of West Marin was not all serious. ``There was a
tremendous celebratory sense that all these people were coming
together,'' Tworkov said. ``A lot of the fun was just hanging
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the media, Hollywood and other purveyors of
popular culture, Tibetan Buddhism and its leader, the Dalai Lama,
have become household words in America.
</P>
<P>
   Books by the Dalai Lama and other Buddhist writers are anchored
on the best-seller lists. Films like ``Kundun'' and ``Seven Years
in Tibet'' have spread the faith, as have Buddhist movie stars like
Richard Gere and Steven Seagal.
</P>
<P>
   Kornfield, who studied in Buddhist monasteries in Thailand,
India and Burma before co-founding Spirit Rock, said Hollywood's
embrace of Buddhism is a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets people interested, but they may show up and say, `I
want to learn to meditate, so I can levitate like I saw the lamas
do in the movies,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kornfield sat in a small room off the main meditation hall at
Spirit Rock, which combines Asian architecture and a rustic
Northern California feel, and spoke about how far Buddhism has come
in the West. His latest book, ``After the Ecstasy, the Laundry,''
looks at how many longtime meditators have gotten over the romantic
notions of Buddhist nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this idea that after five or 10 years, you'd get
enlightened and live happily ever after. You might be more
compassionate, or wiser, or more awake, but you're still the same
person,'' he said. ``The spiritual life turns out to be less about
some spiritual state you've attained and more about the life you
live.''

DRAG AND ... IT'S JUST A DRAG

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am in dire need of your perspicacity. My
current system is disgusting (a Pentium II with Windows 98 Second
Edition). The clock will lose a full day in about two weeks. Also,
when you click the mouse pointer on something, there is a delay,
and when I type, there is a delay before the letters show up. I
call the hardware manufacturer, and he blames the software or the
operating system. I call the software company, and they blame the
hardware or the OS. I have never been able to talk to a real person
at Microsoft, so I am unsure who they'd blame.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow Motion
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLOW: There are no real people at Microsoft. I mean, have
you ever actually seen anyone who works there, other than Big Bill
or Steve Ballmer? Or maybe the're all just hiding in their
windowless little offices, eating aerosol cheese and sardines,
hoping nobody asks them why their products are so full of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I really hate about trying to run down a problem with
no clear solution is trying to get a straight answer out of a
support technician. I wish they'd just say they don't have a clue
instead of pointing a finger at somebody else. And before you say
it, yes, I've done the same thing when I've wanted to get rid of a
particularly annoying user and get back to playing Unreal
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since I know I'll get the run-around from three or four
different help desks, I generally start looking for the answer
myself somewhere out there on the Internet. Try the Knowledge Base
at Microsoft (support.microsoft.com) first, although ``knowledge''
is a bit of a stretch. Maybe ``Stuff We Figured Out For Whiny
Users'' didn't sound so hot to the Marketing Department.
</P>
<P>
   Most software and hardware companies have similar collections of
fixes and suggestions on their Web sites. Just look for ``support''
links.
</P>
<P>
   The best places to find an answer, however, are news groups,
where you post a message and hopefully get an answer. When the
Internet was more text-based, these groups were fabulous places for
finding people with similar interests and problems, software,
little-known tips and, of course, dirty pictures. New Internet
users often pass the groups by, probably because the dirty pictures
are easier to see using a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising the groups, I learned that you're not the only one out
there losing time and putting up with a jerky mouse and keyboard.
Most PC clocks are about as accurate as my SATs, plus a flaky
battery will exacerbate the problem. But there's something else
afoot here, a conspiracy of major proportions. OK, maybe not a
conspiracy and maybe not major, but let me point a few fingers
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Many people report the slowdowns happen after installing Win98
Second Edition or Microsoft's Y2K patches. Others complain that it
all started after installing Norton AntiVirus 5.0 with
Auto-Protect, which runs all the time. And even Microsoft says that
your system can slow down when running stuff like a virus checker
in the background. No definitive answer, but there are a few clues.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs just don't play well with Win98, so turn off your
virus checker and see if things speed up. No? Try this: Shut down
everything else that's going on behind the scenes. If you hit
Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a dialogue box that lets you end
individual tasks. You can safely knock out everything but Explorer
and Systray. If that doesn't work, go back to the Microsoft support
site and look for document Q259161 for some other suggestions.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice
Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied
being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a
fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that
the vice president's lawyers released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's angry denial was contained in a 123-page transcript of a
four-hour interview in which the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance unit questioned Gore at the vice presidential
mansion about his fund-raising activities prior to the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president disclosed the interview transcript Friday
afternoon, scrambling to blunt the potential damage of the revived
Justice Department inquiry of his truthfulness in answering
questions about his efforts to raise money. Still, it risked
prolonging an issue that has dogged Gore's presidential campaign
and threatens to bring renewed com- parisons to the scandals of the
Clin- ton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always cooperated fully,'' Gore told reporters aboard
Air Force 2 Friday afternoon, as he flew from Denver to Palo Alto,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have admitted that I have made mistakes in fund raising,''
he said in the middle of a chaotic day in which he and his aides
sought to contain the latest problem to engulf his presidential
campaign. ``But I want the American people to know that I have
always told the truth on this matter. I have always cooperated
fully. And I want the entire transcript to be out there and I want
people to be able to judge it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore said, ``I think the truth is my friend in this. The
truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April interview, Gore was confronted with questions about
a wide array of campaign finance issues, posed by a clearly
skeptical and at times incredulous prosecutor, Robert Conrad , the
head of the campaign finance task force. Besides the Buddhist
temple luncheon, Gore was asked whether the White House coffees
were fund-raising events and, more recently, what he knew about
missing e-mail messages from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to release the transcript came one day after the
Justice Department confirmed that Conrad had recommended that
Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to
investigate the truthfulness of Gore's statements about his
political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president also questioned the timing of the
disclosure of the new inquiry. ``Here we are four months before an
election that takes place every four years,'' Gore told reporters.
``You can read into that what you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Friday seized on the renewed
inquiry of Gore's fund-raising activities. ``I reiterate my call
for a new tone in Washington which is going to require a new
administration in Washington,'' Bush said. ``People are sick and
tired of all this stuff and the best way to start anew is with a
new administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has clearly made the political calculation that the public
will view the transcript, filled with questions about events that
occurred as long ago as 1989, as old news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of the American
people,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's answers during the April 18 interview at times appeared
to conflict with conclusions reached by a 1997 inquiry by a Senate
panel that investigated campaign finance inquiries. But Gore
dismissed its report as ``a highly partisan document.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gore insisted that the 103 White House coffees
held in 1995 and 1996 with campaign donors were not ``fund-raising
tools'' used to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel, led by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., found in
1997 that supporters who had attended the coffee events between
November 1995 and October 1996 contributed a total of $7.7 million
within one month of having attended the coffees.
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning, Gore recalled that he had remembered
``only one that I attended briefly.'' But the Senate panel found
that he had hosted 23 coffees and attended eight with President
Clinton. Confronted with the contradictory information about the
coffees, Gore said, ``That seems inaccurate to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter,the apparent conflicts with Gore's statements
may fall short of sufficient grounds to show that Gore illegally
perjured himself, a law enforcement official said Friday. That is
one reason, the officials said, Reno has, so far, shown no sign
that she is prepared to refer the case to an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, after searing internal battles in 1997 and 1998, refused
to seek an independent counsel to investigate Gore's fund-raising
efforts over the objections of some of her senior advisers.

 WASHINGTON: senior advisers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, Conrad is not alone in his recommendation to refer the
case to a special prosecutor, the officials said Friday. FBI
Director Louis Freeh also favors a special counsel and has long
urged Reno to do so.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with Gore, Conrad led the questioning,
assisted by two FBI agents. Conrad devoted a majority of the
four-hour interview to Gore's understanding of the true purpose of
the Buddhist temple event, a subject that Gore had not been asked
about in his four previous interviews with federal investigators
from the campaign finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad repeatedly showed Gore numerous memos _ all of which had
been made public years ago _ from aides that suggested that it was
known that the event was intended to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked,
referring to Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the vice president answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?'' Conrad went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the interview, Gore inadvertently referred to the
temple event as a ``fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal
lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Gore that he had misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Neal told the vice president, ``I thought you said previously
you didn't, you still don't know whether it was a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then replied, ``Well, that's right. That is more accurate.
Let me, let me amend that. That was first time it was alleged to
be, to have been a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hsi Lai event, held on April 29, 1996 in Hacienda Heights,
Calif., was one of the most embarrassing episodes of the 1996
campaign finance scandal. The event was organized by Maria Hsia, a
longtime friend and political ally of the vice president who had
collected money before the event from monks and nuns, some of whom
had taken vows of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As a tax exempt religious institution, the temple was not
allowed to serve as a venue for political fund raising or itself to
make political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked repeatedly in late 1996 and 1997 about his
knowledge of whether the event was a fund-raiser, and according to
Conrad responded with differing statements.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia was convicted in March for hiding $109,000 in illegal
contributions and making false statements to federal regulators
about the temple luncheon. She is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted that he did not learn that the luncheon was used
to raise money until several months after it had occurred. In
between, he said in numerous interviews with the press that he
understood the luncheon was a ``community outreach event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no solicitation of money,'' Gore said. ``I did not
see any money or checks change hands. I never heard it discussed.
Nor do I believe it took place, incidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Conrad, ``Perhaps you know that some money changed hands
there. But to this day, I don't think any did.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday at the Justice Department, Reno acknowledged that
prosecutors had embarked on a renewed investigation of Gore's
statements under oath about his political fund-raising practices
during the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, Reno said that she would
ignore the inflamed partisan passions surrounding the election year
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing in any investigation, particularly in
this time of year, is that we conduct an investigation the right
way, not in the headlines, not with pressure from people who may
have differing views but just do it right _ methodically,
carefully, without commenting on it _ and get it done as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought to shift the spotlight to the background and
possible motives of Conrad, the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force who made the special counsel
recommendation late last week.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, while working as a federal prosecutor in
Charlotte, N.C., Conrad contributed $250 to Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., Federal Election Commission reports show. Democrats said
the contribution raised questions about his political motives in
his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, several senior Justice Department
officials defended Conrad's impartiality and said there was no
basis to believe that his legal judgments were politically
motivated.

LAPD'S RESPONSE TO RAMPAGE WENT AGAINST GAME PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD officers failed to move swiftly when violence
erupted after the Lakers won the NBA title, despite their own
confidential plan calling an immediate show of overwhelming force
if there was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential LAPD plan, dated June 5 and obtained Friday by
the Los Angeles Daily News, noted that there was a high potential
for violence and that lawlessness should be dealt with quickly and
effectively to avoid an escalation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early moments of the civil disorder are critical,''
according to the department's Lakers Victory Operations Plan 2000.
``The disorder should be contained to the smallest possible
geographical area and participants isolated from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, officers held back while the mob - ostensibly
celebrating the team's first championship in 12 years - menaced
fans walking or driving away from Staples Center, vandalized and
looted area businesses and set several vehicles ablaze, including
two vacant police cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle officers escorting a limousine retreated after the
crowd swarmed the vehicle, which managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD officials declined to comment specifically on the plan but
defended their overall handling of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But rank-and-file officers criticized the department for failing
to adhere to the plan, saying supervisors ordered them to wait
before making arrests at Staples Center, even though they wanted to
move in as the mob became more violent and began to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan said `move in quickly.' The orders said `stand back
and wait,''' said Ted Hunt, president of the Police Protective
League, the officers' union. ``It's incredibly frustrating and
embarrassing to officers that are handcuffed by their management.
With crowd control you take swift and appropriate action. You don't
step back and wait-and-see. They already tried that and it failed
eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said that after the crowd got
out of control Monday night, about 300 extra officers had to be
called in from around the city to back up the 300 assigned to the
Staples Center area. He said it took ``some time'' deploy the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thought that would be a sufficient number of
personnel,'' Kalish said. ``That's something we'll look at. Through
the game there were absolutely no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the department didn't want be heavy-handed with people
simply celebrating, and didn't want to throw officers into a
situation where they were far outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan's office said the police did ``a fine
job'' Monday night, but had not seen the Lakers Victory Operations
Plan and would not question Chief Bernard C. Parks about why it
wasn't followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor would not presume to second-guess the police chief
and his officers while they are out on the street making decisions.
We're not about to do any Monday-morning quarterbacking,'' said
Deputy Mayor Manuel Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was briefed extensively by the police chief, the
fire chief and the head of the DOT (Department of Transportation),
so basically, we're fine. We have already said we're going to be
getting from the police chief recommendations for how we can
improve and make sure we do a better job in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Monday night that they had expected only
good-natured celebrations, and didn't have enough officers at
Staples Center to handle the crowd of more than 10,000 that massed
outside the arena during and after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly planned for a crowd. But we're not mind readers
and we had no experience with this type of thing,'' said the LAPD
incident commander at Staples Center, Capt. Stuart Maislin, in an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Operations Plan noted the potential for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern for potential spontaneous celebrations in the
streets and civil disturbance from overzealous Lakers fans,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience from past disorders ... dictates that uniformed
officers should be deployed to the field as soon as possible to
deter criminal behavior and to present an overwhelming show of
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The history in other cities could have been a guide, as well.
Riots featuring vandalism, car burnings and other mayhem have
become a grim tradition in the wake of team championships, such as
after victories by the Denver Broncos in 1997, the Chicago Bulls in
1991, 1992, 1993 and 1996, the Detroit Pistons in 1990 and the
Montreal Canadiens in 1986 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Maislin did not return messages Friday, but a source within the
department said plans like the one for the Lakers are seen merely
as guidelines, and that it is ultimately up to the commanders at
the scene to make tactical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Operations Plan report, drawn up in anticipation of a Lakers
victory and ensuing spontaneous street celebration, said police
commanders ``must rapidly deploy forces and use equipment that will
quickly demonstrate the Department's unwavering determination to
restore order. The arrest of violators and the repeated dispersal
of unlawful groups will demoralize the crowd's will to resist
lawful police orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers made 11 arrests Monday night, but a dozen people were
hurt in the unrest and numerous businesses and vehicles were
damaged or destroyed within several blocks around Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this type of crowd you don't want to be provocative and
create a problem,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't perfect and unfortunately we did have some
vandalism. However, at the end of the day, the Lakers won, there
were no serious injuries, no deaths, and the vast, vast amount of
people at the event had a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a training manual from the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, the organization held up the LAPD response to the
Rodney King verdict in 1992 as an example of how not to handle
crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediate action is required in order to protect lives and
property. Containment is one of the most important initial measures
that officers can take in efforts to defuse and disband a riotous
of potentially riotous situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the crowd is not dispersed and order restored, arson and
wholesale destruction and violence often follows.''

BOTTENFIELD TO RETURN, SAYS SHOULDER OK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Updates second item) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Bottenfield returns to the starting
rotation tonight after missing two starts because of tendinitis in
his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield came to the Anaheim Angels from the St. Louis
Cardinals in the trade for Jim Edmonds after winning 18 games in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is 4-5 with a 5.21 ERA, but some of his problems can be
linked to his sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield first felt something was wrong in the shoulder in
mid-May, but he tried to pitch through it. His results showed there
was something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In his first eight starts this season, Bottenfield allowed three
earned runs or fewer seven times. But in his past five starts, he
allowed fewer than three earned runs only once.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shoulder affected his control, Bottenfield said he
had great command of his pitches during a simulated game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to control the ball for 65 pitches, which I've not
been able to do for quite some time,'' he said. ``I expect to go
out there (tonight) and throw anywhere from 100 to 115 pitches. I
don't expect to feel anything in my shoulder, just be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said the two weeks off were good for him in that he
worked hard on his conditioning, building up leg strength and
losing some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some definite goals in mind for the two weeks,'' he
said. ``It was something I needed to do to keep me busy and not
just sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson to have surgery: Pitcher Jason Dickson said he will have
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. The procedure will be
performed Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson had surgery to repair a torn labrum in March of 1999 and
missed the entire 1999 season. He came back and made the starting
rotation out of spring training, but landed on the DL with a
strained hip.
</P>
<P>
   But after coming back from the strained hip, he began to feel
pain in his shoulder, possibly a result of favoring the hip. He
landed on the DL a second time.
</P>
<P>
   While on a rehab assignment, the shoulder pain became too much
to ignore, and Dickson finally told trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the extent of the damage in the shoulder, the
surgery could be season-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something mechanical, with the way I throw,''
Dickson said of his recurring shoulder troubles. ``Maybe my labrum
is weak. Maybe it was reinjured during rehab. You really don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocker out: Shortstop Kevin Stocker was a late scratch Friday
night because of a sore left knee. Benji Gil started in Stocker's
place.

   ISRAEL-ARMY (Jerusalem) _ Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin
in Israel, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It
consists of about 15 houses and a mosque and is for Israelis only.
The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the
Israeli army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques,
riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers
playing the roles of what an army official called ``the enemy'':
Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists
and housewives. For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the
experience can be dizzying. By Deborah Sontag. 1,300 words.

   BANGLADESH-ACID (Gosarigaon, Bangladesh) _ More than 100
Bangladeshi women a year are victims of attacks by men, usually
spurned suitors, who throw acid in their faces. No one is sure why
this crime occurs here at such a high pace, for this nation on the
Indian subcontinent is not so different from many others in its
poverty or its culture or its treatment of women. And in a
male-dominated society, the victims rarely find justice. By Barry

   DRUG-ADDICTION (Undated) _ The debate about whether drug
addiction is a disease: Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, says that the brain of an addict
is fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,
when a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry
of the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the
drugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a
``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the
individual moves into a state of addiction characterized by
compulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist
long after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,
relapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be
approached more like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and
hypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain
that addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.'' By

Harry Potter children's book series, which has a virtually

IN KOREA, AN EMBRACE THAT SHOOK THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean
War. As all schoolchildren in North Korea know, the war began when
South Korea invaded its peaceful neighbor to the north. Since then
the government in Seoul has remained enslaved to a clique of
generals, spies and capitalists who are puppets of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Old attitudes die hard, as is obvious from the twisted
propaganda along these lines that keeps flowing from Pyongyang even
after the extraordinary meeting between leaders of the North and
South last week. A visitor who met with President Kim Dae-Jung in
Seoul after the meeting says that despite all the euphoria in his
country, the South Korean president cautions that it will take
decades, perhaps generations, to achieve reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone following recent events on the Korean Peninsula
cannot help but find them amazing.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is President Kim of South Korea, a former dissident
once rescued from a ship _ where he was about to be tossed
overboard wrapped in heavy chains by government goons _ only after
intervention by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the other is Kim Jong Il of the North, often described as a
murderous megalomaniac surrounded by concubines. Among other
things, in the course of his despotic career he is said to have
ordered the blowing up of a civilian airliner, a bombing attack on
the South Korean Cabinet and the kidnapping of a movie star and
director who were forced to help build up the North Korean film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that The Economist features the oddly coiffed and
reclusive Kim on its cover with the caption ``Greetings,
Earthlings.''
</P>
<P>
   The handful of Western visitors who have been in North Korea all
liken it to another planet. When I was in Pyongyang in 1991,
revolutionary slogans were everywhere, and loudspeakers at
construction sites exhorted workers with picks and shovels to toil
for the glory of the state. The 105-story hotel then under
construction, proudly described as the tallest hotel in the world,
was already sagging visibly. It still has not opened. Everyone I
met recited slogans about North Korea as paradise on earth. Some
admitted to meat shortages, but not to the truth of reports of
starvation in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Even if reconciliation remains a distant dream, the significance
of the two Kims meeting is tremendous. It shakes the equation in
East Asia and could even alter the political scene in the United
States. For one thing, the meeting puts South Korea in an
unaccustomed place _ the driver's seat of the policies being worked
out to deal with the danger posed by the North.
</P>
<P>
   For years the United States has taken the lead in negotiating
with North Korea, offering a combination of threats and incentives
to get it to stop building nuclear weapons. Now after negotiating a
deal on nuclear and missile restraint with Pyongyang, the Clinton
administration must defend its approach against charges of naivete
by hawkish Republicans, including advisers to Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the two Korean leaders is unlikely to soften
their criticism. Indeed, some Republicans talk of ``taking out''
the North Korean nuclear installations. But they overlook the
reality that, aside from the difficulty of destroying facilities
hundreds of feet below ground, any such attempt would lead to the
destruction of Seoul with a barrage of mortar, artillery and poison
gas counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the United States has served as a brake on
confrontation-minded generals in Seoul. Today, with hawkish
Americans calling for a tough stance toward North Korea and plans
for an antimissile defense system, South Korea may be the one
arguing for military restraint and political engagement.
</P>
<P>
   In regional terms, the irony is that for all the yearning for
reunification of the Korean Peninsula, almost no one close to the
situation wants it to happen anytime soon. The South Koreans fear
that a rapid absorption of the North will wreck their economy in
the way Germany was weakened when it was reunified a decade ago.
Russia, China and Japan _ which for centuries jockeyed for
supremacy on the peninsula _ are hardly enthusiastic today about
the possibility of a newly powerful rival in the neighborhood. Many
U.S. experts have no such concerns but nonetheless fear the day _
regarded by some experts as inevitable _ that Koreans ask for the
United States to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Why has North Korea decided to reach out to the people it still
regards as implacable foes? The answers lie in the overwhelming
economic incentives and in apparent pressure from China to defuse
the situation in hopes of speeding the withdrawal of the American
presence. President Kim of South Korea has also done a masterly job
of assuring the North that he really does not want to absorb it or
destroy its system.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it appears that the unpredictable Kim of the North may
be looking for legitimacy. Few doubt that North Korea remains
capable of a clandestine nuclear program, missile exports or other
dangerous behavior. Yet the North may be willing to keep its
aggressive impulses in check in return for help from its wary
adversaries. As for South Korea, for now it has taken the lead, and
the rest of the world will have to respond. Who knows? The latest
in North Korean movies may soon be on their way to the outside
world.

GAGNE'S RETURN WILL REQUIRE TOUGH CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When the Los Angeles Dodgers sent right-hander Eric
Gagne to the minor leagues 11 days ago, it was a decision manager
Davey Johnson wrestled with terribly.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing Johnson knows is he wants Gagne back and starting
with the Dodgers. How to achieve that continues to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious choices, barring injury, are to bump Orel Hershiser
or Carlos Perez from the rotation, which is why the Dodgers brass
are eager to see Hershiser pitch today against St. Louis. They want
to see improvement from him.
</P>
<P>
   And the solution could be as simple as putting either Hershiser
or Perez in the bullpen, or as complicated as releasing or trading
one of them, though Hershiser has a no-trade clause and team
officials believe it would take a lot for him to waive that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different ways I thought we could give our club a
shot in the arm,'' Johnson said. ``There's a couple areas that
concern me right now. We need to get a good outing out of Orel, and
see where we're at after that. You have discussions about if he's
not making an improvement, where do we go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Johnson and assistant general manager Bill Geivett) talked
about the suspensions, and if you went to 12 pitchers, what would
that do? There's a lot of things going on. If (Todd) Hundley comes
back early next week, where does that put us? When is (baseball)
making the rulings (on the suspensions)? There's a lot of things to
kind of think about before you start changing the balance of the
ballclub. We'll know more in a day or so.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll know because Hundley's on a rehab assignment in
Albuquerque (he was 0 for 3 and caught seven innings Friday), and
because of Hershiser's start. The Dodgers said they were committed
to Gagne, who's making $205,000 this season. But they've elected to
go with Hershiser and Perez. Hershiser is making $2 million and
Perez is being paid $5 million this and guaranteed $7.5 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser and Perez, currently in the fourth and fifth spots in
the rotation, are a combined 5-5 in 17 starts. Hershiser's ERA in
four starts is 9.37 and Perez's is 5.89 in 13 starts. Gagne was 1-4
with a with a 4.47 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get something to build on with (Hershiser
today),'' said Johnson, who was then asked about Perez's dilemma
again. ``We've hashed that situation over and over and over, and
it's like a topic of discussion every day, when really what it
boils down to is what's the best thing for our ballclub, and (do
we) have the options if something else happens. Then, where do we
go?''
</P>
<P>
   Releasing Perez doesn't appear to be an option at this point,
and it's unlikely a team would take him in a trade unless the
Dodgers pick up a bundle of his contract. Also, the Dodgers lack
pitching depth at the minor-league level. Jamie Arnold and Mike
Judd aren't pitching well enough to merit consideration for a
recall from Albuquerque if Gagne was back.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gagne's struggled at times with his pitch count with the
Dodgers, the club doesn't want him wasting away in the minors. He
allowed three hits, struck out 11 and didn't walk a batter in eight
innings of Albuquerque's 2-0 shutout win against Nashville on
Thursday. Gagne's 3-0 with a 0.86 ERA in three minor-league starts.
He's allowed two earned runs on nine hits in 21 innings while
striking out 26 and walking three.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping bat, awesome glove: Since being recalled from
Albuquerque on May 31 and entering into a platoon situation with
Kevin Elster at shortstop, Alex Cora has played well defensively
but has slacked off offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, who is batting .258, hit .297 in his first stint with the
Dodgers but he's 13 for 56 (.232) since returning. Cora also has
struck out 10 times, including his first three at-bats against the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made two outstanding defensive plays. He got Craig
Paquette on a ground ball that glanced off third baseman Adrian
Beltre's glove in the fourth and nailed Paquette in the eighth on a
broken-bat slow roller.

EDITORIAL: A CAMPAIGN FINANCE RUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 24:
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to come out against the public disclosure of
fat-cat donors to political ad campaigns. That would be too
embarrassing when the public is so disgusted with fund-raising
abuses. So House Republican leaders have done what must have seemed
like the next best thing. They want a disclosure requirement that
is so inequitable and destructive of First Amendment rights that it
cannot pass. Their scheme is to use this hopelessly defective
legislation as a tool to prevent a serious, even-handed disclosure
measure from getting a fair vote, even though it has broad
bipartisan support. Reformers must defy these leaders and stand up
for real reform this week.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the effort to stop a new breed of shadowy slush
funds, created by elected officials and interest groups under
Section 527 of the tax code, from raising and spending undisclosed
sums for ad campaigns in elections. These groups have sprung up
this year and, circumventing campaign disclosure laws, run
anonymous attack ads like the one that smeared Sen. John McCain
during the primaries. That ad turned out to be paid for by
supporters of Gov. George W. Bush, but others have spread across
the air waves with no one knowing who was paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Rep. Tom DeLay and other foes of campaign
fund-raising curbs have said that what is needed is more
disclosure, not more limits on the fund-raising itself. Now DeLay,
Dick Armey and Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, have come up with a disclosure bill that would
apply to all sorts of activities, not just those in an election
campaign. Moreover, the disclosure requirements for lobbying would
be absurdly punitive toward unions. A labor group lobbying on a
bill would have onerous disclosure requirements, whereas a
corporation lobbying on the same bill would not.
</P>
<P>
   This badly drawn bill is to be voted on in the House next week.
But an alternative is being prepared by several reformers of both
parties, including Rep. Christopher Shays, Michael Castle and
Martin Meehan and Sens. McCain, Joseph Lieberman, Russell Feingold
and Olympia Snowe. Republican leaders are suggesting they might not
allow the bipartisan alternative to the floor. Their mechanism
would be to offer a rule adopted by the Rules Committee, which is a
tool of the speaker, allowing only one bill to be voted on, up or
down _ the one that everyone knows has no chance of passing. This
tactic is reminiscent of Speaker Newt Gingrich at his worst, when
he tried and failed to stop a soft-money ban from being passed in
the House two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been any meaningful campaign finance reform passed
in Congress in many years. The battle has come down to something so
elementary as to be beyond dispute: ripping the curtain of secrecy
from fund-raising that the public thought it had outlawed back in
the dark Watergate days. Lawmakers in the House must demand a
chance to vote on real reform, not the sham bill that is being
force-fed them by DeLay and his colleagues. To miss this
opportunity will only deepen popular cynicism and make more
scandals inevitable.

RED SOX COME UP LAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ This 5-4 loss by the Red Sox to the Blue Jays was
painful. Literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Literally, because Jose Offerman (knee) could not even play,
Nomar Garciaparra (leg) had to pull himself out of defensive duty,
and Trot Nixon (right hamstring) fell in a heap at first base
during a most-painful eighth inning for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, there were enough ice packs and walking wounded
in the Boston locker room to suggest a football team in late
December rather than a baseball team in June.
</P>
<P>
   And the only bright light for the Red Sox was that Nixon's
injury might not be as serious as it looked. Manager Jimy Williams
hopefully suggested it was a ``cramp'' and Nixon described the
injury as his hamstring ``knotting up'' on him during a pivotal
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anything pop,'' said Nixon, who was able to limp
around the locker room afterward. ``I'll know more (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively, though, this loss was similar to so many painful
losses the Red Sox have suffered in the last month. Poor base
running (two runners thrown out) and the inability to come through
in the clutch once again doomed the team to yet another one-run
loss, its 14th in 20 such games.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's 6-14 record in one-run games is far and away the worst
in the league, the minus-8 differential much worse than Seattle's
minus-5 (5-10 in one-run games). Poor hitting and base running,
much more than poor pitching, have prevented the Red Sox from
winning the games title contenders must win.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention poor luck. With the bases loaded and two out in
the eighth, Toronto closer Billy Koch unleashed a pitch to Jason
Varitek that bounced past catcher Alberto Castillo. It was headed
for the backstop and would have brought home Garciaparra with the
tying run. Instead, the ball bounced off the leg of home plate
umpire Dale Scott, ricocheted up the third base line, and
Garciaparra was forced to hold. Varitek ultimately popped out to
short left, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught a great kick save from the umpire with a man on
third and that was the game,'' said delighted Blue Jays manager Jim
Fregosi, whose team leapfrogged over the Red Sox into first place.
Toronto had not been in first place since Opening Day. The win
marked the first time Toronto has been in first place (after April)
since 1993, when the Blue Jays won their second straight World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   But poor base running by the Red Sox' Jeff Frye earlier in that
eighth inning had short-circuited a chance for a huge inning.
Toronto starter Frank Castillo (4-5) suddenly lost everything with
one out after retiring 16 of 17 batters and 15 in a row. Enjoying a
5-2 lead, Castillo gave up back-to-back doubles to Darren Lewis and
Frye with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon then hit a sharp grounder deep into the shortstop hole and
appeared to have an infield hit, even though shortstop Alex
Gonzalez fielded the ball. But Frye froze and then belatedly began
running toward third and was easily cut down by Gonzalez's throw to
third baseman Tony Batista.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' said Frye, normally one of the Red Sox
with keen baseball instincts. ``I can't run into an out there. But
(Gonzalez) was right behind me, playing Trot to pull, and when Trot
hit the ball I froze. But then I remembered he was playing behind
me and I thought the ball was going to get through because he was
playing Trot to pull. (Gonzalez) must have gone 30 feet on that
play to get that ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I can't get thrown out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes on third base, watching Frye being tagged out, few
of the 28,198 fans at SkyDome noticed that Nixon was in a heap at
first base, his leg having given out on him a few feet from the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running there, trying to get down the line because I
thought he'd be throwing to first and my hamstring sort of knotted
up on me,'' said Nixon. ``I didn't feel anything pop and what I
felt mostly was that my whole leg knotted up.''
</P>
<P>
   After that doubly-painful play, the Red Sox still came back.
Garciaparra walked and Carl Everett followed with a double down the
right field line, scoring Curtis Pride, who was running for Nixon,
closing the Blue Jays' lead to 5-4. Brian Daubach worked a walked
off Koch to load the bases, but Varitek, after that would-be wild
pitch, could not come through.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had taken an early 2-0 lead on homers by Nixon (No.
8) in the first and Everett (No. 23) in the second off Castillo.
But John Wasdin (0-3) showcased his penchant for giving up homers
as Toronto, the American league's top homer-hitting team, hit three
blasts off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely wasn't the game I was looking for from me, the
game the team was looking for, or the game the city of Boston was
looking for,'' said Wasdin. ``I was very anxious out there. It was
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays tied the game in the second on a homer by Brad
Fullmer and a two-out single by the meek-hitting Homer Bush (.188
at the time) that drove in Alberto Castillo. Toronto took a 4-2
lead in the third on a two-run homer by Raul Mondesi and scored its
fifth run in the fourth when Jose Cruz went deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought back,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, they lost a game good teams cannot lose with
such regularity, a one-run game.

FIZER NOT SURE ABOUT CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All-American Marcus Fizer, projected as a possible
Los Angeles Clippers selection in the NBA Draft is lukewarm about
playing for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have the third overall pick in the June 28 draft.
Fizer, who left Iowa State after his junior season, was asked about
the possibility of playing for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' Fizer said by phone. ``I don't know
what it is about the Clippers. My agent has informed me about the
Clippers ... who knows, I might not go to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, a 6-foot-8 forward, didn't get into specifics about what
his agent, Henry Thomas, had told him.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, reached later, said that he gives all his clients basic
information about the teams that might draft them such as rosters,
free agents and the coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer added that he had heard negative comments about the
Clippers from fellow draftees but didn't elaborate. When it came
down to playing for the Clippers, Fizer was noncommittal. He said
he wanted to hold off judgment until he had better information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not going to voice that right now,'' said Fizer,
who was on his way to Orlando for a second workout with the Magic.
``I won't have any worries until I find out later.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer did have positive feelings toward Elgin Baylor, Clippers
vice president of basketball operations. Fizer met Baylor when he
worked out for the Clippers at the NBA pre-draft camp in Chicago
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy,'' Fizer said. ``He was a great player when
he played in the pros. He's a guy who wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who gave his draft overview on a conference call Friday,
said Fizer had a good workout with the Clippers in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked what we saw,'' Baylor said. ``Certainly if you talk
about an NBA body, he has that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor added that Fizer has good ballhandling skills for a 6-8
player.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the Clippers are a team that could use his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't expressed any preference nor has he to any
particular franchise,'' Thomas said. ``He's going to be happy when
the day comes that he can hear his name called.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas represented point guard Charles Smith who played for the
Clippers from 1998 until January 1999. Thomas said that the
dealings between the two sides were normal.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching update: Baylor backed off his earlier statements that
the Clippers would have a coach in place by the NBA Draft, meaning
the Clippers could be drafting without a coach for the second time
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not happen,'' Baylor said. ``It might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor added, ``I don't think a coach at this point in time
would have a lot of knowledge about the players (in the draft).''
</P>
<P>
   The only two announced candidates for the job are Clippers
assistant coach Dennis Johnson and Denver Nuggets assistant coach
John Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, in Houston working out draftees and veterans in the
off-season, said he is interested in the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a person who likes to see things come back,'' said Lucas,
who has been a head coach in Philadelphia and San Antonio. ``I
think they have a great nucleus in a city where they can have two
teams that can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgetown coach John Thompson, a friend of Baylor's
since childhood, is no longer a candidate for the Clippers job.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said Johnson would be the coach of the Clippers team in
the Summer Pro League at the Long Beach State Pyramid. The Summer
Pro League begins July 8, which means a contract extension for
Johnson. His contract runs out at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Miles and Alexander: The Clippers didn't work out Darius Miles,
the 6-foot-9 high schooler from St. Louis. But that, said Baylor,
does not rule him out of Clippers draft plans ... Baylor does not
plan to take Fresno State guard Courtney Alexander with the third
pick. Baylor said he would take Alexander if he had a deal to trade
down in the draft. So far, Baylor said he does not see any good
deals for the third spot.

AN UNKNOWN LIFTS THE YANKS, BUT RIVERA LETS THEM DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The New York Yankees were pummeled last week by the
Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium. The two-time defending World
Series champions lost four games in their backyard in emphatic
fashion and trudged around like shadows of their former selves.
They were also ornery about losing two games to the Boston Red Sox
this week and splitting a pivotal series they could have swept.
</P>
<P>
   All of their angst had been building, and the Yankees had to
turn to Ben Ford to help them find redemption against the team with
the best record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Who? Ford is the 24-year-old rookie who has been a reliever
for all but two starts in his career. He was rushed to the major
leagues because of Orlando Hernandez's sprained right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Ford who failed the Yankees as he pitched effectively
into the seventh inning. It was Mariano Rivera who failed them.
Carlos Lee belted a leadoff homer in the ninth inning and Jose
Valentin had a two-out broken-bat single to deliver Herbert Perry
with the decisive run as the White Sox rallied for two runs in the
ninth to win, 4-3, beating the Yankees for the fifth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was trying to do my job in the ninth,'' Rivera
said. ``I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (36-32) dropped to third place in the AL East, one
game behind the first-place Blue Jays (40-34) and a half game
behind the Red Sox (37-32). After losing their third straight game,
the Yankees are as low as third for the first time since April 18,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox slowly gained more fan support as 38,773 fans came
to Comiskey Park on a muggy, rainy night. They came to see if the
surging White Sox could stymie the Yankees again. Few came to watch
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But he lasted into the seventh, Jeff Nelson rescued him by
wriggling through a bases-loaded, one-out jam and the Yankees used
run-scoring hits by Bernie Williams and Shane Spencer in the eighth
to take a 3-2 lead. Rivera stranded a runner in the eighth, but he
crumbled in the ninth and botched his third save in 19 chances. The
Yankees' closer mishandled four saves in 49 chances all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo is human, I guess,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``We're
finding that out. We'll still take our chances with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees are pursuing offense and again showed
they need it because Paul O'Neill's homer was all they managed off
starter Jim Parque, Ford delighted them with his poise.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will toss a ball on Saturday and could be placed on
the disabled list if he feels uncomfortable, which would probably
keep Ford in the rotation. For one night, Ford, who had the flu,
looked as if he belonged. But, for the fifth straight game, the
White Sox humbled the Yankees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset about the loss,'' Ford said. ``It's hard to take,
but I'm happy with where I'm at.''

BOTTENFIELD TO RETURN, SAYS SHOULDER OK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Updates third item) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Bottenfield returns to the starting
rotation tonight after missing two starts because of tendinitis in
his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield came to the Anaheim Angels from the St. Louis
Cardinals in the trade for Jim Edmonds after winning 18 games in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is 4-5 with a 5.21 ERA, but some of his problems can be
linked to his sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield first felt something was wrong in the shoulder in
mid-May, but he tried to pitch through it. His results showed there
was something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In his first eight starts this season, Bottenfield allowed three
earned runs or fewer seven times. But in his past five starts, he
allowed fewer than three earned runs only once.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shoulder affected his control, Bottenfield said he
had great command of his pitches during a simulated game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to control the ball for 65 pitches, which I've not
been able to do for quite some time,'' he said. ``I expect to go
out there (tonight) and throw anywhere from 100 to 115 pitches. I
don't expect to feel anything in my shoulder, just be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said the two weeks off were good for him in that he
worked hard on his conditioning, building up leg strength and
losing some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some definite goals in mind for the two weeks,'' he
said. ``It was something I needed to do to keep me busy and not
just sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson to have surgery: Pitcher Jason Dickson said he will have
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. The procedure will be
performed Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson had surgery to repair a torn labrum in March of 1999 and
missed the entire 1999 season. He came back and made the starting
rotation out of spring training, but landed on the DL with a
strained hip.
</P>
<P>
   But after coming back from the strained hip, he began to feel
pain in his shoulder, possibly a result of favoring the hip. He
landed on the DL a second time.
</P>
<P>
   While on a rehab assignment, the shoulder pain became too much
to ignore, and Dickson finally told trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the extent of the damage in the shoulder, the
surgery could be season-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something mechanical, with the way I throw,''
Dickson said of his recurring shoulder troubles. ``Maybe my labrum
is weak. Maybe it was reinjured during rehab. You really don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocker out: Shortstop Kevin Stocker was a late scratch Friday
night because of a sore left knee. Benji Gil started in Stocker's
place. After the game, Stocker was placed on the 15-day DL and
replaced on the roster by Justin Baughman.

ANGELS WIN, BUT ETHERTON GETS ODD REWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If all had gone smoothly for the Anaheim
Angels this season, they never would have needed to call up Seth
Etherton from the minor leagues. But it didn't, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to the starting staff forced the Angels to put Etherton
in the starting rotation and he responded by going 3-1 in six
starts, including a three-game winning streak capped by Friday's
8-3 win over the Minnesota Twins before 30,254 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton's reward?
</P>
<P>
   A one-way ticket back to Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill, the Angels' opening-day starter, is ready to return to
the rotation and will start Wednesday in Etherton's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton is expected to be optioned to the Triple-A club before
tonight's game because the Angels need to clear a spot on the
roster for tonight's starter, Kent Bottenfield. But he saved his
best for last, throwing a season-high 6 innings and striking out a
season-high six. He had only one bad inning - the second - when he
gave up five hits, including a two-run homer by David Ortiz. A
third run scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Etherton yielded only one other hit before being replaced by
reliever Mike Holtz with two out in the seventh inning. Only an
error by second baseman Adam Kennedy prevented Etherton from
finishing the seventh. The Angels offense gave thanks to Etherton
with four home runs, including two by Troy Glaus (Nos. 21 and 22).
Tim Salmon (No. 17) and Bengie Molina (No. 6) also homered in an
11-hit attack. Darin Erstad had three hits, his
major-league-leading 36th multi-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   After Etherton put the Angels in a 3-0 hole in the top of the
second inning, the Angels got the three runs back in the bottom of
the second when Kennedy tripled in two and Benji Gil drove in
Kennedy with a sacrifice fly. Salmon and Glaus each hit a solo
homer in the third, giving the Angels a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Angels made it 6-3 after back-to-back singles
by Erstad and Orlando Palmeiro, and an RBI groundout by Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton took it from there. After the second inning, the only
hit he allowed was a two-out double by Matt Lawton in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Twins starter Jason Ryan (0-1) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The win also marked a breakthrough of sorts for the Angels.
After losing the previous five times when they had a chance to go
four games over .500, they won on their sixth try Friday, improving
to 38-34. It's the first time they've been as many as four games
over .500 since the final day of the 1998 season when they were
85-77.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the Angels' fifth win in six games. And with three
more to go against the struggling Twins, the Angels have an
opportunity to make a move in the division race.

SHAW FAILS TO BAIL OUT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Through all his problems in the last month, Los
Angeles Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw figured one part of his struggles
were the baseball breaks going against him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his saves were in one-run games, and broken bat singles
and defensive lapses didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature and the umpiring crew threw some more circumstance
Friday at Shaw, who blew his seventh save in 19 chances under some
very trying circumstances that raises more questions about how
he'll be used in the future. The game was delayed 22 minutes by
rain with two outs and a St. Louis runner on second in the 11th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, J.D. Drew singled in the game-tying run off
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a repeat performance in the 12th as weather forced
a 19-minute delay before Craig Paquette hit a three-run homer off
Shaw to give the Cardinals a 9-6 win at a near-empty Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to run out after a rain delay to pitch again,
and to do it twice is something I've never seen,'' said Dodgers
reliever Mike Fetters, a closer for three years in Milwaukee. ``It
was a tough spot, there was no one available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time (the game was delayed) I thought, with two
outs, all we need is one more pitch to get out of the inning and
the game is over. To call it like that, I thought it was a little
premature. It was already raining. Why couldn't it wait until that
batter was done?''
</P>
<P>
   When crew chief Rick Reed called the second rain delay, it came
with runners on first and second and one out and a 2-2 count on
Craig Paquette.
</P>
<P>
   But the strangeness of the evening began with a 1-1 count to
Drew in the 11th. That's when the heavy rains, along with some
thunder and lightning, came. It lasted but 10 minutes, but by the
time the tarp was removed and the field manicured, the delay was
twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Polanco led off the 11th by slapping Shaw's first pitch
through the right side of the infield. He was sacrificed to second,
and Shaw got Edgar Renteria to fly out to right.
</P>
<P>
   But Drew singled to right to tie it 6-6 before being thrown out
by Shawn Green at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled and came back and had the lead, and the rain came
and put a damper on it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``It's a tough situation for (Shaw). It's a tough situation with
(one) strike on (Drew), and he doesn't want to walk him. The rains
come and it takes a little out of him. Then, the second one comes,
and you could almost see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's last appearance came Wednesday in Houston when he failed
to record an out in a save situation, and Johnson said he would
have to monitor when to use Shaw. With a quartet of relievers
already used, Shaw was the choice after catcher Paul LoDuca's solo
homer in the top of the 11th gave the Dodgers a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With lightning flashing around the stadium and thunder rolling
through it, Jim Edmonds led off the 12th with a double to left
field that bounced off Shawn Gilbert's glove as he jumped into the
wall. Mark McGwire was intentionally walked and pinch-hitter Eli
Marrero's botched sacrifice attempt allowed LoDuca to throw out
Edmonds at third.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the count 2-2 to Paquette, heavy rains hit again.
When the game resumed, Paquette hit the first pitch he saw from
Shaw (2-4) into the left-center-field bleachers for the win.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca's homer capped a power surge of a night for the Dodgers
in which all of their runs came via the long ball. Gary Sheffield,
Adrian Beltre and LoDuca each hit solo homers and Green had a
three-run blast.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's solo homer in the first was momentous. It extended
his hitting streak to a season-high 13, but it was also his 25th of
the season. That's the most homers for a Los Angeles Dodger before
the All-Star break. Mike Piazza's 24 in 1996 were the old mark.
Sheffield has five homers in his past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of felt for (Shaw), but other than going with a
position player I don't think we had another option,'' said
reliever Matt Herges, who allowed a solo homer to Mark McGwire to
tie it in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out there twice is tough, but I have to commend Shaw for
acting like it was no big deal. He went out there and gave it his
best. I admire that in him.''

ANGELS WIN, BUT ETHERTON GETS ODD REWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If all had gone smoothly for the Anaheim
Angels this season, they never would have needed to call up Seth
Etherton from the minor leagues. But it didn't, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to the starting staff forced the Angels to put Etherton
in the starting rotation and he responded by going 3-1 in six
starts, including victories in his past three starts, capped by
Friday's 8-3 win over the Minnesota Twins before 30,254 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton's reward?
</P>
<P>
   A one-way ticket back to Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill, the Angels' opening-day starter, is ready to return to
the rotation and will start Wednesday in Etherton's spot. Etherton
was optioned to the Triple-A club after Friday's game because the
Angels needed to clear a spot on the roster for Kent Bottenfield,
tonight's starter.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton saved his best for last, throwing a season-high 6
innings and striking out a season-high six. He had only one bad
inning - the second - when he gave up five hits, including a
two-run homer by David Ortiz. A third run scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Etherton gave up only one other hit before being replaced by
reliever Mike Holtz with two out in the seventh inning. Only an
error by second baseman Adam Kennedy prevented Etherton from
finishing the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense gave thanks to Etherton with four home runs,
including two by Troy Glaus (Nos. 21 and 22). Tim Salmon (No. 17)
and Bengie Molina (No. 6) also homered in an 11-hit attack. Darin
Erstad had three hits, his major-league-leading 36th multi-hit
game.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Etherton was diplomatic about the club's
decision to send him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very positive,'' he said. ``A change needed to be made.
The veteran guys are coming back. They've been successful here too.
I don't think it's any shot at me. They need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   In his six starts, Etherton is 3-1 with a 4.98 ERA. He pitched
at least five innings in every start and didn't allow more than
four runs in any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth came up here and certainly made the most of his
opportunity to show he can pitch in the big leagues,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``But you can only pick five starters.
We have high expectations of Ken Hill with the experience he
brings. But Seth definitely made a footprint here and you'll see
him back. What he did up here certainly was above any expectations
for a guy who has very limited minor-league experience.''
</P>
<P>
   After Etherton put the Angels in a 3-0 hole in the top of the
second inning, the Angels got the three runs back in the bottom of
the second when Kennedy tripled in two and Benji Gil drove in
Kennedy with a sacrifice fly. Salmon and Glaus each hit a solo
homer in the third, giving the Angels a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Angels made it 6-3 after back-to-back singles
by Erstad and Orlando Palmeiro, and an RBI groundout by Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton took it from there. After the second inning, the only
hit he allowed was a two-out double by Matt Lawton in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can compete at this level,'' Etherton said. ``Each
timeout I was feeling like I was getting better. I just want to
build on that and keep going. Facing big-league hitters just builds
on your confidence because I haven't been hit hard in any of my
starts. I made adjustments when I needed to.'' The Angels' trio of
pitchers (Etherton, Brian Cooper and Jarrod Washburn) who started
the season in the minors but found themselves in the starting
rotation, are 6-0 in their past nine starts combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of us have done an outstanding job,'' Etherton said.
``I'm sure it's very encouraging for the team and players and the
organization itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The win also marked a breakthrough of sorts for the Angels.
After losing the previous five times when they had a chance to go
four games over .500, they won on their sixth try Friday, improving
to 38-34. It's the first time they've been as many as four games
over .500 since the final day of the 1998 season when they were
85-77.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the Angels' fifth win in six games. And with three
more to go against the struggling Twins, the Angels have an
opportunity to make a move in the division race.
</P>
<P>
   Twins starter Jason Ryan (0-1) got the loss Friday in his
major-league debut.

<P>
   ROME _ On Monday, the European Union tapped Greece to become the
latest member to adopt the euro as a common currency. The approval
was recognition that Greece, and its newly trimmed economy, was
ready to join the club of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Orthodox church leaders gathered hundreds of
thousands of protesters carrying Greek flags and crucifixes in what
was the second mass demonstration this month to protest the
government's decision to remove religious affiliation from state
identity cards, which brings it in line with other members of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The government views the change as a way to protect minorities
and a natural step on the path to European integration and custom.
The church, however, views it as an assault on Greek nationalism
and identity, and its own authority. ``Resist, my dear
Christians,'' Archbishop Christodoulos told cheering crowds. ``The
forces of globalization and religious marginalization are out to
get us.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between national identity and the homogenized
political values of a newly integrated Europe is found in other
countries eager to be let in. These days, Greece is a society
tugged in opposite directions, as it tries to reconcile its past
with its uncertain future. It is a member of the European Union and
of NATO, yet it is also the poorest country in the European Union
and the only one where the Orthodox faith is dominant. Though the
country has placed its economic future in Europe, it is also a
Balkan nation, bound by history and geography to ancient,
unresolved conflicts and festering grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, inflation and government spending are the
criteria for entrance into the euro. But membership has other
implicit rules of conduct, including religious pluralism and
commitment to security. Greece has passed the economic hurdle, but
still struggles with the social and cultural costs.
</P>
<P>
   Church and state are not separate in Greece, where 97 percent of
the population is Orthodox, and the constitution stipulates that
the Orthodox religion is dominant. The country's small Muslim
minority is viewed with suspicion by many Greeks who are insecure
about Turkey, and who view the recent, new waves of immigration,
particularly from Albania, as a source of crime and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The country has not taken the same steps to eradicate left-wing
terrorism that Germany and Italy took in the 1980s. The Greek
terrorist organization November 17, which earlier this month took
responsibility for the assassination of the British defense attache
in Athens, has committed hundreds of assassinations and bombings in
the last 25 years without a single arrest. Greece's failure to
combat terrorism successfully is one of the most glaring clashes
between the country and its Western partners. The American
ambassador to Greece, Nicholas Burns, called terrorism ``the
defining issue between Greece's past and future.'' There are
others.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's loyalty to its allies was most sharply put to the test
during the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. The socialist
government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis felt bound to support,
or at least not inhibit, the allied bombing campaign, but 99
percent of Greek citizens fiercely opposed the war, prompted by
sympathy for the Serbs, who share their faith, and a deeply
ingrained anti-Americanism forged when Washington supported the
military junta that ruled Greece from 1969 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the euro brings economic and social upheavals that
worry many who may not immediately benefit from a new global
economy. ``The church doesn't exactly speak for them, but it is
expressing their anxieties,'' said Nikiforos Diamandoros, a
political science professor who is also Greece's ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   The country's large population of self-employed small-business
men and civil servants are two groups least likely to thrive under
globalization, he said. ``People who feel threatened by a new
economic order have conflated the state identity card with cultural
identity,'' Diamandoros said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism has lost some of its political edge as Greece seeks
integration with Europe and rapprochement with Turkey, but
insecurity about the economic and social costs of assimilation has
helped it resurface. While Simitis' socialist party, Pasok, has
shed much of the left-wing populism of the past and toed a more
centrist, pro-European line, along with the opposition party, the
Greek Orthodox Church has filled the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   And it is heeded. The church played a huge role in preserving
Greek language and culture under the Ottoman Empire. It was one of
the few institutions providing moral leadership during the Nazi
occupation. Even Greeks who are not particularly religious are not
dismissive of the church's role.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps emboldened by the popularity of its anti-NATO stance
during the war in Kosovo, the church has asserted itself more
strongly of late. The church is worried that the country plans to
institute a separation of church and state, which among other
things would drastically reduce church income.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the identity cards hit a nerve throughout Greek
society. More than 70 percent support adopting the euro, viewing it
as a passport to economic growth and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a recent poll, 40 percent said they supported the
church's stance on identity cards. And that seems to be less about
religious fervor than the tension between Greece's traditionalist
past and modern future.

   &UR; EDITORS: The following is a fictionalized account &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIPLOMATIC NEWS FROM NOWHERE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PYONGYANG, North Korea _ In a dramatic shift of rhetoric, if not
policy, President Kim Jong Il announced today that North Korea
would no longer refer to the United States as ``the imperialist
aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of Cold War tensions and suspicion, he declared that
the United States would henceforth be known as a ``superpower of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim disclosed the change in North Korea's diplomatic lexicon in
an interview with the National Public Radio host Diane Rehm, who
asked if last month's remarkable summit between Kim and President
Kim Dae-jung of South Korea portended a warming of relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said North
Korea was still ``concerned'' by American policies, namely the
construction of a $60 billion missile defense aimed at the North.
But they expressed hope that it would encourage the tentative
diplomatic contacts the Clinton administration has pursued in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's gesture came a week after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced a similar shift in American diplomatic
language. On the same radio program, Albright disclosed that the
State Department had officially purged the phrase ``rogue states''
and would now call America's international gallery of rogues _
North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and sometimes Cuba, Syria and the
Sudan _ by the admittedly clunky phrase ``states of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Albright's gesture will open a new
era of diplomacy, but already there have been signs of global
warming. In the days after her announcement, President Fidel Castro
of Cuba declared that he would stop regularly calling Americans
``Yanqui imperialistas.'' Instead, he said he would call the United
States ``the superpower whose Cold War mentality allows me to
justify a repressive regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, said the United
States was no longer officially ``the Great Satan,'' and the
official Iraqi news agency announced that it would stop calling
American and British warplanes that patrol the nation's skies
``enemy crows'' and instead refer to them as ``birds who have
deviated from their migratory paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including some allies, seemed less inclined to tinker
with the language of diplomacy. France insisted it would continue
calling the United States a ``hyperpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogue states'' is not the first diplomatic moniker to fall out
of use, of course. The end of the Cold War spelled doom for a raft
of nasty-sounding labels like Iron Curtain, Evil Empire, Free World
and third world, nonaligned, pariah states and Red China.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright's move appeared to be the first deliberate effort
to change the diplomatic lexicon in pursuit of foreign policy
goals.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the former spokesman for Albright, said the

   &UR; EDITORS: The following is a fictionalized account &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIPLOMATIC NEWS FROM NOWHERE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PYONGYANG, North Korea _ In a dramatic shift of rhetoric, if not
policy, President Kim Jong Il announced today that North Korea
would no longer refer to the United States as ``the imperialist
aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of Cold War tensions and suspicion, he declared that
the United States would henceforth be known as a ``superpower of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim disclosed the change in North Korea's diplomatic lexicon in
an interview with the National Public Radio host Diane Rehm, who
asked if last month's remarkable summit between Kim and President
Kim Dae-jung of South Korea portended a warming of relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said North
Korea was still ``concerned'' by American policies, namely the
construction of a $60 billion missile defense aimed at the North.
But they expressed hope that it would encourage the tentative
diplomatic contacts the Clinton administration has pursued in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's gesture came a week after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced a similar shift in American diplomatic
language. On the same radio program, Albright disclosed that the
State Department had officially purged the phrase ``rogue states''
and would now call America's international gallery of rogues _
North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and sometimes Cuba, Syria and the
Sudan _ by the admittedly clunky phrase ``states of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Albright's gesture will open a new
era of diplomacy, but already there have been signs of global
warming. In the days after her announcement, President Fidel Castro
of Cuba declared that he would stop regularly calling Americans
``Yanqui imperialistas.'' Instead, he said he would call the United
States ``the superpower whose Cold War mentality allows me to
justify a repressive regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, said the United
States was no longer officially ``the Great Satan,'' and the
official Iraqi news agency announced that it would stop calling
American and British warplanes that patrol the nation's skies
``enemy crows'' and instead refer to them as ``birds who have
deviated from their migratory paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including some allies, seemed less inclined to tinker
with the language of diplomacy. France insisted it would continue
calling the United States a ``hyperpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogue states'' is not the first diplomatic moniker to fall out
of use, of course. The end of the Cold War spelled doom for a raft
of nasty-sounding labels like Iron Curtain, Evil Empire, Free World
and third world, nonaligned, pariah states and Red China.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright's move appeared to be the first deliberate effort
to change the diplomatic lexicon in pursuit of foreign policy
goals.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the former spokesman for Albright, said the
categorization of problem countries as rogue states had initially
served as an effective way to make sense of the increasingly
complex geopolitics after the fall of the Soviet Union. Rogue
states were those that, in the American view, sponsored terrorism
or pursued weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with some of those formerly rogue states taking steps to act
in good faith, it was important not to allow colorful language to
stand in the way of diplomatic progress.

DO THE POOR HAVE A RIGHT TO CHEAP MEDICINE?

  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

   GENEVA _ For years now, the Other War on Drugs has been fought
from the thatch-roofed hospitals of rural Africa to the
travertine-clad corridors of the United Nations' Palace of Nations
here. It is a war over the sale of life-saving medicines to
developing countries. At issue are not only prices but also
implications for free trade and intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the world's poor are mounting a powerful moral and
political campaign to make advanced medicines available much more
cheaply, even though it costs billions of dollars to research and
develop them. But can pharmaceutical corporations greatly discount
their products for the poor yet continue to finance research and
show a profit? And do the poor have an absolute moral right to such
medicines, even to the point of infringing patents and pirating
drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to capitalism's victory in the Cold War and pressure from
the West for open markets, the world's pharmaceutical giants have
largely had the upper hand in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true.
</P>
<P>
   The balance has shifted with the forming of an awkward coalition
of public health agencies, governments and drug makers in the third
world, advocates for AIDS patients, consumer groups and
demonstrators who disrupt world trade meetings. The battle line
itself was redrawn last month when the White House changed its
position on the way poor countries adopt the 1994 Treaty on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Written to
end piracy of consumer goods, the agreement has an obscure section
permitting patented products to be copied in emergencies. The AIDS
epidemic is such an emergency, said Michael Reich, a professor at
the Harvard School of Public Health. Executives can no longer focus
only on profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big pharma has recognized that it has to think more positively
about access for poor countries,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   If such a ``health exception'' to the treaty were recognized,
the door would be open to treat the forgotten epidemics of malaria,
sleeping sickness and elephantiasis as emergencies. This may be
possible because of the new forces that have entered the fray. The
new director general of the World Health Organization, Gro Harlem
Brundtland, has reinvigorated an agency previously known for its
sluggishness. Doctors Without Borders, a group already critical of
the drug industry, won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize, effectively
spinning a halo around its every utterance. Act Up, a protest
organization, suddenly took up Africa's cause and began hounding
Vice President Al Gore over his ties to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the White House issued an executive order: It would
not oppose African nations that violated American patent law to get
AIDS drugs. Did that mean the government had actually switched
sides in the debate over protecting the pharmaceutical giants?
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting intellectual property rights is fundamental to
having a dynamic pharmaceutical industry,'' said Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services. ``But at the same time,
we're recognizing the need to drag down the costs of drugs.''
Shalala called it a ``balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, five pharmaceutical giants agreed to discuss
voluntary cuts in the prices of their AIDS drugs to Africa, even
cuts of 80 percent. That would reduce profits but enable the
companies to control their patents.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, a conference of world health ministers asked the
WHO for a database of prices for all AIDS drugs on sale, even in
countries that ignore American and European patents, and for help
in rewriting their own patent laws so they can buy them legally.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1994 treaty was written, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard
economist who studies development in the Third World, the industry
didn't have in mind ``a titanic struggle for the drug market in
Tanzania _ Tanzania wasn't on the radar screen. They didn't even
think about the implications for the poorest countries, and then
they ran into this growing health disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The five American, British and German companies offering to talk
about price cuts are still vague about exact numbers. The one
exception, Glaxo Wellcome, said it would cut its anti-retroviral
cocktail Combivir from $16 a pill to $2. But it has not shipped the
cheaper drug yet, and the company's representatives in Kenya
recently declined to say whether Glaxo Wellcome wanted any quid pro
quo from African countries _ such as dropping efforts to pass
patent-seizure laws, as Kenya is considering. The drug companies
have traditionally put intense pressure on countries contemplating
such laws.
</P>
<P>
   A recently released AIDS study for the United Nations showed
that Brazilian companies were ready to sell generic
anti-retrovirals at very low prices. A Combivir equivalent was
offered for $1.44, for example, and ddC for 24 cents a pill, rather
than $8.80, its American price. The drug industry has long warned
that copies may be substandard.
</P>
<P>
   If the poor actually dare to demand free drugs, can the hugely
profitable industry really afford it? The answer seems to be: up to
a point.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer donates millions of doses of Zithromax to the
International Trachoma Initiative, which treats a form of blindness
common in central Africa. The powerful antibiotic sells for up to
$60 a dose in the West, and earns the company $1 billion a year.
Yet Pfizer moves cautiously in Africa and Asia to make sure that
the drug is not smuggled back to Europe or America, undermining
sales. Merck donates Ivermectin for river blindness; Bayer gives
Praziquantel for schistosomiasis, which is caused by liver flukes.
But the quantities are never sufficient, and administrative costs
are high.
</P>
<P>
   If Western industry can't find a solution, it will find the
world turning to what the industry sees as its nemesis, India.
There, 26,000 companies replicate everything from antibiotics to
AIDS cocktails to Rogaine and Viagra _ all legally, since Indian
law recognizes patents on processes, not products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be apologetic about it,'' India's secretary
of health, Javid Chowdhury, said in an interview. ``We are a
self-contained developing economy _ we live on little, but we
survive. The per-capita health budget in India is $10 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But even this generic copying must end. India recently signed
the 1994 treaty on intellectual property rights and must enforce it
by 2005.

<P>
   The last of the Mohicans, as it turns out, were not the doomed
stalwarts of 18th-century New York in James Fenimore Cooper's
classic novel. A band of the tribe, now living in Wisconsin, has
laid claim to more than 6,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica,
promising to wait another century if that is what it will take to
regain the land.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Mexico, one of the first places that Europeans cut
real estate deals with the native people, a 252-year-old promise
from the king of Spain to Indians living along the Rio Grande is at
the center of a struggle over who will control Sandia Mountain on
the suburban edge of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Written off as powerless and invisible 50 years ago, American
Indians have been winning back small but significant chunks of land
during a time of general renaissance for many of the tribes. For
the last 30 years, a new generation of tribal lawyers has blown the
dust off old treaties to find that the deeds signed by kings and
presidents still have remarkable power in court.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first broken treaties at the dawning of the
Republic, Indians have tried to use the courts and what little
political leverage they could muster to reclaim lost lands. But
these efforts mostly failed until late in the 20th century, when
much of Indian Country was revived by gambling revenue, cultural
rebirth and newly educated leaders with a fine-tuned political
sense.
</P>
<P>
   In the most combustible of these land claims, the effort by
members of the old Iroquois confederation to reclaim nearly 250,000
acres of upstate New York, an attempt at mediation broke down last
week, although the federal and state governments had agreed to
contribute $250 million each to a settlement fund to be divided by
Oneidas in New York, Wisconsin and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The historic roles have been reversed in upstate New York. The
white landowners now say they are victims of greedy property grabs
by Indians, backed by the federal government. ``Too many people are
looking at this as some sort of historic correction,'' said Leon
Koziol, an attorney representing the property owners. ``What we're
really seeing is a land conquest.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it is a conquest, the tribes are far from where they were
when the Indian wars ended in the 19th century. Between 1778, when
the Delawares ceded their land, and 1871, when the Nez Perce signed
with the government, Congress ratified 371 treaties setting up
hundreds of ``nations within a nation,'' as the reservations were
legally constituted. Indians then owned about 140 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Indian lands have shrunk considerably, with big
reservations in the West perforated by squares of private land, and
specks in the East dwindling to even smaller dots. Today, Indians
control 56 million acres _ barely 2 percent of the United States.
Tribes lost nearly two-thirds of their property through private
sales under a policy designed to make farmers and capitalists out
of them. Termination, a policy of the Eisenhower era, paid Indians
to dissolve their tribal units. Both approaches were deemed
failures, but not until they had had a devastating effect on tribal
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone could say the Indians have the upper
hand,'' said Don Miller, a senior attorney with the Native American
Rights Fund, an Indian legal group based in Boulder, Colo.
``Whenever Indians get any leverage at all, people start to scream
and yell. The predominant attitude seems to be: `We stole it fair
and square. Now go away.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Indians do have, for the first time, is money. Twelve years
after Congress enabled them to open casinos, nearly a third of the
554 recognized tribes run some sort of gambling operation. The
revenues, up to $6 billion a year, have tipped the balance of power
in many communities. The Oneidas of Wisconsin, with their hotel,
convention center and casino, are the largest employer in the Green
Bay area. In Connecticut, Washington, California, South Carolina
and elsewhere, Indians have become major players in politics and
business.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about 1970, even before the casinos, the first wave of
Indian lawyers were demanding more than a check for land lost in
broken treaties. They wanted the land returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the idea of returning land to Indians was
unthinkable,'' said Tim Coulter, a Citizen Potowatomi tribal member
and lawyer who is the director of the Indian Law Resource Center in
Helena, Mont. ``My generation tended to view things a lot
differently. We thought you could give land back to the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Indian claims moved from federal property, usually in the
West, to more populated areas, a loud backlash ensued. Foremost
among tribal opponents is Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has been
a critic of Indian legal rights and land claims for more than 30
years. ``Making a case out of what happened to your grandfather is
not the best way to decide public policy,'' Gorton has said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the blood link to ancestors who signed
treaties with long-dead presidents that has provided Indians with
their best path for a string of legal victories. Held up as the
highest law of the land, the treaties can only be altered by
Congress; numerous Supreme Court decisions have said that the
states are largely powerless in Indian Country.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas, who once occupied 6 million acres in New York,
treated with President Washington himself. But over the next
century, state officials bought and sold their land, in violation
of laws and court cases requiring federal approval of Indian land
transfers. By 1919, the tribal land had shrunk to 32 acres. With
recent gambling revenues, the Oneidas bought back 11,000 acres, and
hired top legal talent to regain the 250,000 acres lost from the
reservation. The 20,000 non-Indians who own some of that land say
they should not have to pay the price for a failure by the state to
follow the law _ nor should they have to fight their own government
to hold onto their cabins, farms and houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, the Sandia Pueblo dates its claim to 10,000 acres
just outside Albuquerque to a handwritten land grant from the king
of Spain in 1748. They interpret the grant to cover the western
flank of one of the most popular hiking areas in the Southwest, and
parts of a residential neighborhood. Opponents say the grant
includes only the top of the first foothill. A negotiated
settlement broke apart last month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major Indian claims have been filed, lawyers for
tribes say. The coming fights are over water or sovereignty, and
the effect of casino-rich tribes over their non-Indian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   And the tribes say that people who think money and greed are the
motives for the Indian land claims should consider the case
involving the Black Hills of South Dakota, which is the longest
unresolved Indian land claim in the country. Promised to the Lakota
Sioux in a treaty from 1868, the land was opened to white
settlement after gold was discovered, leading to the Battle of the
Little Big Horn.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, the Lakota won a settlement that
would have given them $106 million in 1980. But for 20 years, the
Indians living in the poorest county in America have refused it,
holding out for the return of their sacred hills.

<P>
   The last of the Mohicans, as it turns out, were not the doomed
stalwarts of 18th-century New York in James Fenimore Cooper's
classic novel. A band of the tribe, now living in Wisconsin, has
laid claim to more than 6,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica,
promising to wait another century if that is what it will take to
regain the land.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Mexico, one of the first places that Europeans cut
real estate deals with the native people, a 252-year-old promise
from the king of Spain to Indians living along the Rio Grande is at
the center of a struggle over who will control Sandia Mountain on
the suburban edge of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Written off as powerless and invisible 50 years ago, American
Indians have been winning back small but significant chunks of land
during a time of general renaissance for many of the tribes. For
the last 30 years, a new generation of tribal lawyers has blown the
dust off old treaties to find that the deeds signed by kings and
presidents still have remarkable power in court.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first broken treaties at the dawning of the
Republic, Indians have tried to use the courts and what little
political leverage they could muster to reclaim lost lands. But
these efforts mostly failed until late in the 20th century, when
much of Indian Country was revived by gambling revenue, cultural
rebirth and newly educated leaders with a fine-tuned political
sense.
</P>
<P>
   In the most combustible of these land claims, the effort by
members of the old Iroquois confederation to reclaim nearly 250,000
acres of upstate New York, an attempt at mediation broke down last
week, although the federal and state governments had agreed to
contribute $250 million each to a settlement fund to be divided by
Oneidas in New York, Wisconsin and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The historic roles have been reversed in upstate New York. The
white landowners now say they are victims of greedy property grabs
by Indians, backed by the federal government. ``Too many people are
looking at this as some sort of historic correction,'' said Leon
Koziol, an attorney representing the property owners. ``What we're
really seeing is a land conquest.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it is a conquest, the tribes are far from where they were
when the Indian wars ended in the 19th century. Between 1778, when
the Delawares ceded their land, and 1871, when the Nez Perce signed
with the government, Congress ratified 371 treaties setting up
hundreds of ``nations within a nation,'' as the reservations were
legally constituted. Indians then owned about 140 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Indian lands have shrunk considerably, with big
reservations in the West perforated by squares of private land, and
specks in the East dwindling to even smaller dots. Today, Indians
control 56 million acres _ barely 2 percent of the United States.
Tribes lost nearly two-thirds of their property through private
sales under a policy designed to make farmers and capitalists out
of them. Termination, a policy of the Eisenhower era, paid Indians
to dissolve their tribal units. Both approaches were deemed
failures, but not until they had had a devastating effect on tribal
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone could say the Indians have the upper
hand,'' said Don Miller, a senior attorney with the Native American
Rights Fund, an Indian legal group based in Boulder, Colo.
``Whenever Indians get any leverage at all, people start to scream
and yell. The predominant attitude seems to be: `We stole it fair
and square. Now go away.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Indians do have, for the first time, is money. Twelve years
after Congress enabled them to open casinos, nearly a third of the
554 recognized tribes run some sort of gambling operation. The
revenues, up to $6 billion a year, have tipped the balance of power
in many communities. The Oneidas of Wisconsin, with their hotel,
convention center and casino, are the largest employer in the Green
Bay area. In Connecticut, Washington, California, South Carolina
and elsewhere, Indians have become major players in politics and
business.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about 1970, even before the casinos, the first wave of
Indian lawyers were demanding more than a check for land lost in
broken treaties. They wanted the land returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the idea of returning land to Indians was
unthinkable,'' said Tim Coulter, a Citizen Potowatomi tribal member
and lawyer who is the director of the Indian Law Resource Center in
Helena, Mont. ``My generation tended to view things a lot
differently. We thought you could give land back to the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Indian claims moved from federal property, usually in the
West, to more populated areas, a loud backlash ensued. Foremost
among tribal opponents is Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has been
a critic of Indian legal rights and land claims for more than 30
years. ``Making a case out of what happened to your grandfather is
not the best way to decide public policy,'' Gorton has said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the blood link to ancestors who signed
treaties with long-dead presidents that has provided Indians with
their best path for a string of legal victories. Held up as the
highest law of the land, the treaties can only be altered by
Congress; numerous Supreme Court decisions have said that the
states are largely powerless in Indian Country.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas, who once occupied 6 million acres in New York,
treated with President Washington himself. But over the next
century, state officials bought and sold their land, in violation
of laws and court cases requiring federal approval of Indian land
transfers. By 1919, the tribal land had shrunk to 32 acres. With
recent gambling revenues, the Oneidas bought back 11,000 acres, and
hired top legal talent to regain the 250,000 acres lost from the
reservation. The 20,000 non-Indians who own some of that land say
they should not have to pay the price for a failure by the state to
follow the law _ nor should they have to fight their own government
to hold onto their cabins, farms and houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, the Sandia Pueblo dates its claim to 10,000 acres
just outside Albuquerque to a handwritten land grant from the king
of Spain in 1748. They interpret the grant to cover the western
flank of one of the most popular hiking areas in the Southwest, and
parts of a residential neighborhood. Opponents say the grant
includes only the top of the first foothill. A negotiated
settlement broke apart last month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major Indian claims have been filed, lawyers for
tribes say. The coming fights are over water or sovereignty, and
the effect of casino-rich tribes over their non-Indian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   And the tribes say that people who think money and greed are the
motives for the Indian land claims should consider the case
involving the Black Hills of South Dakota, which is the longest
unresolved Indian land claim in the country. Promised to the Lakota
Sioux in a treaty from 1868, the land was opened to white
settlement after gold was discovered, leading to the Battle of the
Little Big Horn.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, the Lakota won a settlement that
would have given them $106 million in 1980. But for 20 years, the
Indians living in the poorest county in America have refused it,
holding out for the return of their sacred hills.

BROWNOUTS IN KENYA HIGHLIGHT ITS CHAOS AND MISRULE 
</HEADLINE>
  By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The generator, somewhere out back, groaned and
the bare bulbs blinked. Smokin Wanjala, a lawyer who studies
corruption in a nation where there is plenty to study, walked up a
dim stairway to his office just before lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No power at home,'' he said. ``No power at the office. So it's
darkness at noon.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed dark in Kenya these days, and not just because
electricity is in such short supply that people are forced to dine
by candlelight three or four nights a week _ a minor inconvenience
given that people are also losing their jobs. Even President Daniel
arap Moi has said Kenya, once among the most stable and prosperous
nations in Africa, is ``facing its worst-ever crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems are many. But maybe the most worrisome
manifestation came two weeks ago when elementary school students
rioted for six hours. They stoned a beer truck and then, as
newspaper cameras clicked away, drank the beer. The children were
angry because the driver of a matatu _ the incomprehensibly
dangerous vans that serve as public transport here _ ran over and
killed a little boy named Oscar Boyi Simiyu.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the day before that a matatu ran into the Range
Rover in which Moi himself was riding. Thus chaos and misrule
poetically collided at a traffic circle near downtown. No one was
seriously hurt, except the driver, who said he was later beaten up
at Moi's official residence, State House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same place I remember,'' Edward J. Casselle, a
U.S. deputy assistant secretary for commerce, said. Casselle, who
traveled around Kenya in brighter days two decades ago, is visiting
to promote a new U.S. law aimed at spurring investment in and trade
with Africa _ arriving at a distinctly pessimistic moment for
Kenya's business climate.
</P>
<P>
   The actual climate has played a big part in bringing Kenya's
long-standing problems to what many people here fear is
near-crisis. Nearly three quarters of Kenyans _ about 22 million
people _ will be affected in one way or another by the severe
drought that is choking the region, the government estimates. Of
those, 2.2 million face the serious prospect of starvation. The
Tana River, where the nation's five hydroelectric dams are located,
is low. So the government has imposed strict power rationing: Most
homes with electricity _ only 10 percent of the nation _ have it
only three or four nights a week. Factories get power every other
day. Water rationing starts soon.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the dry weather, the economy was strangling from
years of corruption and poor management. The phones and roads are
barely passable. Students are rioting. There is turmoil among the
coffee and tea growers. Tourists, afraid of runaway crime, are
staying away.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Moi _ who has been in power for almost 22 years
_ and his government have declined to accept any blame, though
Kenya is so corrupt that the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund cut off aid three years ago. In several speeches, Moi has
mostly noted that God makes the weather _ and rain feeds wells and
hydroelectric dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a rainmaker, and Kenyans are not responsible for the
drought,'' he said this month in a speech asking the world's rich
nations to donate $150 million to feed Kenya's hungry.
</P>
<P>
   But many Kenyans cannot help but notice that neighboring
nations, hit as hard or worse by dry weather, do not have nearly as
many problems with power. Or that one of Moi's top aides, Nicholas
Biwott, the former energy minister, has been criticized in
Parliament for mismanaging construction in the 1980s of an
expensive dam in the Rift Valley. Critics say the dam adds little
to the nation's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Wanjala, the corruption expert and an official with the Center
for Law and Research, wondered why there has been so little
investment in the power system; why dams were not built on other
rivers; why Kenya never pursued a planned deal with Uganda, its
western neighbor, which is spilling over with hydroelectric
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has not been clear to the Kenyan people is that their
day-to-day problems are not necessarily natural,'' Wanjala said.
``And once that sinks in, it is quite possible that it will be
channeled into a serious challenge to the legitimacy of this
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyans are clearly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desperate situation,'' said one business leader, who
asked not to be quoted by name. ``If we don't fix power, the whole
country will collapse.'' It is unquestionably a bad time to work
for a business with a name like Luka's Electric Welding, as does
Edward Maina, 32, a ``very worried'' welder. On a recent afternoon,
he was writing out a sales order in a huge open air garage outside
of downtown, but doing no welding. The four power meters were dead
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place I get my daily bread,'' said Maina, who
has worked at Luka's for eight years. ``If things go bad I will go
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the industrial area of Nairobi, there is power only every
other day, and businessmen like C.M. Waweru have already taken
steps. The owner of an electroplating company, he has already cut
the hours of four part-time workers, and is seriously thinking
about laying off some of his 20 regular workers. He worries his
business itself could come next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now the government is awake,'' he said with hope in
his voice. ``I'm sure they think about it day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the government has announced no plan, except to
wait until the short rains start, in September or October.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels completely dismal about Kenya. As a result of
nearly a year of work by Richard Leakey, a former opposition leader
who Moi appointed to reform the civil service, the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank seem poised to resume aid in the next
few months. Unlike nearly all its neighbors, Kenya is not at war
and never has been since independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   And Casselle, the Commerce Department official, said he is
confident Kenya will pull through _ although it would be better, he
said, if they enacted the reform measures required for
participation in the Africa trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident entrepreneurs will find a way to do business _
profitable business,'' he said, ``in spite of electricity problems,
water problems, real problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Kenya is in bad shape,'' he added. ``But believe me,
there are places where it is a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a hairdresser here named Maggie Mukungu sat in her shop,
Ringlets, on a recent afternoon, telling customers to come back
when the electricity is on. Usually the hairdressers receive a
salary, but now they are paid on commission because she does not
even think they can cover the rent this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's carelessness,'' she said, blaming the government. ``They
don't know what they are doing. They should think about that. But
they don't plan. They don't care about what happens to people.''
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of darkness, the lights suddenly flickered to
life. But the customers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have it,'' she said. ``But no business. So we just
wait.''

<P>
   L 'Ecole No. 41 is a bustling little winery in Lowden, Wash.,
not far from Walla Walla. Their 1997 Columbia River Cabernet
Sauvignon is a wine to put plenty of better-known California
cabernets to shame. But they don't make much wine at L'Ecole No. 41
and unless you plan to be traveling in eastern Washington soon, you
may have trouble finding it.
</P>
<P>
   You could ask them to send you a case, but that would be unwise,
at least without some advice from your lawyer. In most of this
country, you can buy just about anything by phone or over the
Internet, from guns to pornography, and have it shipped to your
home. Try it with wine, though, and you may be committing a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Since Prohibition ended 67 years ago, wine and spirits have made
their way to consumers through the so-called three-tiered system _
intended to keep mobsters out of the booze business. Wineries must
sell their products to a licensed wholesaler, who sells it to a
licensed retailer. Producers may not own any part of the
wholesalers, who may have no financial interest in retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, however, the number of American wineries
has exploded, while the number of wholesalers has plummeted,
squeezing all but the larger producers out of the distribution
system. There are some 800 wineries in California alone, producing
more than 4,000 different wines. But 500 of these producers are
tiny, producing perhaps 1 percent of all California wine.
Nationally, just 49 wineries produce 90 percent of the domestic
wine Americans drink.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wines that are unavailable beyond the states in
which they are made are expensive, but wine lovers, and there are a
lot of them, don't want their choices dictated by a few
distributors. ``The price doesn't bother me,'' said a New York
stockbroker with an extensive wine cellar, ``it's the fact that I
can't buy them here and I can't have them shipped to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers, on the other hand, are terrified of direct
shipment, which would enable anyone to surf the Web for interesting
wines, and order them via credit card or phone. In fact, there is
already a thriving direct shipment business for small case lots of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began as a cottage industry catering to collectors of
hard-to-find wines has become a coast-to-coast $1-billion-a-year
enterprise,'' an industry trade group, the Wine and Spirits
Wholesalers of America, warned in a statement last year. The Wine
Institute, the research and promotional arm of the wine producers,
contends that the figure is closer to $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Direct shipment ``in most states illegally bypasses laws
requiring alcohol sellers to be licensed by the state,'' the
wholesalers group said. ``It also avoids taxes and makes it easier
for underage people to purchase alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring home the supposed danger to the nation's youth from
mail-order wine, the industry staged events at which teen-agers
purchased wine and spirits over the phone or Internet. Direct
shipment supporters promptly filled wine publications and Web sites
with parodies depicting 14-year-olds guzzling illegally obtained
Mondavi Reserve Cabernet and Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in their
basements.
</P>
<P>
   Underage drinking and tax collection are problems, said John
DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute. But the ``loss of income
from the direct sales'' was the wholesalers' real worry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This would appear to be the case, since the wine distributors
have said that they would support direct shipment, if wine sellers
``clear'' their sales. Clear, in this case, means paying a
commission to wholesalers and retailers for doing nothing. One
start-up, called WineShopper.com, says that by using this system,
it will supply ``thousands of wines'' directly to the consumer or
to a retailer nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Both the wholesalers and the wineries claim the law for their
side. The wholesalers and the states cite the 21st Amendment, which
gives the states the right to regulate the liquor industry within
their borders. The wineries and consumer groups claim that to
single out wine for special controls is discriminatory and a
restraint of trade, violating the Interstate Commerce Clause, the
Sherman Antitrust Act and even the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal district courts in Indiana and Texas have thrown out
laws banning direct shipment _ both decisions are on appeal _ and
similar suits are pending in half a dozen other states. In the
meantime, according to the Wine Institute, 30 states allow some
form of direct shipment. Thirteen of them reciprocate with other
wine-producing states, some demand permits, some limit the amount
of wine a consumer can buy, and 10 allow intrastate shipments only.
Until this legal patchwork is sorted out by the courts, John Dyson,
former New York state commissioner of agriculture and deputy mayor
for finance and economic development under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
seems to have discovered the nearest thing to a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson was enamored of the wines of Williams Selyem, a small
winery in Healdsburg, Calif., which sells all its famous pinot
noirs to an exclusive mail order list. Soon after Williams Selyem
told its customers that that law prevented it from shipping any
more wine to New York, Dyson bought the winery for $9.5 million. He
already owned Millbrook Vineyards in New York state, and as a
vintner was entitled to ship wines from California with impunity.

former New York state commissioner of agriculture and deputy mayor
for finance and economic development under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
seems to have discovered the nearest thing to a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson was enamored of the wines of Williams Selyem, a small
winery in Healdsburg, Calif., which sells all its famous pinot
noirs to an exclusive mail order list. Soon after Williams Selyem
told its customers that that law prevented it from shipping any
more wine to New York, Dyson bought the winery for $9.5 million. He
already owned Millbrook Vineyards in New York state, and as a
vintner was entitled to ship wines from California with impunity.

   WASHINGTON _ It's been years since the Clinton administration
called Iran an ``international outlaw,'' and now it has decided to
stop calling it a ``rogue state.'' People inside and outside the
administration were saying last week that dropping such labels
could open the way for Americans to think more realistically about
such countries. But these labels aren't the only problem with the
way the administration has been thinking about Iran.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of K1 and K2.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the labels applied in some quarters of the American
government to the two leading figures in Iran, who are often
portrayed as the bad guy and the good guy in a winner-take-all
morality play.
</P>
<P>
   K1 is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the dour spiritual leader and most
powerful person in the country. He ritualistically rails against
Israel, rapprochement with the United States and the cultural
invasion of the West. He has the support of Iran's theocratic
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   K2 is Mohammad Khatami, a smiling, charming president who won
election in a landslide three years ago, supported by the younger
generation and women, and has called for a ``dialogue among
civilizations,'' even with the United States. He continues to enjoy
remarkable popular support despite his difficulty in implementing
promises to create a civil society governed by the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are stark differences between the two men _ so
stark that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
congressional committee last February, ``In some ways it looks as
though there are kind of two parallel governments that are going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   But that may miss the most intriguing point about Iranian
politics: It is anything but a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   There is, instead, a remarkable degree of overlapping authority,
producing a system where people who deeply disagree and compete
fiercely for power also cooperate frequently to make the whole
system work.
</P>
<P>
   And what has emerged between K1 and K2 is an arrangement of
sorts; if this were France instead of an Islamic republic, it could
be called cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their different roles under the constitution, different
styles and different constituencies, these two men are both
clerics, and only a few years apart. Both are men of ideas who
claim descent from Mohammed. And both are sworn to preserve the
Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising to anyone with a one-dimensional view of Iran,
there is a lot of evidence that the two leaders know they need each
other if Iran's fluid political system is to function. Khamenei has
power on paper; Khatami has the support of the people. They don't
openly attack each other. And they seem to work well together, even
having hugged each other in public.
</P>
<P>
   Their peculiarly symbiotic relationship has been on display
repeatedly. After Khatami announced in 1998 that he wanted to break
down ``the wall of mistrust'' with the United States through
cultural exchanges, Khamenei disagreed. But while he branded the
United States ``the enemy of the Iranian nation,'' he referred to
Khatami as the ``respected president'' and dismissed their
differences as ``a tone of speech and difference of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after nationwide student demonstrations last summer
deteriorated into the worst unrest since Iran's 1979 revolution,
both men made it clear that their own differences were not part of
that struggle. Khamenei announced, ``I support the respected
president and the job he is doing 100 percent. And Khatami never
challenged the extraordinary powers of the spiritual leader,
however incompatible they may be with his vision of a more
democratic Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The president's loyalty was returned in kind four months ago,
after reformers swept the elections for Iran's Parliament and
conservatives who had been defeated tried to get the results in
Tehran annulled. Khamenei declared the election results valid and
stopped a recount, paving the way for the reformist-dominated
Parliament to be seated last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the cooperation is not surprising, considering how big
a stake both men have in preserving civil order and how passionate
many Iranians have become about their politics. Student leaders had
threatened to mobilize massive street demonstrations if the
election results were annulled. In the last such demonstrations, a
year ago, two dozen leaders of the Revolutionary Guards raised the
specter of a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Order is not the only tie that binds K1 and K2. The Khamenei and
Khatami families have been close, a relationship that was forged
when Khamenei, as a teen-age theology student in Mashad, became a
devoted disciple of Khatami's father, a beloved ayatollah.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei has also discovered that the charm offensive of Khatami
has paid off and is struggling to change his own image. He has
taken to holding small seminars with young people, women, actors
and athletes. He sometimes appears on television strolling in
flower-filled gardens, as soft music plays in the background, even
though he once issued a ruling banning music lessons as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   But showing off his soft side does not mean that Khamenei has
transformed himself into an Islamic democrat. His blunt speech in
April charging that some reformist newspapers had become ``bases of
the enemy'' resulted in the shutdown of 18 reformist publications.
The battle was joined when one of the first acts of the new
Parliament was a call for an urgent review of the country's tough
press law and the reopening of the banned publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is eager to see how far it can push
rapprochement with Iran in this open-ended political game before
President Clinton leaves office, even though Iran has not formally
responded to its offer of an official dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, administration officials said, they were hoping
that a third country would invite Iran to a three-day Community of
Democracies Conference that opens today in Warsaw. After all,
countries that the administration considers less democratic in some
ways than Iran _ Kuwait, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan, for example _ are
expected to attend.

   WASHINGTON _ These days, it seems, only wild-eyed anarchists and
third-world dictators believe capitalism is not the high road to a
better world. Free markets, growth and globalization have been the
economists' mantra since the end of the Cold War. But at the World
Bank, the high church of development economics, a widening schism
over how to fight poverty is sending ripples around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ravi Kanbur, a top Cornell economist and the man hired by the
bank to oversee the writing of its World Development Report,
resigned in anger recently when he was ordered to rewrite his
staff's draft. The report is extremely influential among
economists, and Kanbur's version questioned how well developing
countries adapt to capitalism. In fact, it questioned whether the
West's standard prescription for reform does enough to help the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   The draft poverty report ``was read by some people as hostile to
growth and reform,'' said Nick Stern, the incoming chief economist
at the World Bank, who is charged with rewriting it. ``It's a
matter of tone really _ a question of emphasis _ but it was
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed, and Kanbur's departure shows how the persistence
of extreme poverty in Latin America, the former Soviet states,
Africa and South Asia, right through the roaring 1990s, has led to
skepticism about economic orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in his right mind opposes markets or growth,'' said
Dani Rodrick, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government who counts himself among the critics. ``But there is a
real disagreement about how you get it and sustain it. Should every
country converge on Anglo-American-style capitalism? Or should we
have tolerance to let developing countries experiment with what
works best for them?''
</P>
<P>
   The orthodox camp, often thought to include the Federal Reserve
chairman, Alan Greenspan; Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers; and
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary
Fund, argues that developing countries should follow a reform
formula proven to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe often includes trade liberalization, independent
central banks, more effective and less profligate governments,
privatization of state assets, and investment in health and
education. The World Bank and the IMF are not shy of using their
enormous lending power to push for these ends.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting view diverges in subtle but significant ways. Led
by Joseph E. Stiglitz, an economist who like Kanbur resigned from
the World Bank after clashing with Summers and IMF officials, this
camp _ call them the experimentalists _ believes governments can
set their own path and pace to the market. And they argue that the
World Bank and the IMF should tread lightly when their clients face
a financial crisis like the one that swept from Thailand to Russia
in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   China is their shining star. Beijing has gradually installed
market reforms like rural industry (which employs large numbers of
onetime farm workers) and the stock market, but only over 20 years.
China slowly privatizes state enterprises that employ large numbers
of people, and its currency has remained tightly controlled. Still,
its consistent growth has lifted hundreds of millions out of
poverty over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kanbur's draft report, which had circulated widely on the
Internet, preached a more flexible free-market gospel. ``Overall,
the impact of reform on growth appears to have been positive,
albeit much more modest than anticipated,'' the report says. And
economists don't really understand why nations react differently to
the same medicine. For example Argentina, the report notes, grew
much faster after enacting market reforms than Costa Rica.
Economists don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Trade reform, in particular, has been a mixed blessing, it says,
citing a study that found that tariff reductions benefit upper
income groups but, in nations like Turkey, Mexico and Brazil, hurt
the bottom 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The report scathingly criticizes the way the World Bank and the
IMF responded to the Asian crisis in late 1997, when Korea,
Thailand and Indonesia had to slash their budgets and enact
wrenching market reforms to receive multibillion-dollar bailouts.
Such Draconian crisis management instantly unraveled a generation
of progress against poverty, the report says. In Indonesia, for
example, the school drop-out rates for the poorest group of
children surged from 1.3 percent to 7.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many experimentalists have applauded Malaysia for going its own
way during the Asian crisis. The nation refused IMF aid, slapped
controls on investment flows, and arguably had a shallower
recession and faster recovery than its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The orthodox group, for its part, believes the record shows a
strong correlation between reform and growth, and between growth
and poverty reduction. Uganda and Poland, they say, have
aggressively emulated Western market economies and done more to
help their poor than their less ambitious neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, who says that differences between the two camps are
exaggerated, stresses that both the World Bank and the IMF have
constantly evolving strategies aimed at fighting poverty. Trade
reform, Summers says, tends to benefit the poorest of all _ the
rural poor. That's because reform tends to open new markets for the
cash crops they sell, raising their incomes. He cited Mozambique,
where the World Bank recommended eliminating an export tax on raw
cashew nuts. It's poor farmers, though, not the cashew processors,
who want the tax lifted, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Summers and Stern is that no antipoverty
strategy can succeed without the growth free markets produce.
Growth is ``the most potent weapon against poverty ever invented,''
Summers said, adding that reform must be supplemented by direct
antipoverty initiatives like the World Bank's funding of AIDS
prevention and education programs for African girls.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are still sweating the details, but this much is
clear: Progress against poverty is becoming a litmus test for
global economic leaders.

   When the state of Texas executed Gary Graham last week for the
1981 murder of a man outside a Houston supermarket, death-penalty
opponents pointed a spotlight on Graham's court-appointed trial
lawyer, whom they criticized for failing to mount anything near an
adequate defense. He barely investigated the case, they maintained,
and failed to alert the jury to two witnesses who said Graham was
not the killer and to ballistics evidence that could have
exonerated his client.
</P>
<P>
   While poor legal representation rarely leads to the overturning
of criminal convictions, a recent Columbia University study found
that two out of three death-penalty sentences were reversed on
appeal, and of those about 37 percent were the result of
incompetent lawyering. The study _ which examined appeals in all
capital cases from 1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the
death penalty, to 1995 _ said those reversals were due to
``egregiously incompetent defense lawyers who didn't even look for
and demonstrably missed important evidence that the defendant was
innocent or did not deserve to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Graham's execution, Attorney General Janet Reno said,
``There are too many people in this country who do not have
competent counsel to represent them in capital cases.'' She added,
``Each state should develop a system that can ensure adequate
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to criminal trial lawyers who don't mount
adequate defenses?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to experts, is rarely anything other than
being given more capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Bar Association Center for
Professional Responsibility, the guidelines are clear: Lawyers in
death-penalty cases must present a ``diligent'' and ``competent''
defense, with lawyers who have several years of experience handling
capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Fox, a Cornell University law professor and a former
chairman of the American Bar Association's Committee on Ethics and
Standards, said that such rules are rarely followed and that there
is a ``total disconnect between the standards that lawyers are
supposed to meet in capital cases and what they are actually
allowed to get away with.'' In those rare cases where disciplinary
boards find trial lawyers negligent in capital cases, sanctions
range from fines to disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Amendment not only guarantees criminal defendants the
right to counsel, but the right to effective counsel. Courts have
generally defined effective counsel as a lawyer whose ``material''
legal actions are reasonable and who does not make errors that
would have been likely to change the outcome of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox said many states, including Texas, do not have written
guidelines that outline the amount of experience court-appointed
capital-trial lawyers should have, or the efforts that they should
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often do not present a competent defense, they are often
not diligent, they often do not find witnesses or spend the time
and effort necessary to find evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, according to John Howley, a New York
appeals lawyer who has helped win reprieves in recent years for
three people sentenced to death in Alabama and Virginia, is pay.
</P>
<P>
   Few defense lawyers want to take capital cases, because they are
difficult to prosecute and the defendants are often indigent and
unable to pay their bills. This means judges must make appointments
from a small pool of lawyers, many of whom have poor records and
cannot find enough work on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, for example, court-appointed lawyers make $20 an
hour. In turn, a 1996 study by a group opposed to the death penalty
found that the court-appointed lawyers in Alabama spent an average
of three hours trying the penalty phase, in which judges and jurors
decide between life and death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lawyer, Ronald Mock, spent less than a week
investigating his case and presented little evidence that supported
Graham's assertion that he was not guilty. Mock has contended that
he presented an adequate defense in the case of Graham and the
dozen or so other clients of his who have been sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, like New York, have attempted to deal with the
compensation issue by setting up capital defender agencies that
help shoulder the burden in such cases. The more pressing problem,
some legal experts said, is that incompetent lawyers are often
allowed _ and even encouraged, because they are less troublesome to
judges _ to try additional capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death penalty cases are some of the most difficult cases for a
lawyer to bring to trial, but there is no organized way to assure
adequate assistance of counsel in Texas and most states,'' Howley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox of Cornell said judges and lawyers do not really have to
follow the bar association's standards because the Supreme Court
ruled in 1984 that there was a high burden of proof in an appeal
that centers on inadequate legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the answer for clients who are misrepresented is
to file a civil malpractice suit against their counsel. But that's
little consolation for those whose lives are on the line.

THE SIX-YEAR CURSE THREATENS, BUT THIS TIME MEXICO IS BULLISH
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans call it the six-year curse, that spell
that has come over the economy at the end of every recent
presidential term to make the currency plunge, interest rates soar
and people go broke.
</P>
<P>
   With elections approaching on July 2, Antonio Gonzalez Perez,
46, who has lived through all of Mexico's cyclical economic traumas
since he opened his curtain-making shop a quarter century ago, is
taking no chances. These days the sewing machine at his shop in a
workaday suburb of Mexico City is running late into the night so he
can salt away savings and be ready in case the hex strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jitters of Mexicans like Gonzalez, economists
are surprisingly united that for once the economy is strong enough
to keep any disturbance caused by the handover of power from
becoming disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, they say, is that President Ernesto Zedillo, an
economist, has spent the last three years reshaping the economy and
building armor, as he calls it, around Mexico's finances to shield
them from the kind of meltdown that almost sent the country into
default when he took office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vulnerabilities are not there,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexican economist who has written a book about the recurring crises
at the end of the president's single six-year term. ``There are
risks,'' Heath added, ``but they are within the context of the
normal risks of an economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the enormous concentration of power in the hands of
the almost kingly chief executive has made the hand-over
exceptionally perilous for Mexico. Since the mid-1970s, a
procession of presidents used that power to further their political
aims by overspending and running up the debt _ often behind the
veneer of what looked like a sound economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when it came time for the hand-off to a successor, those
fiscal weaknesses came abruptly to light, shattering investors'
confidence and sending the peso into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, however, has had powerful incentives for wanting to
leave his successor a healthier country than the one he received
from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   After a devaluation just weeks after his inauguration, Zedillo's
first year in office was a nightmare of stricken businesses, lost
jobs and paralyzed government programs. He has said that he knows
only too well that the economic gains Mexicans make while he is
president can be wiped out in a flash after he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' fate also served as a cautionary example. Mexicans were
so outraged by the mess he left, he had to leave the country in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's determination to achieve a smooth finish will be just
as great if an opposition candidate wins the presidency, as could
happen for the first time in a Mexican election. A president who is
not from Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
controlled Mexico for seven decades, would be even more inclined to
blame his predecessor for any economic shocks in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A total overhaul'' is how Abel Beltran del Rio, president of
the consulting firm Ciemex-Wefa, describes Zedillo's changes. ``The
edifice was rebuilt so that it can get through the earthquakes
without the crumbling as it did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in the final months under Salinas, Mexico had
short-term debts of $40 billion and foreign reserves of $12
billion. Today Mexico has $32 billion in reserves and its
short-term debt is insignificant. Salinas kept the reserves under
wraps most of the time. Zedillo opened things up, so that the vital
economic indicators are on view every day. Under Salinas the peso
traded within fixed limits. Now the peso floats with the market, so
the government faces a less severe challenge in spending its
reserves to defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is on track to meet his goal of a budget deficit this
year of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Reforms he
promoted have given the central bank authorities leverage to say no
to government officials who want to fiddle with the money supply.
As a result, Mexico's stubborn inflation has been slowly sliding
down toward the official target of under 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreigners
will probably make more than $10 billion in long-lasting
investments in factories and businesses this year. The economy
steamed forward by 7.9 percent in the first quarter, making some
analysts fret that it was actually expanding too fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few gray spots on the picture. The $100 billion bank
bailout remains a hot political issue and could take unexpected
turns. No one is quite sure how Mexico, now fastened at the hip to
the U.S. economy, will fare in a slowdown in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has not been above stepping up federal spending to help
the campaign of Francisco Labastida Ochoa, his party's presidential
candidate. Public outlays jumped by 15.4 percent in the first
quarter, as the federal government laid hand on money budgeted for
the last half of the year and dipped into the windfall from soaring
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``With oil prices running so high, Mexico should be running a
surplus, and it's not,'' said Walter Molano, head of research at
BCP Securities. ``They're spending money based on a volatile
revenue source when they should be saving for the time when prices
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real surprise came from the elections. Polls show that
Labastida is tied with Vicente Fox Quesada, a right-of-center
opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party has begun a campaign to sway voters, and the
opposition is warning that the election may not be clean. Protests
may well follow the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring has already created some turbulence in the economy.
On June 8, when Labastida accused Fox of planning to create
``chaos'' if the opposition candidate lost, the peso dipped from
9.5 to the dollar to over 10. It has since recovered slightly but
continues to waver.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the curtain-maker, sees other signs of uneasiness. His
suppliers are telling him that the imported toile he uses is out of
stock. ``It's speculation,'' he said. ``They're waiting to sell
until after the election because they know the price is going up.''
Nonetheless, seasoned Mexico watchers remain sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Rubio, the head of Cidac, a political economics research
institution, said, ``This time Mexico could have a political crisis
without an economic one.''

DIM ECHOES OF THE MONKEY TRIAL IN A LOUISIANA PARISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

details and prices, phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44).).

<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that student-led prayers at
high school football games are unconstitutional. Largely
overshadowed by the decision was another important case concerning
separation of church and state in an educational setting. By a 6-3
vote, the high court let stand a lower court ruling in Tangipahoa
Parish Board of Education vs. Freiler, which barred a Louisiana
school board from requiring that the Darwinian theory of evolution
only be taught with a disclaimer mentioning the biblical story of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came just weeks before the 75th anniversary of the
Tennessee ``Monkey Trial,'' in which John T. Scopes, a high school
teacher, was charged with violating the state's anti-evolution law.
That trial, which pitted the orator William Jennings Bryan against
the celebrated lawyer Clarence Darrow, has been ingrained in the
popular imagination as the archetypal clash of scientific
enlightenment and old-time religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tangipahoa vs. Freiler hasn't captured the public's
attention or inspired the high drama of ``Inherit the Wind,'' it
offers a fresh look at the continuing struggle over the role of
religion in the classroom. Excerpts from the case documents and
reactions to the decision follow. _THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The original disclaimer, adopted by the school board on April
19, 1994, read in part as follows and was meant to be quoted by the
teacher before any classroom study of evolution: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is hereby recognized by the Tangipahoa Parish Board of
Education, that the lesson to be presented, regarding the origin of
life and matter, is known as the Scientific Theory of Evolution and
should be presented to inform students of the scientific concept
and not intended to influence or dissuade he Biblical version of
Creation or any other concept.
</P>
<P>
   It is further recognized by the Board of Education that it is
the basic right and privilege of each student to form his/her own
opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very
important matter of the origin of life and matter. Students are
urged to exercise critical thinking and gather all information
possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A transcript of the April 19 meeting reveals the major
objections that Herb Freiler, the father of a student and a future
plaintiff in the case, raised to the resolution:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, we have, among other beliefs _ let's see, I've jotted
down a few _ we have snake handling, we have speaking in tongues,
faith healing, some people rolling in the aisles, we have the
spectacle of Jimmy Swaggart, oh, Jim and Tammy, Oral Roberts, who
speaks in _ in physical terms of what the Lord should give you.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the tremendous amusement value of these things . . .
the point of all this is that America was made and founded
basically on freedom and tolerance _ that is, to live and let live,
respect for other people's opinions. What you are doing . . is to
just foist [your) own fundamentalist Christian viewpoint on the
citizens of this parish at great embarrassment to many of us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The board member who originally proposed the disclaimer, E.F.
Bailey, had this response:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If it were a government class, a history class at school, and
the teacher got up and was going to talk about various forms of
government . . . and he or she talked about the dictatorial forms
of government and didn't mention democracy, and then went on to
another subject, wouldn't people stop and say, ``Hey, wait, didn't
you forget democracy? Don't we live in a democracy? You forgot
about that.'' . . . And isn't that _ is that what we're doing now?
Isn't it so that a large percentage, something in the [neighborhood
of) 90 percent of our youngsters, are taught, from infancy on up,
that God created all life and matter? . . . Here comes their first
science class, and . . . somebody comes and tells them that they
are a mere accident, that they're a product . . . of the Big Bang
theory and that that's why they are here, and the kid is thinking
and saying: ``Wait a minute. This doesn't coincide with what my
parents taught me. This is not what I learned in Sunday school.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Freiler and two other plaintiffs filed suit. Among those who
submitted friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the parish board
were the Christian Legal Society and the Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations of America. In a joint filing, they argued, among
other things, that:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists have challenged on scientific grounds the
conjunction of evolution and the general materialistic
presuppositions of 19th-century philosophy . . . and the more
specific view that there is no purposeful cause for the universe. .
. . Sir John Polkinghorne, a distinguished astrophysicist who
served until recently as president of Queen's College of Cambridge
University, notes that all serious physicists of this century agree
that a satisfactory account of the universe must include two sets
of seemingly contrary laws: chance and necessity, gravity and
electromagnetism. But the profound question that no scientific
account can satisfactorily answer is, ``Why is this so?'' For an
answer to the question ``Why?'' Polkinghorne insists, we are driven
by physics beyond physics to metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In a countering brief, the National Center for Science
Education offered this perspective:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, like the theories of heliocentrism and gravitation,
is considered ``factual'' even if specific details remain to be
worked out. It is a core idea of science that underpins all present
study of plant and animal biology, and there is no genuine dispute
in the scientific community that it occurs. . . . The reason that
the scientific literature does not define evolution as a theory of
metaphysics is that science deals with questions of how things
occur, not ``why'' they occur.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In 1997, a district court in Louisiana found the disclaimer to
be unconstitutional: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While encouraging students to maintain their belief in the
Bible, or in God, may be a noble aim, it cannot be one in which the
public schools participate, no matter how important this goal may
be to its supporters. . . .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last year, the decision was upheld on appeal. Earlier this
year, in a petition to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the school
board took issue with the lower courts' reasoning:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the parish schools, evolution is taught; the ``Biblical
version of creation'' is not! How can the effect of the disclaimer
be to endorse or advance a concept that is merely mentioned, using
only four words, when evolution is the only concept for the origin
of life and matter that is included in the curriculum, the only one
that will be explained and discussed in any lesson following the
disclaimer's being read?
</P>
<P>
   Understood and considered in the context in which it is intended
to be used, the disclaimer expresses tolerance for the views of all
students.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In his dissent to last week's Supreme Court decision to let the
lower court rulings stand, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Epperson vs. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), we invalidated a
statute that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools;
in Edwards vs. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), we invalidated a
statute that required the teaching of creationism whenever
evolution was also taught; today we permit a Court of Appeals to
push the much beloved secular legend of the Monkey Trial one step
further. We stand by in silence while a deeply divided Fifth
Circuit bars a school district from even suggesting to students
that other theories besides evolution _ including, but not limited
to, the Biblical theory of creation _ are worthy of their
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The following day, an editorial in a local newspaper, The
Hammond Daily Star, expressed relief that the matter had been

DIM ECHOES OF THE MONKEY TRIAL IN A LOUISIANA PARISH

<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that student-led prayers at
high school football games are unconstitutional. Largely
overshadowed by the decision was another important case concerning
separation of church and state in an educational setting. By a 6-3
vote, the high court let stand a lower court ruling in Tangipahoa
Parish Board of Education vs. Freiler, which barred a Louisiana
school board from requiring that the Darwinian theory of evolution
only be taught with a disclaimer mentioning the biblical story of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came just weeks before the 75th anniversary of the
Tennessee ``Monkey Trial,'' in which John T. Scopes, a high school
teacher, was charged with violating the state's anti-evolution law.
That trial, which pitted the orator William Jennings Bryan against
the celebrated lawyer Clarence Darrow, has been ingrained in the
popular imagination as the archetypal clash of scientific
enlightenment and old-time religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tangipahoa vs. Freiler hasn't captured the public's
attention or inspired the high drama of ``Inherit the Wind,'' it
offers a fresh look at the continuing struggle over the role of
religion in the classroom. Excerpts from the case documents and
reactions to the decision follow. _THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The original disclaimer, adopted by the school board on April
19, 1994, read in part as follows and was meant to be quoted by the
teacher before any classroom study of evolution: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is hereby recognized by the Tangipahoa Parish Board of
Education, that the lesson to be presented, regarding the origin of
life and matter, is known as the Scientific Theory of Evolution and
should be presented to inform students of the scientific concept
and not intended to influence or dissuade he Biblical version of
Creation or any other concept.
</P>
<P>
   It is further recognized by the Board of Education that it is
the basic right and privilege of each student to form his/her own
opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very
important matter of the origin of life and matter. Students are
urged to exercise critical thinking and gather all information
possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A transcript of the April 19 meeting reveals the major
objections that Herb Freiler, the father of a student and a future
plaintiff in the case, raised to the resolution:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, we have, among other beliefs _ let's see, I've jotted
down a few _ we have snake handling, we have speaking in tongues,
faith healing, some people rolling in the aisles, we have the
spectacle of Jimmy Swaggart, oh, Jim and Tammy, Oral Roberts, who
speaks in _ in physical terms of what the Lord should give you.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the tremendous amusement value of these things . . .
the point of all this is that America was made and founded
basically on freedom and tolerance _ that is, to live and let live,
respect for other people's opinions. What you are doing . . is to
just foist [your) own fundamentalist Christian viewpoint on the
citizens of this parish at great embarrassment to many of us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The board member who originally proposed the disclaimer, E.F.
Bailey, had this response:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If it were a government class, a history class at school, and
the teacher got up and was going to talk about various forms of
government . . . and he or she talked about the dictatorial forms
of government and didn't mention democracy, and then went on to
another subject, wouldn't people stop and say, ``Hey, wait, didn't
you forget democracy? Don't we live in a democracy? You forgot
about that.'' . . . And isn't that _ is that what we're doing now?
Isn't it so that a large percentage, something in the [neighborhood
of) 90 percent of our youngsters, are taught, from infancy on up,
that God created all life and matter? . . . Here comes their first
science class, and . . . somebody comes and tells them that they
are a mere accident, that they're a product . . . of the Big Bang
theory and that that's why they are here, and the kid is thinking
and saying: ``Wait a minute. This doesn't coincide with what my
parents taught me. This is not what I learned in Sunday school.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Freiler and two other plaintiffs filed suit. Among those who
submitted friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the parish board
were the Christian Legal Society and the Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations of America. In a joint filing, they argued, among
other things, that:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists have challenged on scientific grounds the
conjunction of evolution and the general materialistic
presuppositions of 19th-century philosophy . . . and the more
specific view that there is no purposeful cause for the universe. .
. . Sir John Polkinghorne, a distinguished astrophysicist who
served until recently as president of Queen's College of Cambridge
University, notes that all serious physicists of this century agree
that a satisfactory account of the universe must include two sets
of seemingly contrary laws: chance and necessity, gravity and
electromagnetism. But the profound question that no scientific
account can satisfactorily answer is, ``Why is this so?'' For an
answer to the question ``Why?'' Polkinghorne insists, we are driven
by physics beyond physics to metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In a countering brief, the National Center for Science
Education offered this perspective:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, like the theories of heliocentrism and gravitation,
is considered ``factual'' even if specific details remain to be
worked out. It is a core idea of science that underpins all present
study of plant and animal biology, and there is no genuine dispute
in the scientific community that it occurs. . . . The reason that
the scientific literature does not define evolution as a theory of
metaphysics is that science deals with questions of how things
occur, not ``why'' they occur.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In 1997, a district court in Louisiana found the disclaimer to
be unconstitutional: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While encouraging students to maintain their belief in the
Bible, or in God, may be a noble aim, it cannot be one in which the
public schools participate, no matter how important this goal may
be to its supporters. . . .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last year, the decision was upheld on appeal. Earlier this
year, in a petition to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the school
board took issue with the lower courts' reasoning:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the parish schools, evolution is taught; the ``Biblical
version of creation'' is not! How can the effect of the disclaimer
be to endorse or advance a concept that is merely mentioned, using
only four words, when evolution is the only concept for the origin
of life and matter that is included in the curriculum, the only one
that will be explained and discussed in any lesson following the
disclaimer's being read?
</P>
<P>
   Understood and considered in the context in which it is intended
to be used, the disclaimer expresses tolerance for the views of all
students.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In his dissent to last week's Supreme Court decision to let the
lower court rulings stand, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Epperson vs. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), we invalidated a
statute that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools;
in Edwards vs. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), we invalidated a
statute that required the teaching of creationism whenever
evolution was also taught; today we permit a Court of Appeals to
push the much beloved secular legend of the Monkey Trial one step
further. We stand by in silence while a deeply divided Fifth
Circuit bars a school district from even suggesting to students
that other theories besides evolution _ including, but not limited
to, the Biblical theory of creation _ are worthy of their
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The following day, an editorial in a local newspaper, The
Hammond Daily Star, expressed relief that the matter had been
resolved:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   God has not been forced out of the schools. Neither the Supreme
Court nor any other governmental entity is so powerful that it can
keep God outside any walls or prevent people from praying.
Students, teachers and anyone else at school can and still do pray,
read the Bible, and exercise their religious beliefs as long as
they don't interfere or push their views on anyone else and as long
as they are not disruptive to classes and school activities. . . .

<P>
   Let the teachers teach. Let the students learn.

   The School Board has more urgent issues to tackle _ do we have
to name them? _ attracting and keeping qualified teachers,

facilities.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Al Gore's college transcript found its way
into the press recently, it seemed destined to ignite a firestorm.
Now the world knew: The prep school boy who applied only to
Harvard, the wonky vice president, the learned
president-in-waiting, had actually been a C student for a time at
Harvard. He even got a D in biology.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody in Gore's camp acted terribly agitated by the
revelations. And before long, the whispers started: Could the
campaign itself have leaked the transcript?
</P>
<P>
   The campaign denies the accusation, but it's a peculiarly
American phenomenon that a candidate might advertise his academic
stumbles. In fact, just as a recurring theme in this presidential
race has been whether Gov. George W. Bush has the intellect to be a
successful president, so some Gore advisers worry that their
candidate may come off, as President Harry Truman would put it, as
too much of ``a smarty.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of politicians of recent vintage _ from Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota to Ronald Reagan to Ross Perot _ have been
known more for their street smarts or down-to-earth personalities
than their intellectual curiosity. It was no accident that during
the Republican primaries, Sen. John McCain reminded crowds that he
graduated at the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among some scholars, too, that smarties make
lousy presidents. Most historians agree that the last president who
was an intellectual was Woodrow Wilson, and some think he was too
much of a thinker to turn the wheels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-intellectualism is one of the more venerable traits of
American voters. It's not that they don't respect smart
politicians; it's that they do not always respect politicians who
act smart. Instead, voters trust those who seem more like
themselves, even if those politicians are masking their
intelligence to better appeal to common folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now expect a much more personable person in the White
House,'' said Fred Greenstein, a professor of history at Princeton
University. ``We are much more open to a normal, laid-back,
colloquial style. George Washington was a figure who never smiled,
and by modern standards would make Al Gore look like the life of
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for many voters, it seems, is not whether a leader
can recite from the classics or is a whiz at math but whether he or
she seems sober-minded and possessed of enough common sense to make
sound decisions and relate easily to people.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Gore has found that his command of policy,
and his willingness to display it, can be as much a political
liability as an asset. Bush still must persuade voters that he has
a sufficient grasp of policy _ or, to put it bluntly, that he is
not a dumbbell _ but polls show he is drawing higher and higher
marks for leadership. That leaves Gore with the arguably tougher
job of proving that he is not a condescending smarty-pants.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush seems to have had success convincing Americans
that you don't have to like reading books to be intelligent. An ABC
News/Washington Post poll released this weekend found that 37
percent of the public thinks Gore is more intelligent, while a
statistically indistinguishable 34 percent give the nod to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the reigning _ and one of the last
_ intellectuals in Congress, managed to get elected despite his
intellectualism because he played at being the absent-minded
professor. His campaign also reminded voters that he grew up an
immigrant's son in Hell's Kitchen and worked as a longshoreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long tradition, and it's appropriate to a democracy,
of politicians saying, `I'm just like you,''' Moynihan said. ``Go
down the list of senators whose names are Dick, Tom, Al, Joe and
not their Christian names, as we used to say. I would have run as
Pat Moynihan except we missed the filing day in New York City and
they put down my proper name. But I'm happy that we didn't have
Frank Roosevelt instead of Franklin D.''
</P>
<P>
   America didn't exactly start out this way. The founding fathers
were much in the British mode of gentlemen of means and leisure,
using both to get a classical education. Not only did they feel it
unnecessary to pander to voters, they felt it far too demeaning to
try.
</P>
<P>
   As America grew more insistently democratic, and populist, the
ruling campaign model began to change as well. And with the
election of 1828, Andrew Jackson disabused voters entirely of the
notion that the president should be an aristocrat from Tidewater
Virginia or a Harvard graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was regarded as a boor by the Brahmins of Boston, who
were apoplectic when Harvard bestowed an honorary degree on him.
John Quincy Adams, an overseer of the school, wrote that it was a
disgrace to confer honors upon ``a barbarian who could not write a
sentence of grammar and hardly could spell his own name.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, Harry Truman was perhaps the president who
best combined sagacity and a genuine common touch. David
McCullough, the Truman biographer, said: ``He was one of the few
presidents who went to the National Symphony fairly often _ and
certainly not for a photo opportunity. If they were playing Mozart
or Chopin, he would often take the score with him.''
</P>
<P>
   His instincts were infinitely sharper than those of Adlai
Stevenson, whose reading and speaking habits nearly caused American
intellectuals to swoon with joy at the thought of his occupying the
Oval Office. He never did, of course, and one reason may be that he
lacked Truman's everyday appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that during the 1952 presidential campaign, a
woman rushed up to Stevenson (who, famously, was derided by Dwight
Eisenhower's loyalists as an ``egghead'') after one of his
speeches. `` Stevenson,'' she said. ``You have captured the vote of
every thinking person in America!'' Stevenson was not heartened.
``Ma'am,'' he replied. ``We need a majority!'' How charming _ and
how haughty.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, could it be mere coincidence that Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who liked to compare Clinton's behavior in office to the
forces that led the Roman republic to ruin, has been replaced by a
former high school wrestling coach? Or that Gov. Mario Cuomo, who
likes to invoke Teilhard de Chardin (the paleontologist and
philosopher), was ousted by the unassuming Gov. George Pataki, who
is more inclined to chat passionately about the Rolling Stones than
his Yale credentials?
</P>
<P>
   These politicians may also be tapping into American society's
increasing glorification of, well, stupidity. People do not get
much credit these days for being brainy. The British complain that
the questions on the television hit ``Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire'' in the United States are far easier than those of the
program's English counterpart. Bart Simpson, one of the most
popular television characters, celebrates being an underachiever _
``and proud of it, man!''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Gore spent a day last week with Ventura _ his
third visit with the governor in four months. This is a former
professional wrestler _ known as the Body _ who had a television
commercial in his 1998 race that featured him assuming the position
of Rodin's ``Thinker,'' clad only in a pair of shorts.
</P>
<P>
   What then, would be the ideal blend of brains and Bubba for a
president? Even one intellectual was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have figured out that formulation yet,''
Moynihan said. ``Wait until the DNA sequencing is done.''  &QL;

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ After three decades of
conflict, a new era of peace and political stability is taking root
here in one of the world's most tormented nations. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-ECON (Seoul, South Korea) _ With the easing of economic
sanctions against North Korea by the Clinton administration last
week, U.S. corporations based here are beginning to assess business
opportunities in a country that has been out of bounds for five
decades. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KENYA-CRISES (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Nearly three quarters of Kenyans
will be affected in one way or another by the severe drought that
is choking the region, the government estimates. The Tana River,
where the nation's five hydroelectric dams are located, is low. So
the government has imposed strict power rationing: Factories get
power every other day. Water rationing starts soon. But even before
the dry weather, the economy was strangling from years of
corruption and poor management. The phones and roads are barely
usable. Students are rioting. There is turmoil among the coffee and
tea growers. Tourists, afraid of runaway crime, are staying away.
Through it all, President Daniel arap Moi and his government have
declined to accept any blame, though Kenya is so corrupt that the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund cut off aid three years
ago. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   KOREAN-WAR-ANNIVERSARY (Seoul, South Korea) _ The South Korean
government's decision to tone down the war anniversary celebrations
has brought angry denouncements from veterans, and it has also
touched off a heated national debate over the significance of the
Korean War and just how far the South should go to appease the
North. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-U.S. (Bogota, Colombia) _ Minister of Defense Luis
Fernando Ramirez hails it as ``a new beginning.'' But Washington's
decision to escalate its involvement in the Colombian government's
struggle against drugs and the armed groups that increasingly
control their production also means the United States will now be
facing new risks here as it begins working closely with some new
faces. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ECON (Mexico City) _ Mexicans call it the six-year curse,
that spell that has come over the economy at the end of every
recent presidential term to make the currency plunge, interest
rates soar and people go broke. But despite the jitters, economists
are surprisingly united that for once the economy is strong enough
to keep any disturbance caused by the handover of power from
becoming disaster. The reason, they say, is that President Ernesto
Zedillo, an economist himself, has spent the last three years
reshaping the economy and building armor, as he calls it, around
Mexico's finances to shield them from the kind of meltdown that
almost sent the country into default when he took office in 1994.
By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   MONACO-MONEY-LAUNDERING (Paris) _ In a scathing 400-page report,
the French parliament said that the tiny principality of Monaco _ a
famous refuge for wealthy tax dodgers _ was also an ideal place to
launder money. It accused Monaco of having deliberately put in
place lax banking laws _ including a guarantee of anonymity _ to
attract wealthy depositors no matter who they were. By Suzanne
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE-TRAFFICKING (United Nations) _ Trafficking in people is
now the fastest-growing business of organized crime, and it is
being run by new, barely understood networks that have sidelined
traditional criminal syndicates, the top anti-crime official at the
United Nations said last week. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-ELECTION (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ The ruling party faces
its toughest challenge in 20 years since independence in
parliamentary elections after a campaign in which President Robert
Mugabe has been accused of fomenting political violence. By Henri
E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PRICES (Undated) _ Internet retailers are in big
trouble. Stock prices have collapsed, venture capital has dried up
and the public markets have closed their doors to those who cannot
demonstrate how they will be profitable soon. To please testy
investors, dot.coms are trying numerous tactics _ including
employee layoffs, rethinking their entire business and raising
advertising and association fees. But because many Internet product
prices were once set beneath cost to lure new customers, the
easiest and most obvious step has been to bring those prices back
to the real world. By Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-KIDS (Maplewood, N.J.) _ It happens everywhere, in the
confusions of adolescence and the yearning for identity, when the
most important thing in life is choosing a group and fitting in:
Black children and white children move into separate worlds.
Friendships ebb and end. But what is striking is that it happens
even here. In a nation of segregated schools, the South
Orange-Maplewood district is extraordinarily mixed. This is the
kind of place where people _ black and white _ talk a lot about the
virtues of diversity, where hundreds will turn out to discuss the
book ``Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the
Cafeteria?'' But even here, as if pulled by internal magnets, black
and white children begin to separate at sixth grade. These are
children who walked to school together, learned to read together,
slept over at each other's houses. But despite all the personal
history, all the community good will, race divides them as they
grow up. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   LA-GOVERNOR (Baton Rouge, La.) _ For a few high-flying months in
his first term, Mike Foster might have been the most popular
governor in America, riding a brief economic boom and his
Harley-Davidson Road King to unheard-of approval ratings in the
range of 70 percent to 80 percent. But the good years never seem to
last long in Louisiana. And when this year's state budget could not
be balanced without a sales tax increase on food, Mike Foster fell
back to earth, hard. And it is unclear whether the economy will
allow him to ascend again in the last three years of his second
term. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   SANFRAN-DYING-ALONE (San Francisco) _ In San Francisco, more
people are dying alone, with no one to arrange their funerals,
settle their estates or mourn their passing. So far this year, 275
people in the city have died this way, said city officials,
compared with about 300 a year for the last decade. By Evelyn
Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-ASBESTOS (Cambridge, Mass.) _ The Environmental Protection
Agency is investigating whether the contamination of a children's
athletic field in a bustling neighborhood on the outskirts of this
city poses an immediate health risk. By Adrianne Appel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-VOTERS (Denver) _ For many Hispanic Americans,
especially those eager to vote in this year's presidential
election, Vice President Al Gore and his probable Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, have turned the campaign
into a virtual love-fest. Describing themselves as the ``soccer
moms'' of the 2000 elections, Hispanic voters say they have never
been courted so aggressively by presidential candidates, giving
Hispanics electoral leverage they never had before. The amorous
turn, a more profound difference in Republican strategy than in
Democratic, evolves directly from demographic shifts: Hispanics are
now the fastest-growing bloc of ethnic voters. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Farmers Get Help, and Back the
Helper; Bush Not so Welcome in Battleground State; Gas-Tax
Suspension Arouses Skepticism; Fearless McCain Attacks Finance Law.
By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-LOBBIES (Washington) _ The struggle over prescription drug
benefits for the elderly, now center stage in the House, is not
simply between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and
conservatives. It has also driven a wedge between two of the
biggest, most influential lobbies in Washington: the Health
Insurance Association of America and the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Washington) _ President Clinton announced a
major change in his proposal for Medicare drug benefits Saturday,
making it much more generous to millions of elderly people and much
more costly to the federal government. The new proposal came four
days before the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a
Republican proposal to offer drug benefits, through private
insurance companies, to all 39 million people on Medicare. By
Robert Pear.

   Earlier this month, a Swiss journalist was fired by a major
German newspaper when it was revealed that he fabricated intimate
interviews with Hollywood celebrities like Sharon Stone and Brad
Pitt. The journalist defended his work as ``conceptual art.''
</P>
<P>
   I first see (celebrity's name) getting out of a (foreign
convertible) at the (Mondrian/Four Seasons/Shutters). (He/she) is
(taller/shorter) than I had imagined, though, in fact, far more
(handsome/beautiful). (He/She) is dressed casually in (linen pants
and T-shirt/jeans and tube-top/sarong and baseball cap backward).
The doorman is trying too hard not to notice, but it is especially
difficult, as (the top four buttons of her blouse are undone/his
fly is down).
</P>
<P>
   I had spoken by phone with (his/her) agent and had suggested
that New York would be a perfect meeting place for our interview,
as (he/she) would be in town for a (premiere/awards dinner/court
appearance). Unfortunately, we were disconnected before we were
able to make firm plans. I flew to the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   You must be (not your name but close), (he/she) says with a
(grin/scowl) as we walk through the lobby to the patio. It's (your
name), actually, I say, but (he/she) doesn't seem to hear as
(he/she) is (making a call on a cellphone/ordering a drink).
</P>
<P>
   We are seated in a corner of the patio and only now does the
star of the biggest box-office weekend in almost (number of weeks)
remove (his/her) sunglasses, only to reveal (an eye patch/a black
eye/another pair of sunglasses).
</P>
<P>
   I'm hesitant to mention (the surgery/the infamous fight/how
ridiculous he/she looks) but feel compelled to do so. (What's the
prognosis?/Are the nuns pressing charges?/Do you realize how silly
you look?).
</P>
<P>
   (He/she) pauses and looks away, out over the Hollywood Hills. It
is a look eerily reminiscent of (his/her) work in (insert film or
TV show).
</P>
<P>
   (He/she) begins speaking while still gazing at the hills. ``Just
before (he/she) died, my (dad/mom/grandmother) told me a story
about what's really important in life: (friends/love/jam).''
(He/She) pauses. ``(He/She) died in my (arms/apartment/wood
chipper).''
</P>
<P>
   (He/She) turns suddenly to the waiter, who happens to be walking
by and says (I said no croutons! Are you deaf as well as
stupid?/The salmon is lovely, thank you).
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard of the (temper/unfailing politeness), of the (flashes
of anger/moments of near beatific kindness). (Abruptly/With
monk-like grace), (he/she) stands and (throws a chair/quietly hands
the maitre d' a $1,000 bill).
</P>
<P>
   (He/She) suggests a drive.
</P>
<P>
   We meander through the city and find ourselves on the Pacific
Coast highway heading north, the azure ocean sparkling on our left.
(He/She) is quiet for a time, then hits the stereo power button.
Dean Martin's ``You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You'' comes
crooning out. ``Is that you?'' I ask, knowing that I'm (skating on
thin ice/on safe ground) as a result of the recent
(breakup/marriage to) a certain (blonde/brunette) (hunk/beauty) and
star of the fantastically successful (sitcom/movie).
</P>
<P>
   (He/She) pauses and takes a deep drag off a cigarette. I'd heard
a rumor that (he/she)) just (started/quit). ``No,'' (he/she) says.
``It's Dean Martin.'' I, of course, sense the sarcasm immediately.
</P>
<P>
   I ask what it's like to be (23/27/31/34/42) and (suddenly/back
on top again and) commanding ($12 million/$17 million/$20 million)
a film, building a house in (Montana/Peru), (engaged/newly single),
and have a new film coming out. ``Great,'' comes the reply. Again,
the cagey depths.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I get serious for a moment?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' (he/she) replies. The wind and the stereo are making
it difficult to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumors,'' I shout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumors?''(he/she) screams back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. Ru-mors.'' (He/She) turns the volume down. ``I've
talked with people _ directors you've worked with, grips, gaffers,
craft services people _ and they all say the same thing: that
you're (a delight to work with/the Saddam Hussein of acting).''
</P>
<P>
   We turn (right/left) off the highway, (down/up) a long, winding
dirt road toward the (ocean/mountains). (He/She) is quiet for a
time, thinking. Then, ``Did you say something?'' I get it.
</P>
<P>
   We arrive at (his/a producer friend's/a director friend's)
(ranch/beach house), and sit for a moment in the car. The sun is
fading in the distance. The only sound is the (surf/cicadas).
</P>
<P>
   ``My guru once told my personal trainer something very
interesting. He said, `There is truth in all things. Unless there
isn't.'''
</P>
<P>
   True enough.

LIVING BETTER (AND RISKIER) ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement
only. Asian and European points: Call Karl Horwitz in Paris for
details and prices, phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44).). 
 By AMY HARMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the recent string of electronic events: A virus that
becomes known as the love bug causes nearly $1 billion worth of
damages as it ravages computer systems across the world. The Office
of National Drug Control Policy admits that it may have violated
federal privacy guidelines by implanting software on the computers
of its Web site visitors that tracks their travels across the
Internet. Hackers seize control of Nike's corporate Web site to
announce that ``global justice is coming _ prepare now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the threats to privacy and security on the Internet
thrust their way into the public consciousness, Congress
overwhelmingly passes a bill that aims to turbo-charge electronic
commerce by giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper
signatures _ without many provisions for security. Americans
continue to transfer their personal, political, financial and even
medical lives online, all the while trading horror stories about
identity theft and credit card scams.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a disconnect here?
</P>
<P>
   If so, it may be because people simply can't stop themselves
from using the Internet, spooked though they may be. They do not
fight the nearly universal tendency to equate technology with
progress. And at a time when the Internet is widely believed to be
driving the buoyant economy, the financial incentives to continue
on the current trajectory are huge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is simpler than that: the risk seems worth it. So
seductive is the technology that even its most strident critics
cannot imagine voluntarily going without e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, those who are most outspoken about the privacy
and security risks are no longer modern-day Luddites but computer
scientists _ some of them the architects of the global computer
network, which they have come to believe is insufficient to meet
the demands being placed on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If situation A is not working right, does it make sense to do
A times 10 using the same technology?'' asked Lauren Weinstein, a
veteran Internet engineer and co-founder of a group called People
for Internet Responsibility, which has issued a technical critique
of the electronic signature bill. ``That doesn't make any sense to
me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As reports of electronic breaches and privacy lapses roll in
with increasing frequency, it has become almost an article of faith
among computer security experts that the radical, global commitment
to research and installing safeguards that could make the Internet
more secure will not happen until a major catastrophe strikes. But
there is little doubt among them that such an effort will be made
some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net's going to go fumbling along until there's a massive
intrusion,'' said Dave Farber, an Internet pioneer and chief
technologist for the Federal Communications Commission. ``Then
everything will hit the fan. Congress is going to go ballistic, and
we're going to panic our way into doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, without much hope, ``It would be much nicer to start
talking about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The technological roots of the Internet's vulnerability are well
known. Conceived by the Defense Department as a decentralized
communications system that would continue to function even if
chunks of it were destroyed, the Internet is by its nature open and
interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet was built in an age when we all knew each other,
we all trusted each other, we were talking about where to have
dinner and what silver futures to buy,'' said Farber, speaking of
the scientists who built it. ``Now we've moved it into an
environment where the country counts on it. And it's very hard to
retrofit security.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with a network that is expanding so rapidly. Even as
software designers and security experts scramble to fix problems
that they know about, dozens of new software applications are
released and hundreds of thousands of new users log on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for things to go wrong is always increasing,''
said Robert Morris, an assistant professor of computer science at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is perhaps better
known as the creator of the first Internet worm, which crippled the
network in 1988. ``More people are also going after things. But
it's not clear who's going to win, the people who write software
with bugs or the people trying to fix the bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many technologists believe that the Internet could be made
considerably more secure. Cars, they note, used to be a lot less
safe than they are now. That was before a combination of consumer
pressure, governmental regulation and manufacturers' designs came
up with seat belts and air bags and anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the network extensively,'' said Peter Neumann, a
computer security expert with SRI International. ``I also know it
can be brought down by anybody, anywhere in the world, in about 30
minutes. One of the things we need to do is educate the populace,
so that they can take precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Risk assessment has been a big topic lately on the online
discussion groups at eBay, the Internet auction site that has
suffered a spate of high-profile fraud attempts. Sandi Brady, 49,
of Franklin, N.J., echoed a widely held view: ``I struggle a little
bit with using my credit card on the Internet,'' she said. ``But
for every bad transaction, there's so many more good transactions.
I use common sense, I use caution, and that's no different than the
caution you take in life, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet proponents argue that the vulnerabilities of the
Internet are not any greater than those of the physical world _
just different. For instance, Paul Leuhr, who supervises the
Federal Trade Commission's Internet fraud program, calls consumers'
fears that someone will seize their credit card numbers as they
travel across the network a ``gross misperception.'' Although
credit card fraud on the Internet is thought to be slightly higher
than in real-world transactions, and the speed and reach of the
network can make its consequences far more serious, Leuhr said,
``almost always, fraud springs from the natural flaws in human
behavior,'' such as writing down passwords or leaving credit card
receipts in the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   But a relatively new realm of human behavior now encompasses
making policy and personal decisions about how to handle the
technology that is becoming so closely woven into everyday life.
And critics say greater attention to the vulnerabilities of the
computer network is an important part of that.
</P>
<P>
   A law that promises to eliminate costly paperwork and to speed
transactions like purchasing home mortgages or paying taxes sounds
great, for instance. But with no standards for ensuring the
security of such documents, it could merely create a lot of
confusion and litigation. Under the current law, it seems that a
simple e-mail signature could qualify as binding. What happens when
one party says a contract is changed after it is signed? What
happens when a family paying bills online drops its Internet
account?
</P>
<P>
   But Margot Saunders, an attorney at the National Consumer Law
Center, said the real problem for critics of the new law is that
``these are all what-ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not intuitive because we're not seeing these problems out
there and reporting back,'' she added. ``We're just guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that in turn may help explain why it is so hard to confront
the virtual impossibility of privacy and security on the Internet,
or find the will to adjust behavior accordingly. It dovetails with
the way people have for decades grappled with technological risk.
Because it is harder to comprehend _ particularly with information
technology, which is itself is so intangible _ it seems easier to
dismiss the potential to do damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same as getting your face smashed through the
windshield,'' said David Mindell, a historian of technology at MIT.
``It's a lot less clear what your risks are when you're on the
Internet or moving your life management over to Internet. And it's
very hard for people to change their behavior based on poorly
defined risks.''

LIVING BETTER (AND RISKIER) ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement
only. Asian and European points: Call Karl Horwitz in Paris for
details and prices, phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44).). 
 By AMY HARMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the recent string of electronic events: A virus that
becomes known as the love bug causes nearly $1 billion worth of
damages as it ravages computer systems across the world. The Office
of National Drug Control Policy admits that it may have violated
federal privacy guidelines by implanting software on the computers
of its Web site visitors that tracks their travels across the
Internet. Hackers seize control of Nike's corporate Web site to
announce that ``global justice is coming _ prepare now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the threats to privacy and security on the Internet
thrust their way into the public consciousness, Congress
overwhelmingly passes a bill that aims to turbo-charge electronic
commerce by giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper
signatures _ without many provisions for security. Americans
continue to transfer their personal, political, financial and even
medical lives online, all the while trading horror stories about
identity theft and credit card scams.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a disconnect here?
</P>
<P>
   If so, it may be because people simply can't stop themselves
from using the Internet, spooked though they may be. They do not
fight the nearly universal tendency to equate technology with
progress. And at a time when the Internet is widely believed to be
driving the buoyant economy, the financial incentives to continue
on the current trajectory are huge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is simpler than that: the risk seems worth it. So
seductive is the technology that even its most strident critics
cannot imagine voluntarily going without e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, those who are most outspoken about the privacy
and security risks are no longer modern-day Luddites but computer
scientists _ some of them the architects of the global computer
network, which they have come to believe is insufficient to meet
the demands being placed on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If situation A is not working right, does it make sense to do
A times 10 using the same technology?'' asked Lauren Weinstein, a
veteran Internet engineer and co-founder of a group called People
for Internet Responsibility, which has issued a technical critique
of the electronic signature bill. ``That doesn't make any sense to
me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As reports of electronic breaches and privacy lapses roll in
with increasing frequency, it has become almost an article of faith
among computer security experts that the radical, global commitment
to research and installing safeguards that could make the Internet
more secure will not happen until a major catastrophe strikes. But
there is little doubt among them that such an effort will be made
some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net's going to go fumbling along until there's a massive
intrusion,'' said Dave Farber, an Internet pioneer and chief
technologist for the Federal Communications Commission. ``Then
everything will hit the fan. Congress is going to go ballistic, and
we're going to panic our way into doing something.''

(The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement
only. Asian and European points: Call Karl Horwitz in Paris for

   (Week in Review summary of events in the headlines last week)
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, Quick Appeal and Slower Penalties
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case surprised
everyone by ordering a postponement of the conduct restrictions he
imposed just two weeks earlier until appeals are complete. In the
same order he certified the case for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court. Microsoft was jubilant; penalties that were to take effect
in September are now on hold for at least a year, maybe longer. But
some government officials say they believe Microsoft, freed from
scrutiny for a while, might continue the sort of behavior that got
the company in trouble to begin with, and help convince the appeals
courts to uphold the lower court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Trying for a Trend in Asia
</P>
<P>
   The historic handshake between the leaders of the two Koreas a
week before inspired another Asian leader to reach out to a
longtime adversary. Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan's new president, invited
his Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, to attend a similar
peacemaking summit. China was unmoved by Taiwan's overture.
</P>
<P>
   To Deal or Not to Deal
</P>
<P>
   With six months left in office and frustrated by the ability of
Slobodan Milosevic to keep his job, the Clinton administration is
exploring with America's allies suggestions that Yugoslavia's
president might leave office if he were given guarantees for his
safety and savings, despite his indictment on charges of war crimes
in Kosovo. Greece is doing the intermediary work. American
spokesmen denied any thought of a bargain, but senior American and
NATO officials said differently.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening Hate Protection
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a milestone _ though not necessarily a law _
when it adopted a hate crimes bill that listed sexual orientation,
along with race, religion, national origin and handicapped status,
as a protected category.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan vote, 57-42, was the first time either house of
Congress had moved to protect gay people on a roll call that could
have political consequences. The measure was strongly supported by
President Clinton, and its fate may depend on his willingness to
insist that House Republican leaders accept it before signing
spending bills that will let Congress go home.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating in Colombia
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved nearly $1 billion in aid to Colombia, a
major escalation in America's commitment to help an important Latin
American ally combat drug trafficking and a guerrilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already approved the measure, a top priority of
the Clinton administration. Proponents said the aid, including
helicopters, would be used to train and equip three army battalions
for counter-drug operations. But critics warned that Washington was
plunging into an open-ended civil conflict that has cost thousands
of lives over nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   A Chance for Addicts
</P>
<P>
   New York state moved to expand pilot programs that had shown
some success in changing the lives of convicted drug addicts, by
offering every nonviolent addict the option of treatment instead of
jail. While all 50 states offer some form of court-mandated
treatment, New York will be the first to make it an integral part
of the system. The move is expected to move one-tenth of the
state's 95,000 inmates from behind bars and into treatment
programs, and save $500 million a year in prison, foster care and
mental health costs.
</P>
<P>
   A New Archbishop
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Egan, the former bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., who was
credited with rescuing that diocese from bankruptcy and
replenishing its dwindling priesthood, was installed as the ninth
archbishop of New York, succeeding Cardinal John O'Connor. Egan is
a canon lawyer and classical pianist who is expected to adapt the
New York archdiocese to demographic changes and fiscal pressures by
closing or merging schools, parishes and perhaps hospitals _ all
steps his predecessor was loath to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   A Long-Awaited Truce
</P>
<P>
   After two years of high-intensity warfare, Ethiopia and Eritrea
_ once held out by Western nations as beacons of hope in Africa _
signed a cease-fire to be monitored by U.N. peacekeepers. Their war
was fought, on the surface, over who owned what along their common
border. But it was fueled as much by economic tensions and personal
grudges stemming from Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
The next step is a border commission, though that will not heal
tattered economies or relations.
</P>
<P>
   New Golf Records
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods did not just win the U.S. Open. He dominated. He won
by a record 15 strokes, even as he broke or equaled several other
records. Golf has never seen a player quite like Woods, who
combines tremendous athletic ability with a magnetism that attracts
people of all ages and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A Grim Trade
</P>
<P>
   The growing trade in people transported by criminal gangs from
their impoverished lands to Europe produced a grisly new statistic
when the bodies of 58 refugees from Fujian province in China were
discovered in the overheated and airless container of a Dutch truck
when it came ashore from a channel ferry at Dover, in southern
England. Two survivors were recovering in a Canterbury hospital.
The British police charged the driver, Perry Wacker, 32, of
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with 58 counts of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of Water on Mars
</P>
<P>
   Mars used to have oceans and rivers, but they vanished more than
a billion years ago, the water evaporating and escaping into space.
Scientists believed that what little water remained was trapped in
the planet's frozen poles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pictures taken by an orbiting American spacecraft suggest
there may be underground sources of water beneath the upper crust
that occasionally burst free and flow down crater walls. Scientists
think those may be ideal places to seek evidence of life.
</P>
<P>
   No Prayers, Please
</P>
<P>
   On religion, the Supreme Court often speaks with many voices in
a confusing tangle of opinions, so last week's ruling declaring
unconstitutional the practice of student-led prayer at public
school football games was notable for its clarity. Organized prayer
at a school-sponsored event _ even if ostensibly the private choice
of a student speaker _ amounts to an official endorsement of
religion that is inherently coercive of unwilling participants,
Justice John Paul Stevens said in the 6-3 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiry on First Lady Ends
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray, the independent counsel who succeeded Kenneth Starr,
announced he would seek no criminal charges against Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the firing of seven White House travel office employees
in 1993, but he said evidence indicated she had played a greater
role than she had portrayed in her testimony. He said she
``ultimately influenced'' the decision by expressing ``concerns''
to White House officials.

   INTERNET-PRICES (Undated) _ Internet retailers are in big
trouble. Stock prices have collapsed, venture capital has dried up
and the public markets have closed their doors to those who cannot
demonstrate how they will be profitable soon. To please testy
investors, dot-coms are trying numerous tactics _ including
employee layoffs, rethinking their entire business and raising
advertising and association fees. But because many Internet product
prices were once set beneath cost to lure new customers, the
easiest and most obvious step has been to bring those prices back
to the real world. By Leslie Kaufman.

   RACE-KIDS (Maplewood, N.J.) _ It happens everywhere, in the
confusions of adolescence and the yearning for identity, when the
most important thing in life is choosing a group and fitting in:
Black children and white children move into separate worlds. But
what is striking is that it happens even here. In a nation of
segregated schools, the South Orange-Maplewood district is
extraordinarily mixed. This is the kind of place where people _
black and white _ talk a lot about the virtues of diversity. But
even here, as if pulled by internal magnets, black and white
children begin to separate at sixth grade. These are children who
walked to school together, learned to read together, slept over at
each other's houses. But despite all the personal history, all the
community good will, race divides them as they grow up. By Tamar

its kitchen-sink strategy of attacking crime. In interviews last

repeated again and again _ by young gang members and tired ex-cons,
by prostitutes and bodega owners, by scrawny heroin addicts and
public housing tenants. In short, most of those who have
substantial contact with police officers do not share the suddenly
popular perception that the Police Department has relaxed its
enforcement tactics. A special report.

COMMENTARY: DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something almost reassuring about how predictably our
politicians have reacted to those high gasoline prices in the
Midwest. The president, oddly unwilling to criticize his own
Environmental Protection Agency, hints broadly that oil companies
are rigging the market. The governor of Texas, oddly unwilling to
criticize oil companies, blames excessive government regulation.
Major Strasser has been shot _ round up the usual suspects!
</P>
<P>
   But a sober report from the Congressional Research Service
blames neither the EPA nor the oil companies _ though a close
reading suggests that both deserve a slap on the wrist for being
caught unawares by a shortage they should have seen coming. And the
report also answers the obvious question raised by other theories _
why this is happening in Chicago and Milwaukee, but not in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   What's special about the Midwest? Well, for one thing, it's a
long way from the ocean. (No!) So the preferred method of delivery
for petroleum and petroleum products is by pipeline. And as it
happens two important pipelines have had problems _ a fire in one,
a leak in the other _ whose aftereffects are still disrupting
supply. The CRS report attributes about half of the 50-cent
differential between gasoline prices in the Midwest and elsewhere
to pipeline troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that's special about the Midwest is that it is
America's agricultural heartland, where the corn is as high as an
elephant's eye _ and the ethanol lobby is even more powerful than
it is elsewhere. And the CRS thinks the other half of the
differential is due to local rules in corn-belt cities that force
refiners to meet new federal environmental regulations using
ethanol rather than other, technically less demanding gasoline
additives.
</P>
<P>
   The use of ethanol _ the same stuff that gives beer its buzz _
as a fuel is one of those bad ideas that just won't go away. Back
in the late-'70s ethanol produced from corn was promoted as the
perfect answer to the energy crisis: It was renewable, it was
domestic, and it was supposed to be less polluting.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of decades and quite a few billion dollars in subsidies
and tax breaks later _ gasoline that contains 10 percent ethanol
still pays lower taxes, amounting to a 54-cent subsidy per gallon
of ethanol _ it is clear that the fuel's virtues were exaggerated.
For one thing, modern farming is an energy-intensive business, and
still more energy is needed to convert corn into ethanol. So this
is a fuel that requires almost as much energy to produce as it
releases when you burn it. True, ethanol is an ``oxidant'' that
helps gasoline run cleaner; but other oxidants are easier to deal
with. Those other oxidants pose pollution problems; but so does
ethanol, which tends to make gasoline evaporate too easily,
contributing to smog in the summer months. Put it all together and
you have a product with no special virtue to recommend it,
certainly no virtue that warrants a billion or so dollars a year in
tax breaks and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But the political influence of the ethanol producers has proved
untouchable. Or perhaps I should say ``producer'' rather than
``producers.'' Most of the benefit from ethanol's special status
goes not to the farmers but to those who turn corn into ethanol,
and about half that business is controlled by one company: Archer
Daniels Midland, the company that runs all those ads during news
programs. Actually, those ads are a giveaway: When people spend
large sums trying to convince you of you how wonderful they are,
without then trying to sell you something, you ought to suspect
that they are up to no good. And in the past, ADM _ one of the
nation's biggest political contributors _ was up to quite a lot of
no good: price-fixing, influence-buying, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Midwest gasoline squeeze wasn't a predictable
result of the ethanol lobby's efforts. Were it not for the other
factors _ extremely low inventories, surging demand from a booming,
SUV-driving economy and all that _ the rules that force Midwestern
refiners to use ethanol wouldn't have had such spectacular
consequences. Still, perhaps this summer of discontent will have a
good effect, by alerting the public to a large, ongoing, bipartisan
example of really bad policy.

FRANCE ISSUES TOUGH REPORT ON MONACO AND ITS MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The writer W. Somerset Maugham once described Monaco as
``a sunny spot for shady people.'' Last week, the French Parliament
offered a few more details.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing 400-page report, the Parliament said that the tiny
principality _ a famous refuge for wealthy tax dodgers _ was also
an ideal place to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   It accused Monaco of having deliberately put in place lax
banking laws _ including a guarantee of anonymity _ to attract
wealthy depositors no matter who they were. And it said that the
monetary surveillance systems were so poor that even if Monaco
officials wanted to cooperate in international efforts to prevent
money laundering, they could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monaco is one of the most hypocritical territories when it
comes to the fight against money laundering,'' said Arnaud
Montebourg, one of the Socialist members of Parliament who helped
to write the report. ``A loose system is not just tolerated there,
it was created on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Even control systems that were in place are not functioning
properly, the report said. One French auditor described inspecting
more than 260 files that should have contained information about
the identity of depositors. He found that a quarter of them were
completely empty.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary report recommended that France review its
accords with Monaco, some of which date back hundreds of years.
Unless changes are made, the report said, France _ which provides
Monaco with top civil servants and supervises its lending agencies
_ is in danger of losing its own credibility in the fight against
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The report also questioned why France should continue to
contribute to the upkeep of the Mediterranean resort, especially
when the principality's main goal ``appeared to be to let some of
the wealthiest citizens in the world get away without paying
taxes.'' At the moment, France shares its sales tax proceeds with
Monaco, under a formula that most experts say favors Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering and banking practices have been a hot topic in
Europe. France's report on Monaco came only a day after members of
the European Union reached an agreement in principle on sweeping
changes to bank secrecy laws, intended to bring cross-border
investment income within the net of tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, all 15 European Union states will exchange
information on nonresident's savings. This is intended to prevent
tax evasion by people who place their investments in secret
accounts in another European Union member country, or elsewhere
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, however, faces some major hurdles. It is dependent on
the cooperation of the United States, Switzerland and such tax
havens as Monaco and Liechtenstein, another principality that has
come under heavy scrutiny by an official from neighboring Austria
who claims to have found evidence of money laundering. Austria
itself has drawn the ire of fellow European Union members for
insisting on maintaining a high degree of banking secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Liechtenstein was among the 15 countries named by an
international task force last week as failing to cooperate with the
fight against the concealment of illegally earned funds. Other
countries on the list included Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco had also been rumored to be on the blacklist, drawn up by
the 26-nation Finance Action Task Force on money laundering. But
instead it was placed on the second tier ``gray'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The French Parliament report found that much of Monaco's
surveillance system was woefully understaffed. The report also
pointed out only 37 ``declarations of suspicion'' on potentially
illegal transactions were filed in 1998, far less than in any other
European tax haven, and despite more than $44 billion on deposit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the report said, Monaco had 10 times as many
bank accounts as residents and about 60 percent of the 340,000
accounts belonged to nonresidents. Only about 30,000 people live in
Monaco, which occupies a choice piece of Mediterranean coast not
quite as big as Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco remained silent on the report. It issued a statement
saying only that in time ``it would communicate the observations
and comments that it believed were necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The principality has a complicated relationship with France,
which provides many of its top functionaries and magistrates.
Monaco also uses French francs.
</P>
<P>
   The French report said that Monaco risks destabilizing markets
through a lack of surveillance of its banking and financial
sectors, and could hardly succeed in joining the Euro zone unless
it mended its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monaco must choose,'' the report said. ``It is up to it to
head for change.''

U.N. WARNS THAT TRAFFICKING IN PEOPLE IS GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Trafficking in people is now the
fastest-growing business of organized crime, and it is being run by
new, barely understood networks that have sidelined traditional
criminal syndicates, the top anti-crime official at the United
Nations said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Arlacchi, an Italian sociologist who worked closely on
fighting the Mafia before becoming director general of the U.N.
Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention three years ago, said
in an interview Thursday that the tragic deaths last week of 58
Chinese migrants trying to reach Britain was ``just the tip of the
iceberg, and one of several recent accidents that show the
magnitude and seriousness of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reliable estimates indicate that 200 million people may
now be in some way under the sway or in the hands of traffickers of
various kinds worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while four centuries of slavery moved about 11.5
million people out of Africa, in the last decade more than 30
million women and children may have been trafficked within and from
Southeast Asia for sexual purposes and sweatshop labor. Rates are
also high in the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest-growing criminal market in the world,
because of the number of people who are involved, the scale of
profits being generated for criminal organizations _ and because of
its multifold nature,'' said Arlacchi, a U.N.
undersecretary-general. ``We don't have just sexual exploitation.
We don't have just economic slavery, which includes two things,
forced labor and debt enslavement. We have also a lot of
exploitation of migrants. And we have classic slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put all this together under the same concept, you get
the biggest violation of human rights in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals he is making to governments is that
anti-slavery laws be reintroduced where they have lapsed or been
taken off the books. He is also considering recommending temporary
residence to would-be immigrants who cooperate with authorities in
identifying criminals who are trafficking in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a measure that in some countries, like Italy and Austria,
is showing very important results in understanding the nature of
networks _ how the victims are attracted, how they are recruited
and the way they are exploited,'' Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But first of all, we really have to understand the size of the
phenomenon,'' Arlacchi said. ``It is a sensitive political issue.
No country likes to admit to having sexual exploitation and human
trafficking. So we have to be very careful how we deal with the
source countries.'' In Europe, he said, large numbers of migrants
are arriving from Africa, the former Soviet bloc, China, Southeast
Asia and, lately, India.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics are still a bigger profit earner for organized crime
than trafficking in people is, he said. But the trade in human
beings is growing quickly enough to demand more precise estimates
of its value and better information about the links that the
smuggling networks, strung along illegal migration routes, have
with other types of international crime, he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Europe, Arlacchi said, traffickers from Eastern Europe and
Asia have already pushed crime gangs out of street prostitution in
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual slave trade was never acceptable to the Sicilian
Mafia, Arlacchi said. ``They are totally out of this business and
they are losing ground vis-a-vis all other international
competitors because of that.'' Albanian and other Balkan criminal
groups, known for their ferocity, dominate street trade in drugs
and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians are particularly ferocious,'' he said. ``In
three or four years in the biggest Italian cities they have
succeeded in destroying the competition of the other organizations.
Albanians scare the Sicilian Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese migrants are not found often in the sex trade, Arlacchi
said. Like the migrants who died on the way to Britain and many who
find their way to North America, he said, most Chinese are headed
for restaurant or sweatshop work, and disappear into neighborhoods
and businesses run by other Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Italian or other European syndicates, he said,
Chinese and other Asian networks are very closed, and therefore
hard to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese work very much inside closed communities,'' he
said.

   Shoppers browsing the Internet for watches last Christmas could
find models of popular Tag Heuer watches for $325 to $1,000, or
roughly 35 percent below their suggested retail price, at
Ashford.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the site has raised prices by over 20 percent, boasts
Kenny Kurtzman, Ashford's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging about price increases may seem crazy, but Kurtzman,
like so many of his Internet brethren, is desperate to reassure
worried investors that Ashford, which lost $72 million on $42
million in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, is on track
for a more sustainable future. And their desperation appears to be
bringing an end to the Internet bargains beloved of many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers are in big trouble. Stock prices have
collapsed, venture capital has dried up and the public markets have
closed their doors to those who cannot demonstrate how they will be
profitable soon. Small companies like Toysmart.com, Petsmart.com,
and Boo.com have been sold or have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even the industry giant Amazon.com appears increasingly fragile.
Lehman Brothers released a scathing report Friday that called
Amazon's situation ``weak and deteriorating'' and advised investors
to avoid its bonds. The critique sent the retailer's stock plunging
19 percent, wiping out the last of its gains since December 1998
and punishing other Internet stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   To please testy investors, dot-coms are trying numerous tactics
_ including laying off employees, reconceptualizing their
businesses, and raising advertising and association fees _ to show
they can eventually move into the black. But because many Internet
product prices were once set beneath cost to lure new customers,
the easiest and most obvious step has been to bring those prices
back to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artificial pricing of 1999 is history,'' said Mark
Goldstein, chief executive of Bluelight.com, the Web arm of Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants in cyberspace have also been encouraged to raise
prices, because customers so far have shown a willingness to pay
somewhat more, providing they get service to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that people are clicking at the higher
price range, because they will pay a premium for convenience _ like
being in stock now, or excellent customer service,'' said Daniel
Ciporin, president and chief executive of DealTime.com Inc., whose
online service allows customers to compare Web merchants' prices.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official entity that tracks past Web prices, but
there is plenty of evidence that online bargains are on the wane.
Consumers looking for the popular Sony S550D DVD player in May, for
example, would have found a bottom-range price of $309 to $323,
according to data collected by DealTime. Shoppers doing the same
search a week ago would have found the lowest options ranging from
$316 to $338.
</P>
<P>
   At Buy.com, an online superstore, the ``American Pie'' DVD cost
$14.99 at Christmas but now retails at $17.99, as does the DVD of
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' up from $13.99 over the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Since prices in earthbound consumer electronics stores have
never been so heavily discounted _ Circuit City, for example, sells
the Sony S550D for $449.99 _ they are not rising much, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even cyberspace retailers whose product prices have not jumped
are raising costs indirectly by increasing shipping and handling
fees or reducing special offers. Drugstore.com, for example, has
raised its standard shipping fee from $3.49 a package in December
to $3.95 today, an increase that Peter Neupert, its chief
executive, said was meant to bolster profits rather than cover new
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers are also cutting back on discount coupons and
free extras while adding limits on who gets them: new shoppers
only, and just one per household.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, plenty of bargains still to be had on the
Web. There are also e-merchants who say they are resisting the
pressure to raise prices. Amazon.com, for example, while still
profitless because of its continued expansion, has $1 billion in
cash on hand and makes money on its average sale, and it insists
that its pricing structure will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our business model to work, we do not need to change our
pricing,'' said a company spokesman, Bill Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Lehman report is right, Amazon will burn through
that billion by December of this year and will again need to go to
the capital markets or find some other way to raise cash. Curry
dismissed the Lehman report as ``hogwash,'' but Amazon appears to
be looking for ways to increase cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 1, for example, Amazon will raise the monthly fee
it charges small businesses that sell through its zShops and Amazon
auctions from $9.99 to $39.99. Amazon would not say how much
additional revenue the increase in fees would bring, but David
Schappell, group product manager at Amazon auctions, said the
increase occurred because ``the old pricing was so far beneath
market standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Less financially blessed Internet companies, meanwhile, are
getting the chance to compete on a more realistic playing field
now, a fact that delights brick-and-mortar merchants whose capital
structures never did allow them to support below-market prices and
the associated losses. Many cackle that as the market returns to a
more normal state, their much larger size will give them a natural
price advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's going to be hard to compete on price if the
bricks-and-clicks are doing a competitive job,'' exulted Jonathan
Foster, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of
Toysrus.com, the online arm of the giant chain. Toys ``R'' Us had
$13 billion in sales last year, or 86 times those of its biggest
Web competitor, eToys Inc., a heft that should give it great
influence in negotiating lower prices from its suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the e-tailers, Web shoppers are showing themselves
to be a bit less the dogged bargain hounds than was originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   In a May survey, Jupiter Communications Inc., the Internet
consulting firm, found that Internet customers were slowly growing
less price-sensitive. Though 73 percent of the 1,500 people who
responded to the survey rated price as the most important factor in
their decisions to buy a product, that was down from 80 percent two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that the lowest price range for the best-selling
Nikon Coolpix 990 camera was $819 to $824 in May, according to
DealTime, and some 59 percent of consumers using the company's
search engine bought at that price.
</P>
<P>
   In June the price range was the same, DealTime found, but the
number of buyers at the cheapest level had slipped to 50 percent,
largely because the more expensive cameras were in stock while the
less expensive ones had waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, convenience and saving time, which have always
been the real advantage of the Internet, will be the most
valuable'' assets of the online business model, said Marcia H.
Flicker, a professor of marketing at Fordham University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The price pressures are also forcing online retailers to figure
out more quickly how to recognize their repeat _ and therefore more
valuable _ customers and reward them, while avoiding the use of
resources on customers who buy only when given money-losing
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there that just want to take advantage of
deals,'' Neupert said, explaining Drugstore.com's decision to offer
fewer coupons. ``Those are not the customers we want to attract.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this does not, of course, mean that consumers are
becoming completely indifferent to the impact on their wallets and
that Internet companies can ignore price concerns. Online sites
that have made serving up bargains their sole purpose for being are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six months, Renana Myers of White Plains, N.Y., has
bid for goods like yogurt, diapers and paper products on
Priceline.com _ a service that allows consumers to negotiate prices
with a diverse array of retailers _ before she goes to the
supermarket, which has a deal with the online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Lately she has noticed that the savings are not so great. ``They
have shifted the cost of things like wipes and yogurt upwards,''
she said. ``You have to be very savvy and know the costs in the
supermarket if you are going to get a good deal.'' She has been
disappointed enough lately that she has considered not bothering to
visit Priceline any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers are all too aware that there is a limit to how
high they can push prices, but profit pressures, already intense,
are likely to get rougher soon. Next month the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, an independent agency whose rulings are
incorporated into generally accepted accounting principles, is
expected to debate and possibly even vote on a recently proposed
rule about how all retailers calculate ``gross profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The board is trying to standardize the way retail companies
account for shipping and handling costs. Although there is great
variation across the industry, many of the biggest merchants that
operate exclusively online, like Amazon.com and eToys, list such
costs under their marketing budgets, a practice that inflates gross
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board is likely to call for an end to this
practice and instead require businesses to deduct such so-called
fulfillment outlays from the costs of goods.
</P>
<P>
   While many catalog merchants also count shipping by this method,
the proposed measure would be of much greater significance to
virtual retailers, because they do not have any positive earnings,
and gross margins are the main way investors have found to measure
the e-tailers' health.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rule could cause gross margins to drop to 10 percent from
20 percent at Amazon, and to negative percentages for eToys,
PlanetRx and Drugstore.com, according to Holly Becker, an Internet
analyst at Lehman Brothers. That could further dismay investors,
leading to additional pressure on prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of bottom-line earnings, we have been using
gross margins to gauge the health of the business,'' Becker said.
``Companies will do what they can to get margins higher again. That
means raising prices or lowering fulfillment costs _ and raising
prices is certainly a shorter-term solution.''

 copy &HT;    Leigh recalls brief stab at immortality
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some actors spend a lifetime trying to grab Hollywood
immortality. Janet Leigh got it in roughly three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   She stepped pretty much naked into a tub, the shower head
squirting steady droplets of cascading water. Even if you haven't
seen Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror classic, ``Psycho,'' you know
the rest. The dark figure behind the plastic shower curtain. The
screeching music. The knife. The scream. The blood flowing as water
swirls around the gulping drain. ``Blood. Mother. Oh, God. Mother.
Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we were doing something innovative, creative and
different,'' says Leigh, who brings ``Psycho'' to the Fox Theatre's
Summer Film Festival on Wednesday for a talk and free showing as an
extension of American Movie Classics' televised Hitchcock Film
Preservation Festival. ``It was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   And physically tedious.
</P>
<P>
   That short, pivotal shower scene was filmed over seven days,
exactly a third of the total time Leigh spent on the set. She was
fitted with bits of skin-colored cloth below her shoulders (a nude
actress was used in some parts of the scene) and Hitchcock used
warm water in the shower to keep Leigh's discomfort to a minimum.
The director had meticulously planned each shot, each cut (there
are about 70) to create a montage that would have moviegoers
believe Leigh was being stabbed to death when, in reality, the
knife never once cuts skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each angle was so important,'' Leigh says. ``The editing
provided the tempo. You see the knife going up and down and up and
down. There's the music. I'm screaming. It just seems real.''
</P>
<P>
   There had never been anything quite like it on film. ``Psycho''
was the fourth in a quartet of movies that many critics view as
evidence of a master film technician at the top of his craft (the
others: 1954's ``Rear Window,'' 1958's ``Vertigo'' and 1959's
``North by Northwest'').
</P>
<P>
   As he always did, Hitchcock challenged Hollywood's conventions
and antiquated morality code. ``Psycho'' was the first to show a
toilet (screenwriter Joseph Stefano urged making it part of the
plot), toyed with clothing as Leigh appeared in then-risque scenes
wearing a white or black bra and half-slips, and boldly killed off
a main star midway through the film. While the director always
insisted that breasts were never shown in the stunning shower
scene, a long, mostly out-of-focus body shot as the girl grips the
shower curtain appears to suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Younger moviegoers today are often bored with ``Psycho.''
They're used to seeing violence in much more graphic detail (who
can miss seeing in slo-mo the knife plunged into Drew Barrymore's
chest in ``Scream''?). But ``Psycho'' is a technically astute film
and remarkable for its 1960 cutting-edge craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the turning shot as the camera slowly backs away
from Leigh's eye near the end of the shower sequence required the
cinematographer to constantly hand-focus his lens (today, that
focusing would be on automatic). A special shower head was
constructed for the shot focused directly into the cascading water
to prevent drops from hitting the large lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (making `Psycho') was as good as it can get because
Mr. Hitchcock was so brilliant, because of how he was going to
shoot it,'' Leigh says.
</P>
<P>
   She did not hesitate to accept the role. She and the Hitchcocks
had mutual friends and were often seated together at dinner
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Then out of the blue came ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a package in the mail and in it was the novel by Robert
Bloch,'' Leigh says, ``and with it was a note from Mr. Hitchcock
that said, `Janet, please consider the role of Mary Crane.''' (The
name from the book was later changed to Marion after researchers
discovered a woman named Mary Crane living in Phoenix, where the
film opens.) The note also said, ```Of course it will be changed
and not concentrate on the whole heinous life of Norman Bates. And
we're thinking of Anthony Perkins.' It was signed `love,' and Mr.
Hitchcock, you know, drew his profile as his signature. ``All I
knew,'' Leigh says, ``is if he wanted me in a picture, I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly why Hitchcock plucked Leigh from all the
blondes in Hollywood (he was, of course, stuck on blond actresses).
But it could be because of Leigh's striking performance in Orson
Welles' 1958 noir thriller ``Touch of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   That film, recently restored to much critical acclaim, features
Leigh in a blistering rape scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to assume that Mr. Hitchcock would have seen an
Orson Welles picture,'' Leigh says, adding that the woman she
played in ``Evil'' was a ``pretty feisty lady, and Marion is
also.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Psycho,'' Leigh received her only Oscar nomination (she
lost in the supporting actress category to Shirley Jones for her
turn as a prostitute in ``Elmer Gantry''). Leigh did, however, win
the Golden Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie changed my life,'' the actress says. ``I,
fortunately, did not fall into that position that Tony Perkins did.
He was so brilliant. But after the film people couldn't see him as
anyone but Norman Bates. I must have gotten 100 scripts in a month
dealing with this same kind of situation. I immediately went into
three very different movies.'' (They were the psychological drama
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' the musical ``Bye Bye Birdie'' and
the relationship comedy ``Wives and Lovers.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's one fact from ``Psycho'' that Leigh says has haunted her
for the past 40 years. Since the movie, she insists, she's never
taken another shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take only baths. I really had never thought about it, but
seeing it and seeing it that way made me think about it a lot.
You're so vulnerable. You can't hear with the water, you can't see
with the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just don't want to go there again.''

FRAGILE STABILITY SLOWLY EMERGES IN CAMBODIA
</HEADLINE>
  By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ After three decades of conflict, a new
era of peace and political stability is taking root here in one of
the world's most tormented nations.
</P>
<P>
   The major rivalries and bloodshed spawned by the Indochina war
in the 1970s have sputtered out over the past two years, and
Cambodia has settled into the everyday misery of a land of poverty,
injustice and continuing brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here see glimmers of hope as the government _
both aided and pressured by foreign donors _ begins to lay the
groundwork for change. An active and liberal civil society has
begun to take root, a functioning government administration is
being mapped out and the traumas of the past are beginning to be
tentatively addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing now is clearing the fog out of the way so
people can see the real problems,'' said Bill Herod, coordinator of
The NGO Forum on Cambodia, a consortium of private aid groups.
``Because now we have one government under one set of leaders. We
don't have to worry about the political strife and tensions that
dominated our lives for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The key question is political will, said Kek Galabru, who heads
Licadho, a prominent local human rights monitoring group. ``We have
more political stability, but we still have social and economic
problems,'' she said. ``All of us hope to rebuild the country now,
but what we get from the government is mostly promises.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected detail illustrates the new atmosphere: human
rights groups have not documented a single political killing over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In another signal that a new Cambodia may be emerging, one
foreign aid official noted with astonishment that, for the first
time in 30 or 40 years, it is possible to travel safely _ at least
in daytime and avoiding mine fields _ to every corner of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of its head man, Pol Pot, and the surrender of
other top leaders, the Khmer Rouge insurgency collapsed in 1998.
Cambodia is still devastated by the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror
from 1975 to 1979, when more than a million people died, but it is
no longer in a position to harm Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   And the armed political rivalry between Cambodia's two dominant
parties _ the royalists and the former Communists _ was decided by
a coup in 1997 that left the country under the control of Prime
Minister Hun Sen _ a former Communist leader who revels in the
epithet ``strongman.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost shamefacedly, several local and foreign analysts here say
it may be true for the moment that a strong hand is what Cambodia
needs, that the country simply was not ready to handle the
competitive democracy that the United Nations sought to implant
with a $2 billion intervention a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that government abuses have ended or that the
people of Cambodia are being served rather than bullied by those in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its democratic forms, this is still in many ways a
feudal nation, ruled by corrupt officials who use violence to get
their way and remain mostly above the law.
</P>
<P>
   The current scourge is land grabbing: Powerful men _ many of
them military officers _ drive farmers from their fields as they
rush to seize the nation's wealth in Cambodia's unregulated,
grab-what-you-can economy.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew by 5 percent last year, but the gap between
rich and poor appears to be widening, and the poverty of the
poorest appears to be growing deeper. Cambodia, with a population
now of 12 million, has one of the world's highest rates of
population growth, 2.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning towards a society close to what it was before
the Khmer Rouge, in the sense that you have rich people getting
rich and poor people getting poorer,'' said Sebastien Marot,
coordinator of Mith Samlanh, a private aid group that works with
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a very different time from the pre-Khmer Rouge days.
The war and the international rivalries that fueled their
insurgency ended long ago. Following the U.N. mission, Cambodia has
retained a huge foreign presence, but it is focused on
nation-building, not warfare.
</P>
<P>
   As the historian David Chandler wrote recently, ``With the end
of the Cold War, Cambodia no longer serves as anyone's sideshow or
surrogate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the international focus on Cambodia involves an
emerging campaign to put mass killers on trial.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years since it was driven from power, no one has
been brought to trial for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. And
although many Cambodians remain ambivalent, outside pressure has
built for an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Hun Sen agreed to a U.S. formula for a U.N.-sponsored
court that would include both Cambodian and foreign judges. The
formula attempts to uphold international standards of justice while
maintaining Cambodia's sense of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has changed tack many times, but if the
current plan holds, the National Assembly _ which his party
controls _ is scheduled to vote on the plan in the coming weeks.
Hans Corell, the chief legal counsel of the United Nations, is due
to visit in early July.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is more than historical housecleaning; it is part of
today's politics, riven as they are with the feuds and rivalries of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Several key Khmer Rouge figures now live freely in Cambodia,
hoping to be allowed to enjoy old age in obscurity. Two of the
worst killers have been arrested and are in custody. One difficult
issue is how many people might face trial _ two or six, or 20 or
many more. As the potential circle widens, the threat it poses to
the country's new-found stability increases.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's ruling party is an extension of the Communist regime
that supplanted the Khmer Rouge and was backed by the Vietnamese,
who invaded in 1979. Throughout the 1980s it fought a civil war
against an alliance that included Khmer Rouge guerrillas and
non-Communist royalists, supported by an equally ill-matched
coupling of Western nations and China.
</P>
<P>
   After a peace agreement in 1991, the United Nations brokered an
election that produced a coalition of enemies, a system of co-prime
ministers that yoked together Hun Sen and the royalist leader,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   Their rivalry, along with the continuing Khmer Rouge insurgency,
kept Cambodia unstable until Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh by force in
1997. After losing an election the following year, the prince
accepted a place as speaker of the National Assembly, and his
humiliated royalist party accommodated itself to a partnership with
Hun Sen's former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential threat to this precarious balance,
advocates of a trial say it is necessary to establish the rule of
law and combat a ``culture of impunity'' that allows abuses by
powerful people to continue unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents question its relevance to society, two decades after
the killings, calling it a new foreign imposition on a
still-fragile nation, a ``new kind of imperialism'' that seeks to
mold Cambodia to a Western template.
</P>
<P>
   One Western diplomat, who nonetheless supports a trial, said
foreigners ``have had a pretty big hand'' in creating Cambodia's
current chaos. ``So we should be careful about whatever we do in
the future and, despite good motives, not do anything that will
bring more harm,'' he said. ``We should be careful about feeling we
know what is best for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   A Khmer Rouge trial is far from the minds of most Cambodians,
exhausted by their country's recent history. . ``What people want
is to be left alone and make money and maybe buy a motorbike,''
said Chhay Narin, a schoolteacher. ``They want to feed their
families and educate their children. That sounds like a simple
thing, but it really is not, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cambodia's move toward a functioning government has been
the gathering of numbers, and they tell a story of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   For the 80 percent of Cambodians who live in the countryside,
only 43 percent of households have electricity and 23 percent have
access to clean water, according to the Ministry of Planning. Only
14 percent of villages have marketplaces, 16 percent have clinics
and just one-third have toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The level of education is one of the lowest in Asia, with an
adult literacy rate of just 65 percent. Government spending on
education has been falling, and as many as half of school-age
children do not attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one independent survey, 49 percent of children
under the age of 5 are malnourished. Life expectancy is less than
60 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government's most persistent critic, Sam Rainsy, says the
economy is in the hands of criminal syndicates and that
``Cambodia's biggest industries,'' apart from garment
manufacturing, are illegal logging, prostitution, drug trafficking
and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Even the finance minister, Keat Chhon, is a critic, telling a
recent conference, ``Cambodia lives in the casino economy where
investors come quickly and leave quickly.'' Few foreign investors
have decided to commit themselves to the country's long-term
future.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade after Cambodia's first post-Communist election,
there is a broad sense that the expensive effort by the United
Nations to create a democratic state was a failure. Hun Sen's coup
was a final readjustment, nullifying the election's outcome and
reinstating much of the political power structure that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note that, as in other new democracies, an election is
only an initial step. The United Nations failed to go farther in
breaking down the grip of Hun Sen's party on government
administration and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   But it is becoming clear that the influx of foreign aid groups
produced a lasting legacy, one that is already changing the
character of the country: a nascent civil society and a culture of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong recognition now not only by the government
but by the military that a civil society is an actor on the scene
and that the state will have to accept this reality,'' said Kao Kim
Hourn, director of a private rights group called the Cambodian
Institute for Cooperation and Peace. ``Because of this, we can work
better now in terms of mobilizing pressure and public opinion and
exposing wrongdoing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the start of the last decade there were just 12 local
nongovernmental organizations. Today there are 360, a sort of
shadow government that provides services ranging from the
protection of women to the digging of wells to the provision of
legal aid. Many of those involved are young Cambodians who received
their first education in political and civil rights during the
period of U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge to the old power structure is the growth
of local groups that protect human rights. Whether it is a strike
by garment workers, a political demonstration or forced eviction of
slum dwellers, local human rights workers will be there, sometimes
harassed, but increasingly heard.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable degree of political opposition is permitted. Three
years after a grenade attack that killed 16 people and wounded more
than 100 at a demonstration headed by Sam Rainsy, he has become a
sort of permanent gadfly, free to travel the country with his
anti-government campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These are still tentative changes, however, subject to the
dictates of the strongmen at the top. ``It's better,'' said Lao
Mong Hay, who heads the Cambodian Center for Democracy, a human
rights advocacy group. ``But it's fragile, very fragile. They can
close us down at any time.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHADDAYA MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY HERE? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ranting, apparently, is in style. Dennis Miller, the new man in
the booth for ``Monday Night Football,'' is known for his rants.
</P>
<P>
   If ABC wanted rants, they could have hired that homeless guy
near my office. All he wants is a quarter a rant.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, everybody is ranting about the sacrilege of
hiring a sarcastic comedian to do ``Monday Night Football.''
Apparently, this will defile the dignified memory of Howard, Giff
and Dandy Don, doing their Edward R. Murrow imitations.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if ranting is in, let's give it a try:
</P>
<P>
   I'm sick of watching the fans and the news media being played
like cheap fiddles in this Sosa-Gonzalez dance. One day Sammy wants
to come to New York. The next day he isn't sure. One day Juan
doesn't want to come to Yankee Stadium. The next day he might
consider a few months to see if he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   What do you mean, Juan Gonzalez doesn't want to play in New
York? Is he nuts?
</P>
<P>
   It may only be a negotiating ploy that Gonzalez has suggested he
wants to play someplace quiet, but people are not going to forget
these sentiments. Doesn't he know what an honor it is to play in
Yankee Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Wade Boggs. Just ask David Wells. Just ask Tim Raines.
Just ask Cecil Fielder. Just ask Chili Davis. Just ask Darryl and
Doc. Just ask Reggie Jackson, who sat in the Orioles' bus in 1976
and sang ``New York, New York'' and other such ditties, just to
tell his temporary teammates he was in a New York frame of mind.
Some ballplayers have imagination and some don't.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez may have gotten the wrong idea when he had to duck some
missiles from the barbarians in the right-field stands during the
three losing playoff series Texas had in Yankee Stadium in 1996,
'98 and '99.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for the vile language and aerial warfare
conducted from the outer seats, but hasn't Gonzalez figured out
that the boos tend to stop when you put on the stripes? (Unless
you've got Whitson's Disease, that is.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he got discouraged from batting one for 12 and two for 11
in the past two playoffs against the Yankees, but he has to
remember the awesome feeling of hitting three homers in two games
in the Stadium in 1996 and going seven for 16 and driving in nine
runs. They could hardly get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with that kind of series and a minimal sense of
imagination would look around him and say, ``I could own this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the guy is using New York for leverage, or else he has
got the pips. He doesn't like New York? Who does he think he is,
John Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that gallant spitter into toll booths is coming to
town on Thursday. Somehow, Rocker has emerged as a symbol for
conservatives. Apparently, it's a freedom of speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said he didn't have the right to be prejudiced against
whole swaths of the population. On the other hand, some of us have
the obligation to reply, ``Those are our relatives and our friends
and our neighbors you're talking about, young fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's defenders should see the disgusted looks on the faces
of his Atlanta teammates, who are athletes, not ideologues. In
their pragmatism, they think he is a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rocker wants to indulge himself in a subway ride to Shea
Stadium. He'll cost New Yorkers thousands of dollars for security
by going out in public. Who does he think he is, a presidential
candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has not made any anti-New York statements, but the
original word was that he did not want to play here. Isn't this the
same guy who said he wouldn't play in the All-Star Game if he
couldn't start? Didn't Steinbrenner check his dossier?
</P>
<P>
   Now the Gonzalez camp is floating out the suggestion that
Gonzalez wants rent-a-player status, coming to the Bronx and taking
a look around.
</P>
<P>
   That might work, except that first impressions are not always so
great. Mike Piazza had that deer-in-the-headlights look when he
landed in Shea Stadium. At first, the fans booed him, sensing, in
their cruelty, that he was stunned. Now they love the big gentle
lug.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gonzalez might find love at first sight. He
could be like the vast majority of cool guys who have come to New
York in recent years and found it much more than doable. Derek
Jeter gets around. Darryl Hamilton fits in fine. Al Leiter's
looking at public schools in Manhattan for one of his kids. Public
schools! John Olerud rode the subway. So does Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez would be a better fit for the Yankees than Sammy Sosa,
but on the other hand Sammy would light up the Bronx with his
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Gonzalez know what a career move this could be? He has
never been to the World Series. Hasn't he seen what happens to even
a Jim Leyritz or a Chad Curtis or a Scott Brosius when they start
playing best-of-seven in late October?
</P>
<P>
   This guy doesn't get it. He doesn't deserve New York. Besides,
what the Yankees really need is pitching.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for the ranting. The ranter near my office told me
everything is the CIA's fault. The guy is a loon. Everybody knows
it's Nike's fault.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TAKING THE MEASURE OF A YOUNG TRACK STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khadijah Conda, sisterhood's child, is still one one-hundredth
of a second shy of qualifying for next month's Olympic
track-and-field trials in the 400-meter run. Her college coach, Pat
Connolly, wails, ``You can't even blink your eye that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But both women know that smidgen of time may be the measure of a
life; at the world class, where all athletes are gifted and strong,
it is a competitor's will, not skill, that makes the difference
between winning and going home early. Even Conda is not sure if she
has the heart to run so hard she will collapse, retching and seeing
stars, then get up and shake it off so she can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me can't quite let go of the dream,'' she said last
week without conviction.
</P>
<P>
   She is barely even talking the talk. Walking the walk came to a
dead stop last Sunday, when she quit in the middle of a race. That
was an unthinkable act to Willye White, the five-time Olympian who
sent Conda to the three-time Olympian, Connolly, her best friend,
for a year of running dangerously at Radford University in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know if that girl is hungry enough, greedy
enough, to pay the price to be a champion,'' White said. ``Khadijah
hasn't shown the die-hardness, the killer instinct. She was called,
but she wasn't chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   The choosing is not quite over. Next Saturday, at a club meet in
Indianapolis, Conda could run the qualifying time of 52.45 seconds
and get a spot in the trials, which begin July 14 in Sacramento.
Her best time so far is 52.46. She is in physical shape to run
well, she said, but it took her most of last week to get her mind
on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep reminding myself this is something I want,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The energy level in her voice rose as she talked about her
current internship with General Electric, which she finds
absorbing, and a plan to surprise a sorority sister this weekend by
attending her wedding. ``I had told her a long time ago I wouldn't
make it because I'd be in training.''
</P>
<P>
   Conda said she has been bedeviled with ``crazy thoughts.'' She
didn't want to disappoint White and Connolly. She felt she had some
responsibility to find the limits of her considerable talents. Yet
she wanted a life, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a year of my life,'' she said. ``I wouldn't change
that, but it was a hard year, the first Thanksgiving I didn't spend
with my family, the first Mother's Day I wasn't with my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Conda transferred from Purdue to run for
Connolly's Radford team, the three women thought they were a
sisterhood heading for this year's Olympics in Sydney. Conda had
the ``tools'' _ the leg speed, strength and stamina _ of an Olympic
champion. But she needed the kind of intensive, one-on-one coaching
that would build her confidence and ignite her competitive fire.
And Connolly and White needed to find out if Conda was really the
one.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches call it heart, but it is really a desperation to win.
Not all athletes care enough about winning to allow the quest to
dominate their lives. Nothing burns out coaches faster than an
unusually talented youngster who will not embrace pain and
sacrifice, who would rather play than pay the price to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   In their time, Connolly, 56, and White, 60, had been desperate
enough to pay the price. White sprinted out of a snake-infested
Mississippi cotton field to the 1956 Melbourne Games and eventually
won two silver medals. Connolly ran and long-jumped out of an
abusive California home to the 1960 Rome Olympics, where she and
White became teammates.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 40 years, the women have considered themselves
sisters, supporting each other through births, deaths, four
husbands and the tidal shifts in the sports world. The rise of
performance-enhancing chemicals and procedures drove both women out
of competition; neither wanted to take drugs or compete at a
disadvantage against those who did.
</P>
<P>
   After a long career coaching and mentoring young women for the
city of Chicago, White retired; she is involved now in Olympic
development. Connolly, who is married to the 1956 Olympic gold
medalist in the hammer throw, Harold Connolly, found her calling as
an elite coach, especially with Evelyn Ashford, winner of three
Olympic gold medals and the former world-record holder in the
women's 100 meters. Last year, Connolly took a job as head men's
and women's track-and-field coach at Radford.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard year, building a new program with subpar
facilities. Most of her athletes regarded varsity sports as a
beauty and fitness regime. Her family was scattered; Harold was in
California, coaching their son, Adam, who had his own Olympic
hammer-throwing aspirations. Their daughter was in New York,
finishing at Columbia. And then there was Conda: smart, lovely,
athletically gifted, a young princess who, her sports mothers
thought, would put Radford on the map or break Connolly's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Conda, who turns 22 June 26, was raised in a strict Chicago
Muslim home. Her beloved late father was a sociology professor.
Educational achievement was emphasized; sports was a pastime,
tolerated so long as Khadijah did well in school. She accepted an
athletic scholarship to Purdue because she wanted to be an
engineer. She won Big 10 titles at Purdue but never competed in the
NCAA championships. Her progress was stalled. Conda and the Purdue
track coach had problems.
</P>
<P>
   White had followed Conda's athletic career since she was a
schoolgirl participant in the Willye B. White Foundation's annual
gala. White thought that Connolly could do for Conda what she had
done for Ashford. But Ashford had been hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have some hunger,'' Conda said last week as she talked
herself into competing in next weekend's Indianapolis race. ``But
I'm not sure. Is there a lacking in hunger, did it decrease? Is my
dream not as deep as I thought it was? I'm searching my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly thinks such introspection, along with Conda leaving
Radford for Chicago to take the GE job and attend the wedding,
shows a lack of desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she really wanted to be an Olympian, she would be here
working out,'' she said. ``I'm sad. I taught her how to run. She
came here and she had never run below 54 seconds before. Maybe it's
me. Some coaches can coach fear, like Bobby Knight. I can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, White said: ``Pat's the one I'm worried about. She
gave the girl everything. I don't want her to think it had to do
with her coaching. I told Pat not to talk to the girl till she
comes back to school in September, let her marinate, maybe she'll
mature, have greater insights. And after what happened last Sunday,
I told Pat, `You can't coach guts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, at a college meet in Chapel Hill, N.C., Conda quit
in the middle of a race she was losing. She stopped and walked off
the course. For White and Connolly, it was a sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to run hard, gut it out, fight to the death,'' White
said. ``You have to run faster than you are trained to run, you
have to hurt, you can't let anyone beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said: ``I was so disappointed, all I could say to her
was, `Thank you for not insulting me and pretending you were
injured.' I really thought she was going to make it, run her heart
out and qualify and go to the Olympics as an alternate in the
relay, take home a gold and be inspired to train for 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after that race, Conda struggled to explain why she
had quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time since I began competing at 9 that I
didn't finish a race,'' she said. ``Before I even ran, I was so
discouraged I had to force myself to a place I didn't feel I wanted
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought what I did was my way of telling myself to
walk away from all this, a perverted way of trying to take control
of my life. Afterwards I thought, this is not control, it's part of
battling with inner demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I learned so much this year. I gained strength. I
improved so much as a runner'' _ she was named outstanding female
athlete at the Big South Indoors. ``Coach Connolly got me to the
NCAA championships. But when I ran my 52.46, I was sick for a day.
Do I want that?''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, however, Conda's spirits had risen,
although she was not sure how much had to do with good feelings
about the GE job, the wedding festivities and her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Indianapolis,'' she said. ``I am trying to muster
it up, find out whether I have it or not, do or die.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR INDIANA CRITIC, A GRACEFUL RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child growing up in Montreal, Murray Sperber could walk to
any one of three hockey rinks. He played the game, and naturally
engaged in his share of fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to play, if you wanted to win, you had to
fight,'' he said. ``But hockey fights are very ritualistic. It was
you and the other guy, and nobody ever jumped in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the way people have in Sperber's more unconventional
battle with Bob Knight, an enforcer with a posse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different,'' he said. ``This is sanity versus
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   After 29 years as an English professor at Indiana University,
the past three spiced by his role as a rare faculty critic of the
volatile basketball coach, 59-year-old Murray Sperber will pack up
his family later this week and return to Montreal. After threats to
disrupt his fall classes and calls to his home threatened his life,
he is terming it a leave of absence, while conceding he may have
taught his last class on his beloved Bloomington campus.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, call it what you want, sabbatical or
surrender. Sperber prefers to consider himself what Russell Hanson,
the dean of arts and sciences, recently declared him _ a living
example of what he is preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Knight's favorite sayings is, `Last man standing
wins,''' Sperber said recently. ``I reject that. The fight I'm in
is the reform of college sports, and that is a long process. If
what's happened to me in any way encourages more college faculties
to get involved, then, who knows, maybe I'm winning.''
</P>
<P>
   An old antiwar and civil rights activist while doing graduate
work at the University of California-Berkeley, Sperber always
understood the consequences for confronting the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my '60s activism probably did get channeled into
it,'' he said. ``But I have to laugh when these Knight supporters
look up my bio, see the Berkeley part of it, and then it's `Commie
this, Pinko that.' The truth is, there were so many people to the
left of me. I was a liberal then. I'm a liberal now.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years on the same campus, the liberal never shook
hands with the General. They never met. Sperber tried to interview
Knight more than a decade ago for his book, ``College Sports
Inc.,'' which started him down this road. He never got past the
secretary, he said, which made him no different than most faculty
members.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber, in fact, once polled 45 instructors with 10 years or
more experience, and discovered that not one had been in the same
room with Knight, not counting the basketball arena.
</P>
<P>
   Had he deigned to break bread with a respected critic on his own
faculty, Knight might have actually learned something about Sperber
that he could respect. How Sperber and his wife, Aneta, struggled
to cope with having to bury a 6-year-old son more than a decade
ago. How they adopted two foster children, both girls, now 12 and
10. Knight would have discovered that Sperber played the game,
Knight's game. An inch over 6 feet, Sperber went from youth hockey
to high school basketball, to intramurals at Purdue and even played
some semipro ball while working on his Ph.D. in the south of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, confronted with mounting evidence of his ill-tempered
handiwork after the Neil Reed hand-on-throat allegations surfaced,
instead chose to discredit Sperber as a critic and an author. On
what did he base his evaluations? Bob Hammel, a retired Bloomington
sports editor and longtime friend and flatterer, told him so.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, the tough guy who builds character, has made a career of
stomping out dissent, or just avoiding it altogether. Consider how
he let Myles Brand cover for him when the university president
announced the zero-tolerance policy last month. When he finally did
address the news media, Knight hand-picked the participants as if
he were choosing the members of his wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Sperber has never been afraid to debate any
rational Knight supporter, including university officials. Several
weeks ago, he walked into what looked like an ambush, on sports
talk radio with Mike Francesa and Chris Russo in New York. Francesa
seemed eager to put Sperber on the defensive, but, to his credit,
conducted a spirited but fair interview. He later agreed that
Sperber in no way came across as uninformed or unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber has another book on the subject of big-time college
sports due out in September. Of course, he has heard that he is
exploiting Knight, as if he knew the Neil Reed story would break.
As if he has been calling newspapers after every Knight outburst
for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   To the best of his recollection, it was not until 1997, when he
was first interviewed by anyone outside Bloomington. By this
spring, he was on all the national outlets, often identified as
``Murray Sperber, Knight critic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `After all my years of teaching, writing, putting off
family outings for students and school, I'm going to go to my grave
as Knight critic,''' he said. ``I have to tell you that was pretty
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is his interest was the increasingly dysfunctional
college sports system long before he became the go-to guy on
Knight. Even then, just as at Berkeley, Sperber's bent was more
liberal than radical. He always credited Knight for ``running a
clean program in a corrupt sport.'' He just thought the cons had
finally come to outweigh the pros, that someone on the faculty
should stand up to say that ``sports should never overshadow the
academic functions of a university.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bob Knight stays at Indiana. Murray Sperber goes, a
living example of what he preached.

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR'S UNUSUAL POPULARITY PLUMMETS AS ECONOMIC CRISIS
LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ For a few high-flying months in his first
term, Mike Foster might have been the most popular governor in
America, riding a brief economic boom and his Harley-Davidson Road
King to unheard-of approval ratings in the range of 70 percent to
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the good years never seem to last long in Louisiana.
Inevitably, they are overtaken by an extreme statewide poverty
virtually unparalleled in the nation, along with an addiction to
oil revenues that frequently run dry. When this year's state budget
could not be balanced without a sales tax increase on food, Mike
Foster fell back to earth, hard. And it is unclear whether the
economy will allow him to ascend again in the last three years of
his second term.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on Monday by Southern Media and Opinion Research
found that Foster now has an approval rating of 54.8 percent, which
many governors might consider a blessing. But in April, the same
poll gave him an approval rating of 69.4 percent, and in March
1999, his approval reached a high of 82 percent. Bernie Pinsonat,
who conducted the poll, said the governor's popularity has been in
a ``free fall'' since the budget crisis developed earlier this
year, after several years of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a gruff, wealthy Republican who often spends weekends at
his private duck-hunting camp, has never been popular among the
state's black residents, particularly after admitting that in 1995
he secretly bought the contributors list of David Duke, a former
Louisiana Ku Klux Klan wizard and state politician. But Foster has
always had a strong following among rural and suburban white
voters, and among business leaders. Both groups seem to be
deserting him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the darling of the business community during his first
term,'' said Pete deGravelles, chairman of the Greater Lafayette
Chamber of Commerce and a boyhood friend of Foster. ``But he really
shocked us after he was re-elected last year. All of a sudden he
was talking about a whole bunch of new business taxes. It was a
whole different tone, and a lot of people were disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even legislators from his own party have criticized how the
governor handled what became a surprise fiscal emergency. Gathered
in the state's Capitol this week for an unusual special session to
complete the budget, several lawmakers said they wished Foster had
better informed the public about the state's economic condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, he isn't exactly the great communicator,'' said state
Rep. Victor Stelly, a Republican from Lake Charles. ``We've had
governors like Edwin Edwards and Buddy Roemer who could charm the
socks off a billy goat, and he's not the charismatic type.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who says he has no political ambitions after he is
required to leave office in 2004, insisted that he is not concerned
about the falloff in popularity. ``That's what happens when you
have a budget crisis pop up on you,'' he said in an interview,
though he acknowledged that he could have done better in explaining
the state's teetering economy to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've had a difficult time getting that across,'' he
said. ``After you have a few good years, people aren't prepared for
a downturn, they haven't had that much pain. There's a kind of
disconnect there that makes it very difficult to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is one of the few states that is having trouble
balancing its budget in a period of national prosperity, but its
economy and civic health have always followed a different course
than the rest of the nation, or even the South. It has the
second-highest poverty rate of any state, after much-smaller New
Mexico, and the gap between its wealthiest and poorest residents is
the nation's widest and is growing. This month it was ranked the
worst state for children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a
private, charitable organization based in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   And according to census data, Louisiana was the only Southern
state where more people moved out than moved in during the 1990s.
While 3.6 million Americans moved to the South, Louisiana
experienced a net migration loss of 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, like several of his predecessors, has tried to solve
some long-term problems by improving the state's educational
system. But he has found that his state does not have enough money
to bring teacher salaries into line even with the rest of the
South, a region that already trails the national average. The state
is one of the most lightly taxed in the country, collecting less
money per capita than all but five other states.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, state government relied on the oil and gas industry
as a reliable source of revenue that provided up to 40 percent of
the state budget as recently as the 1980s. But with the depletion
of the state's energy resources, oil is now supplying less than 10
percent of the budget, and the state is relying on gambling, a high
sales tax and a low income tax for most of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   After the price of oil dropped precipitously last year, the
industry laid off nearly 13,000 people, which quickly rippled
through the economy and produced a sharp plunge in state revenues.
Loren Scott, an economics professor at Louisiana State University,
said the governor and the Legislature also engaged in some
questionable budgeting practices, such as using one-time revenues
from the national tobacco settlement for operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And so this year, faced with a budget deficit of nearly $400
million, the governor and the Legislature raised the state sales
tax on food and utilities by a penny to 4 cents on the dollar, cut
personal income tax deductions and increased taxes on telephone
calls and tobacco. Many Democratic legislators were furious that
business lobbyists prevented any new taxes on the oil and gas
industry or on casino gambling, and education advocates said the
package did little to improve the state's school system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the Legislature sent a proposed
constitutional amendment to voters that would lower the state's
dependence on the sales tax, while raising the income tax enough to
increase teacher salaries. Economists say such a change would
finally allow state revenues to grow with the economy, unlike the
current system in which more than half of revenues come from sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the mood the voters are in, few people expect
the amendment to pass in November. Foster acknowledges the
difficulty he faces in selling the tax package, hoping he still has
a reserve of popularity left from which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're undertaxed, but no one wants to hear that from
me,'' he said. ``I'm just going to have to tell people and not
worry about the consequences. We're in the worst of all worlds if I
have to start worrying about what my popularity is.''  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A weak area of low pressure moving into the eastern Great Lakes
and its associated fronts will trigger many showers and
thunderstorms Sunday. Thunderstorms and showers will develop early
in the Ohio Valley as a cold front impinges upon very warm and
humid air. Afternoon thunderstorms will also develop in the
northern and central Appalachians as a jet stream disturbance races
ahead of the same front.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast will turn noticeably more humid as increasing
breezes from the southwest direct sticky air over the region.
Meanwhile, thunderstorms will develop at the Southeast coast as a
jet stream disturbance lingers over the Carolina Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms, some of which will be strong, will develop in the
central Plains as a front becomes stationary. The Pacific Northwest
states will be sunny and warm.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ARIZONA MONSOON
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon is an Arabic word meaning seasonal wind. In the
Southwestern United States, the seasonal wind shift is often too
subtle to detect, so humidity is used to define the start of the
monsoon. The second earliest start of the monsoon was declared in
Phoenix last week with the first occurrence of three consecutive
days of high humidity. Each year in late June or the first half of
July the amount of moisture in the normally arid desert air nearly
triples. As a result, scattered afternoon thunderstorms become a
common feature during the desert monsoon.

 &HT;    A powerless passion
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNESVILLE, Ohio _ Five minutes after takeoff, when we reach
3,000 feet in a pristine sky, glider pilot Rich Carraway releases
the line from the tow plane and banks our two-seater sailplane
gently to the north _ free, as the poet said, of the surly bonds of
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but the wind whispering around our clear plastic canopy.
We're in a peaceful bubble floating over a checkerboard of Warren
County farms and forests just a few miles east of Caesar Creek
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Below us, turkey vultures circle lazily on the percolating air.
We are brothers, it seems, in the purity and ease of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a shameless wuss like myself, who has a paralyzing fear
of heights, my 20-minute ride as a guest passenger with the Caesar
Creek Soaring Club was as gentle and agreeable as many of the
club's 200-plus members.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who want a more exhilarating experience can catch a
thermal _ a rising column of air _ that can lift them into the
clouds and keep them swirling in the sky for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring ``is probably one of the most addictive things you can
do,'' said club member Mark Statt, 45, of Cincinnati. Statt
developed his habit soon after retiring from the Army in 1994.
``It's the purest form of flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaring also offers a relatively easy way for many people, from
teen-agers to octogenarians, to make their fantasy of flying come
true. Caesar Creek club members range in age from 14 to 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought flying was a really cool thing, because my
dad has been a pilot for a long time. Gliding seemed the simplest
way for me to get some flight experience,'' said Katie Menchen, a
14-year-old Westchester resident who flew solo this spring for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Glider pilots can be licensed by age 16 _ two years younger than
airplane pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar Creek Soaring Club prides itself on having one of the
lowest-priced and safest glider pilot training programs in the
country. The group's 20 instructors are all volunteers and
instruction is free. You must join the club, however, and will need
about 75 flights before qualifying for the pilot's exam.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1947 by a group of mostly Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base researchers, the club is situated on 146 acres of woods and
pasture near Waynesville that was once a dairy farm. The bucolic
setting now includes a landing strip, clubhouse (with showers, rest
rooms and a well-stocked refrigerator), campgrounds, hangars,
picnic shelters, fishing pond and observation deck. The club owns
eight gliders and three tow planes for members' use.
</P>
<P>
   Members keep flight costs well below those of individually owned
sailplanes by volunteering once a month as ground crew and
tow-plane pilots. About 50 members of the club are licensed pilots,
so there is no shortage of volunteers to fly the club's three Piper
Pawnee tow planes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soaring is not the sport of paupers. The club's entry fee
is $400 _ an initial payment of $200 plus another $200 after the
first year for those who want to continue their membership.
(Members younger than 21 pay less.) In addition, adult members are
required to buy 12 shares of stock in the club at $100 a share over
a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Membership dues range from $12 to $22 per month, depending on
how many shares of stock the member owns. The towing cost for
individual flights starts at $10.
</P>
<P>
   Neophytes who just want a taste of gliding can take a guest ride
that lasts 20 to 30 minutes for a one-time charge of $45 to $55.
</P>
<P>
   Glider pilots seem eternally youthful. Francis Bundy, who turns
90 in September, was an instructor at the club until late last year
when he suffered some minor health setbacks. In his 32 years of
soaring, he has flown more than 8,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy, a physicist by training and a researcher for General
Electric who helped develop the first artificial diamonds, says he
still enjoys ``winning over gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Bundy and his father were inspired to build
their own glider after watching hawks circling on the thermals near
their Westerville home in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   They built their own glider frame and tested it ``but then the
Great Crash of 1929 came and we couldn't afford to buy the fabric
and the rope,'' Bundy said. He had to wait another 23 years, until
after his education and his service in the war, to realize his
dream of soaring. He was 42 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy is among a group of about 20 retirees in the club who
gather at the Der Dutchman Restaurant in Waynesville every
Wednesday morning to eat breakfast, sip coffee and trade soaring
stories before heading over to the gliderport.
</P>
<P>
   Club members of all ages are divided over whether to keep the
organization small and elite or to grow it with new members.
</P>
<P>
   John Biernacki, 77, is among those members who feel strongly
that the sport must be popularized to survive against the
juggernaut of commercial and private plane aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600,000 or so licensed pilots in the country, only 15,000
are glider pilots. The Caesar Creek club alone accounts for about
150 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding club membership and increasing public interest in the
sport ``means growing our own ability to participate,'' Biernacki
said. ``Right now we're being squeezed by the (expansion of the)
Cincinnati airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Club members can't fly much south of the gliderport without
violating the airport's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike European countries, where soaring is thriving, America
seems to be turning away from the source of its aviation roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost becoming like a forgotten art,'' Statt said.
``It's a lot like sailing is to boating. You have to know how to
work the wind.''

CLINTON PROPOSING MUCH LARGER PLAN FOR DRUG BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced a major change in his
proposal for Medicare drug benefits Saturday, making it much more
generous to millions of elderly people and much more costly to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal came four days before the House of
Representatives is scheduled to vote on a Republican proposal to
offer drug benefits, through private insurance companies, to all 39
million people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his revised proposal would cost $79 billion over
five years, or more than twice as much as the $38 billion proposal
he sent Congress as part of his budget request in February. The
House Republican plan would cost nearly $40 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton said he was
``deeply concerned'' about the proposal drafted by House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have proposed is not a Medicare benefit,'' Clinton
said. ``It's a private insurance program which many seniors and
people with disabilities simply won't be able to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to use surplus tax dollars to ensure that
no older American would have to pay more than $4,000 a year in drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would submit his new proposal to Congress
in the next few days. Congress, controlled by Republicans, is
unlikely to approve it right away. But experience suggests that
Clinton's proposal could influence Congress and nudge it in the
direction he wants to go as the legislative process unfolds under
the political pressures of this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his plan ``would be affordable and dependable, and
give every senior equal coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Republican response, Rep. Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut said the House Republican plan was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide a choice of at least two plans for seniors,''
Johnson said. ``Under the president's approach, our seniors would
have only one choice. The government would mandate a
one-size-fits-all plan, and a senior would just have to take it or
leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the president's proposal has soared in the last
year, as he offered richer benefits and more realistic cost
estimates. When he unveiled his initial plan in June 1999, he said
it would cost $118 billion over 10 years. In February, he put the
10-year cost at $195 billion: $160 billion for basic drug coverage,
plus $35 billion to help people with very high drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton offered what he described as an improved
version of his proposal, which he said would cost $253 billion over
10 years. That is more than twice the cost estimate for his
original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the more generous drug benefits were
possible because a booming economy had produced a gusher of federal
revenue, increasing projections of the budget surplus in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican proposal was approved on a party-line vote
in the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. It would use almost
all of the $40 billion allowed for drug benefits in the five-year
budget blueprint that Congress adopted in April.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a White House official said the administration did
not ``feel in any way constrained'' by the $40 billion figure.
Under House rules, it would not be in order to consider a bill that
increased Medicare spending by more than that amount.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they hoped that the House Rules
Committee would allow an exception to the rules, so Democrats could
offer an alternative costing $100 billion over five years. The
Democratic proposal, besides providing $79 billion worth of drug
benefits to the elderly, would increase Medicare payments to
hospitals and other health care providers by $21 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they agreed on the need to assist health care
providers and would offer a separate bill later this year, to
restore some of the Medicare money cut in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's original proposal, the government would have
paid half of the first $2,000 in drug expenses incurred by a
Medicare beneficiary, starting in 2003. Under the new proposal,
benefits would start a year earlier, in 2002. ``Seniors and people
with disabilities need prescription drug coverage as soon as
possible,'' the White House said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton specified Saturday, for the first time, how he would
protect elderly people who have high prescription drug expenses.
Under his proposal, no Medicare beneficiary would have to spend
more than $4,000 a year on prescription drugs. Medicare would pay
all costs beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Clinton said he wanted to provide some type of
``protection against catastrophic drug costs,'' starting in 2006,
but he gave no details. Saturday, he fleshed out his proposal and
said he wanted to start the extra coverage in 2002, along with the
basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, Clinton said Saturday, Medicare
beneficiaries would not have to pay anything extra for catastrophic
coverage. Premiums for the enhanced benefits would be the same as
the premiums he specified in February just for basic drug coverage:
$25 a month in 2002, rising to about $50 in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican plan, the government would pay
subsidies to insurance companies to encourage them to sell
insurance covering the drug costs of Medicare beneficiaries.
Premiums and benefits could vary from one plan to another. Under a
typical policy, the beneficiary would pay premiums of $37 a month
and a deductible of $250 a year. The insurance policy would pay
half of the next $2,100 in drug costs, and the beneficiary's
out-of-pocket costs would be limited to $6,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed Saturday to pay health maintenance
organizations to provide prescription drugs to Medicare
beneficiaries, starting in 2001. About 6 million of the 39 million
Medicare recipients, or 16 percent, are in HMOs. Most of the health
plans offer drug benefits, but Medicare does not require such
benefits, nor does it explicitly pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they hoped that the prospect of such
federal subsidies, $25 billion over five years and $75 billion over
10 years, would encourage health plans to participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, many HMOs have withdrawn from Medicare or
curtailed their participation, saying federal payments were
inadequate.

   SEOUL, South Korea _ As a marine during the Korean War, Chang
Kyong-hak saw many of his friends die and nearly lost his own life
defending South Korea from invading Communist troops from the
North.
</P>
<P>
   And like so many Korean War veterans, Chang, 66, was looking
forward to marching in a grand military parade that the South
Korean government had planned for Sunday to commemorate the start
of the conflict 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of strutting down Seoul's main avenues in his crisp
uniform to the fanfare of military bands and cheering crowds as he
had envisioned, Chang said he would most likely stay home, feeling
betrayed by the very country he fought to defend.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, North Korea agreed to pursue peace and
reconciliation with the South after a half-century of hostilities.
So the South Korean government has canceled all parades, battle
re-enactments and other commemorative war events that could be
offensive to the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 50 years since the government told us to fight
against those evil Communists, and now it wants us to accept the
North Koreans as brothers and simply forget what they did,'' said
Chang, a director of the Marine Corps Veterans Association, which
has 800,000 members. ``Well, it's an insult that our own government
doesn't even know how to properly treat those who fought and died
for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the decision to tone down the anniversary
celebrations brought angry denouncements from veterans, but it has
also touched off a heated national debate over the significance of
the Korean War and how far the South should go to appease the
North.
</P>
<P>
   Before the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, and the North
Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, held historic talks in Pyongyang, North
Korea, the week before last, the Communist North was widely viewed
as one of the world's most bellicose nations.
</P>
<P>
   But after the two leaders were seen on national television here
embracing and laughing, and after they agreed to reconcile their
differences, South Koreans were forced to view their decades-old
nemesis in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how to gauge North Korea _ and therefore the war
_ comes as hundreds of veterans, diplomats and officials from
around the world have arrived in Seoul to participate in
commemoration events.
</P>
<P>
   The war began on June 25, 1950, after North Korea invaded the
South. Russia and China took the side of the North, while the
United States led a U.N. force fighting for the South. About 3
million people died on both sides, including an estimated 900,000
Chinese troops and 30,000 Americans. The fighting officially ended
in 1953 when the North and South signed an armistice agreement, but
technically the two countries are still at war.
</P>
<P>
   Some American veterans of the Korean War, who came here to mark
the anniversary, are as disappointed as Chang. Fred Machado, a Navy
veteran from Fresno, Calif., said he was upset that South Korea had
decided to scale back the war commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Rangel, who described his one-year tour of duty
in Korea as a nightmare, had another view. ``When countries have
been at war for 50 years and when they are concentrating on peace
rather than war, I would think that doves and olive leaves are a
little more important than parades and display of military power,''
he said. Rangel, D-N.Y., was in Seoul as part of an official U.S.
delegation for the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government had planned to spend about $40
million on war commemoration events, including a parade with more
than 15,000 veterans from Korea and abroad and re-enactments of
major battles, including U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur's daring
landing at Inchon. The events were to begin on Sunday and continue
over three years, ending with the commemoration of the signing of
the armistice.
</P>
<P>
   The annual parade is normally a grand display of national pride
and patriotism, with dozens of political leaders, bands,
cheerleading squads and civic groups participating. This will be
the first time the event has been called off.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials said they had decided to scale back war
anniversary events as a good-will gesture to Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea normally celebrates the July 24 anniversary of the
signing of the armistice as War Victory Day, with huge military
parades. But the North Korean leader said during the summit meeting
that North Korea would not celebrate the anniversary this year, to
avoid exacerbating hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government had considered canceling any
commemoration of the war but decided that to do so would offend the
many foreign veterans and guests who were coming to attend them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the parades and battle re-enactments, South Korea
plans to hold what it views as more benign ceremonies _ seminars,
wreath-layings, photo exhibits, and luncheons and dinner parties
for foreign and domestic veterans, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Kim Dae-jung will address South Koreans in a ceremony
at the Korean War memorial. But government officials said the
ceremony is to honor the memory of Korean and foreign veterans who
sacrificed their lives for peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   Han Moon-koo, a factory worker whose father was taken prisoner
in the war, said he is, like many South Koreans, excited about the
prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula. But he and others say
they are still wary of Kim Jong Il, who in the past has shown
himself to be as dictatorial and warlike as his father, Kim Il
Sung, the country's longtime ruler before his death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Han was 7 years old the last time he saw his father, who was
preparing to go off to war and was later captured by the North.
``The war robbed me of my father while I was growing up, but oddly
on this 50th anniversary, there's a real chance that I might get to
see him again if he's still alive,'' Han said, referring to a
prisoner-exchange program that was announced during the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Han said that it would not be easy to divorce himself
from the hatred he has long harbored against North Korea. ``I know
that we are of the same race,'' he said, ``but I still consider
North Koreans to be my worst enemy.''

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Peninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Peninsula,
shifting, yet again, the geostrategic stakes for the United States.

during last spring's ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbs call them
prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along

   MEXICO-FOX _ MEXICO CITY _ With a flurry of new polls showing

PROSPECTS FOR BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA: DISTANT AND DELICATE
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ With the easing of economic sanctions
against North Korea by the Clinton administration last week, U.S.
corporations based here are beginning to assess business
opportunities in a country that has been out of bounds for five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, a country of 22 million people, many of them
deprived of all but the most basic needs, represents an unknown
world for U.S. business, but one with prospects both large and
small: Businessmen here see the need for everything from large
transportation and energy projects to modest consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the American Chamber of Commerce here, Jeffrey
D. Jones, says that sketchy data indicate that North Koreans earn a
wage of about $150 to $200 a month, much of it disposable income
because the state provides housing and basic food. If these wage
figures are correct, Jones said, they exceed disposable income in
parts of post-Communist Eastern Europe. However, North Koreans who
have fled to China in droves to escape famine have suggested that
families are spending almost all their money on food.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones warned that the process of opening up North Korea
would be slow, in large part because of its government's wariness
about contact with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with U.S. business leaders, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said, without giving specifics, that Washington
was eager to encourage North Korea, one of the last outposts of
strict Communist economy, to move into the international commercial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen said they envisioned North Korea developing
credibility with major Western powers and then becoming eligible
for funds from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This would lay the groundwork for major infrastructure projects,
which in turn would attract basic chemical, petrochemical, plastics
and paints industries.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have predicted that the bare-bones North Korean
economy, propped up lately by deliveries of food, fertilizer and
fuel from South Korea, China, Japan and the United States, will
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But some modest optimism has emerged, especially since the North
Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, visited China last month. He was urged
by his Chinese allies to follow them in opening up his economy and
was taken around computer companies in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications, including mobile phones, which are becoming
a promising investment sector in China, will take years to organize
in North Korea, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 4.9 percent of households are believed to have phones in
North Korea, according to South Korean statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A joint South-North economic committee was set up during the
summit meeting of the two Korean leaders 10 days ago, and this
panel is likely, in the beginning, to become the main conduit for
business in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Some South Korean companies already do such business, but Jones,
a lawyer here, cautioned that of the four ventures with North Korea
that he had been involved in, only one was still going.
</P>
<P>
   Jones quoted the head of a major South Korean corporation as
suggesting that there was no need for U.S. businesses to fret about
competition. ``If you are worried about a slice of the pie, there
is no pie yet,'' the South Korean had said.

ZIMBABWE VOTING OPENS WITH RELATIVE CALM 
</HEADLINE>
  By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARONDERA, Zimbabwe _ Zimbabwe went to the polls on Saturday for
the first day of voting in long-awaited national elections. Despite
weeks of political unrest, the voting so far was reported free of
the brazen intimidation that marked the campaign and threatened to
mar the election.
</P>
<P>
   A smattering of voter registration problems and a number of
delays in accrediting local election monitors were reported, but
election observers said that the troubles were far less serious
than they might have been and that the process so far was most
notable for being peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very quiet, surprisingly calm,'' said Irene-Maria Eich, a
spokeswoman for the election observers from the European Union,
which has the largest contingent of foreign monitors. ``It's really
going well. It's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's more than five million voters are electing a new
Parliament, and the party that has controlled the government since
blacks won majority rule two decades ago is facing its first real
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, a rising opposition party led by a
coalition of black academics and labor activists has seized on
deepening popular discontent over the nation's crumbling economy
and continuing corruption to challenge the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the only real question is how many seats the new party,
the Movement for Democratic Change, will take from President Robert
Mugabe, who has led the country since it was born in 1980. His
party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, called
ZANU-PF, controls all but three seats in the 150-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this urban center about 35 miles south of the capital,
Harare, and in the rural communities that surround it, interviews
with voters suggested that the results are likely to follow the
pattern that has emerged as the opposition has gained support.
</P>
<P>
   Older and rural voters appear to be sticking with the party of
the 76-year-old president, while younger and urban voters seem more
likely to latch on to the new party as their best hope for a change
in the country's miserable economic fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   At the office of the rural development agency in the village of
Seke, several miles from here, voters stood in line on Saturday,
clutching their identity documents, waiting to cast their ballots
by candlelight in the dark, drafty interior of an unlighted
building. Everyone interviewed said the decision to come out to
vote, despite the violence of the last several months, was easy _
and the decision about who to support seemed to have been even
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Mugabe,'' said Esther Mugiyo, 59. Though the
president is not up for re-election, he is considered the
embodiment of his party. ``He's doing everything for us that we
need in the rural areas,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Like others interviewed, she knew almost nothing about the new
opposition party. Most of what she learns about politics, she said,
comes from local leaders of the governing party, and what little
she had heard about the new party only left her puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I didn't understand,'' she said, ``is, What is this party
for? We already won independence. We know ZANU-PF is our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the region's biggest town, however, voters appeared to
be taking a different view. Hundreds of people, a number of whites
among them, waited as long as an hour to cast their ballot and _ to
read between the lines of their comments _ to cast a vote for a
change in the leadership of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to improve the economic situation,'' said James
Sobola, a 25-year-old gardener, after voting.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else interviewed here, Sobola did not want to say
for whom he had voted. Much of the political violence of the last
several months has been directed at supporters of the opposition
party, and Sobola said the prospect of more such attacks gave him
pause as he contemplated casting his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry so much,'' he said. ``It's not good, the violence. But
I'm not afraid. We are in a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged as they are by the calm of the first day, election
observers have said that they are concerned about how widespread
fears like Sobola's are and how many people might have passed up
voting out of fear that the months-long campaign of intimidation
against opposition supporters might spill over into this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's observer mission is expected to deliver a
preliminary report after the polls close on Sunday, and it will
look carefully at turnout as a crucial measure of whether the
pre-election intimidation compromised the fairness of the vote.
Another question will be how quickly the Zimbabwean election
authorities resolve the problems that surfaced in accrediting the
local observers, who number about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   After saying it would only accredit a fraction of that number,
the government decided late last week to accredit all of them. But
election authorities did not have enough accreditation cards for
all 16,000, and by this afternoon only about 30 percent had been
issued the proper identification and dispatched to polling places.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwean government's refusal to accredit British and
American observers has been yet another issue, and while the
government has refused to budge on British observers, it did ease
its stance on Americans a bit, announcing on Friday that it would
allow 27 diplomats at the U.S. Embassy to serve as observers.

STUDY SAYS GUN TRAFFICKERS ARM CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Tenn.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than half the investigations of firearms
trafficking conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms recovered at least one gun that had been used in other
crimes, a study by the bureau has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report shows that trafficking investigations lead to
armed violent criminals,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
last week at a new conference. The Department of the Treasury
oversees the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The report documented 1,530 investigations by the bureau's
agents between July 1996 and December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the investigations involved firearms known to
have been used in other crimes, Summers said, including homicides,
robberies and assaults. And a quarter of the traffickers were
convicted felons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement that ``gun trafficking
puts thousands of guns onto our nation's streets, and contributes
significantly to our nation's gun violence problems. Each gun put
into the hand of a criminal represents the possibility of one more
life lost, one more family destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureau and Justice Department officials, working with state and
local law enforcement officials, have turned up more than 84,000
firearms, leading to more than 1,700 prosecutions on
gun-trafficking charges, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 percent of the trafficking investigations involved
juvenile cases; about 17 percent were associated with homicide
cases and robbery cases, respectively; and about 25 percent were
associated with assaults, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Felons play a significant role in the sale and distribution of
firearms. The study indicated that when law enforcement officials
followed a gun used in a crime to its supplier, the authorities
often found another violent criminal. For example, about a quarter
of the bureau's investigations involved felons buying, selling or
possessing firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, investigations that `follow the crime gun' to its
illegal source are not only an effective strategy to disrupt and
reduce firearms trafficking in a community, they also are an
effective means to apprehend felons, armed career criminals and
narcotics traffickers who possess and misuse firearms,''
investigators wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, for example, a gun was recovered from a juvenile
in Washington who had been charged with illegal possession of a
firearm. The gun was traced to a gun dealer in Missouri, and then
to a gun trafficker in Nashville, Tenn., who had sold 200 to 300
guns on the streets of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 138 firearms linked to the dealer in Missouri have been
recovered after being used in crimes in the Washington area,
including homicide and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Johnson, the undersecretary for enforcement at the
Treasury Department, called this effort ``finding the criminal
behind the criminal.'' Johnson said that the Clinton administration
would ``continue to push for strong legislation'' from Congress,
particularly dealing with the so-called gun show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt gun dealers were associated with the most guns diverted
to traffickers, the study found, but gun shows were also a major
channel. The gun shows accounted for the second highest number of
trafficked guns per investigation, 130, and for about 26,000
illegally diverted firearms. The investigations involved licensed
and unlicensed sellers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``No set of measures will ever eliminate access by all criminals
to firearms,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``every case against a gun trafficker
contributes to the reduction of gun violence.''

EPA TO ASSESS IF CONTAMINATED SPORTS FIELD IMPERILS HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADRIANNE APPEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The Environmental Protection Agency is
investigating whether the contamination of a children's athletic
field in a bustling neighborhood on the outskirts of this city
poses an immediate health risk.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also plans to look into the risks of the
contamination at a nearby 27-acre site where W.R. Grace and Co.
employs 350 people at the headquarters of its construction products
division.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, a consultant for a neighborhood
association here found concentrations of asbestos 6 inches or more
below the surface of the grassy athletic field. But athletic teams,
including a Little League squad sponsored by W.R. Grace, have
continued to play soccer and baseball on the field, which abuts a
bicycle path and a heavily traveled subway stop.
</P>
<P>
   City officials in Cambridge said they had allowed people to use
the field because tests found only trace amounts of asbestos. There
was no risk to health, they said, because the asbestos was buried
beneath a layer of topsoil.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals and building materials,
has acknowledged that its property a few feet from the field is
contaminated with asbestos, chemicals and heavy metals. Grace says
the materials pose no danger, but it announced this month that it
was shelving plans to build a hotel and office complex on the site.
Grace said it would cooperate with federal and local efforts to
remove the pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The land has a lengthy industrial history. It was owned for a
time by a company that was trying to develop a new type of brake
lining made with asbestos. That company was bought 46 years ago by
Grace, which then used the site for corporate offices, chemical
manufacturing and a laboratory that tested fireproofing materials
containing asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Stanton, a senior EPA official in New England, said
the agency would assess the level of pollution on the field and the
Grace property over the next few months to determine if there was
``an immediate threat to human health.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they think the contamination of the playing
field dates from the late 1970s, when the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority extended a subway line through the Grace
property.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge allowed the transit authority to store equipment and
some contaminated soil, called ``acid sludge,'' on the playing
field, according to Robert Healy, Cambridge city manager, who was
deputy city manager and acting director of public health at the
time of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the transportation authority agreed to rebuild the
field using soil excavated during the subway project, Healy said.
He said it was known at the time that the dirt was laced with
chemicals and heavy metals. The authority, Healy said, agreed to
clean it to safe levels.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they saw no reason at the time to demand
that the soil be checked for asbestos contamination. ``You don't
usually look for it unless it's suspected of being disposed,'' said
Stanton of the EPA. The waste was covered with 6 inches of topsoil,
which was planted with grass.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the athletic field surfaced in the mid-1980s,
when Grace proposed building a hotel and office complex on its
property, stirring local opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a neighborhood association said former Grace
employees had told them that the nearby offices had been used for
asbestos testing.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the neighborhood feared that construction would stir up
clouds of asbestos and other contaminants, and demanded testing of
both the Grace property and the field.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has said that its tests of the property found asbestos at
varying depths. The levels of asbestos in the samples varied, and
in one sample making up 12 percent of the soil's weight, Grace
said. The EPA considers a concentration of 1 percent to be a
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant hired by the neighborhood group found patches of
asbestos 6 inches or more beneath the athletic field with
concentrations as much as 11 percent. The City of Cambridge's test
detected only trace amounts at the field but did find hazardous
levels of chemicals and heavy metals like lead and copper.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lipson, Cambridge's director of public health, said the
findings created a dilemma for the city. Any effort to clean the
soil of the chemicals and heavy metals would stir up the asbestos,
which, Lipson said, does not threaten public health because it is
buried.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, a spokesman for Grace, said the asbestos on
its property probably came from demolition of the several buildings
at the site that had asbestos insulation. ``There could have been
testing that went on,'' Corcoran said, referring to the laboratory
work at the site. ``But more likely it's from our buildings or
renovations.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace acknowledged to state officials two years ago that it had
occasionally tested asbestos products at the site in the 1960s and
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said the asbestos on the Grace property in Cambridge
posed no danger because it was covered by grass, plants or
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   And several company documents made public as a result of
environmental lawsuits note that vermiculite, a mineral that
contains asbestos, was sent to the ``Cambridge quality assurance
laboratory'' for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said the EPA inquiry was part of a nationwide
examination of Grace's handling of asbestos, an ingredient of
fireproofing products it sold in the United States from the early
1960s until the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's review of W.R. Grace operations was prompted by
disclosures late last year that a large number of company employees
had died of respiratory illnesses characteristic of exposure to
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Grace made insulation and other building products from
vermiculite, a mineral that often contains asbestos. The EPA is
investigating the illnesses and deaths of Grace workers who handled
vermiculite in mines and factories around the country. Asbestos is
known to cause lung and other cancers, and is considered dangerous
when airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's decision to drop the hotel project has not assuaged the
fears in the neighborhood about the safety of the athletic field.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge officials have told Grace and the transit authority
that they may be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is, why was a playing field used as a staging
area for toxic waste?'' said Joe Joseph, one of the organizers of
the group opposing the project.

 &HT;    Big changes in small town, USA
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Ala. _ Sharon Denson moved away from the smokestacks of
Birmingham and came here for peace and tranquillity. ``Small Town,
USA,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one locked their doors. For generations, local fortunes clung
to bales of cotton and a tiny railroad depot. Nearby Logan Martin
Lake made for good bass fishing and a serene view.
</P>
<P>
   By the time her husband retired from a nearby fire department,
Denson wanted to have a business established in the town of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   She drew $12,600 from an equity line on her house nearly two
years ago to rent space and buy supplies at the vacant Dairyland
burger joint. The white brick building sits near the intersection
of U.S. 78 and Ala. 77 _ a couple of two-lane highways.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, customers take up six orange vinyl chairs at the
counter and chow down on the $4.89 specials _ country-fried steak,
three vegetables, a drink and corn bread. Regulars wish she'd serve
fried green tomatoes more often. In her red NASCAR apron, Denson
greets almost everyone by name.
</P>
<P>
   Like many places in the rural South, jobs have been the only
thing missing from the country utopia. If they can find it, people
revel in $7-an-hour pay. The county's median household income is
$25,777 a year _ $1,580 less than the state average, according to
the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, economic salvation rolled into town with front-wheel
drive and seating for seven. Auto giant Honda committed $440
million to turn farmland into a 1.7 million-square-foot factory to
build its Odyssey minivan, one of the hottest sellers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Honda has pushed up its timetable and plans to start production
late next year. The company has received 17,000 applications for
1,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Denson's parking lot marquee last May beckoned, ``HONDA THE
LINCOLN CAFE WELCOMES YOU.'' Denson's giddy customers talked about
getting $20-an-hour jobs with Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the town is at a crossroads. Denson and others
are caught at the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Progress, Lincoln is learning, comes with a bulldozer. In the
end, the urbanization of the small-town South costs more than
money. It can turn lifestyles upside down.
</P>
<P>
   A new bridge over a creek in town will take more than a year to
build, diverting locals from their accustomed paths.
</P>
<P>
   Farm property closer to the factory will be eaten up if a new
railroad line Honda wants installed is built to supplement the
existing one.
</P>
<P>
   The sign of the times has a decidedly sharper tongue more than a
year later. Denson's marquee now reads: THE STATE SAID 1000 FOR
CAFE WHAT DO U THINK!!
</P>
<P>
   To widen U.S. 78, the Lincoln Cafe will be demolished. The state
has offered Denson $1,000 for her business, which includes seven
tables, 24 chairs, a freezer, industrial range and a 6-foot-long
oak butcher block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I asked for was what I put into it,'' said
Denson, 46, a former assistant manager at Shoney's.
</P>
<P>
   Her landlord _ Mayor Lew Watson _ offered to move Denson to a
new location. But she balked at Watson's offer and the state buyout
because she wants to remain at the hub of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon Denson's actions are uncalled for,'' said Watson, mayor
for more than 20 years and up for re-election this fall. ``If she's
got a problem she can present her case to 12 men in a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief landowners in town, Watson said he has had no
control over what state transportation officials have offered. A
real estate appraiser by trade, Watson figures land is worth
$82,000 an acre now. It was going for about $36,000 an acre or less
before Honda came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all heard stories of big money to be paid when businesses
were relocated,'' Watson said. ``But I haven't heard of anybody
offered really big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda wants to be a good neighbor. After ground-breaking in
April, the company invited Lincoln residents to a picnic at the
Talladega Motor Speedway 15 minutes away. Honda served ribs and
chicken and put on a fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the local criticism has been leveled at government
officials, some bile has spilled onto Honda, which plans to make
120,000 Odysseys in Lincoln by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there is some inconvenience in the initial
stages, some interruption,'' said Jeffrey Smith, spokesman for
American Honda Motor Co. Inc. ``But we think the coincident
economic development will be a tide that lifts all boats in the
Lincoln area.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same intersection as the cafe, the Lincoln Pharmacy, a
gas station and Allred's garage also will be vanquished for the
wider highway. Down the road, a boat upholsterer needs to move. A
marina next to another expanding road is on the verge of closing
because its land will be eaten up. Same thing with a 7-year-old
bait and tackle shop that closed last July and sits idle with
$12,000 of goods inside.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are rumors Winn-Dixie is coming. Wal-Mart, too. Even
the town's first traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a metropolis,'' said Jeff Barnes, meat
manager at Lincoln's lone grocery store. ``It's not going to be a
small town anymore.'' Ask little Smyrna, Tenn., pumped up in the
1980s by Nissan. Once a sleepy Southern burg of 10,000 people
before the car factory, the town now has twice as many people and
tons more shops. Just outside Nashville, Smyrna was on a quick
growth path even before Nissan came to town. When industry cranked
up, it lopped off Smyrna's small-town roots.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's pay nearly tripled the minimum wage and helped kill
cattle farming in Rutherford County. Randall Matlock, former
Rutherford County finance director, said growth has even spilled 20
miles southeast to Murfreesboro, where he's a CPA today.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Matlock said, the small-town feel has ``gone by the
wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Murfreesboro used to be what we would call a 15-minute town,
where you could get from one side to the other in 15 minutes,'' he
said. ``It takes us a good half-hour to get across it now. That
tells us right there we're right smack dab in the middle of being
an urban community. Smyrna itself, you could get anywhere in five
minutes back in those days before Nissan came in. Now with Nissan
being there, it's the true 15-minute town.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Lincoln is a five-minute town.
</P>
<P>
   At Ron's BP, you can buy barbecue and crickets for a fishing
trip then drive to lunch at the cafe _ passing the coin laundry,
Dollar General Store, Town Hall and the post office all before a
country song ends on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   But that's disappearing in a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   If dump trucks thundering down the highway don't tell you that,
the ominous right-of-way stakes with fluttering pink ribbons
should. Poking from the dirt in front of the Lincoln Cafe is a
stake that shows where the shoulder of a beefed-up U.S. 78 will
extend _ through the back door of the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hare, cook at the Lincoln Cafe, came here last year to
escape a boom in small-town Pell City 10 miles from Lincoln. A
month after Hare arrived, Honda announced it was coming, too. Now
Hare faces the prospect of filing for unemployment if Denson can't
find a new place.
</P>
<P>
   One of 13 brothers and sisters, Hare and her husband bought five
acres in Lincoln ``to keep people from moving in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five acres ain't all that big,'' Hare said between stirring
panfuls of brown gravy. ``You can still hear the neighbors
hollering at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lincoln's expansion doesn't bother everybody. Ron Stickland
has run the Lincoln Pharmacy for two years. He moved from Gadsden,
where a good many workers let go by the Goodyear plant there figure
to be in the running for Honda's new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' said Strickland, a 30-year-old Auburn grad.
``It's going to be a busier place.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland hasn't had an offer yet from the state Transportation
Department but his landlord is already building him a new place
next to the town's only supermarket back away from the highway.
He'll be moved by August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be cleaner, nicer,'' Strickland said. Two buildings down
from the cafe, John Allred has run a garage since 1972. He hasn't
settled with the state yet, and he's not sure what he'll do _ but
he knows he's not going to buy another spot. ``You can't buy
property here,'' he said. ``It's too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Before excusing himself to stick his head under the hood of a
car, the 56-year-old mechanic lamented the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be good to a certain extent,'' Allred said.
``But a city the size of Lincoln can't stand the growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the cafe, at one end of the white Formica counter,
Denson has placed a 5-gallon jug and written in black marker,
``Help the state pay me for my business.'' Ones and fives line the
bottom of the clear bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has talked about opening an auto lot. ``I know how
to sell food,'' Denson said decidedly. ``I'm not selling cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cafe supplier jokes that she should buy 20 cases of napkins
with the $1,000 offered by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I order things every two weeks and I'm scared to now because I
don't know how long I'll be here,'' Denson said. ``It's just wait
and see.''

 &HT;    Bestwick's specialty is nurturing successes
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's half past six on a Monday evening and Dick
Bestwick is still in his office inside the University of Georgia's
McWhorter Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, that would not seem so unusual. But, in this case,
Bestwick is just 10 days shy of retirement. If there ever was a
time to get to work late and leave early, this would be it.
</P>
<P>
   But leaving early never has been Bestwick's style. This, after
all, is a man who will have worked full time almost until his 70th
birthday, which is in August. Besides, there's still a lot of work
to be done. It's no small task to box up a half-century's worth of
memories.
</P>
<P>
   June 30th, Bestwick will end what has been a 52-year journey
within college athletics. It began when he left his hometown of
Grove City, Pa., to attend North Carolina on a football scholarship
in 1948, and it will end here in Athens as Georgia's senior
associate athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   In between were 16 stops as a coach or athletics administrator
and enough highs and lows to make a numerous other
responsibilities; he oversaw football, basketball and baseball and
was the point man on most of Vince Dooley's major hires. But the
core of his work was in tutoring student-athletes in successful
life strategies, something he continued long after giving up the
title of associate AD for academic and athletic standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no one more committed to serving the student-athlete
than Dick,'' Dooley said. ``When necessary, he pulls no punches in
counseling them when he feels they can do better. . . . He will be
sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Pennsylvania millworker, Bestwick has always had a
soft spot for the underdog. Like any coach, he took pleasure in
seeing student-athletes achieve athletic greatness. But he took
even more in seeing the little-known reserve with poor academic
credentials earn his degree and land a good job after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native Gene Toodle, who attended Georgia on a football
scholarship from 1993-97, is one of Bestwick's success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of him I have everything I have,'' Toodle said.
``He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. There was a
point in my athletic career that I was close to giving up. But
Coach Bestwick encouraged me to stick with it and excel at other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Toodle ended up starting at linebacker his senior year in 1996
and was named a permanent team captain. He graduated in 1997 with a
degree in consumer science and now owns an office-supply business
in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cringe when I think of how close I was to quitting,'' Toodle
said. ``Every college deserves a person like Coach Bestwick.
Georgia's going to miss him; I already do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Bestick's wife of 50 years, Phyllis, no one knows
Bestwick better than Dave Braine. The Georgia Tech AD, 12 years
Bestwick's junior, grew up next door to him in Grove City, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Bestwick used to baby-sit Braine _ even changed his diapers _
and coached Braine all four years at Grove City High.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part of my life he pin virtually every role he has
filled with the exception of the brief period he spent as athletics
director at South Carolina. It lasted less than two years and
resulted in him being hospitalized with stress-related health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to solve all the problems at once, and there were
a lot of problems,'' Bestwick said. ``The president (Dr. Jim
Holderman) suggested that I see a physician and get something to
help me sleep. The next thing I know I'm taking 16 pills a day. A
short time later, I had lost 40 pounds, had internal bleeding and
was in the hospital for 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bestwick ``asked to be relieved'' of his AD duties and served
South Carolina as system administrator for athletics for a short
while before Dooley lured him back to Georgia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bestwick has never really settled down, but he has spent more
time in the state of Georgia, 22 years, than he has anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been (at UGA) the longest of any the places I've worked,
and Georgia Tech the second-longest,'' Bestwick said, ``Both of
them have been blessings. My wife and family loved Atlanta, and we
love it here. I may be the only guy in Georgia who loves both
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   As for retirement, Bestwick enters into it grudgingly. He plans
to write a book based on the hundreds of letters he has received
from former players over the years, and he wants to play a lot of
golf and travel. But he believes he still has something to offer
college athletics and would consider consulting or part-time work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some misgivings about (retirement) but my wife probably
has more,'' he said. ``I still enjoy young people as much as I ever
did. It's been a fascinating ride, very interesting.''

IN SAN FRANCISCO, MORE LIVE _ AND DIE _ ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carmen Ramirez knew people. Born and bred in
Managua, Nicaragua, she adopted San Francisco like a doting mother,
protecting and fighting for her neighborhood in a way that captured
the ear of City Hall. But she lived alone and died last month the
same way. By the time anyone noticed her absence, she had been
dead, at age 54, for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Lola McKay knew people too. McKay, an 83-year-old widow, became
a symbol for tenants' rights when she refused to leave her
apartment on 30 days' notice. For eight years, she was the last
tenant in a six-unit building in San Francisco's gentrifying
Mission District. Her case prompted a change in state law,
requiring that landlords give elderly and disabled tenants a year's
notice before eviction.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, died as she lived. Her body was discovered in March,
weeks after her death. And so it was with Howard Phillips, 50, who
was known on the streets as Allah, a man on close terms with the
bottle. In March he died in his small housing authority apartment
from complications of alcoholism. His body was not discovered until
it was in an advanced state of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the bodies are piling up faster than the city
can handle them. More people are dying alone, with no one to
arrange their funerals, settle their estates or mourn their
passing. So far this year, 275 people in the city have died this
way, said city officials, compared with about 300 a year for the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly why. Officials here say it is too soon to
tell whether this is a sign of times to come, here and in the rest
of the aging nation. (Officials in New York and Los Angeles report
no such increase in the number of people dying alone.)
</P>
<P>
   But census figures reveal part of the story. In San Francisco,
19 percent of the population is over 65, compared with 14 percent
in other major cities. The city has an average household size of
1.29 people, well below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a high number of people whose partners have died of
AIDS. San Francisco, boomtown that it is, is also a place where
poor, old people are facing what the public administrator, the
official responsible for settling the estates of those who die
alone, calls ``urban stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of old people worried that they're going to be
evicted from the apartment they've lived in for 30 years,'' said
Ricardo Hernandez, the public administrator. The old people have
heard all the stories of even well-to-do people unable to find an
apartment in the city's surreal, Silicon Valley-fueled housing
market. ``We think that at least in some cases, this is shortening
people's lives,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people dying alone is climbing as more homeless
people have been dying on the streets of San Francisco over the
last five years. Last year, 169 homeless people died on the
streets, and so far this year, 78 of the 290 people who have died
alone were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that more people are living, and dying, on
the streets, as affordable housing throughout the San Francisco Bay
area becomes harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   When indigent people die alone, the medical examiner arranges
for their cremation, unless the person was known to belong to a
religion that dictates that the body be buried. Basic funerals and
a plot in Colma, a town south of San Francisco where many city
residents are buried (the city has no cemeteries), cost $7,000;
cremations generally cost about $700.
</P>
<P>
   When the deceased leaves even minimal assets, the public
administrator handles the funeral arrangements and begins a
sometimes long process of searching for next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes bodies lie for months in the city morgue as officials
search for heirs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Carmen Ramirez, whose cause of death is still
being determined, officials found several relatives in the Bay
area, who arranged for her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   That is the exception. The public administrator said his office
was often left scrambling to find a relative _ any relative, no
matter how remote _ to decide where and how a deceased person would
be buried and where the person's belongings would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remind everybody to leave a will,'' Rodriguez said,
``if it's just a little note on a piece of paper that says I want
so-and-so to have my china.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a room marked ``vault,'' with boxes of personal papers
belonging to those whose families have not yet been found. The
boxes, piled floor to ceiling on metal shelves, contain the sum
total of many lives _ diplomas, yearbooks, military certificates,
photo albums, love letters, Christmas cards. The county saves them
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold onto them,'' said John Clark, deputy to the public
administrator, as he sighed over a weathered black-and-white photo,
at least 50 years old, of a boy kneeling next to a wire-haired
terrier, ``because maybe some relative somewhere will value the
memories.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 This article was reported by David Barstow, C.J. Chivers, Juan
Forero, Sarah Kershaw and Nina Siegal and written by Barstow.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each time a police cruiser passed, someone in the
game room screamed a curse. Mother this, mother that, on and on.
They cranked the rap music to seismic levels, as if the lyrics _
something about ``cracker cops'' _ might make the police leave them
alone. But still, the cruisers came. And then an unmarked Taurus
went by. And then a police van with four officers passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was driving the teen-agers nuts. They said they felt like
ghetto lab rats. The night before, officers had raided the game
room, a dim, grungy hole of a place on the edge of the Van Dyke
projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Hunting for drugs, the officers
had smashed open the pool table, and Qyntel Smith, 19, said she had
been hit by pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the sun setting, Smith and her friends stood at the
game room entrance making highly impolite gestures at passing
police cars. A few officers scowled and responded in kind, making
clear their professional assessments of the game room's young
patrons. But Smith had an assessment, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops,'' she said, ``are not backing off. Not one bit.
Never will. It's still Giuliani time.''
</P>
<P>
   Across New York City, in the drug holes and seedy side streets
and shadowy hot spots where crime incubates, the police department
continues to be seen as an aggressive force that has not retreated
_ not one small inch _ from its kitchen-sink strategy of attacking
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with some 200 people in all five boroughs, this
view was repeated again and again _ by young gang members and tired
ex-cons, by prostitutes and bodega owners, by scrawny heroin
addicts and by public housing tenants. In short, most of those who
have substantial contact with police officers do not share the
suddenly popular perception that the police department has relaxed
its enforcement tactics in the face of severe criticism.
</P>
<P>
   That perception gained force with the rise in murders, including
the Wendy's massacre and the slayings of livery drivers. It
gathered more force last week with the fallout from the frenzied
Central Park sexual assaults after the National Puerto Rican Day
Parade. Though hundreds of citations were written for public
drinking, there were reports of officers ignoring rampant drug and
alcohol abuse, and some officers have asserted that the behavior
was tolerated to avoid provoking Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   True or not _ and police officials say it is not _ people who
live and work in New York City's roughest neighborhoods seem
largely in agreement that they do not see any newfound tolerance of
crime. With remarkable consistency, these residents told similar
stories of facing intense scrutiny from undercover officers, of
continuing to be ticketed and arrested for minor offenses, of
officers sweeping through housing projects and parks, asking for
identification and patting down pockets.
</P>
<P>
   For some, especially young black and Hispanic men, these stories
were told with a sense of persecution. But for others, particularly
homeowners and the elderly, the stories were told with relief _ so
great was their concern that the police might be allowing
complacency or criticism to dampen vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of these residents cited firsthand experience. Cheryl, a
prostitute working the other night in Brooklyn, said she was
arrested just last week. ``And they'll be back,'' she said. On
Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, a homeless alcoholic said he
was ticketed two weeks ago for public drinking. Hector Rodriguez,
24, a security guard at a housing project in East Harlem, said he
had recently been given a summons for loitering. On some blocks,
just about everyone seems to have a story of a recent brush with
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, their observations offer an imperfect
street-level snapshot of the department's recent performance. Yet
in precinct after precinct, these individual accounts are supported
by the most recent arrest statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is the 75th Precinct, by far the most violent
precinct in Brooklyn. In the 75th, which covers East New York,
arrests are up 27.7 percent, to 7,220 this year from 5,652 at this
time last year. Major crimes are down 11.3 percent. The same
pattern _ more arrests, more summonses, fewer crimes _ can be found
throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   As police officials are quick to note, none of this is new. For
years, they have been pursuing the same strategy: using computer
analysis of crime reports to identify trouble spots; sending in
special teams of undercover officers to attack crime in those
areas; relentlessly punishing minor offenses to set a tone of
orderliness in the neighborhood. For all the criticism, for all the
concerns raised about racial profiling, for all the protests over
Louima and Diallo and Dorismond, this basic strategy thus far
remains unchanged _ a fact reflected by arrest statistics and, now,
by the experiences of some 200 residents living in neighborhoods
struggling with poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   To back off now, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, would be
to repudiate the central tenets of the city's policing strategy, a
strategy that has coincided with steep declines in all measures of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't stay here if we were backing off,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also disputed that there had been any unspoken retreat by
the rank and file, noting that his department had made 21,000 more
arrests this year than it had last year at this time. ``That's not
indicative of a police force that is falling asleep or backing
off,'' he said.
</P>

   In the neighborhoods that suffer the most from drugs and
violence, there is a familiar cycle to crime and policing and
public perception. It begins with a recognition of how far the
neighborhoods have come from the bad old days of mayhem, and close
behind is a deep fear of sliding back to that time. The result is a
sort of heightened communal vigilance for the latest flare spots,
and a general impatience for the police to get things under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case last week in Mount Hope, a tiny neighborhood
just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway in the South Bronx, where
crack gangs once ruled. For some time now, retirees there have
complained to the 46th Precinct police about drug dealing in front
of a row house at Topping Avenue and East 175th Street. Their
complaints were part of a broader restlessness, a sense that the
police were not doing enough to preserve the gains of the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to pass by and they'd see a group of people
loitering and they'd tell them, `Stop,''' said Edwin L. Santana,
45, a truck driver who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years.
``They would check and say, `What are you guys doing here?'''
</P>
<P>
   And this is how Jay Nunez, 17, and his buddies came to have such
a rough time of it on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the police came around, officers jumped from
their patrol car, forced Nunez and his friends against a fence and
patted them down for drugs. The officers left empty-handed, the
young men said. But the next time the officers swooped down, they
ticketed Randy Figueroa, one of Nunez's companions, for drinking a
beer on the street. At other times, the police in marked or
unmarked cars and vans simply rolled by.
</P>
<P>
   The men denied they were selling drugs, though John Ramirez, 21,
said he was on parole for heroin dealing and Nunez said he had been
arrested for possession of marijuana. ``It's nothing,'' Nunez said.
``You spend the night in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., the police were back yet again, this time in an
unmarked white van. Four burly officers peered at the young men.
``Yo! Yo! What'chu looking at?'' one young man yelled. The others
jeered, slapping each other and laughing. Nunez chimed in: ``Yeah,
that's right, we're talking about you, pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bravado did not mask their agitation. The corner may
have its rewards, but now, because of the police, it carried a
price. Getting searched for drugs is a nightly occurrence.
Figueroa, 22, complained that he was ticketed on this night for
parking his red sports car too close to the corner. Suddenly,
another unmarked police car, a black sedan, drove past. ``Here,
they go again,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the year, officers in the 46th Precinct have
handed out twice as many summonses as they did by this time last
year. Arrests for drugs and other crimes are way up. But all this
extra effort leads to another part of the familiar cycle _
simmering resentment from young people who have no criminal record
but feel like targets. ``They see you with chains, they think
you're selling drugs,'' said Jose Alvarez, 19, as he fiddled with
the speakers and amplifiers in his Acura. ``They don't know young
people get up in the morning just like they do and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who said he works at Toys ``R'' Us in Mount Olive,
N.J., complained about being stopped again and again by the police
in Mount Hope and asked about drugs. He complained about being
ticketed for playing his music too loud, about being harassed for
simply hanging out with friends. ``They bother you for
everything,'' he said. ``If I stand in front of that building, they
come and tell you to move. If you don't move, they arrest you.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Across the city, just north of Kennedy Airport, the same pattern
has played out on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, a street that cuts
through the 113th Precinct in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, serious crimes are up about 6 percent,
evoking bad memories. The precinct has responded with a 21 percent
increase in arrests, and a 51 percent increase in criminal
summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Moore, a barber on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, does not know
the numbers, but he has been around long enough, 10 years, to have
a sixth sense for his neighborhood's rhythms. He senses that crime
has been creeping back. He also senses that the precinct has
responded forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he complained, officers have kept pulling him
over, asking for his identification and registration. Certainly, he
said, he does not want the neighborhood to slip back into the old
mess, but neither does he want ham-fisted policing. And so, he
said, he feels stuck between two unpleasant alternatives: wanting
police protection yet resenting its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not upset by just seeing the police,'' he said, ``but it's
the nitpicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, in Jamaica, perceptions about the police
department are being subtly shaped by local tactical decisions that
have nothing to do with City Hall politics, or with protests by the
Rev. Al Sharpton, or with the latest police shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica, the department's practice of concentrating officers
on hot spots has created a remarkable situation in which two
neighborhoods barely two miles apart have entirely different
notions about the department's level of aggressiveness. In one
neighborhood, a short strip off Hillside Avenue, some residents and
merchants feel all but abandoned. In the other neighborhood, near
Jamaica Avenue, some residents feel an overwhelming police
presence.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, a little history: Several years back, gangs
and drug dealers swarmed along Hillside. The police responded in
force, harassing and arresting the dealers and gang members until
the corner was clear. Residents were overjoyed; shopkeepers could
not believe their good fortune. With a job well done, police
commanders pulled officers out and sent them to the next hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   For a time all was well. Then Luis Cruz, the owner of One Touch
Transmission, found his shop burglarized. Then it happened again,
and again after that. Nurul M. Islam, owner of a small grocery
store, began to see more thieves in his store. Only a few months
ago, he said, a drunken man stumbled in and began smashing bottles.
And then Lori Vargas, a resident, realized that she no longer felt
safe walking outside at night. ``There's no one out there,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To their eyes, the department had backed off. In fact, the
police have been preoccupied with a new hot spot off Jamaica
Avenue. Residents there had been complaining about drug dealers
operating out of the Crystal Houses, a run-down housing project on
191st Street.
</P>
<P>
   For residents in that area, this has brought a heavy police
presence. Officers have set up motorist checkpoints to inspect
licenses and registrations. They often park a patrol car near the
Crystal Houses. ``The place is crawling with cops,'' said Paul
Chester, who lives not far away. ``They stop you for anything now.
They are all over the place. You can see them lurking around,
slowing down and checking this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, a dozen or so young men were gathered in
front of the Crystal Houses. Smoking marijuana and drinking beer
out of brown paper bags, they complained of the constant police
presence on their ``front lawn.'' Most of them said they had been
arrested at least once, for minor drug offenses or disorderly
conduct. Several said they had been in court in just the last week.
``If they could arrest you for spitting in the street, they would
arrest you every time you spat in the street,'' said Derramius
Edwards, 22, who described himself as a music major at
Queensborough Community College.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight approached, two detectives approached in an unmarked
car. They stopped when they got to Edwards and his friends. The
detective on the passenger side stared at Edwards but said nothing.
The car moved on. Twenty minutes later, another unmarked car crept
down the street, this one carrying five detectives. It, too, paused
by Edwards and then kept going. Just before midnight, the first car
returned, stopping in the same place. The detective in the
passenger seat slowly shined a flashlight across their faces.
Nobody said a word. The car drove on. Edwards and company stayed
put.
</P>
<P>

   There are forsaken places in the city where the pressure from
the police has been so relentless and longstanding that logic
itself has been inverted by the criminals. These are the places
where the police are seen as the cause of criminal activity, so
smothering and inflexible that they make it impossible for a man to
go straight. They are neighborhoods where the hostility is so
seeped in that it is difficult for ordinary residents to express
even mild support for the department's aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And so an elderly Hispanic woman who lives on a drug-ravaged
street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, whispered from her living room
window Wednesday night that it was no good to say anything about
the police. And in the Manhattanville housing project in Harlem, a
21-year-old man named Cgod Godallah, better known by his nickname,
Can't Get Right, somehow finds fault with the police for arresting
him yet again. ``We were hanging out, just chilling, smoking some
weed,'' he said, as if all he was doing was drinking a glass of
milk. And in Washington Square Park, a stoned 21-year-old drug
dealer who called himself Smoke, ran about raging against the
police, shouting, ``Before I die I'm going to blow up a precinct!''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, in the shade of a housing project in the Clifton
section of Staten Island, a 38-year-old ex-convict named Eric
quietly raged, too, blaming the police scrutiny for driving him
back to crime. ``They come out and ask for your identification and
find out who's on parole, and then they target you,'' he said.
``They bring you in saying, you did this before and you must be
doing it again. Well, nine out of 10 of us have a record. So it's
easy for them. They're just pushing you and pushing you until you
do end up breaking the law. They're jumping down on us, and it
makes you want to throw a brick.''

FIRST LADY LEADING IN STAR-BUCKS RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The stars are coming out for Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Federal Election Commission data on campaign
contributions show that Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democratic
candidate to represent New York in the U.S. Senate, has hijacked
the celebrity spotlight from Al Gore, her party's presidential
candidate, and his Republican challenger, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The who's who of Tinseltown that backed President Clinton in
1992 and 1996 now appears to be allied with his better half. Name
your medium and most of its notables have bought into Hillary
Clinton's campaign, which has so far raked in $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood people tend to attach themselves to somebody they
can identify with,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group
specializing in campaign finance. ``They (the president and first
lady) just seem to connect with Hollywood types.''
</P>
<P>
   Her contributors include movie power couple Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman, former ``Wonder Woman'' star Lynda Carter, veteran
actor Paul Newman and rap artist Sean ``Puffy'' Combs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's star power swamped her former foe, New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, who nevertheless bested her in fund raising with a total
of $19.3 million. But his very short star list included Charlton
Heston, currently the Moses of the National Rifle Association, and
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' actor Chuck Norris.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani dropped out of the race last month due to health
problems, he offered to return contributions and also asked that
donors shift their dollars to his successor, Rep. Rick Lazio,
R-N.Y. The most recent FEC records - which date to May 20 - do not
yet reflect the change in the GOP's New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's galaxy of backers also outshines Gore, whose
limited array of stars includes Harrison Ford, who set the screen
standard for presidential heroics in ``Air Force One,'' as well as
Tom Hanks and Nicholas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lineup is positively anemic: Pat Boone, the clean-cut
crooner, and Edward Kerr, a regular on TV's long-canceled
``SeaQuest.'' The actor who was arguably Bush's best-known
Hollywood donor, 1940s and '50s beefcake star Victor Mature, died
in August at age 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollywood crowd in general has always been more Democratic
than Republican,'' Makinson said. ``That's especially true for
actors and actresses. The moguls, on the other hand, vote their
business interests and support candidates or parties that back
their issues.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who is celebrating on election night, Disney Chairman
Michael Eisner will likely be on the invitation list. Eisner has
covered all of his presidential bases, giving $1,000 each to Bush,
Gore and former candidates John McCain, Bill Bradley and Orrin
Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's wife, Jane, whose FEC filing forms list her as a
Burbank homemaker and president of the couple's charitable Eisner
Foundation, also gave $1,000 each to Bush, McCain, Gore and
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is a nonpartisan company. We support the democratic
process,'' Eisner said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The company also knows who its friends are, as evidenced by
Eisner's donation to Hatch, whose presidential campaign was among
the shortest of the GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
sponsored a bill that gave Disney a 20-year extension on its
treasured copyrights for Mickey Mouse, Pluto and Goofy. Hatch is
now the Senate's point man on efforts to stem piracy of
intellectual properties on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan giving is also the rule for the Walt Disney
Productions Employees Political Action Committee, which has spread
$90,741 among Republicans and Democrats. The same goes for PACs run
by Universal Studios ($93,750) and the Motion Picture Association
of America ($51,286), Hollywood's premiere lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   But some moguls have a partisan record. DreamWorks SKG partners
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen gave all of
their individual and corporate contributions, totaling more than
$600,000, to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Stars of the big screen greatly outnumber TV types on the
contributor rolls, with some notable exceptions. Ted Danson, one of
the tube's biggest spenders, chipped in $5,000 for Hillary Clinton.
Jerry Seinfeld gave $1,000 each to Bradley and Gore. Regis Philbin
also backed Bradley's failed effort. Kathie Lee Gifford, Philbin's
soon-to-depart morning co-host, supported Elizabeth Dole, an early
GOP presidential dropout.
</P>
<P>
   Within the ranks of screen and TV stars, Makinson noted that,
broadly speaking, ``gun-toting heroes like John Wayne have tended
to vote Republican. The rest vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. Actor Warren Beatty, who briefly toyed
with the idea of making the quantum leap from fictional Sen. Jay W.
Bullworth to the White House, cast his lot with Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Also responding to a different drummer are singer Barry Manilow
and actor Christian Slater, who have contributed to the campaign of
Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   The local candidate getting the most buzz from Hollywood is
state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, who is locked in a high-stakes,
high-dollar House race with incumbent Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's take includes $1,000 each from DreamWorks' Spielberg,
Katzenberg and Geffen, and another grand from
singer-actress-director Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't quite understand why there's so much star support for
Mr. Schiff,'' said Rogan's campaign manager, Jason Roe. ``(Rogan's)
been in their corner on every issue including copyright protections
and runaway production as a member of the House Judiciary
Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Roe cites another Rogan role on the Judiciary panel as the cause
of his Hollywood problem - Rogan's highly visible position as a
leading prosecutor in last year's move to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an impeachment thing,'' Roe said. ``We didn't see this
kind of support for an opponent in 1998 when the congressman
defeated Barry Gordon, a former president of the Screen Actors
Guild.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schiff campaign had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   A notable no-show on Schiff's star-laden list is actor Steven
Hill, who plays Manhattan District Attorney Adam Schiff on NBC-TV's
``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan remains far out in front of Schiff in the fund-raising
derby, having amassed $3.8 million to the challenger's $1.9
million. But the closest thing to a star on Rogan's long list of
contributors is William Hurt. Alas, Rogan's Hurt, a $1,000 donor,
is a successful Los Angeles investment banker and not the
heartthrob of the film ``Broadcast News.''
</P>
<P>
   Roe said that in recent weeks Rogan picked up a bit of star
backing, getting $1,000 from director Oliver Stone and winning $200
of game-show star Ben Stein's money. However, neither of those
contributions has yet appeared on reports filed with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, who has also worked to
protect Hollywood's output from copyright pirates, is backed by
three Oscar winners: actors Richard Dreyfuss and Michael Douglas
and director Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow San Fernando Valley Democrat Brad Sherman, D-Woodland
Hills, has a short star list featuring actress Catherine Bach. The
Sherman Oaks resident made abbreviated cutoffs famous during her
stint as Daisy Duke on the 1970s TV series ``The Dukes of Hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, former Eagles rocker Don Henley is the most
politically active music maker in Campaign 2000. He has shelled out
$17,500 to a variety of candidates, including Gore, Hillary
Clinton, Schiff and Rep. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's own man in the White House has so far kept his
checkbook shut. Actor Martin Sheen, who plays President Josiah
Bartlett on NBC's ``The West Wing,'' has made no contributions to
real-life politicians during the latest reporting period, according
to FEC records.

OFFICIALS CRACK DOWN ON FARMERS MARKET ABUSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ORITH GOLDBERG AND DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Organic farmer Betty Kennedy has watched with
anger how corporate growers have infiltrated local farmers markets
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't compete with the big rigs that roll into some of
these markets and try to come across as small farmers,'' said
Kennedy, co-owner of the Kennedys With Harvest Pride farm in
Fresno. ``It's not fair - and it shouldn't be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   With farmers markets popping up in one community after another,
state officials promise this summer will be different.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed team of inspectors is hitting farmers markets to
make sure big-time farmers stay out and that produce is
California-grown by small growers. They also will look for
entrepreneurs trying to make a fast buck with store-bought produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in having family-owned small farms at the
market,'' said Marion Kalb, market development specialist for the
Southland Farmers Market Association, which includes 60 markets in
the Los Angeles area. ``That's the whole idea of the market: to
provide an alternative to the commercial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Lax enforcement in previous years has led to abuse, which
customers say they've noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large produce growers use so much pesticide,'' said Debbie
Brier, a Northridge resident who was visiting the market after work
and picking out fresh produce. Her bags already were laden with
green vegetables. ``Here you feel like you're buying real food.
Plus, you get to try free samples.''
</P>
<P>
   Under rules enacted more than two decades ago, growers who sell
at state Certified Farmers Markets are exempt from state
regulations that apply to other food vendors. This waiver makes it
economical for them to do business.
</P>
<P>
   They may sell fruit and vegetables too small to be sold in
stores, need not package their products individually and may get
them to market any way they can. Without such exemptions, farmers
say, they couldn't make enough profit to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   But in return, farmers promise to sell only food grown in
California and to staff the stalls themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the markets honest, however, has largely failed for lack
of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the funding wasn't enough, the state could only allow
so much time to go toward enforcement,'' said Janice Price, program
supervisor overseeing farmers markets for the CDFA.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Legislature passed a bill that now requires
every producer to pay a 60-cent-a-day fee to support inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of Assembly Bill 593, authored by Virginia
Strom-Martin, D-Santa Rosa, is expected to provide $250,000 to
$350,000 for inspectors to visit the markets and ensure that
vendors are properly certified.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would go to Costco and buy fruits and sell them as
fresh from the farm,'' said Strom-Martin's chief of staff, Robyn
Boyer-Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-cent fee can either be absorbed by market operators or
passed on to their vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is expected to fund a full-time supervisor and support
staffers who will provide direction, training and oversight of the
inspections conducted throughout the 58 counties offering farmers
markets. The 60-cent fee will not lead to more inspections in each
county, but the state's full-time supervisor will be expected to
follow up on investigations and provide better oversight for the
inspection programs, said Los Angeles County deputy agricultural
commissioner David Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, about 35 inspectors check each farmers
market at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors issue more than 100 violations each year, according
to Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, abusers supplement their produce with store-bought
produce, a problem that can be difficult to spot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection process is made more difficult when producers
have multiple markets in multiple counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we suspect abuse in another county, I, as a county
employee, would call my peer in the adjoining county and ask for
assistance,'' Kruger said. ``But there is no guarantee it will be
timely or thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   Abusers may be fined and have their privilege to sell suspended
or revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Kalb said market operators have a responsibility to make sure
their vendors are properly certified and that their certificates
are placed at the point of sale.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking certification are required to fill out an
application and list where they are growing their product.
Investigators go to the location where the foods are grown to
ensure that potential vendors are growing what they intend to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get it done within a week,'' said deputy
agricultural commissioner Dennis Vinopal.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors who break the rules could lose permission to sell and be
fined up to $1,000, Vinopal said.
</P>
<P>
   At the newly opened farmers market at the Westfield Shoppingtown
Promenade, sellers said they don't mind the fee because it ensures
they have a place to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for everybody because then we will all be on the
same page,'' said 22-year-old Jeff Watkins, who has sold produce
and passion fruit at farmers markets for the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Volumes of business people from nearby businesses packed the
market, brightening the day for Frankie Peterson, a vendor who
sells decorated dishes and chenille-decorated clothes at both the
Promenade and the Northridge Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so busy,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people during
the lunch break, which was really, really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Valley, farmers markets continue to draw droves
of people seeking quality food at reasonable costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Northridge Farmers Market and Festival, in its second year,
draws large crowds during its hours from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the
parking lot of the Northridge Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hoover, a carpenter from Northridge, says he can find a
better selection of fresh food there at good prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually talk to the people who grew the food,'' said
Hoover, 29, after purchasing dried fruit, sprouts and greens from a
stand. ``I try to eat all organic and try different things.''

TROUBLES BUILD AS COLOMBIANS AWAIT NEW AID FROM U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The United States is committing more than $1
billion to Colombia's struggle against drug trafficking and armed
groups responsible for drug production just as the government here
is stumbling politically, and the national police chief who helped
smash the Cali cartel and did most to win U.S. trust in his
country's efforts has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package, likely to total $1.3 billion after the
Senate approved it on Wednesday, foresees reduced reliance on the
115,000-strong National Police and more on the armed forces. But
the retiring police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, and his men
would never have been called upon to lead the counternarcotics
fight in the past had Washington not harbored grave doubts about
the fighting ability and human rights record of the Colombian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   And President Andres Pastrana, approaching the midpoint of his
four-year term, is under increasing fire here after losing key
aides, including his interior minister, chief of staff and chief
negotiator with the rebels who have taken over drug production and
made increasing inroads here. Public patience with the president's
failure to make a deal with leftist guerrillas who have been
battling the government for decades is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, 58, was praised by his supporters on Capitol Hill as
``the best cop in the world.'' He stepped down on Friday, having
announced earlier this month that he was retiring because ``I have
been to so many police officers' funerals that I can't bear
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 police officers have been killed since 1994 in this
country, which has a murder rate about 10 times higher than that of
the United States and, with more than 3,000 abductions in 1999, the
highest kidnapping rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are convinced that the drug war is being waged
at the expense of their own security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggravation of drug trafficking and the armed conflict
have translated into the police directing their priorities to the
defense of the state and its institutions,'' said Alvaro Camacho,
director of the Institute of Political Studies at the National
University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the police's ``role of supporting the
citizenry has been debilitated,'' and they ``have become an actor
in the war, separated from the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of such sentiments, Colombia's defense minister,
Luis Fernando Ramirez, applauds Washington's decision to step up
its involvement in Colombia's battle against drugs as ``a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy underlying the aid package, which President Clinton
is expected to sign early next month, calls for greater use of the
Colombian armed forces in ``source interdiction'' and envisions a
reduced role for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The primary burden of fighting the drug war will now fall on
three new anti-narcotics battalions created in the armed forces
with U.S. money and training. Ramirez, in an interview at his
Defense Ministry headquarters on Friday, dismissed any doubts that
these new units are ready to do battle with the leftist guerrillas
and right-wing paramilitary units that now play dominant roles in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a dilemma,'' he said. ``Either it can
give us the tools and let us do the job, or the international
community takes charge of a problem that is growing out of hand. I
think the United States has made the correct decision by giving us
the tools we need to do our work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a transition taking place without much trauma,'' Ramirez
said of Serrano's retirement. ``It is basically the same team of
generals in anti-narcotics and the other areas, very much trained
by Serrano and very much in line with the way we have been
working'' since Pastrana took office nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Serrano is stepping down as many of the spectacular
gains made against drug trafficking early in his 5 1/2 tenure have
been erased. Cocaine production has more than doubled in the last
five years despite a U.S.-financed program of spraying from the air
to eradicate coca crops _ a program that is supposed to expand
significantly when U.S. Blackhawk and Huey helicopters, the most
costly items in the new aid package, begin arriving in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's personal popularity, based on his folksy manner and
image of integrity, had dissolved much of the popular discontent
over lawlessness and bolstered U.S. confidence in Colombia's
ability to fight its end of the narcotics war, which is fed by drug
use and addiction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The general organized and led the raids that smashed the Cali
cartel and imprisoned scores of other drug traffickers on
Washington's most-wanted list. He also dismissed 11,400 of his own
officers, turning what had been a corrupt and often brutal force
into a tough and trim fighting unit that the United States
cultivated as a welcome alternative to an incompetent army and the
cartel-financed presidency of Ernesto Samper, Pastrana's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serrano delivered the goods and in many ways was a moral
leader for Colombia at a time the country badly needed one, and he
was tireless and entirely committed to the anti-narcotics fight,''
said Myles Frechette, who was the U.S. ambassador here during the
late 1990s. ``We had so much trust in him that we dealt with him as
if he were one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Serrano's standing in Washington has remained so high
that his superiors, to their dismay and occasional annoyance, have
often been eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   When Pastrana visited Washington last year to lobby for U.S. aid
and was rebuked by Republican members of Congress for not having
brought Serrano with him, he had to remind his hosts that ``I am
the president of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serrano's successor, Pastrana has named Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, 57. The grandson of a French police officer sent to
Colombia in 1891 to organize the National Police, Gilibert has a
personal commitment to the institution that is unquestioned, but
was described by a European diplomat here as being ``more cautious
and less charismatic'' than Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Serrano's great talents,'' Frechette said, ``is that he
really knew how to deal with Americans and had an understanding of
the international situation that the military still doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, Frechette predicted, ``there will be
adjustment pains'' for the Drug Enforcement Administration in
adapting to a different operating style under Gilibert, ``who is
very competent but doesn't know how to handle Americans as Serrano
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appointment was announced, Gilibert has made it clear
he wants the police force to concentrate more on making Colombians
feel more secure at home, at work and on the streets. The
implication is that there will be less of a focus on the fight
against drug trafficking, as Gilibert acknowledged in remarks to
reporters here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we are going to forget about this theme,''
he said. ``But at these moments there are other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Ramirez said, ``we have 195 municipalities in
Colombia that are without a police presence'' because ``their
barracks have been destroyed by guerrillas'' in armed
confrontations. With political pressure building on Pastrana not to
step up the drug war to the detriment of public security, ``we are
going to have to make an extra effort in the Colombian budget'' to
support conventional police duties, he said.

<P>
   Shoppers browsing the Internet for watches last Christmas could
find models of popular Tag Heuer watches for $325 to $1,000, or
roughly 35 percent below their suggested retail price, at
Ashford.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the site has raised prices by over 20 percent, boasts
Kenny Kurtzman, Ashford's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging about price increases may seem crazy, but Kurtzman,
like so many of his Internet brethren, is desperate to reassure
worried investors that Ashford, which lost $72 million on $42
million in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, is on track
for a more sustainable future. And their desperation appears to be
bringing an end to the Internet bargains beloved of many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers are in big trouble. Stock prices have
skidded, venture capital has dried up and the public markets have
closed their doors to those who cannot demonstrate how they will be
profitable soon. Small companies like Toysmart.com, Petsmart.com,
and Boo.com have been sold or have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even the industry giant Amazon.com appears increasingly fragile.
Lehman Brothers released a scathing report Friday that called
Amazon's situation ``weak and deteriorating'' and advised investors
to avoid its bonds. The critique sent the retailer's stock plunging
19 percent, wiping out the last of its gains since December 1998
and punishing other Internet stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   To please testy investors, dot-coms are trying numerous tactics
_ including laying off employees, reconceptualizing their
businesses, and raising advertising and association fees _ to show
they can eventually move into the black. But because many Internet
product prices were once set beneath cost to lure new customers,
the easiest and most obvious step has been to bring those prices
back to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artificial pricing of 1999 is history,'' said Mark
Goldstein, chief executive of Bluelight.com, the Web arm of Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants in cyberspace have also been encouraged to raise
prices, because customers so far have shown a willingness to pay
somewhat more, providing they get service to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that people are clicking at the higher
price range, because they will pay a premium for convenience _ like
being in stock now, or excellent customer service,'' said Daniel
Ciporin, president and chief executive of DealTime.com Inc., whose
online service allows customers to compare Web merchants' prices.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official entity that tracks past Web prices, but
there is plenty of evidence that online bargains are on the wane.
Consumers looking for the popular Sony S550D DVD player in May, for
example, would have found a bottom-range price of $309 to $323,
according to data collected by DealTime. Shoppers doing the same
search a week ago would have found the lowest options ranging from
$316 to $338.
</P>
<P>
   At Buy.com, an online superstore, the ``American Pie'' DVD cost
$14.99 at Christmas but now retails at $17.99, as does the DVD of
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' up from $13.99 over the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Since prices in earthbound consumer electronics stores have
never been so heavily discounted _ Circuit City, for example, sells
the Sony S550D for $449.99 _ they are not rising much, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even cyberspace retailers whose product prices have not jumped
are raising costs indirectly by increasing shipping and handling
fees or reducing special offers. Drugstore.com, for example, has
raised its standard shipping fee from $3.49 a package in December
to $3.95 today, an increase that Peter Neupert, its chief
executive, said was meant to bolster profits rather than cover new
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers are also cutting back on discount coupons and
free extras while adding limits on who gets them: new shoppers
only, and just one per household.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, plenty of bargains still to be had on the
Web. There are also e-merchants who say they are resisting the
pressure to raise prices. Amazon.com, for example, while still
profitless because of its continued expansion, has $1 billion in
cash on hand and makes money on its average sale, and it insists
that its pricing structure will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our business model to work, we do not need to change our
pricing,'' said a company spokesman, Bill Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Lehman report is right, Amazon will burn through
that billion by December of this year and will again need to go to
the capital markets or find some other way to raise cash. Curry
dismissed the Lehman report as ``hogwash,'' but Amazon appears to
be looking for ways to increase cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 1, for example, Amazon will raise the monthly fee
it charges small businesses that sell through its zShops and Amazon
auctions from $9.99 to $39.99. Amazon would not say how much
additional revenue the increase in fees would bring, but David
Schappell, group product manager at Amazon auctions, said the
increase occurred because ``the old pricing was so far beneath
market standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Less financially blessed Internet companies, meanwhile, are
getting the chance to compete on a more realistic playing field
now, a fact that delights brick-and-mortar merchants whose capital
structures never did allow them to support below-market prices and
the associated losses. Many cackle that as the market returns to a
more normal state, their much larger size will give them a natural
price advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's going to be hard to compete on price if the
bricks-and-clicks are doing a competitive job,'' exulted Jonathan
Foster, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of
Toysrus.com, the online arm of the giant chain. Toys ``R'' Us had
$13 billion in sales last year, or 86 times those of its biggest
Web competitor, eToys Inc., a heft that should give it great
influence in negotiating lower prices from its suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the e-tailers, Web shoppers are showing themselves
to be a bit less the dogged bargain hounds than was originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   In a May survey, Jupiter Communications Inc., the Internet
consulting firm, found that Internet customers were slowly growing
less price-sensitive. Though 73 percent of the 1,500 people who
responded to the survey rated price as the most important factor in
their decisions to buy a product, that was down from 80 percent two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that the lowest price range for the best-selling
Nikon Coolpix 990 camera was $819 to $824 in May, according to
DealTime, and some 59 percent of consumers using the company's
search engine bought at that price.
</P>
<P>
   In June the price range was the same, DealTime found, but the
number of buyers at the cheapest level had slipped to 50 percent,
largely because the more expensive cameras were in stock while the
less expensive ones had waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, convenience and saving time, which have always
been the real advantage of the Internet, will be the most
valuable'' assets of the online business model, said Marcia H.
Flicker, a professor of marketing at Fordham University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The price pressures are also forcing online retailers to figure
out more quickly how to recognize their repeat _ and therefore more
valuable _ customers and reward them, while avoiding the use of
resources on customers who buy only when given money-losing
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there that just want to take advantage of
deals,'' Neupert said, explaining Drugstore.com's decision to offer
fewer coupons. ``Those are not the customers we want to attract.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this does not, of course, mean that consumers are
becoming completely indifferent to the impact on their wallets and
that Internet companies can ignore price concerns. Online sites
that have made serving up bargains their sole purpose for being are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six months, Renana Myers of White Plains, N.Y., has
bid for goods like yogurt, diapers and paper products on
Priceline.com _ a service that allows consumers to negotiate prices
with a diverse array of retailers _ before she goes to the
supermarket, which has a deal with the online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Lately she has noticed that the savings are not so great. ``They
have shifted the cost of things like wipes and yogurt upwards,''
she said. ``You have to be very savvy and know the costs in the
supermarket if you are going to get a good deal.'' She has been
disappointed enough lately that she has considered not bothering to
visit Priceline any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers are all too aware that there is a limit to how
high they can push prices, but profit pressures, already intense,
are likely to get rougher soon. Next month the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, an independent agency whose rulings are
incorporated into generally accepted accounting principles, is
expected to debate and possibly even vote on a recently proposed
rule about how all retailers calculate ``gross profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The board is trying to standardize the way retail companies
account for shipping and handling costs. Although there is great
variation across the industry, many of the biggest merchants that
operate exclusively online, like Amazon.com and eToys, list such
costs under their marketing budgets, a practice that inflates gross
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board is likely to call for an end to this
practice and instead require businesses to deduct such so-called
fulfillment outlays from the costs of goods.
</P>
<P>
   While many catalog merchants also count shipping by this method,
the proposed measure would be of much greater significance to
virtual retailers, because they do not have any positive earnings,
and gross margins are the main way investors have found to measure
the e-tailers' health.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rule could cause gross margins to drop to 10 percent from
20 percent at Amazon, and to negative percentages for eToys,
PlanetRx and Drugstore.com, according to Holly Becker, an Internet
analyst at Lehman Brothers. That could further dismay investors,
leading to additional pressure on prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of bottom-line earnings, we have been using
gross margins to gauge the health of the business,'' Becker said.
``Companies will do what they can to get margins higher again. That
means raising prices or lowering fulfillment costs _ and raising
prices is certainly a shorter-term solution.''

GROWING HISPANIC VOTING INFLUENCE PROMPTS COURTSHIP BY GORE AND
BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ ``Yo quiero mucho,'' Vice President Al Gore roared in a
campaign speech here on Thursday night before the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, assuring its
members that he loved them very much.
</P>
<P>
   For many Hispanic Americans, especially those eager to vote in
this year's presidential election, Gore and his probable Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, have turned the campaign
into a virtual love-fest. Describing themselves as the ``soccer
moms'' of the 2000 elections, Hispanic voters say they have never
been courted so aggressively by presidential candidates, giving
Hispanics electoral leverage they never had before.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the seminars at the association's annual conference
here this week are designed to expand their influence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we're hot,'' said Victor Hernandez, a member
of the Lubbock, Texas, City Council. ``The parties see us as an
opportunity, but also a potential threat. They know they have to
deal with us, and they know it's better to deal with us as an ally
rather than a foe.''
</P>
<P>
   The amorous turn, a more profound difference in Republican
strategy than in Democratic, evolves directly from demographic
shifts: Hispanics are now the fastest growing bloc of ethnic
voters. The changes are especially significant in the nine states
with the largest Hispanic populations. Led by California, New York
and Texas, those states account for 202 electoral votes _ or 75
percent of the 270 needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Latino officials group, commonly known as
NALEO, estimates that the Hispanic share of the 2000 presidential
vote will rise to 5.4 percent from 4.7 percent in 1996, giving
Latino voters the power to influence an otherwise close election,
particularly in several important states, including California and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But even if one presidential candidate wins by a wide margin
this year, politically active Hispanic Americans say they won't
cede their political future. With seminars this week like
``Developing your stump speech,'' ``Working with your party'' and
``Coordinating with issue constituencies,'' NALEO officials have
been teaching their members how to get more Hispanics into the
election pipeline to make Hispanic voters more influential in 2000
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Panel moderators have included specialists on issues that
Hispanic voters consistently cite as most important to them _
public education, health care and economic development _ as well as
political strategists from both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Vargas, the NALEO executive director, said about 5,100
Hispanics hold elected office in the United States, but half of
them as members of local school boards, making for a relatively
flat triangle of success. Over the last 10 years, the number of
Hispanics in Congress has risen to 19 from 11; the number of state
lawmakers has increased to 189 from 135; and seven Hispanics hold
statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   But with the nation's Hispanic population increasing, to 31.8
million by last year from 22.4 million in 1990, according to the
Census Bureau, and an analysis by NALEO of turnout in 1992 and 1996
suggesting that more Latinos are voting while other groups are
voting less often, Vargas said the number of Hispanic elected
officials was certain to rise. As a result, NALEO officials have
made sharing political advice and counsel the thrust of their
conference in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus attention on November and the role Latinos
will play in the election,'' he said, reflecting on the mission of
the three-day conference. ``But we also want to stress professional
development. We want people to leave here with new information so
they can do better at their jobs in the future with strategies to
win. Some place soon, we want to have a future governor and a U.S.
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their campaign efforts this year, Bush and Gore
recognize the importance of winning the Hispanic vote. That is not
necessarily a new strategy for Democrats, but it is for
Republicans. And many Republican Party leaders say that with Bush,
whose state has a significant Hispanic population, they have the
right candidate to expand their influence, even though Bush's aides
said a scheduling conflict prevented him from attending the Naleo
conference.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanic voters have traditionally supported Democratic
candidates, they have shown a new open-mindedness in recent
elections toward Republicans. By some estimates, Bush won as much
as 47 percent of the Hispanic vote in his re-election as governor
in 1998. The same year, Tony Garza, a Republican, won election to
the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the
state's oil, gas and public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Californians elected three Hispanic Republicans to the state
legislature in 1998, even as Gray Davis, a Democrat, won the
governor's race, a result that reflected, at least among Hispanics,
a repudiation of the policies of his predecessor, Pete Wilson, who
opposed social services for illegal immigrants, affirmative action
and bilingual education in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Like the vice president, Bush often uses Spanish in speaking to
Hispanic audiences, boasting that his policies in Texas have been
good for Hispanics. Also, he often reminds voters of his
sister-in-law's heritage: Columba Bush, who is married to his
brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, was born in Mexico, and their
24-year-old son, George P. Bush, who speaks fluent Spanish, has
become an active campaigner for his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Hispanics complain that Democratic candidates,
recognizing the historic gap between Hispanics and Republicans,
take the Hispanic vote for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is uniquely positioned with a proven record of winning
Hispanic votes,'' said Michael Madrid, a Republican political
consultant who led the seminar on stump speeches. He said that
Bush's attractiveness to Hispanic voters ``is as much the messenger
as the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still appear to have some distance to cover before
they capture a majority of the Hispanic vote in any big state. As
Vargas pointed out, only in the last few years have Republicans
paid much attention to Hispanic voters, compared with President
Clinton and Gore, who made them a priority in the last two
elections. President Bush won only 19 percent of the Hispanic vote
in 1992, Madrid said, and Sen. Bob Dole fared worse four years
later, with 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been for lack of trying,'' Gov. Bill Owens of
Colorado said Friday, addressing problems Republicans have had
connecting with Hispanics. ``We had it under President Reagan, but
for all the assets Bob Dole had, he was not a warm-and-fuzzy guy.
He didn't have the ability to connect. George Bush does. He'll be
very competitive with Hispanics this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent progress by Republicans, they still encounter
problems. For example, in New Mexico, where Hispanics account for a
third of the vote and four Hispanics _ all Democrats _ hold
statewide offices, the state Republican Party has included only two
Hispanics among its 21-member delegation to the national convention
in August.
</P>
<P>
   And here, Vargas said, Bush's absence ``sends a message that
speaks for itself.'' Bush was represented at a luncheon Friday by
Owens and one of his Colorado cabinet members, Larry Trujillo, who
recently switched from Democrat to Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Hernandez, the Lubbock city official, said it
would be a mistake for either party to take Hispanics lightly. ``We
no longer want a piece of the pie,'' he said, referring to their
growing political might. ``We want to be in the kitchen, deciding
what kind of pie to make.''

CLINTON KEEPS FRENETIC FUND-RAISING PACE TO AID DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They call him the fund-raiser in chief. The money
man. The closer. The Democratic Party's biggest draw, elder
statesman, marquee attraction. Put him on the bill. Lead him to the
podium. Wallets will open.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may not be on the ballot in the fall, but he
is raising campaign money as though Election Day were tomorrow and
his party's life depended on a huge cash infusion. He works his
magic in hotel ballrooms, exclusive nightclubs and tony dining
rooms from coast to coast, wherever he can find Democrats willing
to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is extraordinary that the president, in his eighth
year of office, is out on the road doing this,'' said Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who joined Clinton on Thursday night at
the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix for a swank fund-raising reception for
the Democratic National Convention. The event took in about
$350,000, making it the biggest fund-raising event ever for Arizona
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just one of many stops for Clinton, whose frenetic
fund-raising pace last week alone helped bring in $4 million for
the Democrats at a dozen events in just four days.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the money went to Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose New
York Senate campaign received $200,000 from a fund-raiser at which
Clinton was the host on Wednesday night at a private home in
Washington. The Democratic National Committee, which is using its
money for issue advertisements promoting Vice President Al Gore's
candidacy, received well over $1 million from fund-raisers Clinton
attended in Phoenix and San Diego on Thursday and Los Angeles on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 re-election bid, Clinton set the standard for
aggressive fund raising with a relentless series of coffees,
lunches, dinners and late-night receptions. All the money-raising
helped him hold onto the White House, but the ensuing controversies
surrounding illegal funds haunted his administration for years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who assisted with the effort back in 1996, still faces
questions from Justice Department investigators about his stop at
the Hsi Lai Buddhist temple, a visit the vice president has
insisted was finance-related but not a true fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   It is the memory of 1996 that, in part, keeps Clinton going at
full throttle. Aides say he remembers how much time he spent on
fund raising as a presidential candidate when he should have been
out shaking hands and talking policy. By doing some of the heavy
lifting himself this time, the aides say, Clinton hopes he can free
Gore and other Democratic candidates from the onerous task of
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels fund raising took too much of his time in '96,'' said
Jake Siewert, a former Clinton-Gore campaign worker who is now the
president's deputy press secretary. ``He wants Gore to be able to
collect votes instead of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pitch typically ignores money altogether. He may thank
donors for their contributions to the party, but the arm-twisting
for big checks is done before he arrives by seasoned fund-raisers
like Terry McAuliffe, who recently took over fund raising for the
cash-strapped Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's travels last week benefited many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Davis, a California assemblywoman who is taking on Rep.
Brian P. Bilbray, received $125,000 from a fund-raiser Clinton
headlined at the El Cortez Hotel in San Diego. Davis, who was
occupied with legislative business in Sacramento on Thursday night,
did not attend her own gala.
</P>
<P>
   Sen, Dianne Feinstein of California, who is building a war chest
to keep her opponent, Rep. Tom Campbell, at bay, netted $550,000
from two Clinton-attended events in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democratic Party emerged $112,000 richer after
Clinton spoke on Friday at a rousing reception at the Century Plaza
Hotel in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Convention Host Committee
also benefited from the president's latest fund-raising swing,
taking in $25,000 from enough couples at one event to amass $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton relishes the road. Outside Washington, where his
relevance is sometimes questioned as legislative stalemates keep
much of his agenda in check, there is already a nostalgia setting
in among the almost-ex-president's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Clinton told members of the state party it was
fitting that the Democrats were holding what would be his
``farewell convention'' in the key state of California. ``Awwww,''
the audience replied, clearly sorry to see him go. ``I'm not going
to shrivel up,'' Clinton replied with a laugh. ``I'll be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Clinton is in top form, as he was late Friday when he
turned conversational during an appearance at the home of Kenneth
Edmonds, the music producer and singer better known as Babyface.
The audience _ a star-studded crowd that included the model Naomi
Campbell, the boxer Evander Holyfield and the singers Lionel Richie
and Chaka Khan _ seemed to hang on every presidential word.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that evening, Clinton spoke at the exclusive Garden of
Eden, the sort of club that picks out pretty people from the line
out front but turns away most people not on the list. There, the
crowd of young Democrats ignored most of Clinton's oft-delivered
applause lines and seemed to agree completely when the president
said, ``Now, look, you all came here to have a good time and you
probably don't want to hear a political speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite different audiences, Clinton's spiel is virtually
identical at every stop: The current prosperity may not last and
should not be squandered with tax cuts. Gore, the president says,
is better positioned to keep the good times rolling.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG FIGHT CREATES UNLIKELY ENEMIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word PLUS in parentheses has been used
in the 14th graf instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable
to some newspaper systems.) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The struggle over prescription drug benefits for
the elderly, now center stage in the House, is not simply between
Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. It has also
driven a wedge between two of the biggest, most influential lobbies
in Washington: the Health Insurance Association of America and the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the pharmaceutical industry has been arguing _ on
Capitol Hill and beyond, in an intensive advertising campaign _
that any prescription drug benefit for the elderly must be provided
through the private sector, not the traditional Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the industry fears that direct government
involvement will inevitably mean government pressure on drug
industry prices _ and profits. The pharmaceutical association
asserts, as it said in one recent advertisement, that ``a
government-run prescription drug plan'' and ``government controls''
on prices would hurt the industry, slow research and ultimately
harm patients.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy, which fits neatly with the Republican desire
for less government and more private market forces in the Medicare
program, is at the heart of the prescription drug bill that the
Ways and Means Committee passed on Wednesday night, which may hit
the House floor this week. The Republican bill would use government
subsidies to encourage private companies to offer drug policies to
the elderly. Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs,
and about a third of the elderly have no drug coverage at all.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a persistent voice of resistance from the
insurance industry, ordinarily an ally of the Republican Party.
Officials of the Health Insurance Association of America have been
warning that the private-sector solution being debated would be
difficult to achieve. Even with federal subsidies, insurance
officials have warned, private companies would have a hard time
offering an affordable product and making a profit in a market
where drug prices keep rising and the sickest elderly people _ the
heaviest users of prescription drugs _ are most likely to buy the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As Charles N. Kahn III, president of the group, testified before
a House committee earlier this month, ``We do not believe that
private drug-only insurance is a viable concept given the
substantial economic and regulatory barriers and problems with
adverse selection that would face such a product.''
</P>
<P>
   This tension between two industry giants is one more hurdle in
the way of passing prescription drug legislation this year. The
debate has bubbled throughout the spring, much to the annoyance of
Republican leaders who have been scrambling to find a consensus on
prescription drug coverage, considered one of the most powerful
issues of this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to find something that gets through the
House,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis
Hastert. ``Obviously, some aspects of the insurance industry aren't
that excited about it, but we're trying to get something that will
help seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither industry group has taken a position on the Republican
bill, but their disagreement is widely known and infuses the
larger, more partisan debate. Democrats and their allies say the
insurance industry's resistance proves that the Republican bill is
not a realistic effort to meet the needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really shows the GOP drug plan to be a mirage,'' said
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health
care advocacy group. ``It looks good from a distance, but there's
very little there. Notwithstanding the fact that the GOP bill would
provide huge subsidies to insurance companies, the insurance
companies are still saying, `We're not going to offer these
policies.'''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has a drug proposal of his own and is a
critic of the House Republicans' plan, has noted the insurance
industry's criticism on several occasions, with perhaps a bit of
``Schadenfreude.'' Clinton has spent much of his administration at
odds with the health insurers association, most notably when the
group ran the legendary ``Harry and Louise'' advertisements
attacking his proposal for national health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the deputy assistant to the president for health
policy, said, ``When the advocates of Harry and Louise and the
president agree on something, people say there must be something to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger Democratic critique of the Republican plan, is that
the obvious solution to the lack of a drug benefit in Medicare is
to add a drug benefit to Medicare _ rather than, as Pollack puts
it, ``contorting yourself'' to find private-sector mechanisms that
the private sector itself has doubts about. As Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, put it,
``Republicans want to basically privatize this benefit, as they've
always wanted to privatize Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., argued that the last major
effort to open Medicare to more private insurance involvement,
Medicare(PLUS)Choice, ``by anyone's analysis has not worked.'' He
was referring to the fact that many Medicare beneficiaries have
signed up with private health maintenance organizations, rather
than the traditional Medicare program, only to see their HMOs pull
out of Medicare because they found it unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that their plan would give the nation's
elderly more choices in drug plans; they note that it guarantees
every Medicare beneficiary a choice of at least two plans, and
would also provide for a federal fallback plan if private insurers
do not offer coverage in a particular area.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Health Insurance Association of America _ whose
members include the biggest health insurers and provide benefits to
123 million Americans over all _ may be resisting this new market,
Republican leaders note that others are not. Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health
and the prime mover on this bill, noted that a leading drug benefit
manager, Merck-Medco Managed Care, had said it would ``work to
develop a prescription-drug-only plan that we could offer
nationwide in competition with others in what we expect will be a
highly competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, if you build it, they will come,''
said Feehery, the House speaker's aide. The legislation, he added,
``will create a huge pot of money that the private market will want
to get involved in. The fact is, this is a great benefit for
seniors and we've already had some movement from the private sector
that they will be interested in it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Judith H. Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, said in her testimony on
June 13 that she was certain the private marketplace could produce
drug benefits for the elderly, since it had already produced
private insurance policies for ``cancer, sports accidents,
emergency room visits, pregnancy complications and campers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican bill passed the Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday, on a strict party-line vote, Kahn said he had no comment
``on the bill right now.'' Asked if he would lobby against the bill
when it hits the floor next week, he again declined to comment. But
the dispute clearly puts him in an awkward position, politically
and, perhaps, personally. Before assuming the presidency of the
health insurance association, Kahn was staff director for the Ways
and Means Subcommittee on Health.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pharmaceutical association, its critics assert that
it is so panic-stricken over the prospect of the government cutting
into its profits that industry lobbying will only intensify. Even
if, as many expect, nothing is enacted this year to provide
prescription drug coverage to the elderly, the issue will only
return in the new administration and Congress of 2001.

HELP FOR ARKANSAS FARMERS; BUSH IN KENTUCKY; SKEPTICISM IN INDIANA;
GOP BICKERING IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ARKANSAS: FARMERS GET HELP, AND BACK THE HELPER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' 4th Congressional District, covering the bottom third
of the state, was solidly Democratic until 1992. Then along came a
conservative Republican named Jay Dickey, and since then the
district has been solidly Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have failed three times to come up with a challenger
strong enough to take him, in good part because he is a master
mender of fences back home, able to get votes from Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats refuse to give up, and this year, with
Republicans holding only a six-seat edge in Congress, Democratic
leaders decided to go after Dickey, with the party nominating a
popular, well-financed state senator, Mike Ross, to take him on.
The Democratic leaders figured they had Dickey beaten after he
alienated the Arkansas Black Farmers and Agriculturalists
Association, a major political force in the district. One poll put
Ross ahead by 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers association had asked Dickey to get Congress
involved in settling a lawsuit in which association members claimed
the Agriculture Department had discriminated against them. He
replied that it would be next to impossible to rally any Republican
support for the association because it had signaled its intent to
endorse a Democrat in the district this year.
</P>
<P>
   To some Dickey detractors, that smacked of political extortion,
and they talked for a while of filing an ethics complaint. In the
meantime, Dickey reopened a dialogue with the association and began
pressuring federal farm officials to speed the flow of loans to its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the association threw its support to Dickey,
saying: ``Jay Dickey has not just talked about supporting
African-Americans and other minorities, he has done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross' take on that: ``It's unfortunate we have the kind of
congressman who has demanded political endorsements and campaign
contributions before he will help.''
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY: BUSH NOT SO WELCOME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is a battleground state this election year, and Gov.
Paul E. Patton, a Democrat, is worried. And irked.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas keeps showing up, raising money for
himself and the Kentucky and national Republican parties and
campaigning for himself and state and congressional Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he intends to carry Kentucky. He is intent on helping
Kentucky Republicans win three hotly contested congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   And he is trying to help Republicans maintain their 20-18
majority in the Kentucky state Senate, a crucial majority because
going into next year's redistricting process, Patton will still be
sitting in the governor's chair, and Democrats almost certainly
will still be in control of the State House.
</P>
<P>
   So last weekend when Bush showed up in Kentucky for the third
time in five weeks _ he raised some $1.7 million while talking up
himself and other Republicans _ Patton groused ``enough already''
and accused him of using ``strong-arm tactics'' to wring money and
votes out of Kentuckians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented for a presidential candidate to
participate this way,'' Patton said. ``It just blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican chairwoman, Ellen Williams, laughed and
called Patton's remarks ``wacky sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was more pointed, sending the governor this message: ``I'm
coming. Get used to it. I'm going to come to your state as many
times as I feel like coming _ and win the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA: GAS-TAX SUSPENSION AROUSES SKEPTICISM  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many state and federal officials and investigators wring
their hands and wonder what to do about surging gas prices, Gov.
Frank O'Bannon of Indiana has acted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, using an emergency provision in Indiana law,
O'Bannon, a Democrat, suspended the state's gas tax for two months,
a move that will cut up to 10 cents off the price of a gallon of
gasoline, now well over $2 in many places in Indiana and elsewhere
in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoosiers can't afford to wait on federal and state
investigators to tell us why the Midwest is being hit so hard,''
O'Bannon said.
</P>
<P>
   At the pump, many drivers applauded the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republican officials and legislators saw politics, not
just dollar signs, in O'Bannon's move, noting that he is up for
re-election and that he chose to announce the tax suspension
against the photogenic backdrop of a busy Indianapolis gas station.
They argued that the cut would unbalance the state budget and save
the average driver less than $2 per tank at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politics, a political year,'' said state Sen. Lawrence
Borst of Greenwood, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's campaign manager, Tom New, had a one word
response for that: ``Phooey.''
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON: FEARLESS MCCAIN ATTACKS FINANCE LAW
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is still letting the chips fall where
they may.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while urging a House committee to tighten regulations
on tax-exempt political groups, which do not have to tell who gives
them money or how they spend it, McCain likened their work to
``certain evils in our society,'' namely murder, rape and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who has
close ties to a number of the groups and who disagrees strongly
with McCain on the need for an overhaul of campaign finance laws.
He struck back, unusually hard for a fellow Republican, asserting
that McCain was trying to curb free speech by demanding that the
groups name donors and detail the political activity their
donations support, like advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have offended good Americans and you should apologize,''
DeLay declared. ``By employing emotionally overwrought rhetoric
that places Americans contributing to these groups on the same
level as evil criminals, you rashly condemn many citizens who are
simply pursuing their First Amendment right to join the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded that DeLay seemed nervous about the possibility
that a campaign finance measure just might pass. As for whether he
would apologize, he recalled the answer the surrounded American
commander gave in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II when the
German commander demanded that he surrender: Nuts.

DAVID-AND-GOLIATH BATTLE IN CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From a cramped, three-room office near Wall Street
two weeks ago, four young programmers started a virtual duel with
America Online, the Internet behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, they had all been members of the Israeli
military's computer security unit. But now they were fighting for
their start-up company, Odigo Inc., and its instant-messaging
service.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, their David-and-Goliath battle to keep lines open to
the 140 million users of AOL's instant-message programs would reach
far beyond their corner of Silicon Alley. Even as AOL was
denouncing Odigo's programmers as hackers and criminals, AOL
announced its support for a worldwide standard for the technology.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started on a Saturday night two weeks ago, when Avner
Ronen, a founder and vice president of Odigo, received the call on
his cell phone _ fittingly enough, as he was walking up Third
Avenue to a 10:30 p.m. showing of ``Mission: Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, Ronen was told, had just blocked the users of a
new version of Odigo's program, released on May 31, from sending
messages to or receiving messages from users of AOL Instant
Messenger and ICQ, the programs that account for 90 percent of all
instant-message users.
</P>
<P>
   Ronen, 24, quickly took the No. 5 train downtown to the
company's office at 11 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit surprised,'' he said of AOL's move, but not
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages travel over the Internet and quickly pop up on
users' screens, allowing instantaneous communication. But users of
the different instant-messaging programs have been unable to
communicate with each other _ not because it is technically
impossible, but because AOL has not allowed it. While more than 40
other software companies, including Odigo, offer such programs, for
more than a year AOL has blocked competitors from reaching its
users, citing privacy and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors, most prominently Microsoft, have released
versions of their messaging programs that can communicate with
AOL's users, only to have the security team at the company's
headquarters in Dulles, Va., track the signals of competitors'
programs and block their users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if AT&AMP;T said that you could not communicate with one
of its users from a Sprint line,'' said Ross Bagully, chief
executive of Tribal Voice Inc. of Denver, another instant-messaging
company.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Odigo. The company was founded in January 1999 in Israel,
but most of its 15 employees moved six months ago to Manhattan's
technology-rich Silicon Alley in search of their millions in the
Internet gold rush sweeping across America.
</P>
<P>
   Odigo, which provides its instant-messaging service free to
users and under contract to Internet providers like Prodigy,
StarMedia and Fortune City, found that its efforts to expand were
being stifled by AOL's dominance of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Ronen said, users are reluctant to sign up for new
instant-messaging services if they cannot communicate with
colleagues, friends and family members who use AOL's two programs.
After unsuccessful efforts to talk to AOL, Ronen said, Odigo gave
up and released the new _ compatible _ version of its software in
late May.
</P>
<P>
   When AOL started blocking Odigo on June 10, Roee Vulkan, 26, a
software engineer who helped design the Israeli defense force's
internal intranet system, succeeded in creating a software patch
within hours that allowed Odigo users to circumvent AOL's security
measures. The company posted the software fix on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opening salvo in what would become more than a week
of intense, day-to-day combat between the two companies, with Odigo
engineers coming up with solutions as soon as AOL experts had
blocked the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   Barry M. Schuler, president of AOL's Interactive Services Group,
said his company was not concerned about losing business. Rather,
he said, it wants to prevent instant-messaging companies from
sending advertising, or selling the e-mail addresses of AOL users.
``All of a sudden you open a Pandora's box, where you kill a
product that everyone used to enjoy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said Odigo had ``illegally entered the AOL system'' by
attempting to make its software ``mimic an AOL signature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is from a kid sitting with a computer in a garage
without his parents' permission,'' he said, ``or the engineering
team of a company that is backed by venture capital, hacking is the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ronen said Odigo had done nothing illegal because its
programmers had not penetrated AOL's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The cat-and-mouse game between AOL and Odigo would repeat itself
10 times, with AOL blocking Odigo's signature and the small company
altering its digital fingerprint to get around the firewall.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, AOL released a document outlining its security and
privacy concerns about other companies' instant-messaging software
and laying out its support _ eventually _ for open communication in
the instant message medium.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely hailed as a victory for the little competitors.
But the victory was short-lived. About 15 minutes after releasing
the position paper, AOL again blocked Odigo's users.

EDITORIAL: LET THE VOTERS RULE ON GORE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   Because of her brazen dereliction of duty as attorney general,
Janet Reno has now stirred up a political mess for herself and Vice
President Al Gore and created an electoral quandary for the public.
It turns out that yet another top official in the Justice
Department has concluded that Reno should name a special counsel to
investigate Democratic campaign fund-raising irregularities in
1996, especially the activities and statements of Gore. Had Reno
agreed to such an investigation years ago, as the law clearly
required, the public would have answers about the legality of
Democratic fund raising in 1996. Such an inquiry might have
exonerated the vice president, just as Robert Ray has closed the
Travel Office inquiry with no charges against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore newly entangled by charges in several fund-raising
areas, Reno has created an excruciating choice between orderly
legal process and an orderly presidential campaign. One option
would be for her to reverse course and immediately appoint a
respected lawyer outside the department to look into the latest
allegations involving Gore. We have long favored special
prosecutors to look into all the campaign irregularities, including
these.
</P>
<P>
   But at this late date, even with a fast-moving investigation,
that would mean that virtually the entire campaign would be
conducted in an atmosphere of disruption. We conclude that as a
practical matter, if all that would be investigated is the vice
president's veracity in his most recent sworn statements, it would
be best for the department to share any contradictory information
with the public, and let the voters decide. It is a cliche to speak
of the court of public opinion, but in a presidential year, that is
a lofty tribunal indeed. And Gov. George W. Bush is a prosecutor
who will not give Gore a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   This awkward situation exists because Reno has mishandled this
matter from the beginning. She ignored the recommendations to
appoint an independent counsel from Louis Freeh, the director of
the FBI, and Charles LaBella, her chief prosecutor on campaign
finance. According to the latest news accounts, Robert Conrad Jr.,
the head of the Justice Department's campaign finance team, told
Reno more than a week ago that new evidence suggested Gore might
have been less than truthful in denying that he knew anything about
fund-raising irregularities. Gore made a smart move Friday in
releasing the transcript of his interview with Conrad, in which he
denied again that he knew that the Buddhist temple event was a
fund-raiser. If the new evidence cited by Conrad is simply Gore's
most recent statements, it is unlikely that a special prosecutor
could get a perjury conviction on that basis. The debate over
Gore's veracity can be resolved through the public's examination of
his words during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's team will be making a serious mistake,
however, if it carries out reported plans to launch a Clinton-style
personal attack on Conrad. The vice president needs to separate
himself from Clinton's tactics, not emulate them.
</P>
<P>
   There is, finally, some irony in the new allegations coming out
at a time when Ray, the successor to Kenneth Starr as the
Whitewater prosecutor, has concluded that there is insufficient
evidence to prosecute the first lady on the firings of seven
employees in the White House Travel Office. The independent counsel
did, however, realistically underscore the strong indications that
the first lady had understated her role in dismissals. The White
House has complained about Ray's comments, but the public has a
right to know about the first lady's efforts to disguise her role
in an unseemly episode. Even so, that case is closed, and Hillary
Clinton has the opportunity to move beyond it. Whether Gore can do
the same should be decided by the voters in November.

DELGADO AND WELLS HAVE BLUE JAYS SOARING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering that on successive days, the two recognized
contenders for the American League East championship lost games by
scores of 17-4 and 22-1, the fact that the Toronto Blue Jays, in
the space of six recent games, lost by scores of 16-3 and 18-6
should not rule them out as a third contender for that same title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a chance,'' Carlos Delgado, the team's mass
weapon of opposing pitchers' destruction, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're for real. Absolutely,'' Gord Ash, the general manager,
proclaimed, then readily acknowledged that the Blue Jays have
benefited from the inconsistent performances of the Yankees and the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fooling ourselves,'' Ash added. ``The Yankees and
Red Sox have played probably more poorly than anyone anticipated
and given us a chance to contend. But given the circumstances, we
think we can compete with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays began play Saturday in first place, half a game
ahead of the Red Sox, a game in front of the Yankees. The Blue Jays
had been four games from first before winning 12 of their last 17
games, including 2 of 3 games in each of five successive series.
When that stretch began, the other two teams were tied for first,
but then the Yankees won only 7 of 17 games and the Red Sox 8 of
18.
</P>
<P>
   If those expected contenders have been inconsistent, the Blue
Jays have been a contradiction. They have one of the best hitting
and highest-scoring teams in the league, but they have given up
more runs than they have scored. They have the pitcher with the
most victories in the major leagues, but their pitching staff has
allowed the most hits and has the league's third worst earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado and David Wells are the primary reasons the Blue Jays
are in position to challenge the Yankees and the Red Sox, though
Delgado has had more help from other hitters than Wells has from
other pitchers. Delgado, who chose to remain in Toronto after his
good friend Shawn Green was traded to Los Angeles, is one of the
most fearsome hitters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's game, he led in home runs (25) and slugging
percentage (.714); he was second or tied for second in on-base
percentage (.469), runs scored (61), total bases (190), extra-base
hits (45) and walks (53); and he was fifth in hits (95), tied for
fifth in batting average (.357) and seventh in runs batted in (66).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy to come back,'' said Delgado, who could have
become a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in your career, you have some leverage. You have
to weigh your options. I don't think I sacrificed anything. If I
did, I'm happy with the way things have worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was not happy with his trade by the Yankees to Toronto
last year, but he has flourished there nonetheless. Following a
17-10 record last season, the portly portsider has run off a 12-2
record this season. His 3.55 earned run average is No. 2 in the AL
among pitchers with a name other than Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But like the team, Wells has been a contradiction. He has
allowed the most hits in the league (126), but has countered the
potential effect of all those baserunners by having the best walk
ratio (1.2 per nine innings) with 14 walks in 1061/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade for Roger Clemens, Wells has compiled a 29-12
record, Clemens 18-16. ``He's having a great year,'' Ash said. ``I
think he's relishing the role, in his own unique way, of being the
leader of this group. He came out in spring training and said some
negative things about the club and the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To his credit, 30 days later, he did an about-face after he
saw them compete. Ever since he's been the go-to guy. Probably the
most impressive thing about David this year is the number of times
he's been out there without his best stuff and he has battled and
kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells is the only pitcher with a winning record in the Blue
Jays' starting rotation, which includes two young right-handers,
Chris Carpenter and Kelvim Escobar, and a journeyman pitcher, Frank
Castillo, but no steady fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   The spot belonged to Roy Halladay, another young right-hander,
but an 11.97 ERA earned him a trip to the minor leagues after seven
starts. In his place, Lance Painter, Peter Munro and Clayton
Andrews have failed to make an improvement. Andrews was the starter
in the recent game the Blue Jays lost to Detroit, 16-3. A week
later Carpenter was the starter of an 18-6 loss to the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ash said, games like that (earlier in the season the Blue
Jays lost successive games to Seattle, 17-6 and 19-7) can make him
crazy, but he added, ``It's the nature of the game at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   With Raul Mondesi, acquired for Green in a swap of right
fielders; Shannon Stewart, Tony Batista and Brad Fullmer assisting
Delgado, the Blue Jays have done some pummeling of their own.
``Offensively, we're clearly right there with them,'' Ash said,
referring to the Yankees and the Red Sox. ``We're more balanced
than in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ash also expressed the view that the division race would be
won by the team with the best pitching staff. ``We're all in
trouble,'' he said. ``It's the degree of trouble you're in.''

   When the Yankees beat Pedro Martinez with a flurry of
bases-empty home runs last week, it was suggested that familiarity
might have done him in. That is, the Yankees were facing the
brilliant Boston pitcher for the third time in 24 days and perhaps
benefited from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cleveland Indians saw Cal Eldred three times in 28 days,
and the Chicago White Sox pitcher beat them every time. His third
start against the Indians, in fact, produced the best of Eldred's
three performances against them. He shut them out on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor could have made the difference in the outcomes
experienced by Martinez and Eldred. In Eldred's three games, the
White Sox scored a total of 19 runs; in the three Martinez pitched
against the Yankees, the Red Sox scored a total of three runs.
Eldred allowed six runs; Martinez gave up four and had an earned
run average in the three games that was just about a run lower than
Eldred's, 1.57 to 2.53.
</P>
<P>
   INFLATED ERA IN ATLANTA? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not bad enough that John Schuerholz, the Atlanta Braves
general manager, has spent the past six months dealing with the
fallout from the words that fall out every time John Rocker opens
his mouth. Now he has suffered culture shock. The Braves have
joined the rest of pitching humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Schuerholz said. ``I looked at the
stats about two weeks ago. I looked at the earned run averages in
the American League and saw they were in the fives and sixes. Then
I looked at the National League and we're over four. It's so
foreign to me. But that is as true a reflection of our pitching
times as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves last had a season-ending team ERA that began with a
four in 1990. Leo Mazzone was named the team's pitching coach in
the middle of that season and quickly took steps to reduce the ERA.
From 1992 through last season, the Braves' pitching staff had
either the lowest or next-to-lowest ERA in the major leagues. Their
3.63 ERA was the lowest last season.
</P>
<P>
   They entered Saturday night's game at 4.15, the third lowest in
the majors but not low enough to suit Schuerholz. ``We're going to
try to fix it,'' he said, ``but when you see those stats, you say,
`how are we going to fix it?' I'd rather be writing about the
problem than trying to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   NO HELP FROM REYNOSO  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the second day of their season, the Arizona Diamondbacks
have been out of first place in the National League West on only
two days, after their April 23 game against San Francisco and their
game last Sunday against the Rockies. Armando Reynoso was the
Diamondbacks' starting pitcher in both games, which were played on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso pitched a total of two innings in the two games (he
faced only seven batters in the first one) and gave up 16 runs and
16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   A RULEBOOK STRIKE ZONE?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By instructing umpires to call the strike zone that is defined
in the rulebook, Major League Baseball could speed up the pace of
games, which has been one of its goals, and potentially reduce the
number of home runs and runs, which is not a goal. But Major League
Baseball apparently is not prepared to take such a drastic step.
</P>
<P>
   The upper limit of the rulebook strike zone is the midpoint
halfway between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform
pants. When that definition was enforced, that point was around the
letters on the uniform shirt. The lower limit is the hollow beneath
the kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   That zone, however, shrunk many seasons ago, and umpires now
basically use the knees to a point, by edict of the commissioner's
office, about 2 inches above the belt.
</P>
<P>
   At a negotiating session earlier this season in the talks for a
new labor agreement for the umpires, their representatives reacted
to comments they had seen from officials criticizing umpires for
not calling pitches correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements had been made in the papers that when we get an
agreement, umpires will call the rulebook strike zone,'' John
Hirschbeck, the union's president, said, relating a discussion at
the session. ``We said, `Wait a minute, if that's what you want,
we'll do that right now. Tell us, and we'll do it.' If they said,
`Call the rulebook strike zone,' I swear every major-league umpire
will go out and call armpits to knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Did officials leap at the chance to enlarge the strike zone?
``They said, `No, don't do that; we'll do this gradually,'''
Hirschbeck related.

RESHAPING OF NETS MOVES INTO HIGH GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-NOTEBOOK) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From picking No. 1 to finding a coach, Rod Thorn begins
reshaping the New Jersey Nets in earnest this week. Though the NBA
draft on Wednesday remains a priority, the job of finding a
successor to Don Casey is apparently almost done.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Scott, a Sacramento Kings assistant, has been interviewed
by Thorn and appears to be the Nets' top choice.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is highly respected by Nets upper management, who view him
much in the mold of Orlando coach Doc Rivers: an even-keel person
with a solid playing career and the respect of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's coming to the Meadowlands is not guaranteed. Scott,
Magic Johnson's backcourt mate in the showtime years, is still in
the running for the Indiana job. But with Isiah Thomas and Rick
Carlisle waging campaigns to take over the Pacers, Scott may decide
to leave the Kings for the Nets before taking over for the retired
Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn has been tight-lipped about the candidates and does not
expect to make a decision until next week. And the Nets could
easily go another direction, depending on circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other four candidates are Eddie Jordan, the respected
assistant on Casey's staff whom Stephon Marbury has endorsed, and
Tubby Smith, the University of Kentucky coach. Bob Huggins of the
University of Cincinnati and Mike Fratello have also been mentioned
in connection with the job.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski, the Duke University coach, was contacted by the
Nets but told them he was not interested in leaving the college
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn has other decisions to make. Kenyon Martin, the Cincinnati
forward considered the top pick until he broke his right leg in the
Conference USA tournament, finished his two-day visit with the Nets
on Friday. Because of the injury, Martin did not work out. But he
was examined closely by team doctors, and their evaluation would
not deter the Nets from taking him with the first pick.

DRAFT POSSIBILITIES; THE PACERS' CHOICE; AROUND THE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-NETS) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Orlando and Chicago controlling the draft _ they hold five
of the top 13 picks and six of the first 24 _ the Nets are still
thinking about trading the No. 1 pick. But if they don't and decide
to select Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin, the rest of Wednesday's first
round will probably go like this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vancouver likes Stromile Swift, the 6-foot-9-inch Louisiana
State forward who is the second-leading shot blocker in school
history, behind Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clippers, who pick third, will most likely take Iowa
State's Marcus Fizer, who can score from anywhere and who should
blend in well with Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bulls, at No. 4, are contemplating trading some of their
multiple first-round picks. Jerry Krause is in need of more
veterans than youngsters. But they probably will not pass on Darius
Miles, this year's prep phenom from East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   _ That leaves Orlando at No. 5. Depending on what it does with
its three first-round selections, the Magic will most likely choose
between Texas center Chris Mihm or Florida's Mike Miller. If
Orlando takes Mihm, then the Atlanta Hawks will take Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of an impact player, finding a sleeper late in
the first round is not impossible for a team like the Knicks, who
pick 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   But as more franchises build through free agency and as the
continued proliferation of early entry candidates dilutes the
talent pool, the draft continues to lose its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra's Speedy Claxton may be among the first point guards
taken. He impressed scouts at the draft camps and worked out with
the Knicks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see where Ohio State's Scoonie Penn is
selected. Penn, a fifth-year senior who majored in sociology,
elected not to participate in the Chicago draft camp because he had
to take finals the same week. Penn was determined to get his degree
and passed up one of the main yardsticks for draft consideration.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly also grew disenchanted with the performances of
some of his peers at the Phoenix draft camp, where his stock fell.
A 5-foot-11-inch point guard, Penn was moving the ball, setting
screens and playing help defense, and he apparently did not fit in
with the look-at-me crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, who would want a guy who stayed in school and
played team ball? In this NBA?
</P>
<P>
   THE PACERS' CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, the Indiana Pacers' president, met for three hours
Wednesday night with Rick Carlisle, a Pacers assistant, to assure
him that Walsh had not yet made Isiah Thomas an offer to become the
team's next coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle assured Walsh that he still wanted the job and would go
on the offensive to make sure he received the proper consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently meant having players over to his house and
telling them of his desire to work with them toward winning a
title, according to an Eastern Conference coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the lobbying on both sides, it's getting ugly out
there,'' the coach said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Isiah thinks he has the job, Rick can't believe he's not being
more strongly considered and Donnie is really in a quandary,
wondering what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has also met with players, and from their feedback it does
not appear the Pacers are leaning either way. It may come down to a
gut decision by Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   One Eastern Conference executive said Walsh had been receiving a
lot of anti-Isiah calls from NBA officials who do not want Thomas
to get the job. But Walsh received the same kind of feedback from
Boston when Bird was up for the job and hired him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill's days in Detroit are not over, but they may come to
an end soon. Hill, a free agent forward, has intimated to close
friends and family that he will most likely play in another city
next season, a person close to Hill said on condition of anonymity.
Barring an unlikely trade to New York, Hill is considering Chicago
and Orlando, both of which have salary-cap room to accommodate
Hill. And the notion that Hill will team up with Tim Duncan is
fading. Even if Duncan does not move to Orlando, Hill is not
particularly interested in playing in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents can begin negotiating with teams on July 1, but
cannot sign deals until Aug. 1. Some people are skeptical about how
much weight those dates actually carry. One Atlantic Division
official, for example, called the period a smoke screen. ``Tim
Duncan knows what he's going to do, Grant Hill knows what he wants
to do, and Tracy McGrady knows what he wants to do,'' the official
said. McGrady, the Toronto forward, is still leaning toward the
Magic or the Bulls unless the Raptors pull off a sign-and-trade
with another team.
</P>
<P>
   After all the TV studio candidates shamelessly threw their own
names around, the Knicks assistants Don Chaney and Brendan Malone
have finally been receiving interest for vacant jobs. Chaney
recently turned down the lead assistant position with Atlanta.
Malone was contacted by Washington to be the Wizards' top assistant
under Leonard Hamilton, but he chose not to pursue the job.
</P>
<P>
   A note on the Lakers' first title in 12 years: When Magic
Johnson was directing traffic in the 1980s, there was an aura about
the town and the team that could be felt when the old Forum was
buzzing, as if all the problems outside the arena did not exist.
Since 1988, Los Angeles has been beset with difficult times.
Whether it was Johnson telling the world he had contracted HIV in
1991, the fallout from Rodney King's arrest and the O.J. Simpson
trial, or the devastating fires and an earthquake, the city was
pelted the last decade with some kind of strife or tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, not a single pro sports team had won a title or
captured the imagination of the city like the Lakers of Shaq and
Kobe. A group of rioters on Monday night helped stall the healing
process, but at least it's beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from L.A.,'' said Rick Fox, a Lakers forward, ``but in
watching a lot of times the turmoil the city has gone through, the
different riots and chaos, this would be a positive way to
celebrate. And you hope in that celebration everyone stays healthy
and safe. It would be something jubilant to pull the city
together.''

OUTDOORS: ANGLING ON THE RAPID RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As our 18-foot canoe, heavily laden with grub, clothing,
sleeping bags and fishing gear, moved up the Androscoggin River to
where it flows out of Lake Umbagog, a bald eagle regarded us from
his perch atop a tall, dead conifer and didn't bother to fly though
we passed within 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Umbagog, now within a federal wildlife refuge, is long, narrow
and shallow and covers 7,850 acres. Straddling the Maine-New
Hampshire border, it is the westernmost of the Rangeley lake chain
and about 30 miles southeast of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, my companion Ruth Kirchmeier and I have
been making an annual hegira to the Rapid River, which flows into
Umbagog from Maine, in quest of wilderness, solitude, landlocked
salmon and trout. We begin by putting in at the public launching
area on the Androscoggin just above the power dam in Errol, N.H.;
from there, it's about two miles to Umbagog and approximately the
same distance across the lake to the Rapid River.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, we tented at one of the remote campsites on the
Maine shore, but when Dick Celli of Lenox, Mass., told us that his
camp on the south side of the Rapid River's mouth was available for
rent, we acknowledged that we were getting a bit long in the tooth
to rough it in the bush. The moodiness of the lake, which is swept
by strong winds that build up rough water in the matter of minutes,
also persuaded us that while paddling was more fun and didn't
shatter the silence, an outboard was in order. So now our canoe is
propelled by a little two-horsepower, side-mounted Yamaha. If
conditions are ideal, the entire trip takes us a little more than
an hour each way.
</P>
<P>
   At the camp, we were pleased to find that Celli had kindled a
fire in the wood stove. Our crossing, in a stiff northerly wind
with the temperature in the low 50s, had been cold and wet.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper pinned to the wall near the dining room table
told the story of Dick's success on a fishing trip that he had made
up there in late May. Attached to it was a battered Black Ghost
streamer fly. The fly was large, about a No. 4, and unusually long,
and under it was written: ``Retired _ May 28, 2000 _ after having
taken 10 fish in 2{ hours _ including two 16-inch and one 19-inch
landlocked salmon. All fish were salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   These fish were caught at the outlet pool which is less than a
mile upstream from his camp and the end of the line for boat
fishermen. The Rapid River descends at a startling rate, and those
entering it from its lower end must walk upstream to fish other
pools and runs. Only fly fishing is allowed on the river downstream
to a clearly marked spot below the outlet pool called Cedar Stump.
</P>
<P>
   During that May trip, Dick also caught and released a brook
trout of about three pounds. The creel limit on the Rapid River is
one salmon a day at least 14 inches long, and all brook trout must
be released. The trout are wild fish, descendants of a race of
giant brookies whose numbers have been sadly depleted.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Ruth and I arrived, Dick and I went to the
outlet pool boat at dawn. In two hours, he caught and released one
keeper salmon. I had no hits. The air temperature was in the high
40s and the water temperature about 54. It was frequently windy and
overcast _ with occasional rain _ during our entire stay at the
Rapid River, rarely exceeding 60 degrees at noon.
</P>
<P>
   One morning Ruth and I went ashore at the outlet pool and hiked
upstream to Smooth Ledge, where I hooked and and lost a large
salmon, released a 12-incher and then, using a Muddler Minnow,
caught and released a brook trout of about 16 inches. Returning to
the outlet pool, we found three wading anglers. A hatch of various
aquatic insects, including mayflies, was under way, and trout and
an occasional salmon were rising all about us.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wading anglers was on the opposite shore of the
stream fishing dry flies, and in less than an hour he caught and
released several trout and one keeper salmon. He was an
accomplished fly caster, and from time to time he would snatch one
of the hatching flies from the water or the air, examine it and
then dip into his fly box to tie on a new offering.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired in part by him, I switched to a small dry fly, a Royal
Wulff, and began catching trout, including a 15-incher. I then, in
rapid succession, caught two salmon just over 14 inches. I released
them both because I wanted a bigger one for supper. That proved to
be a bad decision. In the days that followed, I caught nearly a
dozen salmon but none was a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the evenings when we were anchored in the outlet pool,
Ruth yelled to me to turn around and watch a big cow moose wading
across the rapids 40 yards above us. It was Ruth's day for wildlife
sightings. That morning while on a solo hike behind the camp, she
had been ``attacked'' by a female grouse. A mother grouse with
chicks nearby will sometimes go through various antics, but this
was the first time I had ever heard of one actually pecking at a
hiker's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting a meal of fresh fish, I took _ after 15 minutes of
casting with a Mickey Finn streamer fly on a sink-tip line _ a nice
smallmouth bass from the lake in front of the camp. Scaled, rolled
in a corn meal biscuit mix and pan-fried _ accompanied by rice
pilaf, the last of our French bread, freeze-dried peas and a
freeze-dried apple cobbler _ it was first rate. And the following
morning when we broke camp, Lake Umbagog was unusually peaceful: a
vast, undulating, gleaming expanse unruffled by even the slightest
breeze.

 &HT;    So you want to be a reader?
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Too bad the Hugh Grant character in Woody Allen's
``Small Time Crooks'' couldn't give Harold Bloom's new book to
Tracey Ullman's daffy millionairess, who's trying to absorb a
lifetime's exposure to art and literature through osmosis and
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to Read and Why,'' by the author of the best-selling
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human,'' attempts to distill
the erudite professor's 40 years of university lecturing into a
kind of self-help manual for the general public. It's a brilliant
plan, really, to provide an easy-to-swallow literary pill for the
reader who's always yearned to know the likes of Austen, Dickens,
Proust and Mann but has never known where to start. With nothing
more than a pitcher of water, a comfortable chair and the
redoubtable Dr. Bloom in your lap, the arc of Western literature
can be yours in a single sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Just because that's how the book is being hyped doesn't
mean you must believe it. Bloom can be seductive. But instead of
automatically yielding to his personal, at times idiosyncratic,
sensibility, the reader must ultimately learn to trust his own
taste.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Bloom, who teaches at both Yale and New York
University, comes across as a combination of dotty grandfather and
endearing don _ kind of like the British critic John Bayley. He is
benign, eminently likable and possessed of the opinion that he is
the final arbiter of literary matters. Using Shakespeare as the
standard against which all else is measured, he puts forth a series
of practical lessons on the major forms: poetry, drama, the short
story and the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why read?'' he asks. We read to know ourselves better and to
become engaged in a higher form of personal pleasure. ``There is a
reader's Sublime,'' Bloom writes, ``and it seems the only secular
transcendence we can ever attain, except for the more precarious
transcendence we call `falling in love.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is so much pretty writing by a man who is clearly _ and
correctly _ convinced of the ennobling effects of literature. Bloom
is in love. And while he is on a chivalrous mission to save the
printed word from disappearing into cyberspace, he seems to have no
real grasp of who his audience is. His digressive, highfalutin
style is hardly going to win over a crowd hooked on the Internet
and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' In fact, much of the time,
readers without some knowledge of the humanities aren't likely to
have a clue as to what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the chapters on the short story and the novel are a
testament to Bloom's timeless and impeccable taste. No one would
quibble with his selection of Chekhov, Hemingway and Borges as the
modern masters of the short tale. What's troublesome is his
struggle to shoehorn all stories into either the Chekhov-Hemingway
or Kafka-Borges mold. While he admirably includes the Italian
writers Tommaso Landolfi and Italo Calvino in his summary, he
barely mentions Joyce's ``Dubliners'' and entirely omits Katherine
Anne Porter, whose influence on the form is unquestionable.
</P>
<P>
   But these are quibbles and quirks.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the sections on short fiction
and the European novel (from Cervantes to Thomas Mann) to young
readers. Someday, when I get around to rereading Borges or tackling
Henry James' more difficult novels, I will surely go back to see
what Bloom has to say. On the other hand, except for the commentary
on Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, I will probably never return
to his discussion of poetry. And I'm not sure this scholar has a
firm grasp of the American novel. A case in point: He cites
Nathanael West and Philip Roth as the bookends of 20th-century
Jewish fiction, overlooking Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud. And he
calls Cormac McCarthy's ``Blood Meridian'' ``the strongest
imaginative work by any living American writer.'' I haven't read
it, but, by God, I will now.
</P>
<P>
   Readers looking for guidance on the classics would do better to
turn to Vladimir Nabokov's ``Lectures on Literature'' and
``Lectures on Russian Literature,'' in which the great writer
luxuriates in the architecture and details of some 19th- and
early-20th-century masterpieces. Both the Bloom and the Nabokov are
based on university lectures, and they cover much of the same
territory. But only Nabokov, born on Shakespeare's birthday, has
the capaciousness of spirit to turn his lectures into works of art.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The United States is committing more than $1
billion to Colombia's struggle against drug trafficking and armed
groups responsible for drug production just as the government here
is stumbling politically, and the national police chief who helped
smash the Cali cartel and did most to win U.S. trust in his
country's efforts has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package, likely to total $1.3 billion after the
Senate approved it on Wednesday, foresees reduced reliance on the
115,000-strong National Police and more on the armed forces. But
the retiring police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, and his men
would never have been called upon to lead the counternarcotics
fight in the past had Washington not harbored grave doubts about
the fighting ability and human rights record of the Colombian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   And President Andres Pastrana, approaching the midpoint of his
four-year term, is under increasing fire here after losing key
aides, including his interior minister, chief of staff and chief
negotiator with the rebels who have taken over drug production and
made increasing inroads here. Public patience with the president's
failure to make a deal with leftist guerrillas who have been
battling the government for decades is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, 58, was praised by his supporters on Capitol Hill as
``the best cop in the world.'' He stepped down on Friday, having
announced earlier this month that he was retiring because ``I have
been to so many police officers' funerals that I can't bear
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 police officers have been killed since 1994 in this
country, which has a murder rate about 10 times higher than that of
the United States and, with more than 3,000 abductions in 1999, the
highest kidnapping rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are convinced that the drug war is being waged
at the expense of their own security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggravation of drug trafficking and the armed conflict
have translated into the police directing their priorities to the
defense of the state and its institutions,'' said Alvaro Camacho,
director of the Institute of Political Studies at the National
University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the police's ``role of supporting the
citizenry has been debilitated,'' and they ``have become an actor
in the war, separated from the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of such sentiments, Colombia's defense minister,
Luis Fernando Ramirez, applauds Washington's decision to step up
its involvement in Colombia's battle against drugs as ``a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy underlying the aid package, which President Clinton
is expected to sign early next month, calls for greater use of the
Colombian armed forces in ``source interdiction'' and envisions a
reduced role for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The primary burden of fighting the drug war will now fall on
three new anti-narcotics battalions created in the armed forces
with U.S. money and training. Ramirez, in an interview at his
Defense Ministry headquarters on Friday, dismissed any doubts that
these new units are ready to do battle with the leftist guerrillas
and right-wing paramilitary units that now play dominant roles in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a dilemma,'' he said. ``Either it can
give us the tools and let us do the job, or the international
community takes charge of a problem that is growing out of hand. I
think the United States has made the correct decision by giving us
the tools we need to do our work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a transition taking place without much trauma,'' Ramirez
said of Serrano's retirement. ``It is basically the same team of
generals in anti-narcotics and the other areas, very much trained
by Serrano and very much in line with the way we have been
working'' since Pastrana took office nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Serrano is stepping down as many of the spectacular
gains made against drug trafficking early in his 5 1/2 year tenure
have been erased. Cocaine production has more than doubled in the
last five years despite a U.S.-financed program of spraying from
the air to eradicate coca crops _ a program that is supposed to
expand significantly when U.S. Blackhawk and Huey helicopters, the
most costly items in the new aid package, begin arriving in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's personal popularity, based on his folksy manner and
image of integrity, had dissolved much of the popular discontent
over lawlessness and bolstered U.S. confidence in Colombia's
ability to fight its end of the narcotics war, which is fed by drug
use and addiction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The general organized and led the raids that smashed the Cali
cartel and imprisoned scores of other drug traffickers on
Washington's most-wanted list. He also dismissed 11,400 of his own
officers, turning what had been a corrupt and often brutal force
into a tough and trim fighting unit that the United States
cultivated as a welcome alternative to an incompetent army and the
cartel-financed presidency of Ernesto Samper, Pastrana's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serrano delivered the goods and in many ways was a moral
leader for Colombia at a time the country badly needed one, and he
was tireless and entirely committed to the anti-narcotics fight,''
said Myles Frechette, who was the U.S. ambassador here during the
late 1990s. ``We had so much trust in him that we dealt with him as
if he were one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Serrano's standing in Washington has remained so high
that his superiors, to their dismay and occasional annoyance, have
often been eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   When Pastrana visited Washington last year to lobby for U.S. aid
and was rebuked by Republican members of Congress for not having
brought Serrano with him, he had to remind his hosts that ``I am
the president of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serrano's successor, Pastrana has named Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, 57. The grandson of a French police officer sent to
Colombia in 1891 to organize the National Police, Gilibert has a
personal commitment to the institution that is unquestioned, but
was described by a European diplomat here as being ``more cautious
and less charismatic'' than Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Serrano's great talents,'' Frechette said, ``is that he
really knew how to deal with Americans and had an understanding of
the international situation that the military still doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, Frechette predicted, ``there will be
adjustment pains'' for the Drug Enforcement Administration in
adapting to a different operating style under Gilibert, ``who is
very competent but doesn't know how to handle Americans as Serrano
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appointment was announced, Gilibert has made it clear
he wants the police force to concentrate more on making Colombians
feel more secure at home, at work and on the streets. The
implication is that there will be less of a focus on the fight
against drug trafficking, as Gilibert acknowledged in remarks to
reporters here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we are going to forget about this theme,''
he said. ``But at these moments there are other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Ramirez said, ``we have 195 municipalities in
Colombia that are without a police presence'' because ``their
barracks have been destroyed by guerrillas'' in armed
confrontations. With political pressure building on Pastrana not to
step up the drug war to the detriment of public security, ``we are
going to have to make an extra effort in the Colombian budget'' to
support conventional police duties, he said.

DREAMS OF NEW LIVES LED IMMIGRANTS ON FATAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIANZHI, China _ The smugglers promised a journey to prosperous
new lives in the West, in silk-lined cabins supplied with oxygen.
For the last leg, the illegal immigrants would ride a fast
catamaran to England. It would be like a vacation promoted in
glossy brochures for rich, urban Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 60 men and women from rural China, who relatives
say were charged between $20,000 and $30,000 each for their illicit
passage, were found entombed in the back of an airtight,
unrefrigerated truck last week by customs inspectors in Dover,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Packed behind a wall of tomato crates, all but two of them
suffocated. Many of them had flown from Beijing to Eastern Europe,
traveled over land to the Netherlands and Belgium, and then were
crammed into the truck for the ferry trip to England.
</P>
<P>
   ``On June 6, he called his wife to say he was going to England,
but since then, we've had no news,'' said Mrs. Lin, a middle-aged
farmer in the Fujian Province village of Xianzhi, who believes her
son was one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Her arms hugging her knees, Mrs. Lin choked on tears as she
explained why her son took such a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is breaking down,'' she said, motioning around her
dark, musty dwelling, with its concrete floor and molding walls.
``He was just a bricklayer, and he couldn't make enough money here
to renovate our house.''
</P>
<P>
   On the single dirt road that runs through this village, scrawny
chickens ran wild. Inside, dozens of modestly dressed residents
packed into the room to listen. ``Everyone in this village has to
go out, because we don't have enough money. The average income is
1,000 yuan ($120) a month,'' explained the missing man's aunt, her
arm wrapped around her grieving sister.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was cut short when authorities burst in and
ordered this journalist into an official vehicle headed for the
Changle City Propaganda Department. At least 10 other foreign
reporters, picked up in nearby villages, were also questioned and
told to leave the area. At least one British reporter, tracked by
police after he tried to contact alleged smugglers, was escorted
onto a flight back to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of China's sensitivity to illegal emigration,
authorities went to every village that was home to a suspected
victim. They ordered local residents not to speak to ``suspicious
foreigners.'' Police were posted outside one man's home after he
told a reporter his son was missing. Another family changed its
story. Families can be punished for helping relatives flee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the terrible risks, an estimated 100,000 Chinese pay to
be smuggled overseas to Western countries every year, according to
the US Immigration and Naturalization Service. Ten percent are
believed to find their way to the United States. Last year, the INS
caught 2,585 smuggled Chinese, more than double the number detained
in 1998, and four times the number in 1997. Some are deported,
while others apply for asylum. Most go undetected, and unknown
numbers perish en route.
</P>
<P>
   In January alone, more than 100 undocumented Chinese were found
crammed into containers at ports in Seattle and Vancouver, Canada,
including three who died on the way to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on people's dreams of a better life has become big
business; smugglers net $3 billion annually from Chinese passengers
alone, said Jean-Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization
for Migration.
</P>
<P>
   All of the victims in the Dover case are believed to be from
Fujian Province, in southeastern China. Numerous Fujian villages
have seen 10 percent of their residents depart each year. One has
been dubbed the ``widows' village,'' because almost every man of
working age has gone overseas to work. In another, locals say
four-fifths of their young people have left.
</P>
<P>
   The determination to emigrate seems paradoxical, since Fujian is
one of China's richest provinces. But its long coastline has eased
getaways, fueling a diaspora that dates back two centuries. Fujian
migrants built US railroads and mined gold in the 1800s,
established corporate empires in Southeast Asia, and started
businesses in Chinatowns around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, economic reforms and China's opening to the
West have encouraged new forms of corruption and organized crime,
which prey on aspiring and gullible villagers who dream of getting
rich overseas _ especially in the United States, which is known
here as ``the golden mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost every village for 100 miles here, small paddy fields
and decaying brick shacks are juxtaposed against ostentatious,
single-family homes, built with money sent back home. Decorated
with white tile, tinted windows, and flourishes such as rooftop
pavilions, these monuments to success abroad are often empty or
occupied only by elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's because of the money'' that people leave, said
Mr. Lin, a 48-year-old farmer in Zhai Qian, a fishing village
eclipsed by a busy port in nearby Fuqing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Fujian is richer than other provinces, but we still don't
have enough money to build a house. Not even by the end of my life
could I afford a house like that,'' he said, pointing at a pink and
white, four-story tower crowned with a pink pagoda.
</P>
<P>
   With each new house that sprouts up, complete with flush toilets
and double-glazed windows, villagers who cannot afford such
luxuries say they feel like failures and cowards for not trying to
make their fortune overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have gone are usually too ashamed to describe the
horrific conditions they endured during the journey. It may include
beatings and rape. Few ever admit to being forced into indentured
servitude at restaurants or sweatshops to pay off the $20,000 to
$50,000 cost of getting to Europe or the United States. Ten percent
of the price goes to local ``fixers,'' known as snakeheads, who
arrange the journey, according to a businessman familiar with the
process; the rest goes to Chinese criminal gangs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the immigrants have landed in Boston's Chinatown, where
police in the mid-1990s discovered migrants kept as virtual slaves
until their smuggling debt was paid. Some women are forced into
prostitution, but tell relatives they are secretaries. No questions
are asked, because the money keeps flowing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in the next village went overseas and within a few
years, brought back 1 million yuan ($120,048) and built a six-story
house and used the rest to start a business. My husband made less
than $100 a month,'' said He Xiaohong of Changqi village, who
believes her 24-year-old husband is among those found in Dover.
``The snakehead told us the journey was safe, that he'd fly from
Shanghai to Beijing, and from Beijing direct to England.''
</P>
<P>
   The snakehead told them European customs was lax during the
month of June, so he should go now. Her husband was given a
Yugoslav passport, and took a train to Beijing and a flight to
Belgrade, according to Apple Daily, a Hong Kong newspaper. From
there, he went through Austria, Hungary, and countries she had
never heard of. When he called last month from Holland, his
passport, ID, and money had been seized by snakeheads. She has not
heard from him since.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching their baby and crying, He said that if her husband
comes back safely, ``I won't let him try again. After this tragedy,
I won't dream of money anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another family in Changqi told Apple Daily that they last heard
from their son on June 14, when he called from Holland, en route to
England. Wailing hysterically, Chen Yuming, 57, said she and her
husband were against their son's illegal escape. ``We never
expected he'd be trapped in an iron box,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, authorities came, and Chen and her husband, Cao
Yigan, 63, changed their story, telling this reporter that no one
from their village ever had left.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, local authorities have tended to turn a blind eye
to human smuggling. Remittances from abroad have fed a building
boom and enriched the province, and the exodus has controlled
population growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the outflow has shamed Beijing. Each sensational smuggling
tragedy makes life in China seem so terrible that people are
willing to die to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Fujian peasants have enough to eat and China's
policy limiting families to one child is loosely enforced in
villages, those who make it to the West are often coached by
smugglers to claim persecution for their political views or for not
adhering to the one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Federal Board of Immigration Appeals in the
United States reviewed 6,067 asylum applications from Chinese, of
which 929 were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Political persecution is widespread in China, but those targeted
are most often religious dissidents, democracy activists and labor
organizers who pose a threat to the Communist Party's grip on power
_ not farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has started to crack down on smuggling, last year
capturing 9,000 stowaways and 800 snakeheads, who were fined or
imprisoned. But many suspect that some corrupt customs agents help
the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to educate people about the risks, with
graphic pictures of bodies of stowaways that washed ashore. In the
town of Qian Zhai, huge slogans painted on the walls scream the
warning: ``It's dangerous, illegal and hazardous to your health to
leave your country illegally!'' Another urges, ``Expose the
snakeheads and middlemen!''
</P>
<P>
   But people here pay little attention. ``Of course some people
know how dangerous it is, but everyone who has gone makes so much
money,'' said Xiao Yongwen, 25, a driver from Fuzhou. ``People just
build new houses and show off their money, and never mention how
hard it all was.''

AT 30, GAY PARADE HAS GONE MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a bright and sunny Sunday morning 30 years ago
this week, a group of perhaps 200 men and women _ nervous and
unsure _ gathered at Sheridan Square and then stepped onto the
Avenue of the Americas to create a moment in history. For 60
minutes, they marched hastily up to Central Park, observing the
first anniversary of an uprising at a gay bar in Greenwich Village,
the Stonewall Inn.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gay pride parade, the city's first, and it was as much
a curiosity to the sometimes hostile onlookers as it was to the gay
men and lesbians who dared to join it.
</P>
<P>
   When that same parade steps off on Sunday, this time onto Fifth
Avenue, its ranks will include some of the same gay men and
lesbians who were there that first day, many of whom went on to
create the nation's first post-Stonewall gay liberation groups, the
Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance. But the parade
will also include the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
Democrat, and the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   It will count among its sponsors United Airlines and Budweiser
beer. And if recent history is any guide, it will be a six-hour
party _ at points both randy and rowdy, albeit with political
overtones _ drawing hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   But to what end?
</P>
<P>
   When the first march was organized from the Bleecker Street
apartment of Craig Rodwell, one of many activists who said they
were present when patrons fought back when police raided the
Stonewall, the parade was intended as an act of anger and political
affirmation. Rodwell, who died in 1993, envisioned a purposeful
protest in a nation where there was no gay rights law, where sodomy
was illegal, where police crackdowns on gay bars were commonplace,
where homosexuality was portrayed in entertainment as perverse and
threatening, if at all, and where the idea of living openly as a
homosexual, much less announcing it with a march through Manhattan
on a Sunday morning, was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks leading up to the 30th anniversary of that
first march, the state Legislature, after years of resistance by
Republicans, passed a hate crimes bill that included protections
for gays, just days after the U.S. Senate passed its own version of
the bill. A run of corporations, including Coca-Cola and the big
automakers in Detroit, have granted partnership benefits to
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spoke before the Empire State Pride Agenda in
Manhattan in October, his presence a reminder of how unremarkable
it has become for a sitting president to appear before a gay
lobbying group. Four years after Bob Dole refused to accept a
contribution from a gay Republican organization, gay leaders sat
down for a meeting with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
Republican candidate for president. The state of Vermont legalized
gay civil unions, and even the CIA has established a caucus for gay
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have dreamed 30 years ago that this much valuable
progress would have been made?'' asked Martin Duberman, one of the
nation's pre-eminent gay historians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a result, the gay rights movement seems at times on the
brink of being rendered irrelevant by its own success. The
fundamental question challenging the movement since its founding
members gathered in the weeks after Stonewall seems as daunting as
ever: What, beyond the general notion of seeking what its leaders
call equal rights, is it fighting for?
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, still abundant evidence of antipathy toward
homosexuals: the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in
1998 and the denunciation of homosexuality by some Republican
leaders. But the movement has also made vast cultural and legal
advances in a 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hardly surprising that this movement has had
difficulty agreeing on a political agenda, a chronic battle that
has accounted for much of the upheaval that has marked gay
organizing since Stonewall.
</P>
<P>
   When Janice Thomas, the chairwoman of this year's march
organizing committee, was asked to describe its political agenda,
she responded: ``We're marching in favor of our equal rights. It is
not more specific than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizing call of the first wave of post-Stonewall leaders,
or at least male ones, for sexual freedom has largely been
overtaken by the AIDS epidemic, and the assertion by some that the
disease was one consequence of the celebration of promiscuity. Even
the hate-crime bills, which would create an extra level of
penalties for crimes motivated by hatred of homosexuals, are a
matter of dispute. While most gay leaders describe it as a
fundamental issue, there are those like William K. Dobbs who argue
that the legislation is patronizing and a violation of First
Amendment prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Soref, the co-executive director of the Empire State Pride
Agenda, asserts that given the accomplishments of the gay rights
movement, and the effort by gay couples to become, in effect, part
of mainstream society, the task for organizations like his is to
adjust by lobbying for a new round of gay concerns, such as
permitting gay and lesbian couples to adopt children. ``I don't
agree with the people who say there's no agenda anymore,'' Soref
said. ``I think it's an expanding agenda, and maybe it's more
nuanced and subtler because the definition of who is considered
part of the lesbian and gay community is now much more complex, and
much more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many gay leaders chafe even at that. ``We may be becoming
too mainstream; we've lost some of the bite,'' said Robert W.
Bailey, an associate professor of public policy and administration
at Rutgers, who has examined gay voting patterns.

SHADES OF HITCHCOCK: FLY SWARMS PLAGUE RESIDENTS IN UPSTATE NEW
YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, N.Y. _ Will they return, or is the worst over?
</P>
<P>
   Will the buzzing black masses swarm around homes, settling on
screens and siding? Will they again slip through cracks around
windows or fly in doors, landing on food and brushing across the
faces of the sleeping? Will more barbecues be canceled, more garden
parties postponed?
</P>
<P>
   If only the people of Naples knew.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, millions of flies hatched and descended on about half
a dozen houses in town, three weeks after an area farmer spread 200
tons of chicken manure on a 20-acre field nearby. Some of the
residents fled to the homes of friends and relatives. The town's
health officer, noting the amount of dead flies around the houses,
declared a public health risk.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents banded together to pester county and state health
and environmental officials for help. Town officials fielded
inquiries from news organizations as far away as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, after chemical spraying and the use of
lots of fly strips, traps and plain old fly swatters, the flies
were down to the kind of nuisance found in a stable. But some
residents of Naples, a town in the Finger Lakes region about 40
miles south of Rochester, were still digging out from under piles
of thousands of dead flies in closets, on front porches and in tool
sheds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a black cloud,'' said Ervin Paulsen, who lives
across County Road 36 from the field where the manure was spread.
He doused his house with insecticide. ``It was just like an Alfred
Hitchcock movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Fleischman, who lives next to the field, said, ``I'd get
home from work, and I'd have to get the hose and spray down the
door to get in the house.'' First, the odor of the manure, and then
the flies, kept her, her husband and their two daughters inside the
house for weeks. They stopped drinking their well water after all
four developed diarrhea. On Thursday, water testing confirmed the
presence of potentially dangerous E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more nightmare after another,'' Fleischman said.
</P>
<P>
   Though their water had never been tested before, the area's
water superintendent said that it was not uncommon to find some E.
coli in well water.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered residents said they would go back to grilling
outdoors and enjoying their spectacular views of the Bristol Hills
if they knew that the fly infestation was over. Naples, a town of
2,830, is best known for its rural charm, vineyards and annual
Grape Festival. But right now, some people are still hunkering
down, scrubbing walls and sweeping floors.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Kaufman, a veterinary entomologist at Cornell University
who consulted with the farmer, Mark Adams, said this type of
``giant fly explosion'' was reported only a few times each summer
across the country. ``They're very likely through the worst part,''
Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the town supervisor, Donald Leysath, said, ``If we continue
to get rain, I'm going to have a fly problem.''
</P>
<P>
   People who live a few miles down County Road 36 say they had a
similar fly problem last summer after Adams spread chicken manure
on an 80-acre field in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is a member of the Naples Town Board and president of
Adams Hen House, the family farm, where he tends 105,000 laying
hens.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Adams spread the manure on his own fields as
fertilizer. But in the last few years, Adams _ who also happens to
be a member of the town's Board of Health, as well as president of
the New York Poultry Association _ began leasing acreage so he
could spread the manure more thinly to better protect the soil and
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Then the trouble began. Angry neighbors say Adams caused last
week's fly infestation by dumping manure filled with larvae that
hatch into flies, and by not plowing the manure under quickly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Adams denies that the manure contained larvae.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the flies had probably been attracted by the
manure's odor and had laid eggs before the plowing.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading manure is a common farm practice, and it rarely
results in such masses of flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large number of variables and many unanswered
questions,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he follows agricultural guidelines for applying
manure and for plowing the manure under within a few days. But he
concedes that frequent rains kept him from plowing under the recent
application of manure for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he is investigating alternatives to disposing of the
manure, such as composting and selling it as dried fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The change would come none too soon for Denise Wheaton and
Charles Francis, who live near the field blamed for the fly
infestation. After spraying insecticide, their front porch was
littered with dead flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around farms all my life,'' Francis said. ``I've
never seen anything like this.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most Texas voters think Gov. George W. Bush has
done a good job in office. They're just not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite overwhelming approval ratings, 63 percent of registered
voters in the state _ including 56 percent who support Bush's
campaign for president _ can't name a reform the governor has made,
according to The Scripps Howard Texas Poll released today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is saying that he's `A Reformer with Results,'
and it's interesting that Texans can't name a reform that he's
brought about in the state,'' said Texas Poll Director Ty Meighan.
``It's even more interesting because he's been out there talking
about it. Perhaps people haven't been paying attention at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poll indicates state voters intend to vote for Bush
over Vice President Al Gore in the presidential election _ 57
percent to 24 percent. Two percent supported Ralph Nader and 1
percent favored Pat Buchanan. Twelve percent were undecided and 4
percent said they would vote for none of those candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approval ratings as governor also remain high, at 73
percent. Twenty-three percent disapproved of his job performance
and 6 percent said they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen job approval ratings as high as his ever,''
Meighan said. ``It's been unbelievable, and it's not a one time
shot.'' Approval ratings for Bush's predecessor, Democratic
Governor Ann Richards, peaked at 60 percent in Spring 1994 .
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who interjects Spanish into many of his speeches, has
wooed the Hispanic vote in past gubernatorial campaigns and in his
present run for the presidency. But 75 percent of Hispanics _ and
66 percent of African Americans _ couldn't name a reform brought
about by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign has done a great job with the photo ops and
sound bytes,'' said Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth
Malcolm in a prepared statement. ``He'd be a great candidate for
class favorite. But the job of president requires leadership _ not
just likability.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were less skewed among the state's Republican
voters, 52 percent of whom could not name a reform.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who named reforms made by Bush, 16 percent cited
education. Four percent named crime and 3 percent named property
tax as Bush's number-one reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has always made education a number one priority,
and that is also the number one priority of Texans,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's changes in education, such as granting local
autonomy, ending social promotion and increasing teachers'
salaries, have not constituted a change in education great enough
to be called reforms, said presidential campaign expert Bruce
Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas at
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is not really a reformer as that term is truly
understood,'' Buchanan said. ``He's more of an incremental change
specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's not unusual for the public to lack concrete knowledge
of politics and public policy, the poll results don't favor Bush's
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the Bush group even went to that label was in
reaction to McCain in the primaries,'' Buchanan said, referring to
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who campaigned against Bush for the
Republican Party nomination as a reformer of campaign finance, the
tax system and budgetary spending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen percent of Texas Democrats said they would vote for
Bush in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, a telephone interview of 1,000 adult Texans
conducted between May 22 and June 16, has an overall margin of
error of 3 percentage points. The poll also found that 56 percent
of Texas voters would cast their ballot for Republican Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchinson. Democrat Gene Kelly received 21 percent support,
while 16 percent were undecided. Kelly has a slight lead leads over
Hutchinson among Hispanics and African Americans while Hutchinson
has a 40 percent edge over Kelly among Anglo voters.

HOME AWAY FROM HOME FOR AIRLINE CREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hans Krause was in the air, somewhere over Virginia,
when he heard about the pub. Another pilot, who flies for United,
told him there was a place in New York City where the beer was
cheap, the customers were airline and the bartender had a huge
collection of bras, hanging on a beam above the bottles of vodka
and whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time Krause, 32, a pilot for Trans States Airlines,
landed in New York, he dropped his things off at the crash pad in
Kew Gardens, Queens, that he shares with 13 other pilots and
wandered into Yer Man's Irish Pub on Metropolitan Avenue, main
street for people in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Krause lives in Florida, but he spends three or four days a week
in New York. He is among the scores of flight attendants and pilots
who have apartments or second homes in Kew Gardens, which is close
to both La Guardia and Kennedy airports. The neighborhood is so
full of airline employees that residents call it ``Crew Gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   The other night Krause showed up at about 10 p.m. at Yer Man's
with a roommate, Dave Zook, who also flies for Trans States. It was
Wednesday, airline night at the pub. So anyone who flew _ and the
owner of Yer Man's, Jimmy O'Reilly, said he always knows who they
are _ got half-price drinks all night.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd swelled with pilots and flight attendants, Krause
moved around the room, greeting friends from Delta, Continental,
United, American and TWA. Some he had known since he first showed
up at the pub four years ago, others he met just recently. But as
he worked his way around the room, they all seemed like his sisters
and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a definite subculture,'' said Krause, on his third
beer. ``Being away from home so much, it feels like a family-type
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause has spent his 30th birthday, a Thanksgiving and a
Christmas at Yer Man's, because his flying schedule made it
impossible for him to go home to Vero Beach, Fla., where he has a
wife and a 2-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   While Krause was mingling with his friends, the pilot who had
told him about Yer Man's in the first place called on his cell
phone from California and said he wished he were there.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said many of the pilots he knows have also got the Yer
Man's fever. On his briefcase is a sticker, from O'Reilly's
plentiful selection of Yer Man's paraphernalia, that says, ``Save
Water, Drink at Yer Man's.'' Krause said he has several times found
himself in an airline personnel lounge thousands of miles away and
noticed the stickers on other pilots' briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   In the six years since he opened the pub and introduced airline
night, O'Reilly, who is originally from Killarney, Ireland, has
become something of a father figure for airline personnel in the
neighborhood. (``Yer man,'' O'Reilly said, is slang in Ireland for
``what's-his-name.'') Almost as soon as he opened the place, he
noticed that Kew Gardens was a hub for airline people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to know the look,'' said O'Reilly. ``Their hair is all
nicely done and sometimes they come in here wearing summer clothes
in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly knew a good business opportunity when he saw one, but
he also thought that there was loneliness in the job and that the
pilots and flight attendants could use a place to go. Certainly
many of them might want to get away from their apartments, where
rooming with 10, 15 or 20 people is routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could do something to help them out,'' O'Reilly
said. ``A lot of them are young, and so we watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Apking, 25, a flight attendant for Delta, was at Yer
Man's for the third time the other night, having heard about it
from another flight attendant. She has 15 roommates, living in
three bedrooms and a living room and sharing one and a half baths.
She works six days straight and then has six days off, so her
social life gets a little discombobulated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, she had stopped in at Yer Man's and met a
pilot from JetBlue. The two agreed to meet the next night, airline
night, and they danced to live music and chatted at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Apking said. ``Everyone's airline. There's
a certain comfort about that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pilot, Ralph Meyer, stays with 27 other pilots across the
street from the pub and has been going to Yer Man's for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when we all get together,'' he said. ``The main
thing is we get to mix airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly knew three of the working crew members _ and several
others who were ``deadheading,'' or getting a ride but not working
_ on TWA Flight 800, which exploded over Long Island in July 1996,
killing all 230 aboard. Some of the pilots and flight attendants
who died in the crash had spent time at the pub, on airline night.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the crash, O'Reilly held a benefit at the pub,
featuring 18 bands and raising $6,500 for the children of airline
employees who died in the crash. In the back of the bar, a plaque
is propped against the wall, listing the names of the airline
employees who died. ``To the Crew of Flight 800,'' it says, ``From
all their friends at Yer Man's Irish Pub.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bra collection. O'Reilly somewhat sheepishly
explained that he had a certain expertise in the bra-removal
department and that, if a woman was willing, he could unsnap and
remove a bra within 10 seconds, if it was under a short-sleeved
shirt. Looking up at the collection, hundreds of them dangling over
the bar _ lace, satin and cotton, ranging in size from A cups to
double D's _ O'Reilly said, ``If I had to estimate, I'd say about
60 percent of those came from flight attendants.''

IN NASCAR, THE DEALS ARE SHORT-LIVED, BUT THE MEMORIES LAST LONG
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT HULER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every sport has its deals.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, you want to make a deal, you go to spring training.
Football or hockey? Try draft day.
</P>
<P>
   But in Winston Cup racing, the deals go down where the guys go
up _ in the spotter's stand on top of the speedway grandstand.
During every race, every team sends a spotter to the roof; it's a
rule. And everyone knows he spends the race telling the driver what
he sees.
</P>
<P>
   Except the spotter has one more responsibility. He makes deals.
</P>
<P>
   Spotters make small deals throughout any race. They can promise
later cooperation if a lapped car will give way, or they can
explain why a lapped car will refuse to cooperate; perhaps it hopes
to regain its lap, or perhaps the driver remembers a race two years
previously when he didn't get the cooperation he asked for.
</P>
<P>
   If someone wants to get by a car, his spotter has to have
something to offer the passed car _ help later in the race, help
during another race. Sometimes it's as ineffable as a general
spirit of cooperation that can grow between two teams over years;
other times it's a promise to stick together until a certain point
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than negotiating business contracts in a
boardroom,'' said Vic Maguire, spotter for the No. 10 car driven by
Johnny Benson. ``It's a give-and-take.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotters wheel and deal the most at the superspeedways at
Daytona, where the Pepsi 400 takes place on Saturday night, and
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   At Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, the real deals go down in
a couple of rows of rickety aluminum bleachers high atop the
grandstand at the start-finish line, almost in Turn 1. There, in a
cloud of gnats in the brutal Southern sun, squinting across the
2.66-mile track through haze so thick the spotters can barely
identify their own cars in Turn 3, twice-a-year spotters engage in
a kind of dealing that has parallels nowhere else in NASCAR _ or
any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Job 1 for a spotter is to keep his driver apprised of
where his competition is on the track _ when someone is coming up
behind him, when he can move up or down on the track. ``Clear
low!'' the spotter says into his radio, and the driver cuts down
into traffic, secure that he has a space. At most tracks the
spotter does little more than that eye-in-the-sky act, keeping his
driver safe and his $100,000 race car in one piece. Says Danny
Culler, who spots for the No. 3 car driven by Dale Earnhardt,
``It's kind of like being an air traffic controller for a race-car
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Except at Talladega and Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   At those two superspeedways, where carburetor restrictor plates
limit engine output and smooth the field to a parity that renders
horsepower virtually inconsequential, the aerodynamic draft is the
key. In the draft, two or more cars running together outstrip even
the fastest car running alone. So without a dance partner, as they
say, you're sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the spotter.
</P>
<P>
   If a crew chief is looking for a partner, he doesn't go running
up and down pit road. ``It's easier to do it through the spotter,''
Maguire said. ``The spotters are all in one place. I'm not more
than 30 feet away from a guy who might be a whole straightaway down
pit road.''
</P>
<P>
   So late in a race at Talladega, the spotters' stand can become a
cross between a boardroom and a bazaar. The only things at the
speedway moving faster than the spotters are the race cars
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire offered a look into the spotter's life at Talladega
during the weekend of the Die Hard 500, which ran April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The necessity, in superspeedway racing, is to be in a
competitive position at the end of the race,'' Maguire said. ``If
you're in a tight draft, in the top five, you've got a chance to
win. So you have to create alliances that might not occur at short
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   All during practice, drivers run just behind and just in front
of other cars. How does Benson's Pontiac handle behind a Ford? In
front of a Chevy? Are there particular cars it runs with well or
poorly? How does it do in a big draft? A small one? All those
elements will come into play when it's time to choose a friend on
race day.
</P>
<P>
   When this partnership of necessity is struck midrace, isn't it a
little bit like the Mets calling the Dodgers with a deal? Something
like: ``If you use your three weakest starters against the
Phillies, we'll throw everything we've got against the Giants''?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Maguire said. ``In the first place, baseball isn't
open to as many places.'' The driver Kenny Schrader agreed.
``Everything else, it's just two teams,'' he said. ``But when you
got 43 cars at once, you get a buddy and say, `Let's beat those 40
other guys first' _ then we'll lie to each other at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes _ the lie. ``Really, the deals that are set are like a
fairy story,'' Benson said, shrugging and shaking his head. ``A lot
of people say, `Let's work together, let's make a deal,' but that
lasts a lap and a half.'' Bart Creasman, spotter for the No. 55 car
driven by Kenny Wallace, said it best: ``The real deal is there's
no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So deals are being broken all race long, and yet there are
always more.
</P>
<P>
   Some spotters get reputations as dealmakers; some guys try to
rough their act up to drive harder bargains. ``It's WWF stuff going
on up there,'' Maguire said, laughing. And if some spotter is
combing the stand to make a deal, Creasman said: ``You can tell
your driver, `Hey, this guy's running up and down _ he ain't
watching his car. Jump on him.'''
</P>
<P>
   It truly is like a bazaar, where rational self-interest is
hardly the rule of the day. Benson gave the example of a group of
four or five cars drafting together not in the lead pack. ``That
pack of five needs to say, `We need to stay nose to tail,''' and
the spotters may not even need to get involved. ``That deal's going
to last,'' Benson said, ``at least until you get to the lead
pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Then things change. That draft may be the fastest draft on the
track _ if they stayed together, they would not only catch but pass
the lead cars. But as soon as that draft catches the leaders,
someone is going to decide he can run better behind the leaders _
or is going to make a deal with one of the leaders, and everything
breaks down in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The example that everyone in the garage still talks about
occurred in this season's Daytona 500 on Feb. 20. With only a few
laps remaining, Benson led the race, followed by Mark Martin (in
the No. 6 car), Dale Jarrett and Jeff Burton (in the No. 99 car).
Martin and Jarrett's teams brokered a deal for Martin and Jarrett
to pass Benson on the high side, sticking together until they were
by him. The spotters and teams had it all worked out.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted about a tenth of a second. Martin went high, Jarrett
moved to follow him _ and saw in his mirror that Burton, Martin's
teammate, was going low, which could have left Jarrett out in the
cold, behind both cars. ``He was committed to the 6 until the 99
changed his commitment,'' Benson said. ``And he had about
two-hundredths of a second to make his decision. That's how deals
work. And that's among teammates, let alone the rest of the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett won that race; Martin, famous for sticking with his
deals, said, ``I got lied to.'' Jimmy Fennig, crew chief for
Martin, said at Talladega, ``We learned a lesson, and I guarantee
it won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that deals are made in bad faith, said Stevie
Reeves, spotter for the No. 13 car driven by Robby Gordon, who
likens the promises teams make through their spotters to those made
by gamblers at a dice table. ``It's like saying, `I'm going to roll
a seven,''' Reeves said. ``You mean it, but you don't got no
control over that.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few laps remaining in the DieHard 500 at Talladega, which
was eventually won by Jeff Gordon, Martin led the race. But he ran
in the draft behind Jarrett, who was the last car on the lead lap.
The teams communicated through their spotters, Jarrett asking
Martin if he preferred him to move. Martin liked his position, and
only very late in the race did Jarrett make a gentlemanly shift
high to let the leaders by him.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect that to make him best friends with Jimmy
Fennig.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never forget,'' he said of the Daytona 500. ``You never
forget.'' &QL;

MORTGAGE RATES EASE SOMEWHAT 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prospective home buyers surveying the mortgage market
have seen mortgage rates rise steadily if undramatically since last
June, prodded by Federal Reserve interest-rate increases. But in
recent weeks rates on the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
have been easing somewhat. Adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile,
have been steadier.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the narrowness of the spread between rates
for fixed and adjustable mortgages, lending specialists say,
fixed-rate loans, which cannot change over the term of the
mortgage, have been gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly average rates for 30-year mortgages dropped from a high
for the year of 8.82 percent for the week ending May 19 to 8.37
percent for the week ending June 16. Last Wednesday, the rate was
8.33 percent. One-year adjustable-rate mortgages stood at 7.37
percent for the week ending May 19 and 7.38 percent the week ending
June 16, but rose to 7.55 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in the increases in the last year has been the
actions of the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates
1.75 percentage points since last June, raising the rate a quarter
point five times and a half point last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, adjustable-rate mortgages
accounted for 31 percent of all mortgages nationwide, compared with
12 percent in the same quarter in 1999. But midway through the
second quarter, the last period for which statistics are available,
they dropped to 29 percent, compared with 17 percent for the second
quarter of last year, and lenders say their percentage of the
mortgage market is continuing to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is that current applications for ARMs is down
from 32 percent to about 15 to 20 percent,'' said Luke Hayden, a
vice president of the Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While fixed-rate mortgages remain constant throughout the length
of the loan, adjustable-rate mortgages carry a lower interest rate
initially and offer an array of choices. But after a set period of
time _ one year, three years, five years and even seven years are
typical _ the interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgages can rise,
pegged to a benchmark like the Federal Reserve rate, and can
typically increase by as much as 6 percentage points over the life
of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the refinancing market is moribund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Fed started raising rates a year ago, refinancing
virtually disappeared since it's driven almost entirely by interest
rates,'' said Doug Duncan, the chief economist of the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America. ``At this moment, the share of
applications for refinancing is down to 12.45 percent, the lowest
in four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant changes in the mortgage market in
recent years is that people wanting to know about mortgages are
flocking to the Internet. The most striking feature, perhaps, is
the availability of loans through scores of Web sites, sites that
offer interactive tools that allow prospective borrowers to play
out an infinite number of ``what if's'' involving a variety of
rates, down payments and types and terms of loans.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to some expectations, few borrowers are actually
applying for loans over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., predicted last year that
online mortgage lending would soar more than fivefold from 1999 to
2003, to about $91 billion, or 10 percent of the total mortgage
market. But its most recent analysis, published in March, reported
that mortgage lenders ``worry about the lack of consumer acceptance
and the low close rates on applications to date.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis of Internet mortgages by Kenneth A. Posner and
Michael D. Courtian of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter noted that while
recent surveys have found that more than 50 percent of people who
take out mortgages use the Web to research prices and terms, only 1
percent apply online.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective borrowers gather a lot of information on the Web,
Duncan said, ``but when it comes to actually filling out and
signing the documents, they realize it isn't a simple transaction
so they back away.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason people looking for mortgages avoid online
brokers, the Morgan Stanley study said, is that they are wary of
putting their Social Security numbers, employment information,
income and assets online.
</P>
<P>
   Another stumbling block had been the refusal of some states to
accept electronic signatures as binding in online transactions,
including mortgages. But that obstacle was overcome when a bill
making e-signatures binding recently passed both houses of Congress
by lopsided margins. President Clinton is expected to sign the
measure, which is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1.

BILLIONAIRES ARE `RAISING THE BAR' FOR AMERICA'S CUP
</HEADLINE>
  By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In flush times and lean ones, the America's Cup has been a
historical lure to wealthy men eager to advance business or
personal agendas. In the early part of the last century, the Irish
merchant Sir Thomas Lipton employed numerous cup challenges to help
market tea bags. Later, the railroad tycoon Harold ``Mike''
Vanderbilt found cup racing to be a rigorous adjunct to the joys of
a Newport, R.I., summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although in more recent times well-heeled businessmen like Bill
Koch and Ted Turner have promulgated the notion that the cup is a
game for the financially gifted, other sailors with working-class
backgrounds, like Dennis Conner and Paul Cayard, have also proved
that campaigns can be started _ and a handsome individual salary
procured _ with a healthy input of corporate backing.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when a sponsored sailor can run a reasonably
successful effort for $12 million or even $32 million _ the budgets
for Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes team and Cayard's America One squad in
the last cup _ now appear to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Seattle cellular-phone billionaire Craig O. McCaw
announced the formation of his OneWorld Challenge for the 2002-2003
cup races. And racing personnel in the United States and New
Zealand have confirmed that Oracle's software founder, Larry
Ellison, whose personal fortune is a reported $47 billion, is
committed to a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Europe, the cup newcomers Ernesto Bertarelli and
Pierre-Oliver Essig, from Switzerland, have joined the Prada
Challenge's Patrizio Bertelli in separate campaigns to bring the
cup to the continent. And while the announced cup budgets from this
group range from $50 million to $70 million, in an escalated war
for talent and technology, the thought of a $100 million America's
Cup campaign is no longer laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Conner calls these guys the Bees, for billionaires,''
said Bob Billingham, the general manager of America One. ``They've
changed the game. They're raising the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard to raise $20 million in corporate funding the
last time, and it's questionable if that was good value for our
sponsors,'' he said. ``To ask them to double or triple that amount
is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Billingham believes his team's business plan is no longer
competitively viable, he also feels the injection of fresh faces
and dollars could spark new interest. ``Whether you see these guys
as heroes or villains, the bottom line is that they're interesting
people going head to head,'' he said. ``It could give the cup a
whole new personality. And their funding will create technology
that advances the entire sport.''
</P>
<P>
   One cup rookie who plans to avoid the limelight is McCaw, who
skipped last week's luncheon at the Seattle Yacht Club, which his
team will represent, and who declined requests to be interviewed
for this story. For several weeks, McCaw's name has arisen as the
likely backer of a Seattle-based challenge that was intent on
raiding the back-to-back cup-winning Team New Zealand squad.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw has chosen the Australian cup veteran Peter Gilmour to
head his sailing team, has recruited the Kiwi yacht designer Laurie
Davidson to create his boats and has signed up two dozen of
Davidson's countrymen to race them and work on them. ``The reason
we built it around the Kiwis is that they were talented and
available,'' said Bob Ratliffe, a spokesman for McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   The initial roster of Kiwis, which include the grinders Andrew
Taylor and Craig Monk, is notable for its lack of marquee names.
The Kiwi superstars Russell Coutts and Brad Butterworth, have
already cast their fates with Bertarelli's Swiss group.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw has also enlisted the Seattle brothers Jonathan and
Charlie McKee, who will also represent the United States in the
49er dinghy class at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. ``By
the time we're actually out there sailing, you'll see a much more
balanced team that I would guess would primarily consist of
Americans,'' Charlie McKee said. ``I'm excited about sailing with
the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   McKee also said he and his brother were intrigued by the
environmental mission of the syndicate. McCaw has proclaimed that
part of his motivation in mounting a challenge is to promote
environmental awareness of the world's oceans. ``Jonathan and I
have purposely stayed out of this arena before, and that was a
significant factor in our decision to join,'' Charlie McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat lost in the shuffle surrounding McCaw's announcement is
the Seattle Challenge, a second local effort that represents the
Corinthian Yacht Club and is spearheaded by the 26-year-old boat
builder Russell Belden, who hopes to bankroll his $42 million
campaign with corporate funding. Belden's aim is to field an
all-American squad.

MENINGITIS KILLS AIR PASSENGER SOON AFTER ARRIVAL

   NEW YORK _ A 20-year-old Rochester, N.Y., man died of meningitis
two hours after his flight from Israel landed in Newark, N.J., on
Friday. On Saturday, authorities were notifying the plane's other
passengers that they might want to seek medical advice.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rochester man, Joseph Ferraro, arrived at Newark
International Airport aboard El Al Flight 17 about 5 p.m. Friday,
airline workers notified Port Authority police that he needed
medical assistance. Paramedics took him to Beth Israel Medical
Center in Newark, where he was pronounced dead at 7:07 p.m.,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was carrying 416 passengers and 19 crew members. Gregory
Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said that as of early
Saturday afternoon, authorities had contacted 14 passengers,
encouraging those who had concerns about possible infection to see
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor said that federal and state health officials had also
been notified of Ferraro's illness _ meningococcal meningitis, a
bacterial infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal
cord. The infection is transmitted only through close contact with
an infected person, and it is treatable with antibiotics if
detected early enough.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently was traveling in Israel on a program for Jewish
teen-agers and college-age youth.
</P>
<P>
   Neither organizers of the trip nor Ferraro's family could be
reached for comment Saturday.

`OLD SCHOOL' JUDGE ADJUSTS TO RUNNING POLICE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ Arthur L. Spada, Connecticut's newly minted
state police commissioner, likes to talk about the lessons he
learned growing up in the ghetto. His parents, a bricklayer and a
seamstress, arrived from Sicily in 1923, and raised their children
on Front Street, on Hartford's hardscrabble east side in a house
without indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shined shoes at age 8 and 10,'' Spada recalled with proud
fondness, sitting in his tall new leather chair behind his enormous
new desk at state police headquarters. ``We were ditch-diggers at
16.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left for Wesleyan University, where he studied history
and, at 5 feet 4, became a starting linebacker, Spada had also
worked four summers in Connecticut's tobacco fields, earning 35
cents an hour. ``You came home, your whole body was loaded with
nicotine,'' he said, brushing his hands over his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day doesn't go by,'' he went on, leaning over the desk,
where two needle-sharp pencils poked out of a rainbow-striped
coffee mug, ``that I don't make a value judgment on whether
something is worth buying or investing based on the economics I
learned on Front Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Spada, 67, is what some of the younger state troopers might call
old-school. Until he retired to take his current job, Spada spent
the last 22 years as a Superior Court judge with no use for pagers,
cell phones, computers or, by his admission, stylish clothing.
``Judges are not fashion plates,'' he said, grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that is changing, and Spada _ he still gets called Judge
more than Commissioner _ is struggling to adapt, not only to the
new electronics (``They even gave me a laptop''), new suits (bought
at Filene's Basement) and his new gun (required), but also to a new
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from kind of a monastic culture, where you sat in a
courthouse chamber the size of my bathroom facility'' _ he jerked a
thumb at the private toilet next door to his office _ ``to a
culture involving people, contacts,'' he said. ``As a judge, when
you came into the courtroom, you had the first word and the last
word. Now you're working with 1,500 people. That is a cultural
shock that I'm still adjusting to. You just simply cannot work as a
Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never been a police officer, Spada said it is
imperative to show his new employees that he is one of them. ``My
responsibility is to show them that if I don't have blue blood,''
he said, referring to the police kind of blue, ``I know what blue
blood is.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been on the job for two weeks, Spada has begun drafting
an agenda: to hire more troopers, including more nonwhite men and
women, and boost the pay that already ranks third highest of all
state police agencies; to complete the installation of a new
Motorola radio communications system; and to wire all patrol cars
with on-board computers.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more policy change to come under Spada: traffic
violations. The commissioner promised that troopers would soon
begin an all-out attack on Connecticut's increasingly crowded
highway traffic, ticketing speeders and tailgaters and bringing
what Spada twice referred to as ``rogue truckers'' to ``a
screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
   With the General Assembly's approval, Spada would also like to
begin using video cameras that have already been installed along
Interstate 95, where the speed limit is 55 mph, to catch speeders.
</P>
<P>
   While Spada adjusts to being a member of the police force, he is
also adapting to other things, like the hour it takes to drive 20
miles north to Hartford each night, not because of traffic
congestion but because his chauffeured state police car is required
by law to pull over and assist any stranded or disabled vehicles
encountered on the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unusual, lucky day when we can get home without
any incidences,'' Spada said, toying with a pair of black
wrap-around sunglasses, a gift from his predecessor, Dr. Henry Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that Gov. John Rowland had offered the
commissioner's job to Spada _ best known as the grand jurist who
presided over the indictment of six police officers in 1994,
including one state trooper _ people immediately compared him with
Lee. An unusually popular state police commissioner who pioneered
the application of forensic science to police work, Lee left the
department after two years and remains a consultant to the
Connecticut State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons did not trouble Spada, who believes he will be
every bit the efficient administrator that Lee was. But if Lee
infused the agency with star power and a touch of high-tech elan,
Spada intends to improve it with elbow grease and a work ethic
learned in the tobacco fields _ all applied with the charm and
curiosity that have served Spada well over the years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An avid reader of history, including five biographies of Abraham
Lincoln, Spada attracted the interest of a group of judges visiting
from Bosnia three years ago by displaying a detailed knowledge of
European history and discussing the peregrinations of the Visigoths
through southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were extremely impressed,'' said Anthony Fisser, who
leads the Connecticut Judges Institute, a continuing education
program for state judges.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, who first
met Spada nearly 20 years ago, said Spada was a deceptively simple
man. ``He's a much smarter and articulate person than your
impression might be on first meeting him,'' Blumenthal said. ``When
I met him, I remember thinking, `Gee, this guy is charming, but how
smart is he?' But he is razor sharp. He doesn't need to use
multisyllable words to show anybody how smart he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spada does not seem like a man whose life is dedicated only
to work. On warm weekends, he gardens; he cycles 25 miles every
Saturday and Sunday or plays golf at a public course, which, he
points out, costs only $6 a round. In the winter, he skis at
Butternut, a hill in Connecticut where lift tickets are $9.
</P>
<P>
   How long will he stay on the job? That depends on two things, he
said: He will stay as long as the governor wants him to, and as
long as his health holds out. Spada underwent quadruple bypass
surgery 18 years ago, and has had no complications since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I lucky? How long will it last?'' he asked, and he rapped
his knuckles on his big new wooden desk.

ANALYSIS: NEW YORK LEGISLATURE CLOSES WITHOUT USUAL SQUABBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For years, the pattern here was as reliable as
sunrise. Democrats and Republicans went at each other hammer and
tongs, hurling verbal bombs, delaying budgets for months, barely
speaking to each other, and tying unrelated issues together until
most of them collapsed in recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. The legislative session that wound to a close
Friday had its bloody episodes, but they were Republican against
Republican and Democrat against Democrat, with remarkably little
partisan carping. And it ended with an extraordinary number of
agreements on big issues, making it not only the most amicable but
by far the most productive session since well before George Pataki
became governor five and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a spectacular session for the people of this
state,'' a tired but beaming Pataki said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, the Assembly and the Senate ended days of
squabbling over petty procedural issues and passed a hate-crimes
bill that the governor said he would sign.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the Legislature and the governor struck
deals on the farthest-reaching package of gun controls anywhere in
the country, on a sweeping revision of sexual-assault laws, on a
new money-laundering law, on a broad package of school-safety
measures that includes fingerprinting and background checks of
school employees, on making doctors' malpractice records available
to the public, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the mad rush to the finish, the lawmakers had set
down landmarks. In December they agreed to an ambitious plan to
provide health insurance to the working poor, paid for by doubling
the cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   This year New York became the first state in the country to
require fire-safety standards for cigarettes, the first to restrict
where companies can sell or trade the ``pollution credits'' they
earn and the second to phase out a gasoline additive that has
caused ground-water pollution. Another bill gives retired state
workers annual pension increases for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things that people have been fighting for and
dreaming for years would happen suddenly happened _ boom!'' said
Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest
Research Group. ``It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That list amounted to a string of victories for the governor, a
Republican, and for the Democratic majority in the Assembly and
their speaker, Sheldon Silver. For Pataki, the year's achievements
raised his national profile, enhanced his reputation as a social
moderate who is tough on crime, and attached him to several popular
issues as he considers whether to run for a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats gave ground on a few criminal-justice
areas, particularly sexual assault and school violence, but also
won passage of major measures on hate crimes, cigarette
flammability and pesticide notification that they had sought for
years.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican majority in the Senate, it was a more mixed
result, and the verdict will not be known until the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   What most of the prominent bills passed this year have in common
is that they moved state policy significantly to the left _ much
further left than the Senate Republicans had been willing to go
before. Worried about their prospects in November, they have been
eager to shore up their standing with moderate voters, particularly
in the suburbs, and that has meant approving bills that made many
of them unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Their internal struggle over that shift was laid bare early
Friday when the Senate Republicans, their hand forced by the
governor's push for gun control, finally voted on the matter after
struggling for months to establish their position. Of the 20
upstate Republicans, only the majority leader, Joseph Bruno, voted
for the bill, which they clearly wished had never come before them,
while the downstate Republicans voted, 16-1, in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Friday morning on disclosing doctors' malpractice
records also had them deeply divided, 19 in favor and 17 against.
</P>
<P>
   Amicability between the parties was a theme this year. A month
ago, Silver could have criticized the governor for vetoing the
first version of the fire-safe cigarettes bill. Bruno and Pataki
could have berated Silver for resisting tougher penalties for sex
crimes. Silver could have taken after Bruno for dragging his feet
on gun control. But none of this happened.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, they would all have taken those shots, and
the temptation must have been great this year. Bruno looked
vulnerable early in the year, when he was feuding with the
governor, and many Republicans believed Pataki was trying to foment
a coup against the Senate leader. Silver was perhaps even more
vulnerable last month, when the second-ranking Assembly Democrat,
Michael Bragman, the majority leader, tried to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we were all too busy shooting at our own people,''
said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan. ``Just so many
bullets in the gun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Everyone refrained from taking advantage of those weaknesses and
attacking across party lines. ``The opportunity was there to create
some partisan chaos, but I think that would have been at the
expense of getting principled changes at the end of the day,''
Pataki said in an interview. In trying to get his way, he said, he
must have an evolving sense of ``what's going to be most effective
at achieving the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the 1996 and 1998 elections, the governor worked
hard to whittle down the Democratic majority in the Assembly, in
part by attacking and embarrassing them publicly over legislation.
But each time, the Democrats gained seats, and he may have
concluded that the strategy was pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Some Assembly Democrats say that the attempted coup in their
house may have contributed to this year's productivity. They argue
that Silver was forced to loosen his tight control over legislation
and, under pressure from the members, rely less on stalling as a
negotiating tactic. And Silver and many of his allies may have
felt, after surviving the coup, that they needed tangible
achievements to show their Assembly colleagues and the voters back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good year,'' said Sen. Kemp Hannon, R-Nassau
County. ``But it was hard getting here.''

REAL ESTATE: OLD BALTIMORE HIGH-RISE GETS A NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ When the elegant marble lobby and mosaic-tiled
corridors are restored in an $8 million renovation that is to be
completed next month, the Riviera apartment house will be the
fourth of five one-time luxury high-rises on what was once one of
this city's most prestigious streets to be rehabilitated in the
last six years.
</P>
<P>
   It will join the Emersonian, the Esplanade and Temple Gardens,
all of which have been refurbished in recent years. The
reconstruction has included replacing the floors of
rabbit-warren-like apartments to create more spacious units that
are closer to the buildings' original layouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera's developers have set market-rate rents for its
apartments, seeking affluent tenants for the inner-city location by
emphasizing such things as a new entrance to the building from a
fenced and gated parking lot and the equipping of all apartments
with a T-1 high-speed Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a city of two- and three-story homes, Baltimore
built few large apartment houses before World War II, but these
four buildings on Druid Park Lake Drive overlooking the city's main
park and its reservoir were the finest of their kind from 1912 to
the early 1960s. Now after 35 years of decline, they are again
desirable places to live in.
</P>
<P>
   The six-story 92,000-square-foot Riviera was built in 1914. It
was vacant when it was foreclosed by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development in the mid-1990s. The building was acquired by
the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development,
which issued a request for proposals for its reuse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the team of Pennrose Properties, a development firm
from Philadelphia, and Reservoir Hill Hope, a local nonprofit
developer, won the right to rehabilitate the Riviera. The project
was the first in Baltimore for Pennrose, a company that has
developed more than 5,000 units of multifamily housing, including
many historic properties, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations in the 1960s and 1970s had cut the apartments into a
warren of tiny units for subsidized housing, totally obliterating
most of the original apartment layouts. One of the few things left
from the 1914 design was a six-story-spiral fire-escape slide,
discovered behind a wall during demolition.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera originally had eight apartments per floor. It now
has nine units per floor: seven two-bedrooms of 1,200 to 1,600
square feet, and two one-bedrooms of about 700 square feet. All 54
units have either open porches or enclosed sun rooms with views of
the park or downtown Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   To redesign the apartments, the building had to be almost
gutted. But because it was a Baltimore city landmark and was
eligible for state and federal tax-credit equity for its historic
status, many elements were retained. The lobby, with walls of
marble and a coffered plaster ceiling, and the mosaic-tiled
corridor floors with their original plaster cove moldings were all
integrated into the new design, along with new lighting.
</P>
<P>
   As an additional condition for historic tax-credit status, four
apartments facing the park on the sixth floor and one apartment
each on floors one through five had to retain or duplicate original
interior detailing, like window trim, parquet flooring and
baseboards. The brick and stone Classical Revival exterior, along
with its sheet metal cornice, was restored.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera's market-rate apartments are intended for
professionals who work in the city. Rents will be $560 to $800 for
the two-bedrooms and $600 for the one-bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The building is two miles northwest of the Inner Harbor, the
city's hottest rental market, where rents start at $800 for a
one-bedroom and $1,200 for a two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Riviera will have all the amenities of a high-scale
building,'' said Mark Dambly, vice president and a partner of
Pennrose. ``There'll be a business center in the basement that
offers Internet access, fax and copying machines, as well as a
fitness center.'' A new entrance at the rear of the building will
lead to a gated parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A completely market-rate building tailored for professionals in
this location is unusual. The building abuts Reservoir Hill, a once
affluent neighborhood of elegant town houses that has been in
decline since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the neighborhood are pleased that the units are not
subsidized. ``This is a sign that says that this community is worth
investing in,'' said Curtis Jones, the board president of Reservoir
Hill Hope and pastor of nearby Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the developer's own equity and the historic tax
credits, Pennrose received $5 million in loans from HUD and the
city of Baltimore.

<P>
   By the early 1990s, the Emersonian, the Esplanade and Temple
Gardens had suffered the same fate as the Riviera. When Maryland
decided to package all of them in a request for proposals in 1994,
the Emersonian and the Esplanade were in such a run-down condition
that the remaining tenants had to be moved to Temple Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Roizman Development of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and the Baltimore
Housing Partnership won the contract and called the project
Renaissance Plaza. Since the three buildings made up the
Eutaw-Madison Apartment House National Register District, they were
eligible for historic tax-credit equity.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Riviera, each building had interior features, like
distinctive lobbies and corridors, to preserve. ``Besides restoring
the exteriors, we established historic zones to be preserved,''
said Patricia Massey, who was project manager and director of the
Baltimore Housing Partnership and who now runs her own firm, Katia
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the three, the nine-story Esplanade, built in
1912, was the first to be completed in 1994. Temple Gardens, at 14
stories the tallest building in Baltimore when it was built in
1926, came next in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The last to be finished, in 1996, was the Emersonian, an
eight-story building constructed in 1915 by Isaac Emerson, the
creator of Bromo-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   With 84 of the 301 apartments at market-rate rents and the rest
either subsidized or with income restrictions, the three buildings
have had a 99 percent occupancy rate. The entire cost of
Renaissance Plaza was $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth apartment house, at 903 Druid Park Lake Drive _
adjacent to the Riviera _ is vacant. It is on the market for
$525,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1900s, Baltimore's wealthy lived in town houses
in the center city or in suburban villas at its outskirts.
Apartment living was considered lower-class until the first luxury
apartment house was built on Eutaw Place, an elite residential
district. Once the rich adopted this lifestyle, other apartment
buildings were erected, notably at Druid Park Lake Drive, which
intersects the entry to Eutaw Place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, high-rise apartment living (six stories or more by
Baltimore's definition) had limited appeal, and fewer than two
dozen were built before World War II. ``A lot of people said these
buildings should be demolished, but we re-established that living
along the lake was a glamorous thing,'' Massey said.

EX-PROSECUTORS RECONCILE THE TWO SIDES OF A CAREER
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 16 years, Jonathan Frank was an assistant
district attorney in Brooklyn, prosecuting cases from the
little-known to the notorious, like the one in 1998 in which a man
was convicted of a triple murder and received the first death
sentence under New York State's current capital punishment law.
</P>
<P>
   Now Frank, 42, is in private practice at a law firm, dealing
with civil litigation and with criminal defense involving business
fraud. He wants nothing to do, he said, with defending anyone
charged with a violent crime. ``I've seen too much horror, tragedy,
pain and suffering from victims and their families,'' he said of
his days as a prosecutor, which ended last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bradley Simon, who was a federal prosecutor for 11
years before he began a one-man private practice in 1998. Simon,
44, sizes up potential clients more by character than criminal
category. He has no reservations about representing young people
whose ``immaturity and lack of judgment'' had led them into serious
crime, he said, but he has declined some cases involving career
criminals he considered ``beyond redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Simon are known as ``double-digit crossovers,''
members of a relatively small fraternity of veteran prosecutors who
waited a decade _ sometimes more _ before they went into private
practice. Some, like Frank, shun entire classes of cases that were
part of their prosecution routine. Others, like Simon, base their
professional comfort levels on their perceptions of individual
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Some find a criminal-defense practice just as challenging as
prosecution work, even uplifting. Others find the transition to
private practice a double-edged sword: they are their own bosses,
but they have to pay their own bills.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, it is common for young law school graduates or
relative novices to seek experience by staffing the state
prosecution offices in the five boroughs and the federal
prosecution offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, then move on or
return to private practice. The typical stint in the five district
attorney's offices and the two United States attorney's offices is
five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wait longer to depart, lawyers and prosecutors said,
are more likely to have developed strong views about the cases or
clients they are willing to accept in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who's been a prosecutor for 15, 20 years may find it
difficult to defend people'' who have been charged with any kind of
crime, said Austin V. Campriello, a criminal-defense lawyer who is
chairman of the City Bar Association's criminal courts committee.
``It may be mentally hard to make that change.''
</P>
<P>
   Campriello was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan for
nine years, until 1980. Since then, he has represented an array of
criminal defendants, including one of the four men who were
convicted in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, which killed
six people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also abundant skepticism among lawyers that any
significant number in their ranks refuse cases or clients by
category, even among those who had been longtime prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard of people who turn away cases because they
had scruples after having done mob work, drug work, etc.,'' as
prosecutors, said Roger B. Adler, whose 25 years in private
practice followed five years in the Brooklyn district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Adler, a former chairman of the Brooklyn Bar Association's
federal courts committee, also said that competition for cases can
often define a lawyer's scruples. ``In the New York litigation
market, I think there is an undersupply of cases and an oversupply
of lawyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one longtime federal prosecutor, Matthew E.
Fishbein, said that when he went into private practice three years
ago, he wrestled with whether to take certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had left prosecution _ after 12 years in the United
States attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Manhattan _ partly
because he felt ``ready to do something different.'' But he was not
certain whether ``something different'' should include representing
criminal defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every firm I talked to, I made it very clear that I might
not want to do any criminal work,'' said Fishbein, who had risen
from prosecutor to chief assistant United States attorney, the No.
2 post, in Brooklyn, and also held that position in Manhattan. ``I
wasn't sure how I'd feel switching sides.''
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Manhattan firm of Howard, Darby &AMP; Levin,
Fishbein said, he was immediately asked to take over the case of a
man charged with money laundering. When he found the man to be
basically ``a good and decent'' person, he said, ``I realized that
not only could I do the work, but it was something I would like
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The man pleaded guilty, but that did not change Fishbein's
opinion of him. His case was ``the easiest transition I could have
ever imagined,'' said Fishbein, 46. Now with the New York office of
Covington &AMP; Burling, the Washington firm with which Howard, Darby &AMP;
Levin merged, Fishbein largely represents clients charged with
white-collar crimes like securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a prosecutor, I never saw the world in black and white,''
he said. ``A person may have committed a crime and has to pay the
consequences, but that's not necessarily the only thing that
defines a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon spoke of a similar approach. In his 11 years as a federal
prosecutor _ in Washington, on Long Island and in Brooklyn _ he
pursued defendants charged with drug trafficking. Now, in his
Manhattan solo practice, he handles a combination of criminal
defense and civil litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more likely to take a case involving young people, even if
it's a serious crime, because immaturity and lack of judgment lead
them to get involved with people they should not, as opposed to
older people who have made a career of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the different perspective he had gained in his
defense work, and how it enabled him to ``care very much'' about
some of those young clients. ``You find they have a capacity to
lead a productive life,'' he said, but instead they face the
possibility of many years in prison _ a prospect Simon finds
starker now than when he was working to send people there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never in a federal prison while I was a prosecutor, but
now I'm sometimes there several times a week,'' he said of his
visits to clients. ``It's a big awakening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Simon, Fishbein spoke of the rewards of working in the
public interest. Frank, now with the Manhattan office of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, recalled his prosecution work as
meaningful, especially the homicide cases. ``It doesn't get any
more serious than taking someone's life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after 16 years in the Brooklyn district attorney's office,
where he had risen to executive assistant district attorney, ``I
had done everything, and a lot more than I expected, and it was
time to do something new.'' The financial needs of a family with
young children provided added incentives, said Frank, who was
earning $112,500 a year when he left a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said building a practice has been challenging. ``You have
a lot of pressure to pay the bills, to build a practice,'' he said.
He added that after expenses, like rent on his Midtown Manhattan
office, ``my standard of living hasn't changed'' from that of his
later years as a prosecutor, when he earned about $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Simon said, his automatic pilot forgets that he has
changed sides. Several times since the switch _ when putting his
name on the record at the start of a court proceeding _ he has
announced, ``Brad Simon for the government,'' prompting chuckles
from the judge and prosecutors and startled looks from his clients.
``Over 11 years, I must have said it thousands of times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he has no confusion about his old and new roles. At
Skadden, Arps, he said, ``I'm not going out to a crime scene at 4
in the morning and seeing a body riddled with bullets and people
crying.''

TREES ARE DOOMED AS BEETLE STRIKES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asian longhorned beetles, which have destroyed nearly
3,000 trees in New York City since their first appearance in the
Greenpoint section of Brooklyn four years ago, have invaded the
trees that line Luther Gulick Playground near the Williamsburg
Bridge, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The infected trees _ at least six of the park's 34 Norway maples
_ will be removed beginning Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beetles pose an enormous long-term danger to the city's
forests and to trees all along the Northeast,'' Stern said. ``All
of humanity is together in fighting this. This is biological
warfare and we are on the side of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   If more trees are affected by the 2-inch-long, black-spotted
insects, he said, they too will be cut down; it is the only remedy
for a longhorned beetle infestation.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks Department learned of the infestation when inspectors
found pencil-sized holes made by the burrowing beetles in the
tree's trunks, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The insects make such holes to bury their eggs. The larvae hatch
in the spring and tunnel into the trees, feeding on the wood and
destroying the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Because the beetles have no natural predators in the United
States, the only way to stop the spread of the insect is to chop
down infected trees, then chip and burn them to destroy both the
beetle and its eggs, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Parks Department announced a major effort to fight
the longhorned beetle, with more than $10 million _ more than ever
before _ in city, state and federal money budgeted to inspect
trees, cut down those that show evidence of an infestation and
replace them with seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than cancer,'' Stern said of the beetle invasion.
``You can't just cut out the infected areas, you have to kill the
entire tree to get rid of them. You have to sacrifice the tree to
save the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks Department suspects that the beetle, responsible for
the destruction of a huge expanse of forest in China, hitched a
ride to the United States on imported crates, landing at the docks
in Greenpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Parks and Recreation first detected the
beetles in Greenpoint in 1996. Last August the insects invaded
Ruppert Playground, a park in Manhattan's Upper East Side, and 28
trees had to be destroyed.

FOR SEC, QUESTION IS WHAT LAZIO KNEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in deciding to
investigate whether Rep. Rick Lazio violated insider trading laws,
acted on the basis of information that suggested _ but hardly
proved _ that he might have known about a pending takeover that had
not been disclosed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information that prompted the investigation was on
the public record for two years before the SEC acted, but it was
evidently not put together by anyone until Lazio, a Republican,
began running for the U.S. Senate from New York. Aides to Lazio
said last week that he had received a request for information from
the SEC staff early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The details, in brief, are that when Lazio made what seems to
have been his first purchase of stock options ever _ securities
that essentially represent a bet that a stock will rise
significantly in a short period of time _ the company he bought the
options on was actively, but confidentially, looking for another
company to buy it out.
</P>
<P>
   To SEC investigators, that in itself would arouse suspicion. A
first-time options buyer who gets lucky enough to profit from a
takeover typically draws questions from the SEC on whether the
trader might have had a relationship with an insider privy to
confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a relationship did exist. Top executives of the
company, the Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage firm, were major contributors
to Lazio's campaigns. Some of them were also executives of the
Securities Industry Association, which actively lobbies the House
Subcommittee on Finance, on which Lazio serves, because it has
jurisdiction over many issues directly affecting the brokerage
business.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say that combination _ unusual trading
considering an investor's history and a connection to people with
inside information about an unannounced takeover _ would prompt an
investigation by the SEC in virtually any case of which it became
aware.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatively meager profits earned by Lazio _ $21,509
altogether, including his investments in other Quick &AMP; Reilly
securities _ meant that his trading was unlikely to have been
noticed by the SEC in its normal market monitoring, which relies
heavily on the stock and options exchanges for leads.
</P>
<P>
   The Quick &AMP; Reilly transaction, moreover, seems not to have
generated a large amount of suspicious trading in advance, making
it unlikely that either the Chicago Board Options Exchange or the
New York Stock Exchange, the primary markets for Quick &AMP; Reilly
options and shares, respectively, would have referred any
suspicious trading to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio disclosed most, but not all, of his trades in Quick &AMP;
Reilly securities in a filing with Congress in the spring of 1998.
Disclosure of the additional trades, which was made after reporters
for The New York Times concluded that the original trading records
could not have been complete, did not appear to raise any new
questions about Lazio's trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and officials of Quick &AMP; Reilly vigorously deny that he
was given any inside information. If the SEC finds no evidence that
he was, the inquiry will be dropped. That is what happens in many
such investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the SEC staff has more investigative options than simply
asking Lazio and the Quick &AMP; Reilly people if he received inside
information. If the commissioners authorize subpoenas, the staff
can search phone records or interview anyone who might have made
other similarly timed investments in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's first trade in Quick &AMP; Reilly securities came on Feb.
11, 1997, when he bought 300 shares for $11,665. Simultaneously, in
a trade he did not disclose on his congressional report but did
disclose this month, he sold options that gave the buyer the right
to buy those shares for a price slightly above what Lazio paid.
</P>
<P>
   Together, those transactions represented a very conservative
strategy that meant that if the stock did rise Lazio would earn a
small profit. If it fell, however, the $392 he got for selling the
options would cushion the loss.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the stock price rose only briefly, after Quick &AMP;
Reilly announced the stock split, and then declined. The options
expired without being exercised, and Lazio was left with 450 shares
of stock after the split took effect.
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, he bought another 50 shares of stock, paying $1,217.
That left his average cost per share for the 500 shares he then
owned at about $25. Including the commission he would have to pay,
he would have to get a price of about $25.50 per share to break
even. But the stock never got that high until July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Friday, Aug. 1, with the stock price rising on
above-normal volume, and activity in the options markets up as
well, Lazio could have sold his stake and made a small profit.
Instead, he bought options that allowed him to buy 1,200 more
shares, at a price of $30, any time until Oct. 17. On the following
Monday, he bought options on 600 more shares in a trade that was
not disclosed on his congressional filing.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, word leaked to Bloomberg News that the company had
hired investment bankers to seek buyers, and the stock price
soared. Lazio waited a few weeks to cash in his options, and sold
his shares the following January, shortly before Fleet Financial
completed its acquisition of Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a profit of $13,643, or nearly 600 percent, on the
August options purchases, and a profit of $7,866 on his other
trades in Quick &AMP; Reilly securities. Overall, his profit came to
142 percent of the $15,183 he invested.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he bought the options as a takeover speculation,
on the advice of someone he has declined to name. A review of
databases found no report in any newspaper or investment wire about
such speculation before he bought the options on Aug. 1, although
Dow Jones News Service carried a report a few hours after he made
his options investment.
</P>
<P>
   But rising volume in options did indicate that speculation was
growing by the time he made his investment.
</P>
<P>
   Buying options on the basis of a rumor is legal, unless the
buyer has learned from an insider that the rumor is true. But
insider trading cases have been prosecuted when people with
confidential information about a coming takeover simply advised
others that it was not a good time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   For the SEC, an independent agency that normally conducts its
investigation with little public attention until it files charges,
the Lazio case is already proving to be a difficult one. Although
the investigation had begun before the agency received a request
for an inquiry from H. Carl McCall, the New York state comptroller,
McCall's letter helped to create a political tone.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, an ally of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Lazio's Senate
opponent, sent the request on his own campaign stationery. Lazio
was quick to denounce the SEC inquiry as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the SEC is under considerable pressure to complete
its inquiry before the November election.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Laura Moore was growing up, she dreamed of being an Olympic
figure skater. While living in East Africa, she read a book about a
poor, sickly child befriended by a star skater. The sickly girl
became the star.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was different. Shy and klutzy, incapable of catching
a ball, Moore failed gym 12 times. During kickball games she
switched teams every half-inning so she would not have to play, and
nobody complained because they didn't want her playing, either. She
graduated from high school with a special dispensation because she
did not have a single gym credit.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a surprise when she later found herself through
sports, specifically in competitions among gay athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Moore realized she was gay at an early age, but by the time she
was 30 she found herself married and living in the suburbs,
desperately ill with a stress-related disease and hating everything
about her life. So, 12 years ago, she left her husband, moved to
New York City and signed up for an ice skating class.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 Gay Games in New York, she initiated a figure
skating meet _ overcoming skepticism from organizers that the event
would not flourish during the summer games _ and became part of the
first lesbian pairs team to compete. She and her partner won the
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty exciting, to say the least,'' said Moore, who is
now 44. ``I finally felt like, OK, this is the life that I was
supposed to have. I know I'm never going to do a triple jump. I'm
never going to be in the Olympics. But I have done more with
skating and skating has done more for me than I could ever have
imagined. I totally feel for the first time in my life that I am
part of a community. I belong to a global gay sports community.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is now the vice president of Team New York, an
organization that was reinvented in late 1997 to foster sports and
cultural events for gays and lesbians. Saturday, Team New York
sponsored three events as part of the second annual Team New York
Sports and Cultural Festival during Gay Pride Week: a two-mile
community challenge run in Central Park, the NYSwimillennium2000, a
14-event swim meet at Lehman College in the Bronx, and the Metro
Gay Wrestling Alliance Tournament and Open Mat Clinic at the
McBurney YMCA Annex in Manhattan. The run was expected to draw
about 1,000 people, the swim meet up to 200 entrants from four
countries. Team New York has existed since the first Gay Games in
San Francisco in 1982 and has sent athletes to all four quadrennial
games since. But the group disbanded after each Games and hurriedly
reorganized just before the next one. In 1997, an officer for the
1998 Gay Games in Amsterdam phoned Ruth Gursky _ an active
volunteer since the 1990 Vancouver Games _ and asked her to set up
a meeting to generate interest in New York. Gursky called everyone
she knew, took out two ads in community newspapers, reserved a room
and hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and fifty people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed all of us that there was a need to have an
organization, it was just a question of who was going to do it,''
said Gursky. ``I realized it was going to be me or nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   She recruited a treasurer and a co-president and started having
meetings. Team New York is now associated with groups that
participate in 20 sports, including square dancing, table tennis,
softball, volleyball and swimming.

<P>
   ``Many gay and lesbian people feel funny, feel awkward, feel
they're not being accepted on a regular team,'' said Gursky, who
also swims on a masters team. ``I think we can really make a
difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Participation in gay and lesbian sports has increased steadily,
both in New York and worldwide. The 1982 San Francisco Gay Games
had 1,350 athletes and a budget of $125,000, while the '94 New York
Games had 11,000 athletes and a $6.5 million budget. Both numbers
are expected to be much higher for the 2002 Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Blane Roberts, a former vice president of Front Runners, a gay
and lesbian running group, said the New York chapter had 431
members in 1996. Now there are 460. Directly after the Amsterdam
Games in '98, an average of five wrestlers showed up weekly at the
Metro Gay Wrestling Alliance; now the number has nearly tripled.
Last year, the open house for the International Gay Figure Skating
Union, co-founded by Moore, drew six people. This year there were
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've observed that a lot of gay and lesbian men or women were
either intimidated by athletics, didn't feel that they could
compete, were uncomfortable with the situation,'' said Mike
Colgrove, the vice president and coach of the Metro Gay Wrestling
Alliance. ``We get a lot of people who are interested but are
afraid to try it, not because of their ability but because of how
they might be perceived. I think this gives a lot of gay men and
lesbian women an opportunity to try things they might have been
afraid of before.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the increasing visibility of the Gay Games made
competing in sports a welcome alternative to a social scene that
consisted mainly of bars and clubs. ``I knew very few gay people
and I was going to the bars,'' said Barbara Gurtov, 55, who bowls
in a gay and lesbian league at Chelsea Piers. ``And I got sick of
the bars because I'm not a bar person and in those days they didn't
have many functions and now they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although friendship and support are the key components to many
of the gay and lesbian clubs, competition is also important, many
of the club leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total comfort level,'' Stephen DeRose, treasurer of
Team New York and a two-time Gay Games gold medalist for
bodybuilding, said of gay competitions. ``You could be who you
wanted to be. Jump up and down and scream. Clap and not have to
worry, `He's going to think I'm gay.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is still astonished by her metamorphosis from unhappy,
uncoordinated homemaker to medal-winning figure skater immersed in
a loving and accepting community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me when I was a child that I would become a
competitive athlete and I was going to have a drawer full of medals
and I was going to do something that people the world over are
going to be interested in because no one's ever done it before, I
would have laughed in their faces,'' she said. ``There are now so
many opportunities to meet people and participate in activities
that are healthy and fun. I really believe that the gay sports
movement has changed a lot of people's lives.''

REAL ESTATE: OCEAN-FRONT HOUSING BENEFITS FROM BEACH RESTORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HAMPTON DUNES, N.Y. _ The 2.25-mile stretch of Dune Road
that runs the length of this village on a barrier beach facing the
Atlantic in southeastern Suffolk County has the air of a gold-rush
town.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of houses are either being built or rebuilt. The village
is rapidly regaining the 190 houses that were once lost or made
uninhabitable by three decades of severe beach erosion. A $17
million publicly financed beach rebuilding project, completed in
1997, stabilized and expanded the beach and restored its dunes,
leading to the current building boom.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Vegliante, the mayor of West Hampton Dunes, said that in
the last 12 months, 25 houses have been completed and 40 are under
construction. He said he expects another 35 houses to be finished
in the next year. Since the village began rebuilding in 1996, 200
certificates of occupancy, including those for new houses on
formerly vacant lots, have been issued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The beach restoration has worked so well that a sand
replenishment project, originally scheduled for last year, has been
postponed until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other public officials are much less enthusiastic about the
project, but whatever the view, it's generally agreed that the
beach restoration has had an unexpected but positive side effect.
The piping plover, an endangered migratory bird that had all but
vanished from the area, has flourished since the beach was rebuilt.
Thirty-three breeding pairs and 72 fledglings were counted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this to be a blueprint for successful coastal
management because what we have clearly proven is that what used to
be competing interests can come together and have a vested interest
that's common to everyone's needs and goals,'' said Vegliante, who
helped establish the 1.5-square-mile village in 1993. The
population is now about 550.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public access to the beaches can cohabitate with private
property rights,'' the mayor said. ``And something that no one
believed could be done, the creation and enhancement of
environmental habitat, is resulting in a piping plover population
that is greater than that of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode
Island combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Sand erosion along this strip of barrier beach, which lies
between the Atlantic and Moriches Bay just east of Cupsogue Beach
County Park, began occurring after 1964 when the Army Corps of
Engineers constructed 15 groins, also known as jetties, east of
what is now the village's eastern boundary. The groins trapped
sand, keeping it from replenishing the western end of the beach.
Soon homeowners there were seeing houses undermined by water, and
storms swept many of them away.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, all but 18 of the 160 ocean-front houses were lost, and
most of the village's total of 250 houses had been destroyed or
severely damaged. Dune Road, covered with sand, was impassable; the
county park was closed.
</P>
<P>
   A December 1992 storm made an opening between the Atlantic and
Moriches Bay just west of the last groin, creating an island. The
gap quickly widened to 3,000 feet, threatening the ecology of the
brackish Moriches Bay, covering 5,000 acres, by allowing in greater
amounts of salt water. Had the remaining barrier beach west of the
breach been eaten away, the heavily populated areas north of the
bay would have become much more vulnerable to flooding from storms.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $8.8 million to close the breach, a project federal,
state and local officials undertook late in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a lawsuit by owners who had lost their houses to
reach a settlement that led to the beach restoration project. The
first lawsuit, against Suffolk County, was filed in 1984 by
property owners who had formed the Barrier Beach Preservation
Association. The suit was later expanded to include the federal and
state governments. The homeowners contended that the erosion
project begun in 1964 _ and financed by all three governments _
caused the loss of their homes. Represented by John J. O'Connell, a
Manhattan lawyer, the owners sought $200 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 settlement, the three defendants agreed to restore the
beach and dunes and to maintain them for 30 years by replenishing
any sand that might be lost to erosion. To allow public access to
the ocean and bay while protecting the dunes, 11 wooden walkways
were to be built, and so far, nine have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is paying 70 percent of the restoration
costs, New York state is paying 21 percent and Suffolk County is
paying 9 percent. The total cost is estimated at $50 million _
about two-thirds the original estimate _ by the time the project
ends in 2027.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David and Carol Zolondek have reconstructed their ocean-front
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built our house in 1980, it was washed away in 1993, and we
rebuilt in 1998,'' said Zolondek, who owns a textile export company
in Manhattan. ``When you watch the beach deteriorating, and houses
wash away, and your neighbors suffering, it's not pleasant because
it was such a nice community that we had,'' he said. ``And now to
see people rebuilding their houses and putting money into them, and
families with children coming back, it's a renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the lawsuit settlement agreement, owners had to make some
concessions. For lots on the south side of Dune Road, the owners
had to agree to transfer to Suffolk County everything on the ocean
side of the new dunes . The dunes, although owned by the
individuals whose property they are on, were designated a
conservation area, and they can be crossed only by wooden walkways
that individual homeowners must build.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of ocean-front lots have only 50 feet, measured northward
from the dunes, within which to construct a house, because they
must allow for a 25-foot setback from Dune Road. In addition, all
houses must stand on stilts that are a minimum of 12 feet high.
Under the village building code the house itself cannot be higher
than 32 feet above the platform's lowest beam.
</P>
<P>
   Building is prohibited in parts of the bay side of Dune Road
between April 1 and Sept. 1, the nesting season of the piping
plover. Construction has to stop anywhere in the village if a nest
is discovered near the building site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, land prices have soared in the last
three years, and West Hampton Dunes, once characterized by modest
beach houses. A 60-foot wide ocean-front lot sold for $70,000 five
years ago, said Christopher Foglio, a sales agent with the Coldwell
Banker brokerage company in Westhampton. Now the same size lot is
selling for $400,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legacy Development USA of Hauppauge, which has 21 houses either
completed or under construction, has sold all but four. Prices for
the unsold houses, two on the ocean, are $880,000 to $1.35 million.
Citi Habitats in Manhattan is the sales agent.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Heiberger, the president of Legacy, said that ocean-front
houses like the 2,900-square-foot traditional house, with five
bedrooms, four and a half baths and a guest suite, that he sold a
year ago for $883,000 are now fetching $1.3 million. The reason, he
said, is that people are gaining confidence that the beach is no
longer endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Heiberger said he became aware of building opportunities in West
Hampton Dunes after his son Andrew, who is president of Citi
Habitats, saw an ocean-front lot advertised for $175,000 at the end
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here to take a look,'' Ed Heiberger said, ``and
said: `This is just beautiful. What's happening here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Legacy builds a mix of Victorian, Mediterranean and what it
calls Plantation and Island Beach houses. The $1.1 million
Mediterranean style house under construction on the ocean is fairly
typical: it has a pool, and three of the four bedrooms and a den
are on the first floor. The living areas and master bedroom are on
the second floor, which offers the best views.
</P>
<P>
   Another large builder active in the area is Island Estates of
Ronkonkoma. It has two houses under construction. A five-bedroom
ocean-front house on a 75-foot-wide lot with a pool is priced at
$1.250 million. The other on Moriches Bay on a 60-by-600-foot lot,
also with five bedrooms and a pool, is priced at $999,000. The
company has yet to build on 12 other lots it owns along Dune Road,
said Rudy Princi, one of the principals.
</P>
<P>
   While some public officials call West Hampton Dunes a success
story, others contend that the restoration was a waste of taxpayer
dollars and that a better settlement of the lawsuit could have been
reached. They say that public money should not have been used to
stabilize the beach so that private owners of ocean- front lots
could build, allowing erosion problems to start once again. These
critics contend that the lots should have been bought up and made
part of the public beach.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now being debated anew as a similar beach
restoration project is being considered farther west, along the
32-mile length of Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a supporter of the notion of a new dune and pumping sand
onto the beach and trying to stabilize the flow of sediment from
east to west, but not to build houses on it,'' said Stephen Jones,
Suffolk County's planning director. ``I feel terrible about what is
happening at West Hampton Dunes. To stabilize the shoreline and
then build houses on the beach is a real perversion of public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say it is only fair that if houses were lost because
of government action, then homeowners should be allowed to keep
their property and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Ekstein, the executive director of Save Our Seashore, a
nonprofit group formed in 1992 to lobby for the preservation and
protection of coastal resources from Montauk to Coney Island,
pointed out that protecting the coastline safeguards the property,
businesses and well-being of the people living on the South Shore.
Millions benefit from the recreation that beaches provide, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about creating building lots,'' she said. ``This
is about developing the common goal of saving a fabulous resource
and understanding that to do so, everyone must work together.''

TV SHOW HIGHLIGHTS LATEST NEW YORK POP TRENDS FOR TOKYO
TEEN-AGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Japanese television cameras rolled, the
break-dancers and rap artists, the rave kids and a drag queen in a
glittering pink dress swaggered off a humid street in the Flatiron
district and into the wall-thumping interior of the Cheetah Club.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the amateur performers came to battle it out for a $500
cash prize. Others just wanted their faces beamed straight into the
pulsing neon heart of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the party tied up here tonight!'' yelled the host,
Voodoo Ray, his right hand twirling a microphone, his hair neatly
braided into cornrows. ``How's everybody doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd screamed. The floor quaked. And the taping of another
episode of ``Soulook: Seize the Night'' was under way.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly half-hour series appearing on Japanese late-night
television tries to give its viewers the straight-up dope about New
York night life and black pop culture. Or, as one audience member
summed it up: ``Ed Sullivan in a discotheque.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Television began broadcasting the show in April. Its first
episode drew about 180,000 viewers in Japan, mostly teen-agers.
Since then it has grown in popularity, with about 300,000 people
tuning in in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And starting June 28, it can be seen in New York City on
Manhattan Neighborhood Network, a Time Warner cable-access station,
channel 56, every Wednesday from 11 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just as shows like ``Iron Chef'' have attracted a devoted
following in the United States by revealing an offbeat side of
Japanese culture, ``Soulook'' hopes to draw young viewers in Japan
by offering up a slice of the New York underground. For years,
music variety shows have been big in Japan. But until now, none
have taped regularly in New York, considered the trendiest city by
many Japanese club kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show that anything goes and everything happens in
New York City night life,'' said Mitsuo Watanabe, 51, the executive
producer of ``Soulook.'' ``Everyone has a good time here!''
</P>
<P>
   That image of New York resonates with many Japanese youth, said
Mark Schilling, who wrote ``The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop
Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a big topic in Japan,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his home in Tokyo. ``It's where a lot of Japanese
pick up information about American trends.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Soulook,'' attitude rules. If you don't have it, the
producers say, don't even bother coming to the auditions, which are
sometimes advertised in The Village Voice and Backstage. Those who
have made it onto the show include a lawyer who pranced around the
stage unrolling toilet paper as classical music played in the
background, and a drag queen named Hedda Lettuce who belted out a
version of Aretha Franklin's ``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sad collection of talent,'' said Lynda Mota, an
audience member who winced while watching a recent taping. ``I just
can't believe that in New York City, this is the best they can
muster up.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, say the producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if they are good in terms of music skills,
but if they have the character, a strong character that will play
well on TV, we are interested in them,'' said Watanabe, as he
pensively stroked his gray mustache. ``Compared to Japan, there are
so many people in America who believe they have a talent, who
believe they have something special to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In his pitch letter for ``Soulook,'' Watanabe tried to explain
to network executives the appeal of such artists: ``The people of
the new generation, who will build our future, have been waiting
for these heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe knows something about showmanship. For 22 years, he
helped produce a weekly music variety series in Japan called ``Yoru
No Hit Studio.'' At its peak in 1975, about 4 million people
watched each episode. Japan's most popular singers appeared on it,
as well as American superstars like Frank Sinatra and Madonna.
After the show ended, Watanabe said he felt he no longer had a
purpose in Japan. Music was his life. But the show had run its
course, and a lot of Japanese pop music was behind the times,
struggling to imitate American genres like R &AMP; B and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   So, he thought, why not go where the trends were starting?
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe said he liked to think that he still had his finger on
the pulse of the fad-conscious generation. He saw more and more
youths in the glittery Shibuya district of Tokyo walking around
with baggy jeans and Kangol caps. He knew about the teen-age girls
called ganguros _ black face _ who dyed their hair platinum blonde
and went to tanning salons. Some even made pilgrimages to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a segment of the youth culture in Japan
that has been wrapped up in American black culture,'' Schilling
said. ``But now you see the look everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several Japanese pop idols who have adopted
elements of black musical styles have hit it big. Teen-agers
swooned over girls like Namie Amuro and the R &AMP; B-inspired Hikaru
Utada, whose first album sold more than 7 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Soulook,'' Watanabe is unabashedly trying to capitalize
on that trend. In the title sequence, an animated black graffiti
artist spray-paints the show's logo onto the screen. Another
animated character, a black disc jockey, mixes records on a
turntable. ``Smashin' and kickin' on a Tuesday night,'' the opening
rap goes, taken from a Beastie Boys song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soulook'' taped its first nine episodes at El Flamingo, a
Chelsea nightclub, but recently switched to Cheetah, a regular
hang-out for hip-hop royalty like Lauryn Hill and Puffy Combs.
Besides the stage competition, each episode also features three
1-minute segments that introduce the viewer to other popular
dancehalls, street fashion and favorite records of DJ's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe chose two young black hosts: Voodoo Ray, who also tours
as a stage dancer for acts like Mariah Carey and the Backstreet
Boys, and Alexis Brown, a student at Hofstra University. On each
show, the two join three other wise-cracking hipster judges to
decide the night's winner. Future shows will also feature Toshi
Kubota, a Japanese R &AMP; B singer who has short dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met enough Japanese cats that like hip-hop and follow the
hottest break-dancers,'' Voodoo Ray said. ``They'll know the top 10
and the hottest videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the show's acts have roots firmly planted in street
culture. Take the break-dancers called the Just Begun Crew. At
Cheetah, the four boys in baggy orange shirts spun their stuff for
the crowd, even though one of them fell off the stage in the middle
of the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could take dance lessons from those guys seven days a week,
24 hours a day,'' said one of the guest judges, a blonde woman in a
tight black dress, as she reclined on a cheetah-print couch, adding
``naked dance lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the audience watched the performers with,
perhaps, a touch of envy. Tony Lopez, who was grooving on the dance
floor, said his band, which played music ``kinda like Lou Reed, you
know, alternative,'' said he thought he might have a shot at
getting on the show one day. His date, Camilla Tee, dancing with a
cigarette between her lips, also said she thought that her
four-person band would go over well with a Japanese audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what else I like about this show?'' she said,
pointing to the bar. ``It's great that everything's free. This is
an expensive city.''
</P>
<P>
   The taping certainly was easy on the pocketbook. Just ask the
five members of Zero Tolerance, a Latin rap group. They walked away
with one of the night's $500 prizes. Sure, their moment in the
spotlight would be seen mostly by teen-agers who knew more about
growing up in Tokyo shopping malls than on the streets of Brooklyn.
But any stage was better than none, and an award was an award.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's, like, no way to explain,'' said Norma Justiniano, one
of the teen-age rappers. ``It's, like, something that somebody
always wanted, and I got it.''

ISLES DRAFT A GOALIE AND MAKE 2 BIG TRADES
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Hoping to reverse a long slide into
irrelevance and buoyed by the financial promises of new ownership,
the New York Islanders moved aggressively, dramatically and with
high risk Saturday at the NHL entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   They made two major trades, losing two goalies, including the
highly touted Roberto Luongo. They acquired two young players from
Florida, both of them forwards. And they drafted two of the first
five players, including the first overall.
</P>
<P>
   That opening pick was historic: Rick DiPietro, a Maine native
from Boston University, became the first goalie ever chosen first
overall. Mike Milbury, the Islanders' general manager, strongly
suggested that the 18-year-old DiPietro, with one year of college
experience, will be the first-string goalie next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As dangerous as this might be, maybe Mad Mike has something
going for him,'' Milbury said of his dealings. ``We have not made
the playoffs in far too long. We need to get there. It's a roll of
the dice a little bit.'' The Islanders last reached the playoffs in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury compared DiPietro to Tom Barrasso, who had a record of
26-12-3 for the Buffalo Sabres as an 18-year-old rookie in 1983-84.
DiPietro seemed willing to accept the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved the day is over and we made a little
history,'' DiPietro said. ``I was pleasantly surprised to hear my
name called. I'm just happy it was me, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he step into a major role in the NHL? ``I don't know,''
DiPietro said. ``I have never been to an NHL training camp. I feel
pretty confident. It's obviously very mind boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Islanders' decision to trade Luongo and draft
him, DiPietro said: ``Obviously, there's going to be a lot of
pressure. Roberto Luongo will probably end up being a franchise
goaltender with Florida. I enjoy the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   With their second choice, fifth overall in the first round due
to a trade with Tampa, the Islanders selected Raffi Torres, a
stocky left wing from Canada who scored 43 goals with Brampton last
season in the Ontario junior league. Torres is the son of a father
born in Mexico and a mother born in Peru. He started playing hockey
on roller skates in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez of the Devils won rookie of the year honors last
season as the league's first Hispanic star, and Torres was asked
about comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gomez was a highlight player in his first year,'' Torres said.
``I'd like to follow in his footsteps. I'm so excited. It's crazy.
It's crazy! I can't even talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury said he was not sure if Torres, 18, is ready for the
NHL, because there are questions about his skating. It will be
determined by how hard he works this summer, before training camp,
Milbury said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In trades, the Islanders sent Luongo, their top goalie prospect
until Saturday, to Florida along with center Olli Jokinen for
center Oleg Kvasha and right wing Mark Parrish. In order to choose
Torres with the fifth pick, originally a Tampa choice, they sent
goalie Kevin Weekes and Kristian Kudroc, a defensive prospect, to
the Lightning along with the second-round pick in the 2001 entry
draft. As part of the deal, the Islanders obtained Tampa's
fourth-round pick in the current draft, which will conclude Sunday,
and a seventh-round pick that was originally traded to Tampa in
March.
</P>

   DiPietro went 17-3-5 last season with a goals-against average of
2.44. He is 5 feet 11 inches, 185 pounds, and made the tournament
All-Star team when he played for the United States in the World
Junior tournament. He set a NCAA record with 77 saves in one game,
a 3-2 defeat in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NHL's Central Scouting service, DiPietro plays
with the style of Martin Brodeur, the veteran goalie of the Stanley
Cup champion Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handles the puck extremely well,'' the report said. ``Is very
good at setting up the puck for his defensemen. A very good skater,
with excellent agility and balance. Uses his stick well to deflect
pucks away from the net. Has a very quick glove hand and uses his
blocker to angle shots into the corner very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, with seven picks among the first 76, chose David
Hale with the 22nd pick in the first round. Hale is a 6-1,
204-pound defenseman who grew up in Colorado and plays junior
hockey with Sioux City, Iowa, of the United States Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Scouting report said of Hale: ``An intense,
punishing player who can intimidate opponents. Has an excellent
work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round was dominated by European prospects. The third
pick was Marian Gaborik, a left wing from Slovakia, chosen by the
expansion team in Minnesota. The fourth pick was Rostislav Klesla,
a defenseman from the Czech Republic who has been playing with
Brampton. Among other choices in the first round was Dany Heatley,
a Canadian forward from the University of Wisconsin, taken by
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kvasha, obtained by the Islanders in the Florida trade, scored
five goals and had 20 assists last season in 78 games. He is a
Moscow native who stands 6-5 and weighs 216 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, who also came from Florida, grew up in Minnesota and
like Kvasha has played two years with Florida. Parrish, 5-11 and
191 pounds, scored 26 goals and 18 assists in 81 games with the
Panthers.

INMATE INSTITUTIONS BUOY NEW YORK TOWN'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMULUS, N.Y. _ From his front porch, Ray Zajac can hear the
inmates' voices rising through the double set of glistening
razor-wire fences across Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The late afternoon chanting of men exercising in the drug
treatment center is money to his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is subsidizing us by producing these criminals,''
said Zajac, meaning New York City. ``It's not a nice thing to say,
but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy is about to soar. Once the state's Five Points
prison opens here in August, Romulus will be home to 3,200
free-ranging souls and 2,200 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The free-rangers aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a salvation to us,'' said Zajac, who has run this Finger
Lakes town as the elected supervisor for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Romulus is a village saved by prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The state psychiatric hospital on Main Street closed in 1995,
but reopened as the Department of Correctional Services' Willard
Drug Treatment Campus. The 11,000-acre Seneca Army Depot began the
process of closing down that same year, but the state funded the
$180-million prison now being completed on a secluded corner of the
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest construction project ever in the Finger
Lakes,'' said Michael Nozzolio, the area's state senator and
chairman of the Senate's corrections committee, who brought home
this juicy morsel of bacon. Beyond the projected 638 full-time jobs
and 191 spinoff jobs _ and their combined $28.5 million payroll _
the prison will also rescue Romulus from its own sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Waste water from about 200 homes near the prison site and
Romulus' only school ran through the Army's sewer system for
decades. With the Army leaving, the hamlet would need a new system,
which it could not afford. But the prison's water and sewer system
will serve the town, as well, and pay the local sewer district,
which will run it, an estimated $2 million a year, said the
district's administrator, the same Ray Zajac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big business, crime is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political, too. Sentiment is growing in New York state to
re-think drug laws that have helped push the prison population over
71,000, and last week the state's chief judge announced an effort
to send more addicts to treatment rather than jail. But the
Legislature ended its session Friday with no action on proposals to
ease the state's harshest drug statutes, the Rockefeller-era laws
that mandate minimum sentences of 15 years to life for possession
or sale of small amounts of drugs _ stiffer sentences than the
minimums for rape or manslaughter. Fear of appearing weak on crime
overcame political will.
</P>
<P>
   The inaction in Albany and the construction activity here, 160
miles west, demonstrate that there is just one safe political
course when it comes to sentencing wrongdoers: put the pedal to the
metal.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame Romulus.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some better-off folks with houses on serene Seneca
Lake, Romulus is a collection of three tattered hamlets that
largely lived off the state mental hospital and the cold war threat
of global conflict that kept the World War II Army depot alive
until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The world has changed, and now
Romulus will have a drug treatment center, a maximum security
prison and a nonprofit center for troubled youths that Gov. George
E. Pataki helped inaugurate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going from government to government,'' said Dennis
Aloia, the Seneca County manager. ``When you're a hungry area, like
this place is, you're willing to accept things other places
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisons are bonanzas in depressed areas, and Glenn Cooke, Seneca
County's industrial development director, calls Nozzolio ``our
rainmaker.'' The senator has six prisons in his district.
</P>
<P>
   In Romulus, Sandy Lynd, the postmaster, is expecting business to
skyrocket. Dianna LaPrade said the medical office where she works
as a nurse had hired an additional doctor, anticipating an influx
of prison employees. And she said the guard jobs, with good pay and
benefits, will give grown children a reason to stay in town. ``It's
a nice touch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the world changes again and there is a move to reduce the
nation's world-beating incarceration rate, it will cause economic
upheaval for places like Romulus. Not that anyone is expecting, as
Zajac said, ``all the criminals to find the Lord,'' or for all the
politicians to go soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's less likely that will happen,'' Zajac said,
``than the Berlin Wall coming down.''

an athlete. Conda who has all of the ``tools'' -- the leg speed,
strength and stamina -- of an Olympic champion, recently has been
bedeviled with ``crazy thoughts.'' ``I have to keep reminding
myself this is something I want,'' she says. (Steve Kagan/The New

   (NYT6) CHICAGO -- June 24, 2000 -- LIPSYTE-COLUMN-1 -- At the
world class level in professional sports, where all athletes are
gifted and strong, it is a competitor's will, not skill, that makes
the difference between winning and going home early. Khadijah
Conda, 26, has world-class talent in the 400-meter run and still
has a chance at next month's Olympic track-and-field trials, but
she has seemed more interested recently in off-the-track events
including an internship and a friend's wedding. (Steve Kagan/The

   (NYT5) NAIROBI, Kenya -- June 24, 2000 -- KENYA-CRISIS -- It is
indeed dark in Kenya these days, and not just because electricity
is in such short supply. Kenya, once among the most stable and
prosperous nations in Africa, is facing its worst-ever crisis. Even
before the drought hitting the region, the economy was strangling
from years of corruption and poor management. The phones and roads
are barely passable. Students are rioting. Tourists, afraid of
runaway crime, are staying away. Maggie Mukungu, a Nairobi
hairdresser, has been turning customers away, asking them to return
when the electricity is on. ``It's carelessness,'' she says of the
government. ``They don't know what they are doing.'' (Ian
Fisher/The New York Times)

   (NYT4) SEOUL, South Korea -- KOREAN-WAR-ANNIVERSARY-4 -- South
Korean protestors, including students and human rights activists,
hurl eggs at a picture of an ``Uncle Sam'' hat, during a
demonstration outside the U.S. Eighth Army base in Seoul. The
demonstration was against the resumption of bombing drills by the
U.S. Air Force at Koon-Ni. Local residents and civic groups have
demanded the range be moved. The protests came on the eve of 50th
anniversary ceremonies to mark the start of the Korean War. (Chang.

   (NYT3) INCHON, South Korea -- June 24, 2000 --
KOREAN-WAR-ANNIVERSARY-3 -- Fifty years after North Korea attacked
the South as Koreans slept, Korean War veterans from the United
States and elsewhere gathered at former battlegrounds this week to
remember. Sgt. Sean Melanphy of the United States Marine Color

   (NYT2) SEOUL, South Korea -- June 24, 2000 --
KOREAN-WAR-ANNIVERSARY-2 -- As North Korea has agreed to pursue
peace and reconciliation with the South after a half-century of
hostilities, the South Korean government has canceled all parades,
battle re-enactments and other commemorative war events that could
be offensive to the North. Kim Min Uk of the South Korean Navy
rested last week during a rehearsal for a ceremony at the Korean
War memorial in Seoul. The ceremony on Sunday is part of a
toned-down observance of the war's 50th anniversary. (Chang. W.
Lee/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT1) INCHON, South Korea -- June 24, 2000 --
KOREAN-WAR-ANNIVERSARY-1 -- The recent decision by the South Korean
government to tone down the 50th anniversary celebrations
commemorating the Korean War has not only brought angry
denouncements from veterans, but it has also touched off a heated
national debate over the significance of the Korean War and how far
the South should go to appease the North. The debate comes as
hundreds of veterans, diplomats and officials from around the world
have arrive in Seoul to participate in commemoration events. U.S.

2003. Today, however, there's mixed emotions about Honda. A

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Peninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Peninsula,
shifting, yet again, the geostrategic stakes for the United States.

   With KOREA-SIDE _ SEOUL, Korea _ When Christopher McCarthy, a
22-year-old American soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody
after he was accused of murdering a South Korean bar hostess for
refusing sex with him, it fed the belief among South Koreans that
Americans believe they're above the law. McCarthy was apprehended
eight hours later and was sentenced by a South Korean court this
month to eight years in prison. However, that incident was the
latest in a series of events, including the surprisingly successful
summit between
</P>
<P>
   North and South Korea, that has stoked calls for less
interference from the United States. Reunification of the two
Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as an issue that can be
resolved by Koreans only. (Chao, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more
than 1,500 Kosovar Albanians still held in Serb prisons without
being charged. Many of them were rounded up by Serb paramilitaries
during last spring's ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbs call them
prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along
and bear witness to one of these exchanges at the Kosovo-Serbia
border to tell the story of these families being reunited. (Coker,

   MEXICO-FOX _ MEXICO CITY _ With a flurry of new polls showing
two top candidates in a dead heat, Mexican presidential challenger
Vicente Fox holds a major campaign rally in downtown Mexico City
Saturday night. Fox is trying to unseat this country's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has controlled the
presidency for 71 years. Only one week is left before election day.
Never before has a Mexican presidential race here been as exciting
and close as this one. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). ETA: 10 p.m.

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The presidential election on July 2
has political observers and experts asking a rather unusual
question: What if the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI,
doesn't retain presidential power after 71 years? If opposition
candidate Vicente Fox is able to topple PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, what happens to seven-decades of social
infrastructure? Is there a worst-case scenario? Mexico's
government-controlled unions used to bring out massive numbers of
voters for the PRI. They've declined in strength as Mexico has
become less centralized and authoritarian, so can they still churn
out enough voters to help the PRI's candidate win? This population
is a critical part of the PRI political machine. (Ferriss, Cox News

Nothing but the wind whispering now around our clear plastic

Warren County farms and forests just a few miles east of Caesar
Creek Lake. Even for a shameless wuss like myself, who has a

   HOWARD-FINSTER _ SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev.
Howard Finster, the godfather of saving souls, the hardest working
man in the folk art business, had been seriously sick. So the
faithful flocked to Paradise Garden, his wild 3-acre folk version
of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.

CUTS IN COLLEGE PROGRAMS SEEN AS ENDANGERING FUTURE U.S. TEAM
GOALS

   DALLAS _ At the U.S. Olympic trials here last week, Jim Scherr,
USA Wrestling's executive director, made a bold prediction. He said
the men's Greco-Roman and freestyle teams would make frequent
appearances on the podium in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be the best Olympic team we've ever
fielded,'' Scherr said in Reunion Arena Thursday night. ``We could
get three to four medals in Greco-Roman and eight medals in
freestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Greco-Roman and freestyle teams each carried
10 weight classes instead of the eight now required under
international rules, U.S. Greco-Roman wrestlers won three silver
medals and freestyle wrestlers won three golds, a silver and a
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Scherr expressed his beliefs before the 16 wrestlers had even
qualified for the 2000 Olympic teams, a testament to the wealth of
candidates vying for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   But how long will his optimism carry? Wrestling is thriving at
both the international and grass-roots levels, and even receiving
energy from the success of girls' and women's wrestling. But the
crucial middle link is gradually corroding.
</P>
<P>
   College wrestling has become an endangered species in the last
28 years, with more than half the programs disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   There were 750 programs in 1972, the year that Title IX was
enacted; now there are barely 300 and falling at a steady rate as
universities cut nonrevenue wrestling programs to enforce equity
with women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous following for the sport, but we have an
artificial bottleneck at the collegiate level,'' Scherr said. ``As
far as USA Wrestling is concerned, dropping collegiate programs
could affect Olympic programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Scherr sees no immediate solution to persuading universities to
keep wrestling. Coincidentally, women's wrestling is beginning to
become popular, but even that may not be able to help the cause of
men's wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If colleges start women's wrestling, it would make it more
difficult to drop men's wrestling, but it's not enough to save NCAA
wrestling,'' said Mike Duroe, the women's national coach, referring
to programs at NCAA schools. ``The issue, in my opinion, is that
wrestling is being used as a scapegoat. It's easy to drop wrestling
where it's not popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But wrestling is popular on the high school level. In 1999,
boys' high school participants were at an all-time high, at
235,973, making it the sixth most popular sport for boys. In 1999,
2,361 girls participated in high school wrestling, and two states _
Texas and Hawaii _ officially sanctioned girls' wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Three varsity teams compete at NAIA schools _ Minnesota Morris,
Cumberland (Ky.) College and Missouri Valley College. The latter
two programs began last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be progressive thinking,'' Gary Abbott, USA
Wrestling's director of communications, said. ``Women's wrestling
is just as exciting, just as athletic, as men's.'' He proposes that
women's college programs should wrestle in the spring and compete
under the international rules of freestyle (men wrestle freestyle
in college), so that women can be better prepared for world
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, the women's senior national team
won the world championships. Tricia Saunders, 34, whose husband,
Townsend, won a silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996,
captured her fourth world championship last year as the United
States took the title from perennial power Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Women compete in six weight classes, ranging from 101.25 to
165.25 pounds. Although the world championships for women first
took place in 1990, the United States has fielded and funded a
national team for only three years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with USA Wrestling said they anticipated women's
wrestling to be on the program for the 2004 Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be paying a lot more attention to women's
wrestling in the next couple of years,'' Abbott predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Women's wrestling is not as accepted in this country as it is in
Japan, Canada and the Scandinavian countries. That could change
when women's wrestling will be included with men's wrestling next
year at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics serve as this year's wrestling world championships.
But in September 2001, Greco-Roman, freestyle and women's wrestling
will be on the same bill for the first time when the championships
come to New York City. Scherr is eager to show off the sport on
such a grand stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope because of the success we've had this will have a
larger impact at the Games in Athens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At these Olympic trials, Scherr admitted his concern for the
sport's growth on the collegiate level, but preferred to focus on
Sydney, hoping that the wrestlers' success there will enable the
sport to become rooted outside its loyal community.

ROMANIA'S CHAMPION TRACK STAR GABRIELA SZABO AIMS FOR RECORD BEFORE
OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ She stands only 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 93
pounds, with short blond hair and glasses, and modesty that causes
her to lower her eyes when she greets a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   She is Gabriela Szabo of Romania, and at first glance she does
not seem to be the world's greatest female middle-distance runner
or the first woman ever to win $1 million in prize money in one
season on the European track circuit. She might never have run at
all if a teacher had not encouraged her at age 13 to enter a school
race in Bistrita, a town in Transylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one runs in my family,'' Szabo said. ``My parents are fat.
My mother ran maybe 100 meters once and said, `OK, that's
enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo took the advice of her physical education teacher and
entered a cross-country race of 600 meters, the equivalent of one
and a half laps around a track. She won easily, and a coach from a
local sports club noticed that she was not even breathing hard at
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you come tomorrow,'' said the coach from the club.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance conversation that would take the unordered life
of a teen-ager and place it on a structured path to international
greatness. Three months later, Szabo finished second in a national
race of 600 meters for Romanian children. She later attended a
special high school for athletes, and with training, an efficient
shuffling stride and a blistering kick, she won a silver medal at
1,500 meters, the metric mile, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta. Last summer she won the world championship at 5,000
meters, or 3.1 miles, collected $1 million in prize money and was
named the international female track athlete of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Szabo had not lost a race since August 1998 as she entered the
1,500 meters Saturday at the Prefontaine Classic. At age 24, Szabo
is favored to win the 5,000 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, by which time she hopes to have broken the world
record of 14 minutes 28.09 seconds, held by Jiang Bo of China.
Szabo's best time is 14:31.48. She was favored to win the gold
medal in Atlanta, too, but she said she did not prepare correctly
for the heat and humidity, suffered from dehydration, and did not
even qualify for the final of the 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my fault,'' said Zsolt Gyongyossy, her coach.
</P>
<P>
   He is the same coach from the sports club who spotted Szabo as a
13-year-old and convinced her that she could be a runner. Szabo's
parents were split on the idea of an athletic career. Her father,
John, a carpenter of Hungarian ancestry, gave his consent, but her
mother, Livia, disapproved, wanting her daughter to concentrate on
her studies. Eventually, Szabo became rich and successful, with a
degree in physical education, and her coach became her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Comenici, the first Olympic gymnast ever to receive a
perfect score of 10, is still the most popular athlete in Romania,
Szabo insists. But Gaby, as she is known, is the most potent symbol
of current success and possibility in a country that continues to
struggle in its sluggish transition to a market economy a decade
after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu and his Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loves Nadia, but that was a long time ago,''
Gyongyossy said. ``The younger generation, they are looking at Gaby
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Szabo and Gyongyossy were married in Bucharest,
and as a measure of her popularity, the president of Romania, Emil
Constantinescu, attended. The prime minister sent roses, and the
reception was held in a villa that once belonged to Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian women have won three Olympic gold medal at the middle
distances: Doina Melinte at 800 meters in 1984, Maricica Puica at
3,000 meters in 1984 and Paula Ivan at 1,500 meters in 1988. But
the centralized system of identifying and developing athletes has
eroded since communism. There are more urgent uses for money than
sports. Where there were once 150 to 200 elite track and field
athletes in Romania, Szabo said, now there are six to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches have been unwilling or unable to succeed without
the safety net of the state, said Gyongyossy, who is 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old coaches, in middle age, they can't change,'' he said.
``They don't understand that a coach must also find sponsors and be
a marketing director.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo has invested in real estate in Romania, but she spends
most of her time out of the country, training at altitude in South
Africa during the winter, living on a farm and having little
contact with anyone other than her husband, her physical therapist
and her cook. In her spare times she reads the classics, Emile Zola
and Jane Austen. Her seclusion is purposeful, for she is fastidious
about training, running up to 120 miles a week, but also running 5
miles of speed work in succession, running sprints as short as 40
meters to 60 meters to polish her relentless kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has that sprinter's mentality, every time she wants to
win,'' Gyongyossy said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who runs fast in track draws suspicion of drug
use, and Romania has a history of positive tests for
performance-enhancing substances. Szabo insists she is clean and is
calling for blood testing at the Sydney Games. ``If the lab is
better, the sport will be cleaner,'' she said. ``It will be fair
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo has come far from that first school race, from an unknown
girl into an almost unbeatable woman. She runs now, she said, not
for money, but for permanence in the tidy ledgers of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win the Olympics, then I will have everything,'' she
said. ``I would have all the medals. What else could I ask for but
good health?''

TROUBLES BUILD AS COLOMBIANS AWAIT NEW AID FROM U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS first 2 grafs to tighten)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The United States is committing more than $1
billion to Colombia's struggle against drug production and
trafficking just as the government here is stumbling politically
and the national police chief who did most to win U.S. trust in his
country's efforts has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package, likely to total $1.3 billion after the
Senate approved it on Wednesday, foresees reduced reliance on the
115,000-member National Police and places greater emphasis on the
armed forces. But the retiring police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano, and his men would never have been called upon to lead the
counternarcotics fight in the past had Washington not harbored
grave doubts about the fighting ability and human rights record of
the Colombian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   And President Andres Pastrana, approaching the midpoint of his
four-year term, is under increasing fire here after losing key
aides, including his interior minister, chief of staff and chief
negotiator with the rebels who have taken over drug production and
made increasing inroads here. Public patience with the president's
failure to make a deal with leftist guerrillas who have been
battling the government for decades is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, 58, was praised by his supporters on Capitol Hill as
``the best cop in the world.'' He stepped down on Friday, having
announced earlier this month that he was retiring because ``I have
been to so many police officers' funerals that I can't bear
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 police officers have been killed since 1994 in this
country, which has a murder rate about 10 times higher than that of
the United States and, with more than 3,000 abductions in 1999, the
highest kidnapping rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are convinced that the drug war is being waged
at the expense of their own security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggravation of drug trafficking and the armed conflict
have translated into the police directing their priorities to the
defense of the state and its institutions,'' said Alvaro Camacho,
director of the Institute of Political Studies at the National
University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the police's ``role of supporting the
citizenry has been debilitated,'' and they ``have become an actor
in the war, separated from the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of such sentiments, Colombia's defense minister,
Luis Fernando Ramirez, applauds Washington's decision to step up
its involvement in Colombia's battle against drugs as ``a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy underlying the aid package, which President Clinton
is expected to sign early next month, calls for greater use of the
Colombian armed forces in ``source interdiction'' and envisions a
reduced role for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The primary burden of fighting the drug war will now fall on
three new anti-narcotics battalions created in the armed forces
with U.S. money and training. Ramirez, in an interview at his
Defense Ministry headquarters on Friday, dismissed any doubts that
these new units are ready to do battle with the leftist guerrillas
and right-wing paramilitary units that now play dominant roles in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a dilemma,'' he said. ``Either it can
give us the tools and let us do the job, or the international
community takes charge of a problem that is growing out of hand. I
think the United States has made the correct decision by giving us
the tools we need to do our work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a transition taking place without much trauma,'' Ramirez
said of Serrano's retirement. ``It is basically the same team of
generals in anti-narcotics and the other areas, very much trained
by Serrano and very much in line with the way we have been
working'' since Pastrana took office nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Serrano is stepping down as many of the spectacular
gains made against drug trafficking early in his 5 1/2 year tenure
have been erased. Cocaine production has more than doubled in the
last five years despite a U.S.-financed program of spraying from
the air to eradicate coca crops _ a program that is supposed to
expand significantly when U.S. Blackhawk and Huey helicopters, the
most costly items in the new aid package, begin arriving in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's personal popularity, based on his folksy manner and
image of integrity, had dissolved much of the popular discontent
over lawlessness and bolstered U.S. confidence in Colombia's
ability to fight its end of the narcotics war, which is fed by drug
use and addiction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The general organized and led the raids that smashed the Cali
cartel and imprisoned scores of other drug traffickers on
Washington's most-wanted list. He also dismissed 11,400 of his own
officers, turning what had been a corrupt and often brutal force
into a tough and trim fighting unit that the United States
cultivated as a welcome alternative to an incompetent army and the
cartel-financed presidency of Ernesto Samper, Pastrana's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serrano delivered the goods and in many ways was a moral
leader for Colombia at a time the country badly needed one, and he
was tireless and entirely committed to the anti-narcotics fight,''
said Myles Frechette, who was the U.S. ambassador here during the
late 1990s. ``We had so much trust in him that we dealt with him as
if he were one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Serrano's standing in Washington has remained so high
that his superiors, to their dismay and occasional annoyance, have
often been eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   When Pastrana visited Washington last year to lobby for U.S. aid
and was rebuked by Republican members of Congress for not having
brought Serrano with him, he had to remind his hosts that ``I am
the president of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serrano's successor, Pastrana has named Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, 57. The grandson of a French police officer sent to
Colombia in 1891 to organize the National Police, Gilibert has a
personal commitment to the institution that is unquestioned, but
was described by a European diplomat here as being ``more cautious
and less charismatic'' than Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Serrano's great talents,'' Frechette said, ``is that he
really knew how to deal with Americans and had an understanding of
the international situation that the military still doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, Frechette predicted, ``there will be
adjustment pains'' for the Drug Enforcement Administration in
adapting to a different operating style under Gilibert, ``who is
very competent but doesn't know how to handle Americans as Serrano
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appointment was announced, Gilibert has made it clear
he wants the police force to concentrate more on making Colombians
feel more secure at home, at work and on the streets. The
implication is that there will be less of a focus on the fight
against drug trafficking, as Gilibert acknowledged in remarks to
reporters here last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we are going to forget about this theme,''
he said. ``But at these moments there are other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Ramirez said, ``we have 195 municipalities in
Colombia that are without a police presence'' because ``their
barracks have been destroyed by guerrillas'' in armed
confrontations. With political pressure building on Pastrana not to
step up the drug war to the detriment of public security, ``we are
going to have to make an extra effort in the Colombian budget'' to
support conventional police duties, he said.

MENDOZA LENDS HIS ARM TO YANKEES' UNDERACHIEVING STARTING ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ramiro Mendoza was not even supposed to be in the
starting rotation for the New York Yankees this season. The Yankees
had marquee names like David Cone, Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez
and Andy Pettitte and they wanted the fifth starter to be an
untested rookie named Ed Yarnall. As always, Mendoza was destined
to do the grunt work.
</P>
<P>
   But the season is almost half over, the Yankees rotation has
been plagued by injuries and underachievement and Mendoza, the
versatile pitcher, has evolved into the most consistent starter on
the team. Mendoza helped the Yankees finally stop the White Sox
Saturday, 12-8, winning his second-straight start during a stretch
of 10 games where the wobbly Yankees have won only three times.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre has called Mendoza his pet because he has
constantly advised the Yankees against trading Mendoza. Torre's
pleas might be redundant now. With both Clemens and Hernandez
injured, Cone stuck on one victory and the rookie Ben Ford in the
rotation for at least one more start, Mendoza could be as valuable
to the Yankees as Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh. Posada is in the midst of an All-Star season, but
Mendoza's pitching has been a salve. Mendoza silenced Chicago for
five innings, after the amazing White Sox had swatted the Yankees
in five consecutive games, dominating them like they have rarely
been dominated. But the Yankees punched back Saturday as Shane
Spencer drove in three runs and Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill
knocked in two each.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that is still trying to acquire Juan Gonzalez to
bolster its offense, the eruption was nice. But Mendoza's crisp
pitching is what pushed the Yankees. Mendoza gave up three runs on
six hits and three walks while pitching into the sixth inning,
hardly overwhelming statistics. More importantly, the White Sox
managed one run in the first five innings as the Yankees built a
10-1 cushion. Mendoza left the game in the sixth with slight
stiffness in his right shoulder and it was unclear if it would have
an impact his next start, which would be distressing for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the past two weeks the Yankees have desperately
needed a victory and Mendoza has produced each time. He relieved an
injured Clemens in the second inning on June 14 and worked 5 2/3
shutout innings in equaling Pedro Martinez and helping the Yankees
win, 3-1. After the Yankees had lost four straight, Mendoza pitched
competently in taming Boston, 22-1.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen hours after Mariano Rivera botched a save opportunity
in a devastating 4-3 loss to the White Sox here on Friday, Mendoza
held Chicago to two runs before leaving with a 10-2 lead in the
sixth. With a 7-3 record, Mendoza is tied with Pettitte for the
most victories on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Yankees trudged into the clubhouse about two hours
before the start of Saturday's game, which is a lot later than they
would usually arrive. But the Yankees played on Friday night and
then had to be back at Comiskey Park for an early game so at least
15 of them showed up with barely enough time to pull on their
uniforms for batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are tired of seeing the White Sox, who had defeated
them five times in the last eight days. When Jose Valentin's
broken-bat single off Rivera gave the White Sox a 4-3 victory on
Friday, the Yankees fell into third place for the first time since
April 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the Yankees to show some perkiness
against Kip Wells. Derek Jeter grounded to the mound in the first,
but Wells threw wildly to first and Jeter smartly scooted all the
way to third base. With only one out, it was pivotal for Jeter to
grab the additional base. O'Neill singled in the first run.
</P>
<P>
   After Bernie Williams singled O'Neill to third, he followed with
a clever play. Martinez smacked a grounder to first and Paul
Konerko stepped on the base and threw to second. Williams got in a
rundown, which allowed O'Neill to score the second run. &QL;

MUGABE'S TACTIC OF INTIMIDATION SEEN TO BACKFIRE

<P>
   HWEDZA, Zimbabwe _ The grassland farming district of Hwedza,
about 90 miles southeast of the capital, was scorched by terrible
political violence over the past four months. Farmworkers were
forced to attend nightly ``reeducation'' rallies, where thugs of
the ruling party beat them and made them sing revolutionary war
songs. The opposition candidate for parliament fled the country,
and remains in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   But when the polls opened Saturday on Zimbabwe's most important
election since independence in 1980, Eric Chikukwa was one of
hundreds of people waiting in the early winter morning to vote.
``People aren't worried about who the candidates are. They just
want change,'' said the young Zimbabwean, casting a ballot for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Facing its first serious challenge in 20 years, President Robert
Mugabe's party encouraged a widespread intimidation in the months
preceding this weekend's ballot, which ends Sunday. He lashed out
the white minority for sabotaging the economy. His backers raided
more than 1,000 commercial farms, destroying crops and pummeling
anyone they suspected of supporting the opposition. At least 30
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, however, seems to have backfired. Rather than
hiding at home, people turned out in record numbers, eager, many
said, to register their frustration over economic decline and
government corruption. Five years ago, just 29 percent of voters
bothered to mark a ballot. Saturday, they waited for hours in long
lines outside polling stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most expressed the hope that the ballot's arrival would mark an
end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last,'' said Daniel Chininga, one of the first voters to
arrive at a polling station in Goromonzi, outside the capital,
Harare. ``We all wish the elections had been held sooner. Brother
to brother will be brother to brother again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a contest between an entrenched ruling class and the forces
of change, both sides seemed to understand the stakes. Farmers gave
their workers the day off Saturday, and organized transportation
for them in pickup trucks and three-ton flatbeds to and from the
polling stations. Government supporters rode in on buses or
tractor-pulled hay wagons. At most polling stations, the atmosphere
was cheery, though a quiet tension prevailed in districts like
Hwedza that were most shaken by the violence.
</P>
<P>
   International teams of election observers reported only
scattered organizational problems and incidents of intimidation.
That was surprising, they said, given the turbulent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition said that at one polling station farm workers
were required to stand in line between rows of war veterans, the
pro-Mugabe group that orchestrated the invasions on white-owned
commercial farms. In other locations, it said, ruling party
supporters blocked people from voting.
</P>
<P>
   One white farmer told Reuters that he and voting family members
were yanked out of the line by war veterans saying, ``you will not
vote here. This is not your country. This is not a white man's
country.'' Others were blocked from voting by incomplete voter
registration lists.
</P>
<P>
   But ``overall, things are running smoothly,'' said Pierre
Schori, head of the European Union monitoring group. ``We have
received reports from the countryside. There have been four or five
incidents, mainly people being obstructed from reaching polling
stations, some threats and that type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 5 million people are registered to vote for the 120
elected seats in parliament. Mugabe himself is not up for
reelection until 2002. Election officials were due to count the
ballots through the night after the polling stations close Sunday
in order to announce the results Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed the large turnout was auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Before casting his ballot Saturday, Mugabe said the enthusiastic
participation proved Zimbabwe's peaceful, democratic nature. ``I
hear the people are voting in their masses,'' he said. ``The
prophets of doom . . . their prophecies are doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was equally upbeat. ``This
is the day we move forward as a country, or backward into an
economic abyss,'' he said after marking his ballot. ``Hope is our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts had said a large turnout favored the
opposition, which faced an uphill battle in Mugabe's rural
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine Ziswa, an opposition candidate in the rural district
of Makoni North, 90 miles east of Harare, said his opponent could
win only by rigging the vote, a claim Tsvangirai has made. Ziswa
vowed a court challenge if defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Chenjerai Hunzvi, a ruling party candidate and the inflammatory
leader of the war veterans' farm invasions, vowed to take up arms
if the opposition wins. ``There is no other way of liberating
Zimbabwe other than armed struggle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, as sprinklers shot across the oat fields
on Nico van Rensburg's farm, two sisters bundled up an infant and
prepared to go to vote. Every night since March, they said, they
were rounded up by war veterans occupying an adjacent farm and
forced to hear lectures about Mugabe's greatness. They wouldn't say
how they planned to vote, but allowed they wanted change.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of candor, ruling party candidate Aenaes
Chigwedere admitted that the government's use of intimidation
hadn't worked so well. ``Maybe it made people afraid to enter the
arena and campaign,'' he said. ``But as a strategy it was
counterproductive.''

 &HT;    Thrashers take scorer as top pick
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY _ Knowing too well that scouting reports cease to carry
any weight after a draft, Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
cautioned Saturday, ``We'll find out in four or five years how
smart we were.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Thrashers can at least be comforted by early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, they landed the consensus best
player in the draft, selecting Wisconsin freshman left winger Dany
Heatley with the second overall pick on the first day of the NHL
entry draft at the Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel real good about this,'' Waddell said. ``We've talked
about goal-scoring being at a premium, and Heatley is a goal
scorer. If (Patrik) Stefan (last year's No. 1) and Heatley become
the players we think they can, we can be set for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Heatley fell to the Thrashers after the New York Islanders
traded two young backup goaltenders (Roberto Luongo and Steve
Weekes) to make room for Boston University's Rick DiPietro, who
became the first goalie in history to be taken No. 1 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley is a 6-foot-1 ``power forward'' whom Waddell likens to
Philadelphia's John LeClair. It's likely he will return to
Wisconsin for another season, although that decision is not final.
Heatley cannot even attend training camp without jeopardizing his
NCAA eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to a pretty new team gives a younger guy a better chance
to get his foot in the door,'' said Heatley, who totaled 27 goals
and 25 assists in 35 games for Wisconsin. ``But I'm in no hurry to
leave school.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th anniversary of Calgary taking Atlanta's hockey team,
the Flames, Atlanta took Calgary's favorite son. Heatley was born
in Germany, where his father played hockey, but moved to Calgary
when he was 4 years old and played youth hockey here.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Heatley, Dany's father, said, ``It's the best of both
worlds. Dany's not going to an established team, but he's not going
to a brand new team where he's going to get his head beat in. He'll
only get his head beat in a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Heatley punctuated a successful first day for
the Thrashers. Waddell added size and strength on defense with two
second-round picks, taking Russian Ilja Nikulin (6-3, 211) with the
31st overall pick and Czech Republic native Libor Ustrnul (6-5,
228) with the 42nd selection. Both were projected as first-rounders
by scouting services, and the Thrashers had Nikulin ranked sixth
overall and Ustrnul 15th. Waddell acquired the 42nd overall pick
from Vancouver for a second-round pick in 2001 and a possible swap
of third-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said he had ``about 10 phone calls'' from other GMs for
the 31st pick, with most wanting a shot at Nikulin. Barring trades,
the Thrashers have 10 more picks in rounds 4 through 9 today.
</P>
<P>
   Nikulin probably will play another year in Russia, but said,
``When I come to play, the Thrashers will win the Stanley Cup.''

ANGELS' GLAUS _ HE'S NO MIKE SCHMIDT, YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Dave Hollins used to call him ``the
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins was the Anaheim Angels' third baseman at the time, and a
young Troy Glaus was too talented for Hollins to ignore. He called
him the franchise, partly out of admiration, but mostly out of envy
and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, an aging, beat-up veteran, could only dream of being in
Glaus' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1998. In 1999, Hollins was gone and Glaus was indeed
the Angels' every-day third baseman at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting 29 homers last season, much is expected of him
this season. And he is delivering. His 22 homers is tied for the
team lead with Mo Vaughn. He's hitting .314, a marked improvement
from last season's .240. He ranks among the American League's top
10 in nine offensive categories.
</P>
<P>
   A former shortstop, Glaus is Gold Glove material defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels know what they have in Glaus, and now the rest of the
world is learning about him. So much so, Sports Illustrated
compared Glaus to Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. That's
heady company, and it's often unfair to compare a young player with
legendary players.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't bother Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's flattering to be compared to him, but it's just (the
reporter's) opinion,'' Glaus said. ``I'm not trying to be Mike
Schmidt, I'm just trying to be the best Troy Glaus I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no debate about Glaus' talent and potential.
Despite his size - he's 6-foot-5, 229 pounds - he has quick hands
and is agile at third, where he fields almost everything. He has
power - he hit a 457- foot homer off Randy Johnson this month - and
still has patience at the plate (he's sixth in the league in
walks).
</P>
<P>
   But in order to be a star-type player, it requires more than
just a pretty swing and a good glove. Does Glaus have that certain
something?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has it,'' Angels coach Joe Maddon said. ``What he
has to come to grips with is, as he becomes more comfortable with
his role on the team, to understand the awesome potential he has. I
don't think he understands that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's difficult to remember that Glaus is so young. But
he'll give reminders when he slams his helmet and throws his bat
after striking out. Or when he'll be short with reporters after a
tough loss, or even after a win.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus is careful to avoid talking about himself as much as
possible. Which is why the comparisons to Schmidt might have made
him uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about how you take what people say,'' Angels first
baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``Mike Schmidt was a bad cat, one of the
best ever to play the position. Does (Glaus) have the potential?
Yes, but he has to work at it. It's all about how you apply
yourself. The only thing he can do is keep doing what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus almost surely will make the All-Star team, which will go
against his ``team-first'' philosophy. He'll have to talk about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great honor, but it's an individual accolade,
and I don't play for individual accolades,'' Glaus said. ``The only
accolade I play for is a World Series championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddon insists Glaus means what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not motivated by hitting .300, he's motivated to help us
win,'' he said. ``With Troy, peer acceptance is very important. If
his fellow players see him as a guy who has winning as a first
priority, that will do whatever it takes to win, he will be
well-liked, as would anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a difficult task to stay grounded at such a young
age when the compliments are coming fast and furious, but Glaus
says it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is, because I've still got a lot of work to do,''
he said. ``I'd like to be that (Hall of Fame-type) player. All of
us would. If you want to be the best, you have to work. And if
you're lucky enough to get there, you have to work to stay there.''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Like with many teams that get edgy when
things aren't going well, the defending AL West-champion Texas
Rangers and defending AL Central-champion Cleveland Indians are
getting a little hot under the collar.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, tempers flared between players during a
``friendly'' card game when center fielder Kenny Lofton and rookie
DH/first baseman Russell Branyan had to be separated.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton said only, ``The disagreement's over.'' Branyan, who hit
two homers in his first game this season, is developing a
reputation as a cocky player. Said Branyan about the incident:
``It's just Kenny being Kenny.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was second baseman Roberto Alomar's criticism of
manager Charlie Manuel. Alomar was hit in the head by a pitch from
Detroit's Willie Blair and became upset because Manuel did not
order retaliation from one of his pitchers, even though Alomar
admitted Blair hit him accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what Chuck Finley thinks of all the in-house griping?
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, after being swept in the three-game series against
the Rockies last week, Rangers manager Johnny Oates was asked how
he was feeling: ``Whatever's one degree below frustrated, I'm
feeling it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, however, is concerned his players aren't as upset as he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there's some people in the clubhouse feeling that way,
too,'' he said. ``I don't think there's enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there apathy among the players?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what Johnny's talking about,'' Rangers reliever
Tim Crabtree said. ``This team comes to the ballpark to play hard
every day. There isn't one player on this team who doesn't give 100
percent every day.''
</P>
<P>
   No September showdown: Add Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi to the
list of those critical of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have joined the Red Sox and Yankees in the AL East
race, but after this weekend, the Blue Jays and Red Sox won't play
each other again this season.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Angels manager Mike Scioscia talked about, when he
was a player, how the final month of the season was played against
division foes. Fregosi said it should still be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I honestly believe can be accomplished,''
Fregosi said. ``Those are the classic games in baseball, the
confrontations between people contending within their own division
in the month of September. To me, that's what baseball is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Break up the Orioles: With the third-highest payroll in baseball
at $83.1 million and the team going nowhere, look for the Orioles
to unload some high-priced players before the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Here's who might go, and where they might end up:
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Erickson, Cleveland; shortstop Mike Bordick,
Arizona; outfielder B.J. Surhoff, Yankees, and catcher Charles
Johnson, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Mike Mussina would help anybody, but he will be a free
agent at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   AL best: So which division is the best in baseball? Would you
believe the AL West?
</P>
<P>
   Based on the combined records of each team in the respective
divisions, the AL West (through Friday) was 24 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Next best was the NL West (19 over), followed by the NL East (14
over), the AL Central (two under), the AL East (9 under) and,
finally, the woeful NL Central (46 under).

TYSON EARNS TKO OVER SAVARESE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ Normalcy seems to exit the boxing ring as
soon as Mike Tyson enters it these days.
</P>
<P>
   In another bizarre and brief fight Saturday night at Hampden
Park, Tyson knocked Lou Savarese down with his first punch and then
won on a technical knockout 38 seconds into the first round _ after
briefly decking Referee John Coyle, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson hit Savarese with a looping left hook just seconds into
the fight, his glove striking Savarese with a grazing punch to the
top of the head. Savarese fell onto his back with his legs tangled
beneath him. He rose at the count of 6 and stepped forward when
Coyle asked him to, but Savarese was clearly dazed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson swarmed Savarese, wobbling him with another left hook
followed by several uppercuts that landed on Savarese's jaw. Coyle
at this point jumped between the fighters, apparently trying to
stop the bout and shouting for both to stop punching. But Coyle
could not get Tyson away from Savarese, and Tyson continued to
throw wild, furious punches.
</P>
<P>
   One of those punches, a looping attempt to throw a left hook
around Coyle, glanced off the referee and knocked him to the
canvas. Coyle did not appear to be hurt, and when he got up, he
separated the fighters. It was then that Coyle informed Savarese
that he had stopped the fight and awarded Tyson the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savarese wasn't throwing any punches back, and I could see his
eyes weren't focused on the task any longer,'' Coyle said. ``It
would have been unsafe for him to continue. I wasn't hurt when
Tyson kept punching.''
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring Coyle's orders, Tyson may be involved in another
postfight controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dedicate this fight to my friend Darryl Baum,'' Tyson, 33,
said in the ring afterward, referring to a friend who was murdered
in New York two weeks ago. ``I'm the best ever. I didn't really
train for this fight. I was too upset. I probably trained for only
two weeks. I wanted to rip his heart out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Lennox I'm coming after him. He can't fight me; he has no
chance against me when I'm ready. I'm not ready right now because
I'm rusty. I need more training. So when I am ready, he'll be no
match for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's victory over Savarese keeps him on the path to a title
fight, although a match with Lennox Lewis, who holds two of the
three heavyweight championship belts, may be held up because of the
fighters' contractual television agreements. Lewis is aligned with
Home Box Office, while Tyson has a contract with Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's next title fight may likely be for the World Boxing
Association title, which is vacant. Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz
fight for the WBA title in August.
</P>
<P>
   For Tyson (48-8, 42 knockouts), it was his third consecutive
victory since his losses to Holyfield. Last year, Tyson knocked out
Francois Botha and had a bout with Orlin Norris declared a no
contest after he hit Norris after the bell ending the first round.
In January, Tyson knocked out Julius Francis.
</P>
<P>
   For Savarese (39-4, 32 knockouts), it was his second successive
defeat. He was soundly beaten in a 10-round unanimous decision that
went to Michael Grant almost a year ago. Savarese, who will soon
turn 35, talked about retirement after that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Scottish crowd booed the fight's result. The crowd,
which appeared considerably smaller than the sellout of 51,000 that
had been predicted, cheered both Savarese and Tyson when they
entered the ring. Savarese seemed to be the favorite.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Frank Warren, the promoter of the fight, made his first
appearance in a week when he arrived ringside. Some in the British
press reported this week that Tyson had scuffled with Warren in a
dispute over money Tyson believes Warren owes him. Tyson denied
that he hit Warren, who wore a tuxedo and did not appear to be
injured. A London judge announced on Friday that he was withholding
a portion, valued at nearly $700,000, of the expected $8 million
purse Tyson was expected to receive.
</P>
<P>
   There were protesters outside Hampden Park before the fight,
though heavy rain seemed to subdue the scene considerably. Several
protesters held placards denouncing the decision of Jack Straw, the
home secretary in London, to allow Tyson into Britain since recent
changes in immigration laws would normally prohibit someone like
Tyson, who was convicted of rape in the United States, from being
granted a visa.
</P>
<P>
   The rain put a damper on the atmosphere at Hampden Park, the
Scottish national soccer stadium. Though it had stopped raining by
the time Tyson and Savarese entered the ring, the canvas may have
been slippery.

JUDAH WINS TITLE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ Brooklyn, N.Y.,'s Zab Judah made a
successful first defense of his International Boxing Federation
junior-welterweight championship Saturday night with a unanimous
decision over Junior Witter on the undercard of the Mike Tyson-Lou
Savarese fight in Glasgow's Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awkward fight for Judah, who improved his record to
23-0 as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches.
Witter also kept switching between fighting right-handed and
left-handed, which also helped make him an elusive opponent. By the
middle rounds, however, Judah's consistent body punching slowed
Witter, and with 30 seconds left in the fifth round, Judah caught
Witter with a straight left hand that dazed Witter and sent his
mouthpiece skittering across the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Judah continued to be the more effective fighter from there,
throwing many more power punches than Witter. Witter also was
clowning in the ring, and generally seemed more intent on
frustrating Judah than being aggressive enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Witter (15-1-2), from Bradford, England, was a late replacement
for Jason Roland, who withdrew for the fight two weeks ago because
of medical reasons.

MEMORIES OF KOREAN WAR STILL STRONG 50 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES J. FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pusan, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir, MiG Alley,
Pork Chop Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   All pieces of something called a police action. Just a few of
the names on that corner of the map called Korea, where the Cold
War once turned very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after our World War II victory marches, a dozen years
before we waded into Vietnam, the seesaw stalemate around the 38th
parallel is sometimes called ``The Forgotten War.'' That is a
bitter legacy for those who fought and froze on icy mountain roads
or bled and died in reeking rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   Because today _ 50 years after the conflict began _ the ones who
came home still cannot forget.
</P>
<P>
   So their recollections are not of the great themes of history,
of Western strategies for communist containment, of how civilian
authority asserted itself over the military or of how ``limited
war'' could become a military objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothered me most was the brainwashing,''
recalled Charles Kerr, living today near Bentonville, Ark. A pilot,
he was held by the Chinese in solitary confinement for a year.
``Night and day interrogations. And not being able to communicate
with my parents. They let me write a couple of letters, but they
never sent them. No Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories, instead, are of the confusion, the fear and the loss.
</P>
<P>
   With his right hand, fingers curled and thumb outstretched,
Chung Hyun Kim, 66, makes the motion of loading a clip in the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated from Korea in 1974 to join the 5,000-strong Kansas
City Korean-American community. He remembers South Korean soldiers
coming to his village when he was 16 years old, giving him an M-1
rifle and telling him that he and 500 other young men were members
of the 5th Republic of Korea (ROK) Army Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to show me to load,'' he said. ``I remember the
clip. Eight bullets. But I don't know about M-1. They said, `You
take; you shoot.' You know how many of the 500 survive?''
</P>
<P>
   He holds up three fingers.
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget the sad-faced children in a ravaged land;
waves of screaming men in quilted uniforms coming in the night; the
individual acts of heroism; and, above all, the barbarism of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a candle the other day,'' recalled Ken Lunt, 68, the
mayor of Fort Scott, Kan. He was a Marine scout-sniper in 1952 and
1953. ``All of a sudden I remembered this kid who had been shot in
the throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The wound was mortal and the bleeding unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cold it formed into a stalagmite like you see in a
cave, except it was this dark red, dripping down and getting bigger
and bigger....That candle brought all that back.''
</P>
<P>
   No, these veterans cannot forget. Nor should we.
INVASION AND RETREAT
</P>
<P>
   The conflict ignited when 90,000 North Koreans swarmed across
the South Korean border along the 38th parallel, brushing aside
undermanned ROK units that had given their farm-boy soldiers leave
for the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations immediately called for the North Koreans to
withdraw. The United States rushed unprepared troops from
occupation duty in Japan. Armed conflict in that fifth year of
post-World War II peace had not seemed on the horizon, despite
growing tension between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't ready,'' said John Williams of the 21st Infantry
Regiment of the 24th Division and now of Overland Park, Kan. ``The
whole Army wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was among those first troops into Korea, part of what
was called Task Force Smith, which met advancing North Korean
troops near Osan, south of Seoul. Some thought the U.S. Army just
showing up would make the enemy _ which called itself the Inmin Gun
_ turn tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rifles, carbines, machine guns and those 2.36 rocket
launchers,'' recalled Williams. ``The North Koreans had T-34 tanks,
recoilless rifles, artillery, you name it. Our little-bitty rocket
launchers we had just bounced off their tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting retreat was chaotic. Vehicles, weapons and wounded
were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Korea was not going to be a walkover. Task Force Smith,
too, would be remembered. The January 2000 edition of Military
Review, the professional journal of the U.S. Army Command and
General Staff College, at Fort Leavenworth, contained these words
in an article about today's shrinking military: ``No more Task
Force Smiths.''
</P>
<P>
   The news most all that summer was almost all bad _ engagement,
retreat, and the shrinking perimeter around a southern port called
Pusan. And a phenomenon called straggling _ troops white, black and
Asian running away.
</P>
<P>
   The daily newspapers did most of the coverage; television news
then was 15 minutes a night. The datelines on the stories were
Masan, Pohang, Taejon (where a two-star Army general was captured),
Taegu and Suwon. The black-and- white photos showed images such as
an exhausted GI weeping in another's arms, dead Americans found
with their hands bound, and floods of Korean refugees in their
flowing white dress and small black hats.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict's toll on the Koreans was staggering. Kim lost six
brothers. Villages were leveled, families sundered and much of the
population seemed uprooted. Fleeing columns of refugees often were
strafed in that panicky first year. Both sides summarily executed
ideological opponents as well as captive soldiers, especially the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different,'' said Fred Rice, a sergeant and machine
gunner in the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the lst Cavalry Division, who
now lives in Belton. ``You never could tell with the refugees. They
could have a burp gun under those robes. Most of us suspected that,
here and there, there were enemy soldiers in among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rice thinks, there was no massacre of huddled civilians
under the bridge by 1st Cavalry troopers at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't happen,'' he insists, despite the recent spate of
articles. ``Anybody who's been in the Army will tell you something
like that would have spread like wildfire. Soldiers talk. We would
have known.''
STRIKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Even with war undeclared officially, a lot of young men signed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the younger brothers of the guys who'd been in World
War II,'' said Bill Norris, a Korean veteran from Springfield, Ill.
``Nobody went off to Canada. I don't even remember anybody talking
about draft deferments. We didn't consider ourselves special.''
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slaughtered them,'' said Bill Norris, who was a tank
commander and recalled hundreds of Chinese and North Korean bodies
in their padded uniforms and ubiquitous tennis shoes piled up in
front of American lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't count them. They would keep coming, and we'd just
keep shooting and calling in artillery. What I remember is the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't forget what a battlefield where men have died smells
like. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Capturing real estate was secondary to punishing the enemy army,
said the new 8th Army commander, Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway. By
this time the idea of uniting the two Koreas had been given up by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur, however, had not abandoned the goal. Ignoring the
administration, he called loudly for expanding the war by
unleashing Nationalist Chinese from Taiwan and bombing or
blockading China.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong war against the wrong communist power, concluded
President Truman. MacArthur was sacked April 11, prompting a howl
of indignation through much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought of the politics or the big brass,'' said John
Hureado, a son of migrant workers, who grew up in Kansas City's
north end. In the Navy he became a 5-inch gun captain on the USS
Erben, a destroyer that gave fire support to troops ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there just to do a job....we were a bunch of kids.
Kids don't think about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kessler was another sailor, serving on the USS Mispillion,
an oiler that delivered aviation gas to combat ships. He likens
such duty to living in a time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a buddy named Jack Davenport,'' he said. They played
football at Paseo High School and delivered The Star together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war came, I said to Jack, `Let's join the Navy and
see the world.' He wouldn't. He wanted the Marines.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, 1951, near Songnae-Dong, Cpl. Davenport threw
himself on a grenade, giving his life for another Marine. He was
awarded the Medal of Honor.
TALKS, FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the communist armies were pushed back over most of the
38th parallel, where the Korean Demilitarized Zone stands today.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage the U.N. forces had was air superiority. Although
the communists had more jet fighters (usually flown by Chinese or
Russians), the U.S. Air Force achieved at least a 7-to-1 kill ratio
in dogfights.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kerr, an F-86 pilot, ended up on the wrong side of that
ratio. He was on patrol in April 1952 along the Yalu River with a
green flight leader, when a MiG-15 was spotted below. The Sabres
dived on him, but the communist flier slammed on his air brakes,
causing the Americans to overshoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My flight leader didn't react fast enough. We just zipped on
by him. ... He got in behind me and hit me as soon as I started to
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The second lieutenant began 16 months of captivity, most of it
alone in a farmhouse room. He describes his relentless
interrogators as well-educated, even boastful of studying in the
United States. They wanted propaganda, especially phony confessions
about germ warfare. ``That was their biggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although peace talks had started in July 1951, the war would
drag out for two more years. The Chinese used the first round of
negotiations as a breather to organize a new offensive. It was
blunted. The next round they used to dig deep into their
mountainous defense lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 percent of American casualties came in this last phase
of the war. Charles Stollenwerk of Overland Park served as a
butcher at March Air Force Base in California:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting meat. But what I remember is the big C-124
Globemasters coming in from Korea, day in and day out, just full of
coffins. They were huge planes. They could carry lots of coffins.''
Uneasy peace
</P>
<P>
   The truce finally came in late July 1953.
</P>
<P>
   It had been held up largely over the issue of returning
communist prisoners. China wanted them all back; the U.N. wanted to
give them a choice. Finally the exchange was made.
</P>
<P>
   When Kerr, the emaciated flier, finally walked under the
``Welcome Home'' arch, one of his thoughts was of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived largely on meager rice rations until the last weeks
of captivity, when he got some bread and a little meat. ``Rice,
something I hated all my life, and boiled cabbage.'' Kerr chuckled
at the grim memory. ``I lost a few pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunt remembered wanting more than anything a hamburger and a
root beer. One day, however, he and some of his fellow Marines got
their hands on some oranges.
</P>
<P>
   They perched themselves above a road where trucks hauling
Chinese communists on their way to repatriation would have to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here came these trucks, loaded with communists who had
ripped off their clothes and used to their own blood to make red
flags. They were singing these Chinese communist songs and chanting
and shouting like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we blasted them. With oranges. Just pelted them ... Shut
'em up. You should have seen the looks on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeWitt of Independence was with the 555th Army Field
Artillery Battalion. In the last days it was overrun. Half its 600
men were killed or listed as missing. DeWitt's memory of that
always will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another recollection would stick, one bordering on the
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country around where we'd been fighting was shot to
pieces,'' said DeWitt. ``A wasteland. It looked as barren as the
moon. But right after the truce we found this gorgeous little
valley, all green, absolutely untouched by the war and just full of
pheasants. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day there were signs in the valley saying stay out;
it was now an artillery range. And so it got shot to pieces, too.''

   One advantage the U.N. forces had was air superiority. Although
the communists had more jet fighters (usually flown by Chinese or
Russians), the U.S. Air Force achieved at least a 7-to-1 kill ratio
in dogfights.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kerr, an F-86 pilot, ended up on the wrong side of that
ratio. He was on patrol in April 1952 along the Yalu River with a
green flight leader, when a MiG-15 was spotted below. The Sabres
dived on him, but the communist flier slammed on his air brakes,
causing the Americans to overshoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My flight leader didn't react fast enough. We just zipped on
by him. ... He got in behind me and hit me as soon as I started to
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The second lieutenant began 16 months of captivity, most of it
alone in a farmhouse room. He describes his relentless
interrogators as well-educated, even boastful of studying in the
United States. They wanted propaganda, especially phony confessions
about germ warfare. ``That was their biggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although peace talks had started in July 1951, the war would
drag out for two more years. The Chinese used the first round of
negotiations as a breather to organize a new offensive. It was
blunted. The next round they used to dig deep into their
mountainous defense lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 percent of American casualties came in this last phase
of the war. Charles Stollenwerk of Overland Park served as a
butcher at March Air Force Base in California:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting meat. But what I remember is the big C-124
Globemasters coming in from Korea, day in and day out, just full of
coffins. They were huge planes. They could carry lots of coffins.''
Uneasy peace
</P>
<P>
   The truce finally came in late July 1953.
</P>
<P>
   It had been held up largely over the issue of returning
communist prisoners. China wanted them all back; the U.N. wanted to
give them a choice. Finally the exchange was made.
</P>
<P>
   When Kerr, the emaciated flier, finally walked under the
``Welcome Home'' arch, one of his thoughts was of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived largely on meager rice rations until the last weeks
of captivity, when he got some bread and a little meat. ``Rice,
something I hated all my life, and boiled cabbage.'' Kerr chuckled
at the grim memory. ``I lost a few pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunt remembered wanting more than anything a hamburger and a
root beer. One day, however, he and some of his fellow Marines got
their hands on some oranges.
</P>
<P>
   They perched themselves above a road where trucks hauling
Chinese communists on their way to repatriation would have to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here came these trucks, loaded with communists who had
ripped off their clothes and used to their own blood to make red
flags. They were singing these Chinese communist songs and chanting
and shouting like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we blasted them. With oranges. Just pelted them ... Shut
'em up. You should have seen the looks on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeWitt of Independence was with the 555th Army Field
Artillery Battalion. In the last days it was overrun. Half its 600
men were killed or listed as missing. DeWitt's memory of that
always will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another recollection would stick, one bordering on the
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country around where we'd been fighting was shot to
pieces,'' said DeWitt. ``A wasteland. It looked as barren as the
moon. But right after the truce we found this gorgeous little
valley, all green, absolutely untouched by the war and just full of
pheasants. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day there were signs in the valley saying stay out;
it was now an artillery range. And so it got shot to pieces, too.''
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ourselves special.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserves were called up, said J.O. Smith, a Marine in a 105
mm Marine howitzer battalion in Kansas City. ``They called us and
we went. Nobody was exactly happy. But that was the deal we'd
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even early on, an odd disconnect existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there was news about Korea in the papers or if you watched
television, you'd see a little here and there,'' recalled Rose
Matthews of Mattoon, Ill. When her husband, Joe, was assigned to
the 2nd Division, she took their baby to live with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never knew there was a war. I'd meet people on the
street, and they'd ask where my husband was. I'd say Korea, and
they'd look at me like I was crazy. Life went on the same. It
wasn't a thing like World War II, when everybody was focused all
the time on the war.''
</P>
<P>
   But everybody did focus, at least for a while, when the old
Pacific war hero, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, made his gamble _ the end
run around the invading forces. On Sept. 15, 1950, the 1st Marine
and 7th Army Divisions went ashore at Inchon and seized Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 8th Army broke out of the Pusan perimeter
and joined the pursuit of the Inmin Gun.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Young Park, who was 17 then, remembers the North Koreans
retreating through her village 70 miles outside of Seoul. The
communists already had taken all the livestock in their push south,
and now they grabbed what food they could as they moved north
again. Adding insult, they urinated in the home's vat of pickled
cabbage that they couldn't take with them, the Kansas City woman
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In a period of two weeks, a savage defensive war seemed to have
been transformed into a brilliant American victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd be home for Christmas,'' said Chester Addison,
part of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. TO THE YALU AND BACK AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The United States made a fateful decision to go beyond the 38th
parallel and reunite the Koreas under President Syngman Rhee's
corrupt but pro-Western dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur brushed off concerns that the Red Chinese might decide
to keep the imperialist Americans from their borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went right up the west coast of Korea,'' said Nathan Riley,
a sergeant in the 19th Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division, who
lives in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were little things that bothered you. We were having
trouble getting ammunition. And winter gear. It was getting really
cold, way below zero, and I was still wearing just a field jacket,
a shirt, a sweatshirt and my old leather combat boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the rear everybody seemed to have these big winter
parkas, shoe-pacs, wool sacks, everything to keep toasty. But not
at the front. They were grabbing them off before they got to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley remembers how two men would dig a foxhole and sit facing
each other, each man sitting on the other's feet to keep them warm.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the Chinese came out of everywhere, and we took off
south.''
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur's intelligence sections, looking for trucks in
roadbound columns, had missed hundreds of thousands of
``volunteers'' infiltrating into North Korea by night and on foot.
</P>
<P>
   From headquarters to the front line, the resulting collapse
would leave a black mark on the Army's reputation. In western Korea
the 8th Army was suddenly hearing bugles, whistles and the screams
of thousands of Chinese soldiers bursting through their lines,
panicking the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Addison was at Unsan, north of the communist capital, Pyongyang,
where his unit was all but wiped out. Although wounded four times,
he escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the popping sound when they shot me. They weren't
very good shots, you know. It still bothers me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern side of the peninsula's mountain spine, the
Chinese encircled the Marines, as well as some of the 3rd and 7th
Army divisions, around the Chosin Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   James Ramsey was in the 7th. Of the 3,200 men in his 32nd
Regiment and the 31st, just 385 survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wounded in the hip, and we went out across the ice of
the reservoir to get away,'' said Ramsey, who lives in Westfield,
Ill. ``Behind me I could see our vehicles burning and the Chinese
shooting them up. They had wounded men in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey and a few others made it to Marine lines at Hagaru-ri,
where a puny airstrip had been ripped out of the frozen earth.
Loaded aboard a C-47 for evacuation, Ramsey could finally breathe
as the plane took off. Then it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right back where we'd come from,'' he said. ``The Marines came
out and got us, threw us on another plane, and that one made it. It
was not a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines broke out, bringing most of their dead, their
wounded, much of their equipment and vehicles, Army and ROK units
and a mass of refugees. They were evacuated from the port of
Hungnam by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, 1950, Ensign Jesse L. Brown's F4U Corsair, flying
close air support for the Marines, was hit by ground fire.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 24, the first African-American naval aviator, could not
make it to Hagaru-ri. His belly landing in the snow was rough.
Brown's three squadron mates, circling above, saw Brown slide his
canopy open, but he did not get out of the smoking plane.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Thomas Hudner landed his Corsair nearby. Finding Brown's
legs were pinned under a hydraulic panel, he called for a
helicopter. Meanwhile, he comforted Brown, who was in severe pain,
and tried to put the fire out with snow.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, however, was no help, and the light started to
fade. Brown was unconscious and probably dead. The area was
swarming with Chinese. Hudner had to get out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy _ in its own way _ gave Brown a Valkyrian tribute.
Soon four Corsairs flew overhead and cremated Brown and his Corsair
in a billow of napalm.
BLOODY STALEMATE
</P>
<P>
   Six Chinese offensives came in the first five months of 1951.
The battle line slipped far below Seoul once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese needed only 50 tons of supplies a day for one of
their divisions, compared with 610 for an American division, but
now even their supply lines were badly stretched.
</P>
<P>
   The allies reorganized and mounted unglamorous operations called
Ripper and Killer, Thunderbolt, Tomahawk and the battle of ``The No
Name Line,'' all using the superiority of U.S. firepower. (MORE)

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ completely meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks in February, trade commission Chairman Robert
Pitofsky cited the study, saying that the United States was in a
wave of mergers and that divestitures proposed to remedy
anti-competitive results had become more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to ensure that scale and scope economies are not
entirely lost is to prefer _ but not always insist upon _ the
divestiture of an ongoing business with staff, supplies and
customer relations intact, to divestiture of a package of selected
assets,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that when the government accepted a certain kind of
restructuring, it led companies that later initiated similar deals
to expect the same treatment. But if the market has become more
concentrated, then maybe a similar deal is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The government is not justified in repeating a mistake if an
earlier restructuring failed to provide adequate competition,
Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   These are insights that could have some bearing on the Sprint
and WorldCom deal, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom and MCI merged in 1998, the merging companies
agreed to sell MCI's Internet business to Cable &AMP; Wireless Inc. for
$1.75 billion, along with the customer contracts, employees, assets
and services that would allow it to replace MCI as a competitor in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless later sued WorldCom, alleging that it failed to
transfer all its customers, customer information and personnel, and
failed to provide all the services and support to operate the
business. WorldCom settled the case in March for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Sprint and WorldCom deal, Kovacic says he thinks
it was always a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the policy change is a more demanding look at mergers
and settlement proposals. At the same time, it is the old
phenomenon of deals getting stickier as the number of players drops
to a handful,'' Kovacic said. ``What regulators have always said
is: When you get down to a handful of players, you have to have a
very compelling reason for us to contemplate the next merger. The
burden increases and gets heavier and heavier.''

GOVERNMENT REGULATORS GIVE MERGER DEALS A HIGHER DEGREE OF
SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ While the vast majority of corporate mergers
filed last year will be approved, antitrust experts detect a chill
wind in the regulatory atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. and WorldCom Inc. now are caught in the cold,
offering to sell off Sprint's Internet and long distance operations
to assuage regulatory concerns that the merger would concentrate 80
percent of long distance traffic in the hands of two companies:
AT&AMP;T and the merged Sprint//WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   That comes after Sprint and WorldCom officials predicted the
merger would be blessed without the companies' having to auction
anything substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's board is expected to meet in the next few days to
evaluate the plan to sell the entire long distance division, a move
that would effectively dismantle Kansas City's largest employer and
alter the dynamics of the deal. The alternative is to scrap the
deal altogether and send Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey
looking for another partner.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain whether senior officials at the Department
of Justice will accept WorldCom and Sprint's offer, or choose to
back their staff's recommendation to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The department is likely to weigh in with its decision whether
to fight the merger in court in the next few days, and it may be
coordinating its approach with European regulators, who are also
disposed to block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint situation comes hard on the heels of a judge's
agreeing with federal regulators that computer software behemoth
Microsoft needed to be broken into two competing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe regulators have been emboldened by their ability to
convince a judge that Microsoft acted in a predatory manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent victories have given the agencies a real shot in the
arm,'' said Hillard Sterling, a partner with Gordon &AMP; Glickson, a
Chicago antitrust law firm. ``They are feeling confident and
aggressive in their antitrust endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more significant than the Microsoft case, many experts
agree, has been a Federal Trade Commission study released last
summer. It found that more than 25 percent of the divestitures the
commission required as a condition of approving mergers in the
early 1990s never produced competition, or not at the level
desired.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is not evaluating the Sprint//WorldCom deal,
which is being reviewed by the Justice Department, the Federal
Communications Commission and the European Commission. Experts,
however, said that all antitrust agencies had taken note of the
trade commission study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, in the past, divestitures have been a convenient
way for antitrust agencies and companies to resolve a merger
without a real confrontation,'' said John Kwoka, professor of
economics at George Washington University and a fellow at the
Kennedy School at Harvard. ``Where agencies were uncertain or
lacked resolve, they could declare victory when walking away from
the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a surge in mergers in recent years as
corporations embraced the notion that huge economies of scale are
needed to compete on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there were 9,270 mergers announced, valued at almost
$1.5 trillion, according to Mergerstat, which tracks publicly
announced marriages. That was up 59 percent from the 5,841 mergers
announced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 4,700 mergers filed with the trade commission last
year involve complex divestitures _ selling off parts of the merged
businesses to satisfy concerns over diminishing competition. But
the study found that in a significant number of cases merging
companies made only token attempts to satisfy the concerns of
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission study confirmed regulators' suspicions that
they must be more diligent if consumers are not going to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get back to the state of competition that
existed before the merger,'' said Dan Ducore, assistant director in
the commission's Compliance Division, which conducted the study.
``This is not resulting in revolutionary changes in our approach,
but the study confirmed our assessments that we needed to be
particularly careful in structuring divestitures.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have not redefined what deals they would find
palatable, Kwoka said. But they have been able to cite the report
when they think companies are not doing enough to preserve
competition in their industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no broad, new guidelines that now make deals
unacceptable that once were acceptable. But there is a new emphasis
by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice,
since the report on divestiture remedies found they often failed to
restore competition,'' Kwoka said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission report found that companies agreeing to
divest some of their operations often looked for weak buyers they
expected to fail and then sometimes sabotaged them. Buyers were
more likely to succeed when they bought ongoing businesses rather
than selected assets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers, even large sophisticated companies, often lacked enough
information about the assets they were buying to negotiate good
deals. Sometimes they did not realize that assets the merging
companies had not included in a sale were essential to succeeding
in a new business. Some buyers even accepted conditions that the
trade commission opposed rather than risk the chance that they
might not get the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it was no surprise companies might not look for
the best competitors when divesting business. But the commission
staff had relied on buyers of assets to help determine what needed
to be sold and on what terms, the report said. It was a surprise to
find that buyers often did not know or would not help regulators
formulate the best plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence of widespread mistakes by buyers of divested assets
has, however, changed how the staff examines proposed divestiture
orders and prospective buyers,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson regulators have learned is that they have to be more
careful in evaluating mergers and the solutions companies propose
to solve concentration issues, said William Kovacic, a law
professor at George Washington University law school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they knew before the report was finished is that in many
cases the government is getting low value,'' Kovacic said. ``Many
of these settlements trumpeted as good solutions turned out to be
competitively meaningless.'' (MORE)

MEMORIES OF KOREAN WAR STILL STRONG 50 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES J. FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pusan, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir, MiG Alley,
Pork Chop Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   All pieces of something called a police action. Just a few of
the names on that corner of the map called Korea, where the Cold
War once turned very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after our World War II victory marches, a dozen years
before we waded into Vietnam, the seesaw stalemate around the 38th
parallel is sometimes called ``The Forgotten War.'' That is a
bitter legacy for those who fought and froze on icy mountain roads
or bled and died in reeking rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   Because today _ 50 years after the conflict began _ the ones who
came home still cannot forget.
</P>
<P>
   So their recollections are not of the great themes of history,
of Western strategies for communist containment, of how civilian
authority asserted itself over the military or of how ``limited
war'' could become a military objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothered me most was the brainwashing,''
recalled Charles Kerr, living today near Bentonville, Ark. A pilot,
he was held by the Chinese in solitary confinement for a year.
``Night and day interrogations. And not being able to communicate
with my parents. They let me write a couple of letters, but they
never sent them. No Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories, instead, are of the confusion, the fear and the loss.
</P>
<P>
   With his right hand, fingers curled and thumb outstretched,
Chung Hyun Kim, 66, makes the motion of loading a clip in the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated from Korea in 1974 to join the 5,000-strong Kansas
City Korean-American community. He remembers South Korean soldiers
coming to his village when he was 16 years old, giving him an M-1
rifle and telling him that he and 500 other young men were members
of the 5th Republic of Korea (ROK) Army Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to show me to load,'' he said. ``I remember the
clip. Eight bullets. But I don't know about M-1. They said, `You
take; you shoot.' You know how many of the 500 survive?''
</P>
<P>
   He holds up three fingers.
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget the sad-faced children in a ravaged land;
waves of screaming men in quilted uniforms coming in the night; the
individual acts of heroism; and, above all, the barbarism of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a candle the other day,'' recalled Ken Lunt, 68, the
mayor of Fort Scott, Kan. He was a Marine scout-sniper in 1952 and
1953. ``All of a sudden I remembered this kid who had been shot in
the throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The wound was mortal and the bleeding unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cold it formed into a stalagmite like you see in a
cave, except it was this dark red, dripping down and getting bigger
and bigger....That candle brought all that back.''
</P>
<P>
   No, these veterans cannot forget. Nor should we.
INVASION AND RETREAT
</P>
<P>
   The conflict ignited when 90,000 North Koreans swarmed across
the South Korean border along the 38th parallel, brushing aside
undermanned ROK units that had given their farm-boy soldiers leave
for the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations immediately called for the North Koreans to
withdraw. The United States rushed unprepared troops from
occupation duty in Japan. Armed conflict in that fifth year of
post-World War II peace had not seemed on the horizon, despite
growing tension between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't ready,'' said John Williams of the 21st Infantry
Regiment of the 24th Division and now of Overland Park, Kan. ``The
whole Army wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was among those first troops into Korea, part of what
was called Task Force Smith, which met advancing North Korean
troops near Osan, south of Seoul. Some thought the U.S. Army just
showing up would make the enemy _ which called itself the Inmin Gun
_ turn tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rifles, carbines, machine guns and those 2.36 rocket
launchers,'' recalled Williams. ``The North Koreans had T-34 tanks,
recoilless rifles, artillery, you name it. Our little-bitty rocket
launchers we had just bounced off their tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting retreat was chaotic. Vehicles, weapons and wounded
were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Korea was not going to be a walkover. Task Force Smith,
too, would be remembered. The January 2000 edition of Military
Review, the professional journal of the U.S. Army Command and
General Staff College, at Fort Leavenworth, contained these words
in an article about today's shrinking military: ``No more Task
Force Smiths.''
</P>
<P>
   The news most all that summer was almost all bad _ engagement,
retreat, and the shrinking perimeter around a southern port called
Pusan. And a phenomenon called straggling _ troops white, black and
Asian running away.
</P>
<P>
   The daily newspapers did most of the coverage; television news
then was 15 minutes a night. The datelines on the stories were
Masan, Pohang, Taejon (where a two-star Army general was captured),
Taegu and Suwon. The black-and- white photos showed images such as
an exhausted GI weeping in another's arms, dead Americans found
with their hands bound, and floods of Korean refugees in their
flowing white dress and small black hats.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict's toll on the Koreans was staggering. Kim lost six
brothers. Villages were leveled, families sundered and much of the
population seemed uprooted. Fleeing columns of refugees often were
strafed in that panicky first year. Both sides summarily executed
ideological opponents as well as captive soldiers, especially the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different,'' said Fred Rice, a sergeant and machine
gunner in the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the lst Cavalry Division, who
now lives in Belton. ``You never could tell with the refugees. They
could have a burp gun under those robes. Most of us suspected that,
here and there, there were enemy soldiers in among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rice thinks, there was no massacre of huddled civilians
under the bridge by 1st Cavalry troopers at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't happen,'' he insists, despite the recent spate of
articles. ``Anybody who's been in the Army will tell you something
like that would have spread like wildfire. Soldiers talk. We would
have known.''
STRIKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Even with war undeclared officially, a lot of young men signed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the younger brothers of the guys who'd been in World
War II,'' said Bill Norris, a Korean veteran from Springfield, Ill.
``Nobody went off to Canada. I don't even remember anybody talking
about draft deferments. We didn't consider ourselves special.''

KENTUCKY WOMAN RECALLS E-MAIL RELATIONSHIP WITH MURDER SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A few months ago a Kentucky woman looked at
two photos e-mailed to her by ``John'' and envisioned a
hard-working businessman and caring father from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Now she looks at the photos and searches her mind to recall any
conversation that might help authorities as they investigate John
Edward Robinson Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Olathe, Kan., man has been charged with five
counts of murder in the deaths of women whose bodies were found in
barrels in Linn County, Kan., and Cass County. He also has been
linked to three women and a baby missing since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also is accused of sexually attacking two women who
traveled to the area in the spring for sadomasochistic encounters
after meeting him on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, the Kentucky woman said, she corresponded with
John in an e-mail relationship that began on a
bondage-discipline-sadomasochism, or BDSM, personal ad Web site.
The woman, who uses the name ``Lauralei'' on the Internet, asked
that her real name not be used in this article, to protect her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they had spoken with several women who received
similar pictures of Robinson. They would not confirm that they had
interviewed Lauralei.
</P>
<P>
   Lauralei said their conversation was far removed from the
violence and manipulation of which Robinson has been accused. She
and John never met in person but formed a strong bond over the
Internet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mails and so on that he sent me and the things that we
talked about were so completely different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the solitude of their computers, the two enjoyed conversation
about their families and their day-to-day lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him interesting,'' she said. ``We e-mailed daily for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though still perplexed by the charges, her mind now races with
questions about the conversations they shared. He spoke of a young
college student who dressed in black attire: Was it Izabela
Lewicka, whose body was found in one of the barrels in Linn County?
He would fail to respond to some messages, explaining later that he
had gone to his farm: Was he meeting other women?
</P>
<P>
   Lauralei and John met when he answered her ad seeking someone
``that was over 45 years and somebody that was sure of themselves
and secure financially,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, I didn't want to have to support somebody,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   John knew she was a business owner but never asked her about
money, she said. The relationship was mostly platonic but did
involve some BDSM role playing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Lauralei said, the only red flag in her mind was
that he did not have an ad on the page where the two met. That,
however, seemed less important as they communicated.
</P>
<P>
   Her image of him _ drawn by John's words _ was of a loving
father who was divorced, a well-to-do businessman with a caring
heart who called to console her after her brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he was there, and I needed to lean on him. He was
supposed to be the strong one and...I should bring my problems to
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was early May, but for some reason, Lauralei said, she did
not respond. She said she appreciated his kind words, e-mail
letters and occasional phone calls but had no interest in pursuing
a cyberrelationship.
</P>
<P>
   He sent some more messages, but she did not answer them.
Eventually she deleted their three months of correspondence. She
did not give him much mind until June 11, when a detective from
Lenexa, Kan. _ a city she had never heard of _ called to ask why
her name appeared on Robinson's phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time she had connected Robinson _ the man
charged with five killings in Kansas City _ with the man she knew
as John. It seemed unreal until the detective asked her whether she
had any pictures. She remembered the digital images of John, clad
in Western attire.
</P>
<P>
   The Lenexa detective told her that her description of the
pictures sounded the same as those he had sent to several other
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until he told me about a picture, a photo, that
(Robinson) had sent to some of these other women that it dawned on
me who it was,'' she said. ``I just about dropped my teeth. I could
not believe it. It just really hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembered John telling her about a young woman who packed
up her belongings and left a college ``back East'' to live in
Kansas City to carry on a BDSM relationship with him. When the
student arrived, he was embarrassed by her appearance, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had the black lipstick, the piercing and this, that and
the other,'' Lauralei said. ``He was embarrassed of her, and when
they went out for dinner, he introduced her as a daughter of a
friend. According to him, he sent her back; he sent her away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She begged him to let her stay and said that she would learn
to do whatever he wanted her to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauralei read newspaper articles about Lewicka but said she
could not be sure she was the woman John was writing about.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said that Lewicka left Purdue University and
traveled to Kansas City because of her connection with Robinson.
Those who knew Lewicka in the Kansas City area said she dressed in
black apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Before she disappeared last fall, Lewicka told people that she
was married to an older man. In 1997 she applied for a marriage
license in Johnson County, Kan., with a John Anthony Robinson _ a
different middle name but the same birthdate as Robinson, who has
been married since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The computer site where John and Lauralei met has since been
disabled. The Webmaster for the site did not return phone calls or
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Lauralei has tried to retrieve John's e-mails, but the attempts
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   At least once in his messages, she said, John proposed that they
get together, but she had no desire to meet a stranger in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he always thought of me as being too strong-willed,''
she said. ``...I just really wasn't interested.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore's social security plan favored over Bush
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll out Saturday found voters support both Democrat
Al Gore and Republican George Bush each 45 percent, but more voters
favor Gore's ideas for changes in the social security system. The
random telephone survey of 750 adults found that while most
surveyed were not familiar with each candidates' specific plans for
social security changes, more respondents favored the vice
president's plan, 67 percent, to 51 percent for Bush. Only 18
percent knew Gore wants to create a supplemental savings program,
with workers allowed to put up to $2,000 a year in tax-deductible
savings with matching government contributions based on income.
Just 34 percent knew Bush would allow workers to invest some of
their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. The poll
has a 4 percentage points margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH CAMP LOOKING FOR RECORDS ON GUARD SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's campaign workers have concluded that no documents
exist showing he reported for duty as ordered in Alabama with the
Texas Air National Guard in 1972, and are searching for people who
might have served with him to verify his story. Dan Bartlett, a
Bush campaign spokesman, said last week he reviewed 200 pages of
documents from the National Guard's records but could not find
evidence of Bush's service. Bush has said he served in Montgomery,
Ala., while working on the unsuccessful Senate campaign of former
Postmaster General Winton Blount. However, on Friday Bush said he
doesn't recall what jobs he did. ``I can't remember what I did, but
I wasn't flying because they didn't have the same airplanes. I
fulfilled my obligations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON BRINGING IN BUCKS FOR DEMS
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is proving to be his party's most successful
and tireless rainmaker who has brought in an estimated $4.2 million
for Democratic candidates and the party's national convention
during the last four days. Friday night, Clinton helped raise
$500,000 during a Los Angeles fund-raiser. Saturday he raised $1.5
million at the home of Republican Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
before returning to the White House later Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   GOP ACCUSES KENTUCKY GOVERNOR OF `SOUR GRAPES'
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton says he has had enough
of Bush's campaigning in his state. ``Enough already,' Patton said
last weekend after Bush raised $1.7 million for his presidential
campaign and the GOP. Patton accused Bush of using ``strong-arm
tactics'' to get money from voters. ``This is unprecedented for a
presidential candidate to participate this way,'' said Patton who
wants to block Republicans from maintaining their 20-18 majority in
the Kentucky state senate. ``It just blows my mind.'' GOP state
chairwoman Ellen Williams replied that Patton is suffering from
``wacky sour grapes.'' Bush sent Patton a more pointed message:
``I'm coming. Get used to it. I'm going to come to your state as
many times as I feel like coming _ and win the vote.''

MARLINS NOT GOING `OUT OF BUSINESS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Baseball's biggest problem: finding a way to keep
small-market teams in contention while not ticking off large-market
teams that don't want to share the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Fire sales at the trading deadline have become a yearly watch,
and the rich have become richer.
</P>
<P>
   Things appeared so bad financially in Florida that Marlins
officials discussed dealing not only players who were eligible for
free agency but those who would be eligible for salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   However, manager John Boles tried to defuse the potential
crises. He went as far as to gather the team before a game to tell
them the club, which is hanging around .500 and entered Saturday
36-38, is not going to be dismantled near the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any decision that general manager Dave Dombrowski makes will
be in the best interest of this organization from a player-only
standpoint, not financial,'' Boles said. ``We are not going to lose
players because they're arbitration eligible - period. We are in
the business of getting better, and the people who are saying these
things are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, struggling to make ends meet and in search of a new
stadium that can produce the kind of revenue they believe they need
to keep the team in South Florida, have eight players eligible for
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Boles said Luis Castillo would be the Marlins' second baseman
next season and that Cliff Floyd, who's making $4.5 million this
season, won't be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just emphasizing the point that we are not going to make
wholesale changes with these players,'' Boles said. ``I wish
everybody would comprehend that that's not us anymore. If we start
getting rid of players because they're arbitration eligible, we
might as well hang a shingle on the door that says `out of
business,' and we're not out of business. And I should know
something about this, being the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough finish: Arizona might have to build a nice lead heading
into September if they're to win the National League West. Because
of weather and scheduling, the Diamondbacks will finish the season
with 27 games in 27 days. Six of those games are against the
Dodgers, eight are against San Francisco and four are with
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse come Sept. 15, when the Diamondbacks will play 18
games in 17 days without having a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the schedule came out, we knew that was going to be a
challenge,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said. ``Now even more
so. We've got to worry about June right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for help: One of the things that made Atlanta a playoff
team for the past decade is general manager John Schuerholz's
willingness to acquire a key player for the second half of the
season. With right-hander Kevin McGlinchy bothered by a stiff
shoulder, the Braves are putting feelers out for another starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can afford to wait,'' Schuerholz said. ``We do
enjoy a lead. If we were trying to close a gap on somebody, it
might be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Burned out on Valdes: It took the Chicago Cubs less than three
months to get tired of former Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes,
who is on the trade market as the Cubs look for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is 1-1 with a 5.40 ERA in eight starts, and he's been
plagued with injuries. First, it was a sore shoulder that enabled
Kerry Wood to return more quickly than expected. Lately, Valdes has
been yanked from starts because of a blister problem, which
prompted Cubs general manager Ed Lynch to quip: ``He has very dry
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is a free agent after the season, but the Cubs haven't
even talked about extending his contract. Meanwhile, Valdes has
told people close to him he wouldn't mind pitching in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   A must-see: There is a can't-miss moment that could take place
Thursday, as long as John Rocker's pitches don't continue to follow
the same path as his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   For all the punishment handed out by baseball and fans and shear
comeuppance from his continuous moronic and ignorant statements,
Rocker will get the ultimate punishment when Atlanta travels to New
York to face the Mets.

DUCKS PICK SMIRNOV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Russia, with love. . . . And some high hopes and a little
finger-crossing thrown in, for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks president and general manager Pierre Gauthier did
his NHL Entry Draft Day shopping in Calgary on Saturday. However,
the stock concerns, and, perhaps, the organization's future
check-writing duties, were squarely focused on eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier and the Mighty Ducks selected 18-year-old Russian left
wing Alexei Smirnov with the 12th overall pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   A couple hours following Smirnov's selection, Gauthier traded
his third, fourth, and fifth-round picks to the Montreal Canadiens
in exchange for the Canadiens second-round selection (44th
overall). With that pick, Gauthier snagged Russian goalie Ilja
Bryzgalov, a 6-foot-3, 196-pound talent who recently turned 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the line, these are both first-line players,'' Gauthier
said from Calgary. ``But both of these kids are young and need time
to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Smirnov was predictable, yet risky.
</P>
<P>
   The upside most certainly is there with Smirnov, who possesses a
left- handed shot. He has size, strength, breakaway speed, vision,
and grit. Those reasons, and several others, are why Gauthier
selected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great talent!'' Gauthier said. ``We're very happy and
very excited. When you look at this kid, you think he is ready to
play in the NHL. When he is on his game, he is the best (skill
player) of anyone in this draft. But he's young.''
</P>
<P>
   With the upside also comes a downside. And Smirnov has some
issues in the minds of scouts throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he has tons of ability,'' one scout told The
Hockey News recently. ``I don't know if there's another prospect
who has as much potential. But I wonder about his drive.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Smirnov was believed to be a legitimate Top 5
pick. However, subpar showings at the Five Nations Tournament in
February and at the Under-18 World Tournament in Switzerland left
once-drooling scouts shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   And those facts, the questions regarding Smirnov's work ethic,
appeared to enter into play on Draft Day, at least as far as one
team was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Blackhawks took Russian forwards Mikhail Yakubov
(10th overall) and Pavel Yorobiev (11th) just ahead of the Ducks'
first-round pick. And it should be noted that Blackhawks GM Mike
Smith is one of the league's best at spotting European talent,
especially those who come from Russia. Smith also took a timeout
before making his two back-to-back picks, apparently to ponder the
thought of selecting Smirnov.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 211-pound Smirnov, who speaks little English,
addressed that issue 30 minutes after being selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have the desire to play in the NHL,'' he said
through an interpeter, ``I wouldn't be here wearing a Mighty Ducks
jersey and talking to you on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryzgalov enters the picture with an apparent clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   He is a big goalie, at 6-3, with quick reflexes, a good glove
hand, and he has a knack for challenging shooters. He is a very
calm and focused worker who has a stand-up style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted this kid,'' Gauthier said. ``When the scouts
saw him (in the Junior Worlds), the reports were he went
head-to-head with (No. 1 overall pick Rick) DiPietro (of the New
York Islanders).''
</P>
<P>
   Both Smirnov and Bryzgalov, Gauthier reminds, are still young
and in the developmental stages. Both are unlikely to see Anaheim
ice this season and, at present, Smirnov's timetable to the NHL
appears to be more lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   The first three rounds were completed in Calgary on Saturday,
with the Ducks, following their draft day deal with Montreal,
making just the two selections.
</P>
<P>
   Rounds four through nine will be completed today. Anaheim has a
fourth-round pick, two fifth-round picks, a sixth- and a
seventh-round pick today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try and hit a home run again,'' Gauthier said.
``We are going to try and steal more good players, so don't go and
call the cops.''

FREE-SWINGING JONES HURT BY INCONSISTENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jacque Jones' presence on the Minnesota Twins
roster creates a daily dilemma for manager Tom Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   At 25 years old, Jones, a former USC standout, has enough power
to bat cleanup, enough speed to bat leadoff and just enough
discipline at the plate to avoid being put on the next plane to
Triple-A Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacque's getting better,'' Kelly said, ``but he sometimes gets
a little out of whack and swings at some pitches trying to hit the
ball over the fence. Sometimes he tries to do a little bit too
much, instead of just trying to keep himself under control and
putting the ball in play with a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just natural for a lot of young people who try to do a
little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the statistics confirms why Kelly discusses his center
fielder with equal parts enthusiasm and criticism. Jones, in his
first full year in the majors, went into Saturday's game against
the Anaheim Angels with a .314 batting average and a team-high 10
home runs, but in 239 at-bats, he had struck out 47 times compared
to only 11 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 5-foot-10, 176-pound left-hander, stands far away from
the plate, near the outer edge of the batter's box, and keeps his
feet as far from each other as possible, but his batting stance
isn't a problem. Jones doesn't disagree with Kelly's assertion that
he might be trying too hard but shrugs off the idea that he needs
to be more disciplined at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am what I am right now,'' said Jones, who has alternated
between the No. 1 and No. 9 spots in the lineup because of his
inconsistency. ``I'll become better, and maybe I'll fit into the
lineup better, but right now I'm a free swinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to swing the bat, and I need to get to the point where
I'm aggressive but not over-aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever growing pains Jones must deal with are not caused by a
lack of effort. Less than 15 minutes after his arrival Friday at
Edison Field, Jones grabbed a bat and rushed to the underground
batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was on to the field, where Jones waited
impatiently next to the cage for the group of players ahead of him
to finish, so he could jump in and start swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of working and learning, getting a lot of
at-bats,'' said Jones, who played for the Trojans from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Twins hope, Jones' hard work will make him a
more consistent hitter. The home run numbers won't be as prolific,
but neither will the strikeout numbers. The towering fly balls,
which now alternately land in the bleachers or in an outfielder's
glove, will more often turn into line-drive doubles or triples.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot to learn about this game,'' Kelly said, ``but
he's getting better every day. He has a lot of ability, he has a
live body, he's got enthusiasm to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets a little too brave about what he's doing, but he's
doing fine, and I wish I could trade places with him because he's
going to have a long career in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Jones' improvement is that Kelly is now more
comfortable starting him against left-handers, even though Jones
hovers around the .250 mark against lefties. Since the Twins are a
young team, already long since out of playoff contention, Jones has
a chance to work out his problems at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just experience, and I'm working on having a good at-bat
every time out, and not giving away at-bats,'' Jones said. ``By
now, I've seen all the pitching staffs we face, and I pretty much
know what they're going to try to do, so it's just a matter of me
making adjustments, and then things will be better.''

TIME TO SIZE UP NEW BALLPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Dear baseball fan, which of the following would
you rather watch?
</P>
<P>
   A) A late inning, one out, runners on first and second, batting
team trails by two. A drive to left-center. Left fielder is away at
the crack of the bat, angles over and back with the speed and grace
of a gazelle, dives at the edge of the warning track but just
misses a heroic catch. Ball long-hops the wall. Center fielder
alertly backs up his mate, plays the carom on a sprint, spins and
heaves a bull's-eye to the shortstop, the cutoff man. First runner
scores. Second responds to the third-base coach's gyrations
signaling ``go'' and storms toward the plate. Shortstop whirls,
makes the split-second calculation he can prevent the tying run,
and fires a one-hopper to the catcher, who braces for a
bone-cracking collision. Runner cleverly loops behind him and slaps
the plate with his outstretched left hand a moment before the tag
comes down on his shoulder. Catcher jumps to his feet in a cloud of
dust and throws to third too late to prevent the sliding batter
from putting the go-ahead run 90 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   B) Same situation, and a guy with forearms the size of a trophy
halibut socks the ball into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Which of those would you find more exciting, more intriguing,
more !ital!baseball!off!? Sorry if this seems to be a leading
question.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, your answer is A). The people who run
baseball appear to think we prefer B).
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the ballparks they build.
</P>
<P>
   Up the freeway from San Diego came news this week that the
Padres' plans for a new downtown ballpark include a center-field
fence 396 feet from home plate. The club received permission from
the commissioner's office to shave 4 feet off what is supposed to
be regulation size for straight-away center in a major-league park.
</P>
<P>
   The fence itself will be as low as 4 feet tall in left field and
as high as 12 feet in another spot. It will be 7 feet tall around
most of the field - ``allowing for spectacular, leaping, home
run-robbing catches,'' Padres president Larry Lucchino declared.
``In the future, you may see some of baseball's most dramatic,
thrilling and fascinating plays occur in San Diego's little
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. The right-center-field alley is designed to go 411
feet, and straightaway right will be a healthy 382. But
straightaway left will be only 367 and there will be a ``Home Run
Porch'' in right. It sounds as if Lucchino's definitions of
``dramatic, thrilling and fascinating'' relies heavily on the long
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that if you wanted dramatic, thrilling and
fascinating, you'd build ballparks bigger, not smaller.
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing as somebody who doesn't mind baseball's scoring
explosion - a 10-9 game can be just as tense, often more so, than a
2-1 game - but gets tired of all the home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else being equal, I'd rather see a batter rounding
second and trying for a triple than watch a ball flying over a
fence. A double or triple puts more skills of more players on
display and raises the drama for the next hitter. But while the
number of home runs was rocketing up in the 1990s, the number of
triples was stagnant, the league leaders' average (13.2 in the
American League, 14.0 in the National) reflecting a decline from
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   We keep hearing that home runs have increased in part because
players are better athletes - taller, better fed, fitter, more
scientifically coached. Yet what has baseball done to encourage
players to show off not only their strength but also their legs,
gloves and arms?
</P>
<P>
   The Padres president's vision of ``spectacular, leaping, home
run-robbing catches'' above a 7-foot-tall fence is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   I can catch a ball above a 7-foot fence 367 feet from the plate.
(I can also dunk on a 7-foot basket, thank you.)
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular plays are the result of outfielders having to cover
a lot of ground and to make throws. Think of Willie Mays' catch off
Vic Wertz in the 1954 World Series, 450 feet from home plate at the
Polo Grounds, and Al Gionfriddo's catch off Joe DiMaggio in the
1947 Series, back- back-back-back-back in Yankee Stadium's old
461-foot left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a call to bring back the Polo Grounds, or uproot the
Dodger Stadium bleachers and move the fences back 30 feet. It is a
wish that the next stadium architect would grasp the value of
keeping the ball in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody gets it: The Detroit Tigers' Comerica Park goes 420
feet to dead center, 398 and 380 to the power alleys, and 345 and
330 down the lines. It's a refreshing change from the trend
reflected in this year's other new parks in San Francisco (307 from
the plate to the water down the right-field line) and Houston (362
to left-center). Detroit's is the second-roomiest outfield in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The roomiest belongs to the Colorado Rockies' Coors Field (347
and 350 down the lines, 415 to center). The bad news about Coors is
that although it was built that way to compensate for the light air
at mile-high elevation, it's the easiest place in the major leagues
to hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The good news about Coors Field is that the huge outfield also
makes it one of the easiest places to hit a triple, a double or,
for that matter, a single. Balls drop in. Balls shoot through the
gaps. Outfielders have to make plays. Batters have to run the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Move it to sea level and Coors Field might be the greatest
ballpark of them all. Now, where can San Diego find a really big
moving van?
</P>

KINGS GIVE FROLOV EARLY BIRTHDAY GIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the 20th overall pick in Saturday's NHL entry draft, the
Los Angeles Kings selected Russian left-winger Alexander Frolov,
who turns 18 today.
</P>
<P>
   Frolov played in 36 games last season with Yaroslav 2 of the
Russian Division 2 League and recorded 40 points (27-13  &QC;  40) and
30 penalty minutes. He also helped Russia
win a silver medal in this year's under-18 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   In six games during that tournament, Frolov scored five goals.
He also had three goals in four games in the Five Nations
Tournament, a major international event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexander Frolov brings a little bit of everything to the
table,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said Saturday from
Calgary, site of the draft. ``He has very good size, he is a good
skater, and he has scoring ability when he gets in tight around the
net. He also has a good reach and sees the ice well. We really like
the complete package we see in Alexander.''
</P>
<P>
   Frolov was the first of three players chosen Saturday by the
Kings. The draft will resume today with the fourth through ninth
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   With their second pick and 54th overall, the Kings took
defenseman Andreas Lilja, 24, who played 49 games last season with
Malmo of the Swedish Elite League. At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, Lilja
logged 88 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Their third selection was center Yanick Lehoux (86th overall).
Lehoux, 18, played 66 games for Baie-Comeau of the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League. He recorded 31 goals and 92 points.

IN SAN FRANCISCO, MORE LIVE _ AND DIE _ ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to fix stat in 4th graf: 290 is correct, sted 275)  
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carmen Ramirez knew people. Born and bred in
Managua, Nicaragua, she adopted San Francisco like a doting mother,
protecting and fighting for her neighborhood in a way that captured
the ear of City Hall. But she lived alone and died last month the
same way. By the time anyone noticed her absence, she had been
dead, at age 54, for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Lola McKay knew people too. McKay, an 83-year-old widow, became
a symbol for tenants' rights when she refused to leave her
apartment on 30 days' notice. For eight years, she was the last
tenant in a six-unit building in San Francisco's gentrifying
Mission District. Her case prompted a change in state law,
requiring that landlords give elderly and disabled tenants a year's
notice before eviction.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, died as she lived. Her body was discovered in March,
weeks after her death. And so it was with Howard Phillips, 50, who
was known on the streets as Allah, a man on close terms with the
bottle. In March he died in his small housing authority apartment
from complications of alcoholism. His body was not discovered until
it was in an advanced state of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the bodies are piling up faster than the city
can handle them. More people are dying alone, with no one to
arrange their funerals, settle their estates or mourn their
passing. So far this year, 290 people in the city have died this
way, said city officials, compared with about 300 a year for the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly why. Officials here say it is too soon to
tell whether this is a sign of times to come, here and in the rest
of the aging nation. (Officials in New York and Los Angeles report
no such increase in the number of people dying alone.)
</P>
<P>
   But census figures reveal part of the story. In San Francisco,
19 percent of the population is over 65, compared with 14 percent
in other major cities. The city has an average household size of
1.29 people, well below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a high number of people whose partners have died of
AIDS. San Francisco, boomtown that it is, is also a place where
poor, old people are facing what the public administrator, the
official responsible for settling the estates of those who die
alone, calls ``urban stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of old people worried that they're going to be
evicted from the apartment they've lived in for 30 years,'' said
Ricardo Hernandez, the public administrator. The old people have
heard all the stories of even well-to-do people unable to find an
apartment in the city's surreal, Silicon Valley-fueled housing
market. ``We think that at least in some cases, this is shortening
people's lives,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people dying alone is climbing as more homeless
people have been dying on the streets of San Francisco over the
last five years. Last year, 169 homeless people died on the
streets, and so far this year, 78 of the 290 people who have died
alone were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that more people are living, and dying, on
the streets, as affordable housing throughout the San Francisco Bay
area becomes harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   When indigent people die alone, the medical examiner arranges
for their cremation, unless the person was known to belong to a
religion that dictates that the body be buried. Basic funerals and
a plot in Colma, a town south of San Francisco where many city
residents are buried (the city has no cemeteries), cost $7,000;
cremations generally cost about $700.
</P>
<P>
   When the deceased leaves even minimal assets, the public
administrator handles the funeral arrangements and begins a
sometimes long process of searching for next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes bodies lie for months in the city morgue as officials
search for heirs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Carmen Ramirez, whose cause of death is still
being determined, officials found several relatives in the Bay
area, who arranged for her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   That is the exception. The public administrator said his office
was often left scrambling to find a relative _ any relative, no
matter how remote _ to decide where and how a deceased person would
be buried and where the person's belongings would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remind everybody to leave a will,'' Rodriguez said,
``if it's just a little note on a piece of paper that says I want
so-and-so to have my china.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a room marked ``vault,'' with boxes of personal papers
belonging to those whose families have not yet been found. The
boxes, piled floor to ceiling on metal shelves, contain the sum
total of many lives _ diplomas, yearbooks, military certificates,
photo albums, love letters, Christmas cards. The county saves them
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold onto them,'' said John Clark, deputy to the public
administrator, as he sighed over a weathered black-and-white photo,
at least 50 years old, of a boy kneeling next to a wire-haired
terrier, ``because maybe some relative somewhere will value the
memories.''

IRVING LICHTENSTEIN, PIONEER IN HERNIA SURGERY, DIES AT 80
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Irving L. Lichtenstein, who transformed hernia surgery from
an operation requiring hospitalization and long recuperation into
an uncomplicated outpatient procedure, died June 11 at his home in
Marina del Rey, Calif. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein announced his new procedure in 1964, to the dismay
of many in the medical establishment. For a century before that,
surgeons had regarded the repair of hernias, which occur when
tissues protrude through a weakened area of muscle wall, as a
straightforward, not especially interesting procedure with a basic
technique hardly worth revisiting.
</P>
<P>
   A patient was admitted to the hospital and, on the day of
surgery, given general anesthesia. A surgeon made an incision into
the appropriate area of the abdomen and sewed the tear back
together with sutures designed not to dissolve. The patient stayed
in the hospital as long as a week and was then sent home, forbidden
to work, for about two months. The thinking was that if the patient
exerted himself too soon, the tear would recur.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein, however, said that both the prolonged bed rest and
the general anesthesia were unnecessary _ and that the anesthesia
was even counterproductive. To prove this point, he insisted that
many of his patients walk away from the table after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad loved drama,'' his daughter Leslie Lichtenstein of Los
Angeles said. ``That was dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein, who was long active in the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California, also loved a good battle,
and he got one when he stood in front of a thousand doctors
attending an American Medical Association meeting in San Francisco
in 1964 and told them they were handling hernia patients all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 article in a magazine published by Lichtenstein's alma
mater, MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine in Pennsylvania,
recounted how he had been peppered by angry questions at the
meeting. When Lichtenstein's time was up, the program director,
eager to get things rolling again, suggested that those who still
had questions take them into the hallway. Hundreds did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Lichtenstein remembered. ``So many people
followed. Physicians were shouting questions at me, criticizing me,
challenging me. There was a great deal of confusion and
disorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Lichtenstein had done little, at least initially, to
change the basic way hernias were treated. With some minor
modifications, like using a stronger suture material, he was
performing a 100-year-old technique developed by Edoardo Bassini,
an Italian surgeon. It was on the question of how long patients
needed to recover that he broke new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exploded the myth of not letting the patient do any
physical activity for two months,'' said Dr. Parviz K. Amid,
director of the Lichtenstein Hernia Institute, which was founded in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein focused on hernia operations only after becoming
interested in the broader issue of how wounds heal.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, while he was teaching at UCLA Medical School
and working at what is now known as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, he
watched as a gallbladder patient he had just sewn up began to retch
violently. Remarkably, the incision did not reopen, and
Lichtenstein began to wonder about the reliability of the
information he and untold others had been given about wound
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years, Lichtenstein established that in
animals, a properly sutured tear immediately regained 70 percent of
its strength, and that what mattered most was how it was sewn up
and what material was used. To test his ideas on humans, he settled
on hernia patients, since their injuries were generally confined to
the tear itself. He used local instead of general anesthesia so
that the patients would be able to follow his instructions on the
table; he would have them cough, for example, to test the strength
of the repair.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lichtenstein reported high success rates, it took years
for his practices to be widely adopted. It was only about two
decades later, in part because of pressure from managed care to
control costs, that they became truly widespread. Outpatient
treatment for hernias is now normal practice; almost a million of
the procedures are performed each year, mostly on men.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lichtenstein worked to refine the surgery,
devising simpler suture techniques and using mesh screens to reduce
the risk of the hernia's recurring.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein's practice was in Beverly Hills. He stopped
operating about 18 years ago, as a result of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Lester Lichtenstein was born on Feb. 21, 1920, in
Philadelphia. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania
before attending Hahnemann. In addition to his daughter Leslie, he
is survived by his wife, Lisa, and three daughters: Nancy, of Los
Angeles, Patricia Bisch of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Joanne
Lichtenstein of Mill Valley, Calif. His marriage to the former
Billie Ruth Herskowitz, the mother of his children, ended in
divorce.

PAUL GRIFFIN, 62, SESSION PIANIST FOR A MULTITUDE OF POP MUSICIANS
</HEADLINE>
  By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Griffin, a pianist and organist whose
gospel-charged style made him one of New York City's top studio
musicians, died on June 14 at his home in the Bronx. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause seemed to be a heart attack, said his wife, Mary Beth.
Griffin also suffered from diabetes and was told last year that he
needed a liver transplant; he was awaiting one when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin played for thousands of recording sessions. He was a
keyboardist on Bob Dylan's albums ``Highway 61 Revisited'' and
``Blonde on Blonde''; Steely Dan's albums ``The Royal Scam,''
``Aja'' and ``Gaucho''; Don McLean's ``American Pie''; the Isley
Brothers' ``Twist and Shout''; Aretha Franklin's ``Think''; the
Shirelles' ``Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?''; and on all the
albums Burt Bacharach and Hal David made with Dionne Warwick. His
tack piano is heard in ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some musicians who are hacks,'' Donald Fagen of
Steely Dan once said, ``and then there are guys like Paul who can
create something so different and unique they  &UR; make &LR;  the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was born in Harlem and learned to play by sitting in the
first pew at Paradise Baptist Church and watching the hands of the
pianist. When the pianist died, he was her replacement.
</P>
<P>
   He studied classical music at the High School of Music and Art
and played first viola in the All-City Orchestra; he was also an
usher and occasional accompanist at the Apollo Theater. The
saxophonist King Curtis heard him there and offered him his first
professional tour and recording dates.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of touring with King Curtis, Griffin and other
members of the band turned to New York recording sessions in 1960;
he became a member of the house band at Scepter Records. He also
worked for the producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and Bert
Berns and Jerry Ragovoy, backing such singers as Solomon Burke,
Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters, Erma Franklin, and Van Morrison in
his first American sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin became a vital part of folk-rock in his 1965-66 sessions
with Dylan. He also played organ or piano for Paul Simon; Peter,
Paul and Mary; Ian and Sylvia; Eric Andersen; Tom Rush; Carly
Simon; and John Denver. In the mid-1970s, he began a long
association with Steely Dan; he received a writing credit on ``The
Fez,'' and his voice is heard scat-singing on ``Peg.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, when there was less session work in New York,
Griffin taught, arranged and recorded commercial jingles. He played
organ on Fagen's 1993 solo album, ``Kamakiriad.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters,
Shannon and Rebecca, and two sons, Kinalla and Ioayo.

JONES TAKES BIG LEAP AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Marion Jones is quickly returning to her greatest
asset - speed - to improve her chances for an unprecedented five
gold medals in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the two-time defending world 100-meter champion
sailed to a season-best 22 feet, 10 inches to win the long jump,
her weakest event, in the Prefontaine Classic at the University of
Oregon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Thousand Oaks High graduate won the 100 meters in a
wind-aided 10.93 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, who hopes to compete in the 100, 200, long jump and
400 as well as the 1,600 relays in the Olympics, has struggled in
the long jump after switching the emphasis of her long-jump
training from speed to technique.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who jumped 23-11 two years ago, went only 20-7 in her
season opener in Osaka, Japan, in May. Competing on her home track
at North Carolina State last Saturday, Jones could manage only two
21-6 efforts to place second to training partner Chandra Sturrup of
the Bahamas at the Pontiac Grand Prix Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot more aggressive, and I went for it today,'' Jones
said. ``I think it is a step in the right direction. It was night
and day compared to here and Osaka. I had nothing to hold me back.
I had been thinking about technique and too many things going
through my head. Today, I just ran and jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones opened the competition with her winning effort and jumped
21-11 and wind-aided marks of 21-9 and 21-11 on her second, third
and fourth attempts, respectively. Jones fouled on her last two
jumps. All of her jumps surpassed those of Shana Williams, who was
second at 21-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is I popped off a good one,'' Jones said.
``It was not the best of the series, but I was excited I could come
back after the 100 and pop one off. I feel a lot better than I have
in the past on the runway. My speed without a doubt is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene did little to detract from
their upcoming duel in the 200 in next month's U.S. Olympic Trials
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the defending Olympic 200 and 400 champion and world
record holder in both events, won the 400 in 43.92 for the world's
fastest time of the year. Greene, the world 100 record holder who
captured the 200 in the 1999 world championships in Johnson's
absence, sped to victory in the 200 in a wind-aided 19.93.
</P>
<P>
   World women's 5,000 champion Gabriela Szabo of Romania produced
a world-leading 4:00.73 to nip Suzy Favor Hamilton by
six-hundredths of a second after overcoming a 15-meter deficit off
the final turn in her first appearance in the U.S. since the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time world 100 hurdle champion and 1992 and 1996 Olympic
100 champion Gail Devers won the 100 hurdles in 12.64 for the
world's No. 2 mark to start her quest for her fourth Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jones, however, who captured the most attention in the
100, debuting a full-length hooded ``Swift Suit'' that she will
wear in the Olympics. It is designed to improve performance by
aerodynamics and maintaining warm muscle temperature.
</P>
<P>
   While flashy, the Nike outfit did little Saturday to help Jones.
Jones called her start ``horrible'' and never found her rhythm.
However, Jones was never challenged by runner-up and former USC
standout Torri Edwards (11.09) or Peta-Gaye Dowdie of Louisiana
State and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``My transition was not very good, but I am strong enough I can
pull it out in the end,'' Jones said. ``A 10.93 for me is a jog.
There are some things I need to correct. But I am a technician when
it comes to the 100, and I can put the race together when I have
to. I am much more excited about my jumping today. I am just
waiting for a meet where I can be happy with both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will get only one more chance in the Golden Gala meet in
Rome in her final competition before the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Jones, who moved to fourth on the yearly, global long jump list
with her performance Saturday, will face world leader Fiona May of
Italy in the long jump and compete in the 100 in the June 30 Golden
League meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the Europeans will make a big deal of it,'' Jones
said. ``(May) has been jumping very far. I thrive on competition. I
just think I need more competitions under my belt against the best
and I'll be OK.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

a gall bladder infection and cancer, said Nancy Smith Hall, a
family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Liebler spent much of his 44-year career writing and lecturing
on the treatment of injured athletes and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important achievements was the development in
1988 of a minimally invasive laser procedure for relieving pain
caused by some kinds of spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1979, Liebler, who calculated that by then he
had treated more than 6,000 dance-related injuries, said that one
of the greatest difficulties in treating dancers was overcoming
their reluctance to reveal the extent of their injuries and pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is so great,'' he said, ``many dancers don't
want anyone to know about their injury. They don't want to be
sidelined. Many times, we don't see injuries until they become
major.''
</P>
<P>
   His prescription for preventing injuries included knowing one's
limitations, practicing enough so that steps or plays become second
nature, getting excellent instruction, doing warm-up exercises and
eating and sleeping properly.
</P>
<P>
   William Amend Liebler was born on April 6, 1924, in New York
City. He graduated from Upsala College in East Orange, N.J., in
1950 and received his medical degree from New York Medical College
in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He was long affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital as an attending
orthopedic surgeon, and was affiliated with St. Luke's Hospital,
Metropolitan Hospital and New York Medical College in Valhalla,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Liebler is survived by his wife, Katherine Lyndell Liebler; his
two children, Michael Amend Liebler of Bronxville and Cynthia
Liebler Saari of Woodstock, Conn.; two sisters, Georgia Liebler
Porter of the Bronx and Barbara Liebler Quentin of South Salem,
N.Y.; and a grandson.

JOSHUA MYRON, ZIONIST WHO FOUGHT THE TURKS, DIES AT 102 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joshua Myron, one of the last of the camel-mounted
Zionist brigade that fought with Vladimir Jabotinsky against Turkey
in Palestine during World War I, died in Manhattan on June 8. He
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   With the outbreak of World War I, Jabotinsky, then a Russian
journalist, realized that the Ottoman Empire was likely to lose to
the British and that it would pay for the Zionist settlers in
Israel to back the winning side. He spread the idea of forming a
Jewish Brigade, sometimes called the Jewish Legion, to fight beside
the British.
</P>
<P>
   The British army unit, which recruited Jews from both the Middle
East and Europe, used camels to move from front to front, and Myron
rose to become company sergeant in charge of transport.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade is believed to have contributed significantly to the
British war effort, and Jabotinsky believed its aid was a major
factor in winning the Balfour Declaration of 1917, in which Britain
announced support for a Jewish national home in Palestine. ``Half
the Balfour Declaration belongs to the Legion,'' Jabotinsky wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other members of the brigade was David Ben-Gurion,
later the first prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Myron was born at Rishon Lezion, the first officially Zionist
settlement in Palestine, and devoted his life first to battling for
a Jewish homeland, then to supporting Israel after its
establishment in 1948. After emigrating to New York and becoming a
pharmacist, he remained active in raising arms and money for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Myron's father, Feivel Miransky, left Russia with a group of
pioneers called the Biluim to go to Palestine as one of the
founders of Rishon Lezion. Jews already lived in Palestine, but had
not banded together in settlements in support of the Zionist ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement of Rishon and other Zionist towns was financed by
Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who established a large vineyard there.
Miransky set up a carriage service to link Rishon with Jaffa, which
became Tel Aviv. At the time, the trip took more than two hours on
a sandy, muddy road.
</P>
<P>
   Myron was born on Aug. 17, 1897, into a frontier existence. His
grandson Marc Lubin told of the time some of Myron's father's
horses were stolen when he was 16. He reported the theft to the
police and was told he was on his own. He ended up crossing the
Jordan River and taking his horses back.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Myron decided to move to the United States. He
immediately experienced what he regarded as a stinging insult and a
great inconvenience when the British refused to grant him traveling
papers, saying he was officially a Turkish subject. So, officially
at least, he arrived in America as a Turk.
</P>
<P>
   He had intended to study veterinary medicine at Columbia
University but the school was not accepting new students at that
time. He studied pharmacy at Albany College of Pharmacy. While
there, he married Sybil Berkowitz, who died in 1973. In the early
1930s, they returned to Palestine, where their daughter, Naomi
Scheurer, was born. She now lives in Manhattan; Myron is also
survived by three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Myrons moved to Suffern, N.Y. Myron commuted to
Manhattan, where he owned two Midtown pharmacies.

PORTRAITS OF SOUTHERN LIVES SHOW A RECORD OF PAIN AND PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Observer)  
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who knew the South during the days of de jure
segregation, The New York Times' series on race in America
describes a world of routine social interaction that could be
imagined only by rebels, visionaries and dreamers _ almost all of
them black _ from the vantage point of, say, Birmingham in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   As the series shows, the new multiracial society announced into
our national consciousness by the break-through victories of the
Southern civil rights movement is not free of economic and cultural
tensions, of mistrust and plain old prejudice. The series documents
that no part of America, North or South, East or West, has fully
created what U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia calls ``the beloved
community.''
</P>
<P>
   It also shows that what was once viewed as a regional story told
in black and white is now national in scope and multi-ethnic in
content.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, I found that three articles set in my native
South stirred a desire to bear witness to the persistence of some
distinctly regional themes in this broad narrative about race in
America's new century. For example, it seemed especially
appropriate to me that the series began with Kevin Sack's story on
June 4 about an integrated Pentecostal congregation in suburban
Atlanta. Think of the historical convergence in that setting and
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was the spiritual capital of the Confederate South, the
intellectual home of the New South economic-development movement,
and the command center of the civil rights revolution and the black
preachers who led it. The centrality of the black church to racial
transformation in America can hardly be overstated. Martin Luther
King Jr. and his colleagues forged the stories of Moses and Jesus
into mighty social weapons. Nor can the failure of the white church
in the South be overstated. Its preachers stood in fearful silence.
Its congregants tried to ignore the inner voices insisting that
belief in the gospels allowed but one response to segregation.
While Sack's reporting found that the Assembly of God Tabernacle
may not have perfected the beloved community, its members' effort
to do so, within the twin shadows of Stone Mountain and Ebenezer
Baptist Church, seems to me apt and momentous.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer's most famous pastor, King, had a special genius for
defining the links between economic oppression and racial conflict.
His lessons in that regard came to mind when I read Charlie
LeDuff's article on June 16 about the black, white, Mexican and
Native-American work force at the Smithfield Packing Co.'s plant in
Tar Heel, N.C. For generations, Northern industrial corporations
treated the South as a colonial enterprise. They used black-white
tensions to keep out unions and fattened their profits through a
two-tiered wage system _ low pay for whites, lower still for
blacks. In comparison, tenant farmers enjoyed a kind of rough
parity. The crop-lien system kept blacks and whites equally
impoverished, although blacks could be hanged as well as starved.
</P>
<P>
   But whether in the factory or on the farm, Southern workers were
schooled to understand a brutal financial fact. If you will not
take this harsh, low-paying, dead-end job, some other hungry person
will.
</P>
<P>
   What is taking place in North Carolina shows that in the
Southern industrial environment, change does not always bring
progress. The tough-minded employer in Tar Heel is a Southern firm.
Mexican immigrants have replaced blacks and Appalachian whites as
the workers willing to take the lowest wages with the fewest
complaints. And according to LeDuff's reporting, there is still
truth to King's teaching that the competition among poor people for
grinding jobs brews frustrations that are expressed through racial
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far piece from Tar Heel to Natchitoches, La., where
Ginger Thompson reported on the effort to preserve Magnolia
Plantation. That article last Thursday reminded me of perhaps the
greatest scholarly lesson of the last half-century of race
relations in the Southern region and the country at large. That
lesson is simply that we may more accurately speak of American
``histories,'' rather than a single, monolithic American history.
From Colonial Williamsburg to Acadian Louisiana, most preservation
efforts have focused on the big house and celebrating the lives of
its inhabitants. At Williamsburg and later at Magnolia, a National
Park Service ranger named Carla Cowles worked to add the buildings
and human histories of the slave quarter to the story of the big
house.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's article is too complex to summarize here, but the
resonant quote with which it ended lingers in recollection as a
comment on a broad swath of social experience. That experience has
consisted of remarkable levels of social integration in places like
the Atlanta church, new levels of intellectual honesty about the
past in Natchitoches and, less happily, a persistence of obdurate
patterns in Tar Heel and many other places as well. Betty Hertzog,
the 70-year-old owner of Magnolia Plantation, spoke of moving away
from a property that has been in her family for 200 years. She
would depart knowing, of course, that Magnolia Plantation will be
used to teach a version of Southern history far more complex than
that associated with the traditional plantation ``tours'' of
decades past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be that it was hard to leave this old place,'' Hertzog
said. ``But now it's harder and harder to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Something similar might be said about race relations in America
today. As The Times' series documents, those relations are full of
tension at both the philosophical and quotidian levels. But for
millions of Americans of all colors, staying in the old place was
not, in the end, a tolerable possibility.

<P>
   &UR; JEM (AND SAM) &LR;  By Ferdinand Mount. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95. This
novel of Restoration London is about a drinking buddy of Samuel
Pepys (and possibly the author's ancestor) who struggles mightily
to overcome his envy of Pepys' career, connections and wife. The
result is ``a brilliant pastiche of 17th-century prose'' in which
``the historical detail feels rich and accurate,'' Michael Upchurch
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMBRACING DEFEAT: Japan in the Wake of World War II &LR;  By John W.
Dower. Norton/New Press, $15.95. A historian assesses the impact of
the Allied occupation of Japan between 1945 and 1952 on modern
Japanese history. His nuanced account, which won a Pulitzer Prize
and a National Book Award, dissects the pretensions and practices
of the operation, as well as the ambiguities, bad policy-making and
bureaucratic bungling of the period. He finds much to praise and to
deplore in the occupation's legacy. Last year in The New York Times
Book Review, J.A.A. Stockwin called this ``a magisterial and
beautifully written book'' that includes ``many amazing documentary
photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WOMAN WHO CUT OFF HER LEG AT THE MAIDSTONE CLUB: And Other
Stories &LR;  By Julia Slavin. John Macrae/Picador USA, $12. These tales
of suburbia and the fears and self-destructive impulses underlying
family commitments are infused with the grotesque: One woman grows
teeth all over her body, while another swallows the yard worker she
lusts after. ``Slavin's uncluttered, room-temperature prose renders
the monstrous familiar, even beautiful,'' Charles Taylor wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNGRY OCEAN: A Swordboat Captain's Journey &LR;  By Linda
Greenlaw. Hyperion, $14. A female fisherman (not a fisherwoman, she
insists) describes her grueling seafaring life and her many voyages
off the Atlantic coast. ``It is a story of triumph, of a woman not
only making it but succeeding at the highest level in one of the
most male-dominated and most dangerous professions,'' Douglas
Whynott wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONE VOYAGER: The Extraordinary Adventures of Howard Blackburn,
Hero Fisherman of Gloucester &LR; , by Joseph E. Garland
(Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13), tells of a sailor who survived
for five days alone in an open dory during a winter storm off
Newfoundland in 1883 by allowing his hands to freeze to the oars as
he pulled for land. This account of his ordeal (he lost all his
fingers) and his subsequent exploits is told with ``scrupulous
detail and much narrative skill,'' Henry Beetle Hough wrote in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDISCOVERED CHEKHOV: Forty-Three New Stories &LR;  By Anton
Chekhov. Translated by Peter Constantine. Seven Stories, $16.95. By
the time he was 26, Chekhov had published more than 400 stories and
vignettes in popular Russian magazines. This collection of early
tales, which has been reissued with five additional stories, is a
``delightful compilation,'' Donald Fanger wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDNIGHT CHAMPAGNE &LR;  By A. Manette Ansay. Harper Perennial, $13.
This novel explores the thwarted romantic lives of guests at the
Wisconsin wedding of a young couple who have known each other only
briefly. The author ``weaves in and out of the sundry dramas with
grace, warmth and a good deal of humor,'' Laura Jamison wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DREAMS OUR STUFF IS MADE OF: How Science Fiction Conquered
the World &LR;  By Thomas M. Disch. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. A
well-regarded science-fiction novelist argues for the genre's
literary merits while blaming it for encouraging delusory popular
fantasies and wacko religious cults. ``Disch is an eloquent
storyteller and polemicist'' and his book ``is consistently
rewarding,'' Alexander Star wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MORAL LIFE OF CHILDREN &LR;  By Robert Coles. Atlantic Monthly,
$13.50. Traveling to the world's trouble spots, a child
psychiatrist interviews a wide variety of children to examine the
way they develop their moral awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion volume,  &UR; THE POLITICAL LIFE OF CHILDREN &LR; 
($13.50), also reissued by Atlantic Monthly, he studies the way
youngsters think about politics. ``There is no one who is more
interested in what children say, sing, don't say or don't sing _
and why _ than Robert Coles,'' Neil Postman wrote in 1986. ``He is
to the stories that children have to tell what Homer was to the
tale of the Trojan War.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITE WIDOW &LR;  By Jim Lehrer. PublicAffairs, $12. Set in the
1950s, this novel revolves around a happily married bus driver in
small-town Texas whose life unravels when he becomes obsessed with
a mysterious woman passenger. The result is ``an oddly affecting
morality tale,'' The New York Times Book Review said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUXTON SPICE &LR;  By Oonya Kempadoo. Plume, $11.95. This tale of
village life in Guyana, narrated in a rich creole by a girl, is set
in the 1970s during a period of racial turmoil. ```Buxton Spice' is
a superb, and superbly written, novel of childhood and childhood's
end,'' Patrick Markee wrote last year.
