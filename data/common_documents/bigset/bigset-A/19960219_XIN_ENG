<HEADLINE> U.S. Official To Visit Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary
of Commerce Ronard Brown will pay a two-day visit to Kenya from
tomorrow, a press release from the American Embassy in Nairobi
said today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the U.S. official will hold bilateral talks
with Kenyan leaders aimed at promoting trade relations between
the two countries, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Brown is visiting Cote d'Ivoire today and he will tour
Ghana, Uganda and Botswana apart from Kenya to promote ties
with African countries.
</P>
<P>
He is accompanied by officials and about 40 U.S. business
representatives in a week-long trip to these five African states.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to send a clear and unequivocal signal that the
days of the US conceding the African marketplace to our
European friends or to anyone else are over," Brown told a
roundtable meeting of U.S. and West African business leaders in
Cote d'Ivoire today.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to compete in the area of trade, of investment
and commerce. We believe that that is good for America and that

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Says Coalition Talks Conform to Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that all efforts to form a new government
conformed to constitutional rules.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks in a message issued on the eve of Eid
al-Fitr (Moslem Feast) which falls on February 20.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the efforts concerning the
government formation would be successful.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that results of the December 24 elections were
the expression of the free will of the nation and no cause for
alarm about the fate of secularism and the republic.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any alteration of the fundamentals of the
Turkish Republic was impossible.
</P>
<P>
Motherland Party (ANAP) and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
agreed in principle to form a coalition government this afternoon
after four rounds of arduous and long talks in the recent days.
</P>
<P>
ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz and RP Chairman Necmettin Erbakan
said at a joint press conference that they had arrived at the
final stage of their deliberations and that the remaining
difficulties concerned "technical issues."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan explained that the technical issues at this stage had
to do with the composition of the cabinet to be formed and the
question of which party gets which ministry.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that a commission comprising members of the two
parties would work throughout the three-day Eid al-Fitr holiday
and would try to come up with an agreement by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish reliable sources said that the ANAP and RP would share
the premiership on a rotating basis, but Yilmaz would become the
prime minister first for 10 months under this formula.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Erbakan would not take part in the
Cabinet led by Yilmaz and would wait for his turn when it comes at
the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller today warned Yilmaz
against forming a coalition government with the RP.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this will not only be a grave mistake on the
part of Mesut Yilmaz and his party, It will also constitute...a
coalition that will sink the country into darkness."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Tourism: Good Prospects for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 2 million foreign
tourists visited Cyprus in 1995, with income in foreign currency
estimated at 810 million Cyprus pounds (about 1.62 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by the Chairman of the board of
directors of the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO), Antonakis
Andronicou, who also saw a good prospects for this year.
</P>
<P>
Andronicou said a slight reduction in the number of tourists
from Cyprus' largest market, Britain, is expected, mainly due to
the high exchange rate of the Cyprus pound against the British
Sterling. About 900,000 British tourists visited Cyprus last year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, tourist traffic from countries such as
Switzerland, Belgium, Scandinavia, France, Russia, Italy, Arab
countries, Israel and the U.S.A. is expected to be "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of tourism for the island's economy,
Andronicou said its contribution to the Gross National Product is
about 21 percent, whereas one third of the work force is directly
or indirectly employed in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Andronicou described competition from other tourist
destinations as Cyprus tourism's main problem, due to both
external and internal factors.
</P>
<P>
He listed some external factors such as the Cyprus pound
exchange rate, the devaluation in the currencies of competitive
markets, and new markets with cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
With regard to internal factors, Andronicou pointed to the
rapid increase in hotel running costs and certain "weaknesses" the
tourist product faces.
</P>
<P>
The CTO head stressed that action should be taken for the
preservation of the island's identity and character, the further
upgrading of tourist services and the encouragement of internal
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Andronicou said basic infrastructure works should be carried
out, the tourist product should be enriched so it can cater for
more specialized groups and there should be further improvement of
the natural environment, with emphasis on agro-tourism.
</P>
<P>
He added the Cyprus Tourism Organization has already prepared
studies for the creation of marinas and golf courts, stressing
the need for the implementation of those projects without further
delay.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Commitment to Work for Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Commitment to work for Cyprus
solution remains a top priority for the U.S. government this year,
a high ranking U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized U.S. desire to continue to work as best as we
can to work on a solution in Cyprus," Carey Cavanaugh, Director of
the Office of Southern European Affairs at the State Department,
told the press after an hour-long meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said the general situation in this region and the
efforts that could be undertaken to improve prospects for a
settlement were part of his discussions with Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. has any concrete thoughts about Cyprus, he
replied "there are clear thoughts about the importance of moving
ahead and the importance of coordinating our activities with the
U.N. and the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official noted efforts on Cyprus issue have been
delayed partly because U.S. attention was drawn elsewhere and
because of the lack of government in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh also had talks today with Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
After talks, Michaelides told the press that Cavanaugh
conveyed to him U.S. concerns that the Cyprus question must be
tackled because the situation in Cyprus is volatile and can
suddenly cause a crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Cavanaugh told me clearly that the recent Greco-Turkish
crisis in the Aegean (Sea) signifies that the U.S. may find itself
before a big crisis. Therefore the problem must be dealt with as
quickly as possible," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this assertion. It is fortunate that even now, it
has been established that the situation in Cyprus is explosive
and the problem must be solved to avoid the danger for a serious
confrontation," Michaelides added.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh, who arrived here Sunday, is on a four-day
orientation tour, during which he is also expected to meet with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. embassy press release, issued here earlier, said that
Cavanaugh's visit to the island "comes within the framework of
U.S. interest in reaching a comprehensive negotiated settlement
based on a bizonal, bicommunal federated state."

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Lonrho company is to
tap oil in Mozambique under a contract it signed with the
Mozambican government today.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed by Mozambican Deputy Minister of Mineral
Resources Castigo Langa and Lonrho's Executive President Dieter
Bock here, stipulated that the British company would carry out
exploration in a 30,000-square km area stretching from Mocimboa
da Praia in the northern Cabo Dolgado Province to Memba Bay.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Langa thanked Lonrho for its
decision to explore for oil in Mozambique, saying the
implementation of the contract would make it possible to find oil
in the Mozambican territory.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been totally relying on oil imports, which
deplete a large amount of the country's foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano met Bock
here, reiterating that Mozambique welcomes all foreign capital
and investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said today
the FAO will assist Angola in reviving its agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the FAO Jacques Diouf told reporters at
the airport here at the start of his three-day visit that the
Angola government cannot supply its people with enough food
because 20 years of civil war have laid waste the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Diouf expressed FAO's support for Angola's
emergency plans, providing technology to help restoring the
war-ravaged contry's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that FAO will offer more than 2.2 million US
dollars in total for Angola's emergency plans.
</P>
<P>
Angola is a country with great potentialities, not only able
to attain self-sufficiency in food, but also to have surplus for
export, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that only after peace is gained can the Angola
leaders focus their energy on solving its economic and social
problems and get more assistance from the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Study: End of Ceasefire Hits Ulster Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of the Northern
Ireland peace process could cost the province its position as the
UK's most rapidly expanding regional economy over the rest of the
decade, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
Business Strategies, which specializes in regional economic
forecasts for the UK, predicts in its latest regional outlook
report that the Northern Irland's economy will grow by an average
2.3 percent a year between 1995 and 2000 if the peace process
survives. But growth will be cut to 2 percent if the process
fails.
</P>
<P>
Comparing Northern Ireland's performance with the rest of the
UK's 12 regions, this would move the province from first place in
the growth league table to a below-average eighth place.
</P>
<P>
Business Strategies believes that an enduring return to armed
conflict would discourage inward investment and harm the tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
The forecast suggests that with the ceasefire ending, job growth
in the region will fall from 1.4 to one percent. Unemployment will
rise from 10.2 to 11.2 percent, while consumer spending growth
falls back from 3.4 to 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Angola Should Speed up Peace Process: British Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A British minister said today
the international community will continue to provide aid if the
warring sides in Angola are committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here on arrival of her three-day
visit, Britain's Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker
urged the two sides to speed up implementation of the Lusaka
agreement signed in 1994, especially the assemblying of UNITA's
fighters.
</P>
<P>
"I fear that since June last year the implementation of the
Lusaka protocol has been slower than the whole international
community had hoped," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed between the Angolan
government and the opposition movement of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end two decades of
civil war, UNITA has to disarm all of its estimated 62,500
guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo doe Santos has accused UNITA
of holding back its real soldiers and sending in children and
elderly men to assembly camps, an accusation the UNITA totally
denies.
</P>
<P>
Britain has donated 61 million US dollars in emergency aid to
Angola since June 1993.
</P>
<P>
This is Chalker's third visit to Angola, whose aim is to
promote bilateral ties with Angolan leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chalker said she would go to central Angola to meet UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi during the visit, apart from having talks
with dos Santos.

<HEADLINE> IRA Threatens to Broaden Bombing Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
threatens today it might broaden its current bombing campaign to
other cities in Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to the BBC in Belfast earlier, the IRA
claimed responsibility for the second bomb blast in London on
Sunday night, in which a bus was wrecked, one person killed and
eight others injured.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one of the IRA's members was also killed by
its own bomb in the "bungled attack" as described by police.
</P>
<P>
A leading IRA source was quoted by Reuters as saying: "If what
is happening in London doesn't get the message home, the same
signal will be sent by activity in other major British cities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the largest Protestant
political party in Northern Ireland, predicted further IRA attacks
today, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
UUP security spokesman Ken Maginnis said: "Until we face up to
the reality of what the IRA really are, we are going to suffer
this kind of tragedy again and again."
</P>
<P>
The smaller, but more radical Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
leader Ian Paisley reiterated that his party could not negotiate
"with people who are prepared to take up weapons and take their
lives."
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Protestant paramilitary organizations, the
rivals of the IRA, have still constrained themselves not to take
retaliative actions.
</P>
<P>
But one of the fringe loyalist political parties which have
links with these Protestant armed groups warned earlier that every
IRA blast brought nearer a full-scale resumption of violence.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Democratic Party appealed not to let the IRA wreck
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ebola Outbreak Confirmed in Gabon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientific tests have confirmed
an outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease in Gabon which has as of
today killed 13 people and infected at least seven others, the
World Health Organization (WHO) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said the tests, carried out by experts in Paris and
Gabon on samples of blood from nine infected people, have
confirmed the initial diagnosis of the disease by isolation of the
Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the WHO said, there are 20 confirmed and seven
suspect cases of Ebola in Gabon. Thirteen people have died.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also said all 20 confirmed cases come from Mayibout II,
an isolated village with some 150 inhabitants which is situated
some 400 kilometers east of the capital city, Libreville.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the dead have been confirmed to have had direct
contact with the blood of a dead chimpanzee which they had skinned
for a meal. The 13th death was a six-month old child of one of the
original 19 cases hospitalized on February 5-6 in Makokou, the
provincial capital of Ogooue-Ivindo in Gabon, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
An international team of medical experts led by the WHO which
arrived in Mayibout II on February 16 is investigating all
possible contacts of the patients, as well as rumors of illness
in two neighboring villages: Mayibout I and Mvadi. Persons who
accompanied the patients to the hospital in Makokou and who
returned with the dead bodies to bury them are know to live in
these two villages.
</P>
<P>
In Mayibout II, the international team has isolated six persons
with symptoms which could be early Ebola infection. In Makokou,
experts are searching for 10 additional persons who accompanied
patients from Mayibout II to the provincial hospital, WHO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, WHO does not recommend any travel
restrictions to or within Gabon.... With the precautions taken and
investigation of the outbreak and sensitization campaigns of the
population in the effected area under way, it is hoped that the
spread of epidemic will be minimized," WHO officials at the Geneva
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak in Gabon is the second recent one of Ebola in
Africa since the epidemic in Zaire in 1995 which infected 316
people and killed 245, a 77 percent fatality rate. There is also a
single case of Ebola in Cote d'Ivoire in last December.
</P>
<P>
The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with blood
secretions or body fluids from infected person. The symptoms of
the disease include the sudden onset of fever, followed by
vomiting, diarrhea and massive bleeding. The incubation period is
between two and 21 days. No specific treatment or vaccine against
Ebola exist.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Rated Most Sceptical About EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- British companies are the most
sceptical about economic and monetary union (EMU) compared with
those in other European countries, according to a survey released
here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by Coopers and Lybrand shows that in
Britain only 57 per cent of the sample of companies surveyed are
in favor of EMU, with 37 per cent against and 6 per cent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
Financial services companies in the UK are more strongly
opposed to EMU and a single currency, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Those companies in favor believe that EMU would bring about
reduction in exchange rate risk, greater financial discipline and
a reduction in inflation.
</P>
<P>
But many British companies see the main disadvantage of EMU as
the loss of the ability to use economic policy to solve domestic
economic problems, an inability to align interest rates and the
loss of fiscal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, across Europe as a whole, there is a clear majority of
companies which are in favor of EMU and in some respects,
business leaders are even more enthusiastic about it than
politicians, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
In France, for instance, 95 per cent of companies surveyed
support EMU, while in Germany the figure is 74 per cent, according
to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Aideed Captures Another Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and
14 others wounded when more than 260 militiamen supporting
faction leader Mohamed Farah Aideed invaded Dinsor Town, 120 kms
southwest of Baidoa, early yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted the political leader of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA), Ali Aden Margus, as saying the fighting
was the least disastrous one since hostilities began between the
RRA forces and those of Aideed.
</P>
<P>
No looting occurred during the fighting, Margus said.
</P>
<P>
Dinsor is the third major town that Aideed has captured since
he left Mogadishu six months ago. Aideed occupied the towns of
Baidoa and Huddur last September and in January this year
respectively from the RRA, which is armed and supported by
Aideed's rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The RRA's defeated men are regrouping themselves just 10 kms
out of Dinsor for counter-attack, Margus said. He considered
their defeat in Huddur as a tactical withdrawal aimed at
lessening the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Margus admitted that his men couldn't stand against Aideed's
overwhelming power in the region.
</P>
<P>
He warned against an attack by Aideed on the southern port of
Kismayo, calling on people in Lower Jubba region to prepare
themselves to defend against Aideed's aggression. Kismayo is the
capital city of Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
There is no official statement from Aideed's South Mogadishu
government as yet. However, senior officials supporting his
government said their president is on his routine official tours
in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a national government since the fall
of late President Mohamed Siad Barre in early 1991. Aideed, who
controls the southern part of Mogadishu, is one of the three
self-declared presidents in the Horn of Africa nation who have
gained no international recognition.

<HEADLINE> US, Germany Seek "Open-Skies" Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Germany
hope to reach an agreement this week that may begin breaking down
protectionism in airline service, according to the "USA Today".
</P>
<P>
Opening Germany would bring 40 percent of the traffic between
the U.S. and Europe under open-skies agreements, more than double
the current amount, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, U.S. airlines make 276 flights a week to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The deal would affect only routes flown by U.S. and Germany
airlines between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said, once Germany's Lufthansa, its major
aviation company, unrestricted access to the U.S., airlines in
other countries would risk losing business without similar
agreements. Some people flying to the U.S. from Europe might
choose Lufthansa because it has more direct U.S. destinations, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Worried about Voter Apathy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-president Godfrey Miyanda
today called on non-governmental organizations (ngos) to help
find solutions to the problem of voter apathy in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the call in a speech delivered at an
ngos consultative group meeting here. The speech was read on his
behalf by deputy minister in the vice-president's office Matiya
Ngalande.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said the government is concerned about the low voter
turn-out as evidenced during the past parliamentary by-elections
and the current voter registration exercise.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to ngos to have dialogues with eligible voters and
other concerned parties on the democratic governance of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government believed in the spirit of consultation and open
dialogue rather than confrontation and therefore encouraged ngos
to use such fora for debate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngalande said the government appreciated ngos actions and
programs aimed at promoting democracy and national development
because they are supplement to its socio-political reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned ngos to safeguard the rule of law in
their endeavors to redress the democratic issues.
</P>
<P>
The current voter registration exercise has been extended
twice due to the low turn-out.

<HEADLINE> IFP to Abide by New Constitution: Buthelezi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) of South Africa would abide by the new constitution
although it was not being involved in its creation, IFP leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting visiting Danish Foreign Affairs
Minister Nielshelveg Petersen in Cape Town, Buthelezi said his
party stood by its call on international mediation to resolve
certain outstanding constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a statement by deputy president F. W. de Klerk
that the need for international mediation could fall away if the
issues were resolved through negotiation, Buthelezi said he did
not know how he (de Klerk) could have reached that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
If the new constitution went ahead without the IFP, then "so
be it," said Buthelezi, adding there was a precedent for this in
that the IFP also did not participate in drafting the interim
constitution.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's final constitution is expected to be worked out
by the constitutional assembly before May 9 this year, the
deadline set for the completion of the constitution-writing
process.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year protesting against the failure of the African National
Congress to honor an agreement, reached before 1994 April
election, on international mediation over Zulu autonomy in
Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
However, in a memorandum handed over to Petersen, Buthelezi
warned that unless the prevailing strong centralist and
autocratic tendencies were reversed, South Africans would soon
live under a single, monolithic power structure which would not
tolerate any political opposition or competition.
</P>
<P>
There were already far-sighted academic voices to be heard
warning about the dangers of creeping authoritarianism and
one-party statehood, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In African contexts, power domination and political control
or patronage often determine voters' allegiances," added
Buthelezi.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Calls for Rebuilding Peace in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
said today that efforts must be made to rebuild peace in Northern
Ireland though the peace process is over.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster, the leader of the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) said he was
shocked and saddened by the latest bomb blast in central London on
Sunday night, in which a double-decker bus was wrecked, one person
was killed and eight others wounded.
</P>
<P>
He also offered his condolence to the families of the victims,
but, just like ten days ago when the IRA plotted the first bomb
explosion in east London, refused to condemn the attack.
</P>
<P>
Adams repeated that his party wanted to see an end to all armed
conflict in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the
biggest Catholic political party in Ulster, called for early talks
among all sides involved in the conflict to try to keep the
damaged peace process on track.
</P>
<P>
SDLP legislator Joe Hendron argued that communications should
remain open with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Hendron told BBC Radio: "We want the ceasefire renewed, we want
all parties to be talking."
</P>
<P>
He supported the Dayton-style "proximity talks" proposal put
forward by the Irish Government, saying that the proposal had a
lot of merit.

<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The British Air Force lost its
sixth warplane in five weeks today when a Harrier jet fighter
crashed shortly before landing, according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
The jet fighter, returning to base from Cyprus, crashed earlier
today in the eastern county of Lincolnshire and the pilot ejected
safely before the plane hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-January the Royal Air Force (RAF) has lost one Jaguar
and three Tornado fighter bombers as well as a Hawk training jet.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Royal Navy lost a Harrier jet fighter when it
crashed into the Adriatic Sea and one pilot was killed when his
Hawk trainer crashed in North Wales.
</P>
<P>
An RAF spokesman is reported as saying today: "We do not
believe we have a problem. All the aircraft involved come from
different bases, had different flight patterns and crashed at
different stages of flight."
</P>
<P>
He made clear that there is no discernible pattern to all this,
saying in some years the number of planes which crash will be more
than average and in some years it will be less the average.

<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Jim McGilvray, a soccer referee
of Britain, submitted his resignation on Monday, just 16 days
after booking Paul Gascoigne for celebrating a goal.
</P>
<P>
McGilvray said after giving the resignation to the Scottish
Football Association he could no longer carry on as a "robot".
</P>
<P>
He said the final straw was feeling forced to book Gascoigne
after the midfielder scored the first of his two goals in Rangers'
2-1 win over Partick at Firhill on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The referee was quoted as saying: "The day I had to book
Gascoigne for celebrating scoring a goal was the last straw -
that was the day I decided to pack it in."
</P>
<P>
He said his stomach had turned, but under the system he had to
yellow card Gazza.
</P>
<P>
"We are being programmed like robots with a list of
instructions," he added. "I just can't carry on like this. I love
my football but it is time to get out."
</P>

McGilvray, 47, has been a Grade One official in Scotland for
the past 11 years.

<HEADLINE> Commanders of 3 Bosnian Armies to Resume Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) and military leaders of the
three Bosnian sides will restore contacts today, Tanjug news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a MATO statement as saying that the
meeting will be hosted by IFOR commander Admiral Leighton Smith
aboard the U.S. Aircraft Carrier George Washington in the Adriatic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army Major General Zdravko
Tolimir, Muslim army commander General Rasim Delic and Croat army
representative Major General Zivko Budimir will participate in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows the Rome summit on the implementation of
the peace agreement, where the Bosnian sides had agreed to restore
all military and civilian contacts.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs suspended contacts with IFOR and the Muslim-Croat
federation following the arrest of two ranking Serb officers in
late January by Muslim police in a IFOR-controlled zone in
Sarajevo and indicted to the Hague for further questioning this
month.
</P>
<P>
IFOR said that the meeting had been organized in order to
restore contacts and build confidence between the Bosnian sides in
the interest of the implementation of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
To put the unraveled Bosnian peace process back on track, the
presidents of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia held a special
conference in Rome over the weekend, at which the three
signatories of the peace agreement reaffirmed their commitment to
the full implementation of the peace agreement and pushing the
peace process forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 654,000 Iraqis have
died due to deteriorating health conditions caused by the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for over five years, said an Iraqi
report available today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the Iraqi Commission in the
Cairo-based Arab League, field statistics made by the Iraqi
Ministry of Health showed that more than 4 million children under
the age of 15 have suffered bad health because of insufficient
food supplies.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency also quoted the report as
saying that the mortality rate of infants in Iraq has reached 136
deaths in every 1,000 births due to a lack of vaccines for mothers
and children.
</P>
<P>
During the period from 1985 to 1990, the infant mortality rate
was 33 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions, including a
ban on oil sale, on Iraq since August 1990 for its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has suffered a serious shortage of foodstuffs and
medicines which the country does not have enough foreign currency
to purchase as a result of the embargo. Before the oil ban was
imposed, oil exports provided about 95 percent of Iraq's income of
hard currency.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Sweden to Vie for HK Lunar New Year Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese eleven
displayed its strength here today when it trounced European power
Poland 5-0 in the opening match of the 50,000 US dollars Carlsberg
Cup Lunar New Year soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Japan led 3-0 at half-time.
</P>
<P>
In the other match of the day, Sweden downed Hong Kong 1-0
after a scoreless first half.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Sweden will play for the tournament title Thursday
while the losers will meet before the title clash to decide the
third place.
</P>
<P>
The Polish national team had been weakened by the pull-out of
players from the Warsaw Club who are to compete in the semi-finals
of the European Champions' Cup next month. And the
newly-appointed coach Tommy Svensson had to field younger players
instead.
</P>
<P>
"I've come to test the strength of my side," he said on his
arrival here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The taller and faster Polish tried in the early stage to
pressure on their Japanese rivals in the first half. But soon
they found it to be a hard nut to crack.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese put in three consecutive goals in a space of nine
minutes, sealing their victory.
</P>
<P>
A long shot and two headers put the Japanese team three up at
the break, and two more goals in the second half were only
something like bonus.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Hong Kong kept a clean book until the 20th minute of the
second half when Sweden's 1994 World Cup player Patrik Andersson
scored the sole goal after a free-kick awarded to his side.
</P>
<P>
"Although we lost tonight's game, in some respects we won it,"
said Hong Kong coach Tony Sealy. "Whether we've played is more
important."
</P>
<P>
"The 1-0 defeat's nature is hard since it was close," he said,
referring to the fact that Sweden was far more fancied than the
Hong Kong side.
</P>
<P>
He admitted his team did not play well at some points. "Quite
honestly, we looked a very scared, very frightened team," he said.
</P>
<P>
He complained about the short period of time given to them
before the match -- only one week.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Svensson, the Swedish coach, gave high comments to his
players.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that many of the players have not played since
October, I think they've made best of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong team perhaps had a little too much respect to
the Swedish team, he said, but in the second half they played
much better, much more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
"Many of my players are not 100 percent fit now," he said. "But
in all, I am satisfied as we came to win the first game and we
did."

<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's exports of flowers
and fresh horticultural produce are on target this season, with
50 million U.S. dollars having been earned in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of Horticulture Promotion Council Stanley Heri
said today despite the heavy rains which damaged some of the
flowers, the 1995/96 season has been good.
</P>
<P>
"Damage from the rains was very minimal and according to our
export projections, we are on target. Fresh produce has been
excellent due to the good weather," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the current season, the council expects 12,300 tons of
flowers to be exported compared to 9,200 tons the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from flower and fresh produce exports in the 1994/95
season were 75 million U.S. dollars and the 1995/96 season is
projected at about 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is Africa's second largest exporter of flowers and
fresh horticultural produce, and is increasingly strengthening
its position in Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department of
Customs has rejected appeals by Zimbabwean shippers to rescind a
decision to slap hefty duties on transit cargo.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Zimbabwe's Ministry of Industry and Commerce
Kelbert Nkomani today said the South Africa's Department of
Customs had decided to implement the new measures with effect
from March 1 despite appeals by the Zimbabwe government and the
Shipping and Forwarding Agents Association of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Among other measures to control smuggling, the South African
Department of Customs is demanding that exporters from such
landlocked countries as Zimbabwe pay a cash deposit to cover 125
percent of the duty which would be payable if the goods in
transit are imported into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department is insisting it would not accept
road bonds as security for removals of goods in transit, and
wanted all transit goods destined for other African countries by
road to leave through the border posts of Beitbridge and
Komatipoort.
</P>
<P>
He said that the duty would apply to cover textiles, clothing,
electronic goods, tyres, wine, beer and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said today that Zimbabwe and other countries
could be forced to divert their cargo to such Mozambican ports as
Beira and Maputo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lunar New Year Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- At temple fairs, lantern
displays, and on travel programs, Chinese people are
celebrating the most important holiday of the year -- Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The lunar new year, which is usually celebrated by holding a
family reunion, began yesterday evening and will last for about a
week.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
famous for its historical relics and the start of the Silk Road,
held its first temple fair, where local food and folk arts
performances could be enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
Lantern shows are being held in Chengdu and Zigong in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, from February 19 to March 17. The two
cities are known for these shows, which have a more than
1,800-year history and are a must for some people during Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
For residents of Chongqing, another city in Sichuan, travel has
replaced the traditional holiday celebrations, with people
visiting other Chinese cities or going abroad, mostly to
Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's commercial and industrial center, fresh
flowers have become the most popular gift for the holiday season,
adding to the traditional ones of cigarettes, alcohol, and
candy. Another popular gift in this major city is the new year's
card, a new fashion, where people send cards to friends,
colleagues, and family members.
</P>
<P>
A dragon-dance competition was held by the people of the Yi
ethnic minority in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province. Eleven
teams from different parts of the city participated in the
competition, with one made up of 15 female Yi farmers proving to
be the most eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
People in remote areas, which are somewhat poorer than cities,
have received donations from other Chinese provinces and the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Li Kui, an elderly peasant in Gansu Province in northwest
China, said, "I am so grateful because President Jiang Zemin
brought food, clothing, and money to my home at the end of last
year. Now I can spend the holiday happily."
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan New Year coincidentally falls on the same day as
Spring Festival this year. People in Lhasa and all over the
plateau area are singing and dancing in the street to celebrate
the two festivals.
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, provincial captial of Shandong in east China, 400
Tibetan students studying there are celebrating together with
their Han classmates.
</P>
<P>
For foreigners doing business, working, or travelling in China
there were a number of the New Year celebrations. From top Chinese
officials to ordinary Chinese families, from neighborhood inns to
luxurious hotels, they are greeted as welcome guests.

PHNOM PENH, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A cement factory will be

Thai Ruonrong company and a Chinese company at a cost of 60
million U.S. dollars.

<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Motherland Party
(ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan reached a Principle agreement on
the formation of a coalition government this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told reporters at a joint press conference with
Erbakan: "Technical working (of the two parties) will start to
distribute cabinet members and this work will be finished before
Friday. The coalition government will be formed as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The two party leaders agreed in principle on the coalition
formation through four rounds of arduous and long talks in recent
days after Yilmaz being assigned to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
coalition on February 3 when True Path Party (DYP) Chairperson
and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller returned her mandate
for a government formation. She failed in her attempts to convince
Yilmaz to enter a coalition partnership with the DYP.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan failed to draw a partnership in four other political
parties in the parliament and returned his mandate to form a
government to the president earlier.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and ANAP executives rejected Ciller's proposals for a
coalition between the ANAP and DYP in which each party leader
shares the premiership on a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's proposal had floundered on her insistence that she
become prime minister first under this formula.

KUWAIT CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today restored
postal services and direct telephone links with Jordan, signaling
that the bilateral relations were improving after a five-year rift
caused by the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qabas, a local Arabic newspaper, quoted Jassem al-Aoun,
Kuwait's communications minister, as saying that he ordered the
restoration so that citizens of the two countries may contact
their families on the occasion of Ramadan Bairam (Moslem feast).
</P>
<P>
The three-day Ramadan Bairam, which will start on Tuesday,
marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications between the two countries were cut off five
years ago following Jordan's perceived tilt toward Iraq during the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Before today, people in Kuwait could make telephone calls to
their friends and relatives in Jordan, but the calls went through
a third country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that air flights between the two countries will
also be resumed preliminary to the restoration of ties and the
return of the Jordanian ambassador to Kuwait.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Shaheen Air
International (SAI) entered into an agreement with Thai Airways to
buy its two Boeing 737 aircraft which SAI is currently operating
under dry lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan today, SAI, the
second largest national airline, acquired these aircraft and began
operations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
SAI officials said this purchase demonstrates the resolve of
the airline to stay in business for long and build a complete base
of operations and engineering.
</P>
<P>
SAI already has a fully trained pool of Pakistani pilots,
engineers and technicians for its Boeing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The airline also plans to acquire more Boeing 737s for its
domestic routes and get more modern aircraft for its international
operations, said SAI officials.
</P>
<P>
The Army Welfare Trust and the Bahria Foundation, two
military-supported foundations, have recently expressed interest
to acquire shares in SAI.
</P>
<P>
SAI officials hoped this would further give the airline the
strength and the backing necessary for it to develop and expand
both in the domestic and international sectors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan International Airline is the national carrier and the
largest national airline in the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Releases 269 Repentant Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today released 269
repentant extremists on the occasion of the end of the Moslem holy
month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
These prisoners have "renounced their extremist thoughts which
they were misled to advocate in the past," the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) said.
</P>
<P>
They were the second batch of repentant extremists freed during
the month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, 117 extremists who had repented were released.
</P>
<P>
The release was part of the Interior Ministry's amnesty policy
aimed at ensuring social and economic care for former extremists
who have announced their repentance, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The released extremists are believed to have been Moslem
fundamentalist militants, who had launched a violent campaign
against the current secular government since 1992 in an attempt to
replace it with strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Among those set free today, 126 are from Upper Egypt, where
most of the terrorist attacks in the country have taken place in
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
MENA reported earlier that more extremists who have repudiated
their hard-line thoughts will be released following Ramadan
Bairam, which begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security forces have fiercely cracked down on
Moslem fundamentalist militants, many of whom were arrested and
sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy said Sunday that Egypt
will continue its efforts to uproot the elements of terrorism,
extremism and violence in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that struck northern Irian Jaya, Indonesia, last
Saturday rose to 53 at noon today.
</P>
<P>
Police officers from Biak also confirmed that in the quake and
aftershocks, 19 were missing, 51 injured and more than 2,100
houses destroyed, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Tsunamis triggered by the quake also wiped away completely ten
villages along the coast.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that the actual number of fatalities
and the extent of the damage were expected to increase. Poor
communication in the remote areas has prevented them from
obtaining more accurate information.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which measured 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale,
has reportedly triggered tsunamis that have destroyed scores of
houses on Biak Island and in the mainland coastal town of
Manokwari.
</P>
<P>
Road access on Biak was complicated after many bridges were
destroyed by the quake and tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
Radio and telephone lines also went down, preventing several
subdistricts from reporting on the situation in their areas.
</P>
<P>
The tower of the Frans Kaisiepo International Airport was also
hit hard, with the navigation equipment, radars and a power
generator damaged. The airport is temporarily closed to night
flights.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were urging people to stay outside of their
homes until further notice.
</P>
<P>
There had been several aftershocks since the quake stuck
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A quake, measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale, occurred this
morning at 8:09 a.m. local time in Wamena city of Jayawijaya
district of Irian Jaya, according to local meteorology officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials located the quake's epicenter at about 80 km
south of Wamena.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Denies Participation In Negotiations On Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) issued a statement in Gaza today, denying this
morning's report by Israel Radio about Jamil Hammami participating
in negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, according to a report
of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that seminars had gone on in the Orient
House, PLO's office in East Jerusalem, between Palestinian and
Israeli intellectuals on the future of Jerusalem. Participants in
the talks included Jamil Hammami, who heads the Islamic Scientific
Committee, and Mahdi Abdul Hadi, who heads the Palestinian
Academic Studies Society for International Affairs (PASSIA).
</P>
<P>
The Hamas statement, which was carried in a leaflet, said that
"Brother Jamil Hammami's participation in a seminar on Jerusalem
-- despite this being his own personal decision without Hamas'
permission -- is not considered participation in negotiations with
the occupiers on the status of Jerusalem, which will always be
united and owned by the Palestinian people and Arab and Islamic
nation.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas affirms its clear and absolute decision to reject the
settlement agreements with the Zionist enemy and all the
negotiations that preceded them.... It refuses to participate in
any form in any negotiations or talks dealing with the settlement
project, whether on Jerusalem or otherwise," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement, a radical
fundamentalist group, was formed in late 1987 in the Gaza Strip as
a militant offshoot of the Moslem Brotherhood, a pan-Islamic
movement. Gaza is now a Palestinian self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus in January Down to 6-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in January
plunged 83 percent from a year earlier to a six-year low of 467
million U.S. dollars, the Japanese Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
January was the seventh consecutive month in which Japan posted
a decline in its seasonally unadjusted global trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decline to continued rise in
imports.
</P>
<P>
The nation's politically sensitive trade surplus with the
United States also dropped 51.2 percent to 1.549 billion dollars,
extending the downtrend to an eighth month, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
On a customs-cleared basis, Japan's overall exports in January
rose 6.7 percent to 28.956 billion dollars, an increase for the
35th consecutive month. Overall imports for the month grew 16.9
percent to 28.489 billion dollars, also posting a rise for the
35th straight month.

<HEADLINE> UK, Germany at Odds Over Defense Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France will
jointly develop a new generation of armored personnel carriers on
their own if Britain does not agree to join the program by the end
of this month, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A joint program to develop a multi-role armored vehicle (MRAV)
is seen by Britain, France and Germany as vital to help
rationalize the crowded arms industry.
</P>
<P>
Britain is particularly keen on the program which may enable it
to join the Franco-German arms agency from which it has been
excluded for its perceived bias towards buying U.S. arms rather
than joining European programs.
</P>
<P>
During negotiations in the past 18 months, however, Britain has
demanded an open competition with companies forming international
teams and submitting rival designs.
</P>
<P>
But Germany and France, which have been working on the MRAV
program for a long time, have already agreed on a detailed design
and insist that companies bid on the basis of their design.
</P>
<P>
Britain now is faced with a choice of either accepting the
Franco-German proposals, which would involve less competition, or
being excluded from the program.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem before the deadline, British
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo and his German counterpart,
Volker Ruhe, will discuss the program at a meeting in London on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today told visiting Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Russia is
and will continue to be firmly opposed to the eastward expansion
of NATO towards its borders.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half hours of talks with Kohl in the Kremlin
this morning, Yeltsin told reporters: "My friend Helmut believes
that a solution to the problem should be postponed for a while and
be passed over in silence for people to cease worrying."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived here Sunday night for a three-day official
visit, told reporters that he will not pursue a policy which could
put under threat the new partnership and friendly relations
between Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The German leader said that the establishment of a
pan-European security system could be one of the possible
solutions to the problem of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"One should act so as to prevent the emergence of new barriers
in Europe. It is essential to handle these issues in a calm and
reasonable manner," Kohl added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is expected to have talks with Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will give an official dinner in the Kremlin in Kohl's
honor this evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today met with Afghan and Pakistani foreign ministry
officials in an attempt to bring peace to the war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio said Rafsanjani met separately
today with Afghan State Minister for Foreign Affairs Najibullah
Lafraei and Pakistani Deputy Foreign Minister Najmeddin Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Lafraei, Rafsajani announced Iran's
readiness for taking part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan if
its civil war comes to a halt, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying that peace and stability
were necessary in Afghanistan before the reconstruction began.
</P>
<P>
Lafraei said that his government was against war and
bloodshed. He added that Kabul government appreciated Iran's
efforts for bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, Lafraei submitted a message
from Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani to Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Some specialists predicted that with the secret agreements
reached in recent talks between Tehran and Islamabad over
Afghanistan, there were hopes for restoration of relative
tranquility in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Allaeddin Boroujerdi, Iran's deputy foreign minister for Asia

ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
six others injured when Afghan capital of Kabul was again shelled
by rockets, said a report from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
One of the rockets, falling into a house in the suburb of
Chelsitoon near the front-line separating government forces from
those of the Taliban, wounded nine civilians late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three of them were declared dead when the victims were rushed
to a hospital, the report quoted hospital sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry officials blamed the Taliban religious
student militia, that has been besieging Kabul since last October,
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The city had since been subjected to almost daily rocket and
shell attacks until early last month when they decreased in number
as the Muslim holy month of fasting began.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Orphans Enjoy Their Own Happy New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua)-- Wang Jianbo, a 24-year-old chef
at a luxury hotel in Shijiazhuang City, the capital of Hebei
Province in north China, went to the city's orphanage yesterday to
spend the lunar new year with the 50 orphans there.
</P>
<P>
"I have spent every Spring Festival at this orphanage for as
long as I can recall," Wang, who was dressed in a brand new
jacket, said, then explained that his parents had died when he was
very young and he had spent his own childhood in this very
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very unfortunate because I am an orphan and don't have
parents the way most of my friends do," Wang said, but pointed
out, "I'm also fortunate because I enjoyed the same happy
childhood in the orphanage as every other child in China who was
raised by parents."
</P>
<P>
"I have dozens of brothers and sisters here, and the aunts here
treated me as their own child," said Wang, tears rolling down his
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the orphanage holds a party for the children to
celebrate the country's most important holiday, which is
celebrated typically by a family reunion. This year's new year's
party was held in the orphanage's new building.
</P>
<P>
Gao Weipin, deputy director of the orphanage and its chief
medical doctor, said that almost one out of every five of the
orphans here suffers from congenital health problems, many from
mental-retardation. "I suppose the reason some parents abandoned
their children is that they saw no hope for the children's
recovery," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is not only to raise them, but to provide therapy,
which is more important, so that they can become useful members of
society," said the deputy director.
</P>
<P>
About 200 kilometers away in Tianjin, a northern industrial
city, 210 orphans are also celebrating New Year's Eve in the
city's orphanage.
</P>
<P>
The more than 200 children have only one "grandpa", Yan Jiying,
the director of the orphanage. "We try not only to give these
children the kind of love a family gives, but are also making
efforts to teach them, in their hearts, a love for society," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The orphanage receives about 300,000 yuan in donations every
year, some coming from anonymous donors. enditem

<HEADLINE> Festival Customs Undergoing Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the freezing cold
temperatures today, residents of the capital city of Jiangxi
Province came out in numbers to watch folk dances performed by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of two 80-meter-long blue and red "dragons"
and 13 others cloth strips representing lions and boats in the
dances, accompanied by the players on stilts, were met by rounds
of applause.
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful thing when we farmers can join the city folk
in celebrating the Spring Festival, the traditional Chinese New
Year," said one older woman playing a "dragon".
</P>
<P>
She explained that farmers used to stay at home to offer
sacrifices to ancestors and pay a call to elders during the first
seven days and go out on the eighth.
</P>
<P>
"No one was allowed to break this rule, or the family's good
fortune in making money would be gone," she continued.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xibao, a farmer from Changgang Village on the outskirts of
the city, another of the "dragon" player, said, "Nowadays, many of
us younger people do not follow the rules, and we know that
property is created by man."
</P>
<P>
"The reason our ancestors stuck to the practice of staying up
late or all night on New Year's Eve was that their lives were so
poor, and they placed their hopes for good fortune on the coming
year," the 33-year-old man went on to explain.
</P>
<P>
Luo is a graduate of senior middle school, and noted that his
village has set up 16 factories, employing 80 percent of the
villagers. All the cultivation work is being done under contract
by a few capable farmers. The annual income of villagers last
year averaged 2,200 yuan per capita.
</P>
<P>
"Because we eat the same food and wear the same clothing as
urbanites, we need to emulate them culturally and mentally," Luo
said.
</P>
<P>
Lai Shiqiu, a folklore scholar, says that the psychology and
views of the people will change along with the social sciences,
technology, and the economy.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Budget Deficit Accounts for 1.6 Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's state budget deficit
currently accounts for 1.6 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), considered one of the world's lowest ratios in this regard,
said the finance minister today.
</P>
<P>
Mohi Eddin el-Gharib was quoted by the Middle East News Agency
as saying that the maintenance of the deficit at its current level
will be conducive to a major success in the overall economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
The three-year second stage of Egypt's economic reform, which
started in the second half of 1993, is aimed at reducing
considerably the budget deficit and has apparently achieved
initial success.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began its economic reform in 1991 with the backing of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gharib said that an IMF mission will be visiting here in March
for a regular review of the development of Egypt's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he said, the IMF will eventually agree to
write off Egypt's 4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign debts to
the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
This will spare Egypt about 200 million dollars in debt
interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank, which represent the Paris Club,
have been reluctant to drop the debts because they believe that
Egypt has been too slow in implementing its economic reform
program, especially privatization.
</P>
<P>
Egypt recently has announced a plan of accelerating the
privatization process.

<HEADLINE> Britain Vows to Continue Search for Peace in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
pledged to continue to search for peace in conflict-torn Northern
Ireland despite a second bomb blast in London on Sunday night, the
BBC reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said that the government
would remain "resolute" in its search for peace, urging Protestant
loyalist paramilitary groups -- the rival armed organizations of
the Irish Republican Army -- not to retaliate. Any reprisal, he
said, would further worsen the situation and would be
"catastrophic."
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), a fringe loyalist party which
represents the Ulster Volunteer Force,declared that the IRA must
not be allowed to wreck the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael, leader of the UDP, also expressed his concern
about the fragility of the loyalist ceasefire announced on October
13, 1994, 43 days after the IRA's ceasefire began.
</P>
<P>
McMichael suggested that loyalist paramilitary leaders would
now be looking at the situation very closely.
</P>
<P>
He warned that every IRA blast brought nearer a full-scale
resumption of violence.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast, which follows an IRA bombing in east London
nine days ago, occurred at 22:38 Sunday night in central
London. The explosion wrecked a bus, killed one person and injured
eight others.
</P>
<P>
So far, no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind today left for a four-nation Balkan tour to
promote the Bosnian peace process and cement UK-Greek relations.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind will begin his diplomatic trip in Sarajevo, where he is
expected to put forward British proposals on giving impetus to the
Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, Rifkind will have a difficult
time in Bosnia as relations between the Muslims and Serbs around
Sarajevo have deteriorated to the extent that the Dayton peace
treaty is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary is expected to face a serious challenge
when he arrives in Athens, the analysts added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, newly-appointed Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos bitterly attacked Britain and Rifkind in particular for
failing to support Greece in its dispute with Turkey over the
Aegean island of Imia.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day trip, Rifkind will also visit Slovenia and
Albania to further cooperation with the two countries.

Hong Kong imported 42 billion HK dollars (5.4 billion US
dollars) worth of interior furnishing products last year and 30
billion HK dollars of it was re-exported to such major markets as
China, Germany, Japan and some American countries. Domestic
exports amounted to 1.4 billion HK dollars (180 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buyers and suppliers of the home furnishing sector,
architects, interior designers and contractors will gather at the

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Increases Value of State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest economic
center has increased the value of state assets in the past few
years by setting up 33 state-controlled holding firms and group
companies.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai authorities empowered the companies to manage state
assets in such fields as textile, instruments, electronics,
commerce, and aquatic product industry. State assets of these
companies account for about half of the total in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Through acquisitions, bankruptcies, and suspensions of
production, the Shanghai Textile State Assets Co. Ltd. has reduced
the number of entities in the red from 142 to 21 in the textile
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Lansheng (Group) Corporation developed
catering services and tourism and took over a poker factory to
expand state assets under its control by 10 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Building Material (Group) Corporation has
established 17 joint ventures with investments totalling 236
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Instrument and Electronics State Asset Managing
Corporation established a system to upgrade the management of
state assets, as well as clarify the duties and responsibilities
of share-holders in state assets.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the establishment of the state-control
holding companies has provided valuable experience in taking care
of state assets in a market-oriented economy.

SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Aladdin Knowledge
Systems Ltd chose the Shanghai Research Institute of Light
Industry as agent for its HASP, a software anti-piracy system,
recently.
</P>
<P>
The system can prevent piracy and the illegal use of its
software, and is being used in more than 60 countries and regions,
with sales of more than 10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its customers include Lattice, Philips, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Digital, and
Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
Software piracy has been responsible for at least 15 billion
dollars in losses to developers, according to recent statistics of
the Software Publishers Association and the Business Software
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has the largest number of computer users in China,
with computer sales reaching 4.5 billion yuan last year, and
software sales 800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
But, software piracy also exists, and the city's antipiracy
technology, that is badly needed, is still not good enough.
</P>
<P>
The city has decided to use imported software anti-piracy
systems, while working on ways of developing such systems.
</P>
<P>
This gives Aladdin a good opportunity in this software
protection system market, said the company's sales manager.

DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, leader of

Hasina said the BNP government had no political, legal and
moral validity to remain in power following the meaningless
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A new wave of refugees are
crossing the Sierra Leone border into Guinea to escape an
increase of rebel attacks on nothern towns and villages, relief
officials said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travellers arriving here told reporters that the
once prosperous Kamakwe, Gbemdembu and part of Kambia are
becoming ghost towns as people abandoned their residence and fled
into the bush over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We had the rude shock that we are no longer safe so we have
to flee for our lives," 38 year old Mariatu Koroma said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to stem the exodus on Sunday, the chief of
defence staff, Brigadier Joy Yuray flew to Makeni, the
headquarters town in the north to appeal to residents "not to
abandon their towns and villages but to work with armed
volunteers to resist rebel attacks."
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Turay said, "a tight security network is now in
place to ensure free and fair elections" due in eight days' time.
</P>
<P>
The north is the most populated area in the country and its
current situation worries election officials who believe polling
would only take place in Makeni and nowhere else in the district.
</P>
<P>
The north accounts for nearly 45 percent of all registered
voters and any increase in the attacks would seriously
"de-enfranchised" voters, according to election officials.
situation has deterated for concern.''
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Chairman of the Sierra Leone
Interim National Electoral Commission, Dr James Jonah, has
criticized the statement made by Turay last week, which said the
"military would not guarantee adequate security during polling
day".
</P>
<P>
"The statement has cast a slur on the integrity of the army,"
Jonah said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the security situation is concerned," he pointed
out, "one could explore the possibility of requesting for UN
troops on a short term basis."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, INEC began displaying the list of registered
voters at various centres across the country. The exercise will
run until friday.

NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Deposits in rural banks in
east China's Jiangsu Province hit 80.65 billion yuan last year, up
19.85 billion, or 24.6 percent, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect impressive growth in this area because it
has normally taken Jiangsu, even though it is an economic
powerhouse, two to three years to increase rural deposits by
something like ten billion yuan.
</P>

Rapid rural economic growth in the province, known for its
township enterprises, has boosted rural per capita income to 2,457

<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official today
criticized Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak's recent remarks
that Israel's security could not be maintained except through
nuclear abilities, saying they were "imbued with racism"
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobeih, the Palestinian permanent representative to the
cairo-based Arab League, said in an interview with the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) that Barak's remarks were tantamount to an
official admittance that Israel owns nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih, also secretary of the Palestinian National Council
(PNC), or parliament-in-exile, told MENA that Barak's statements
implied a clear Israeli threat to use nuclear weapons against the
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that only peace can provide security, saying that
the party which possesses and keeps nuclear weapons despite the
prevailing atmosphere of peace is the one that wants aggression
and expansion.
</P>
<P>
Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons though it
has never openly admitted nor denied it.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and a number of other Arab countries have called on Israel
to scrap its nuclear weapons to make the Middle East a region free
of weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar failed
to go higher against most currencies due to an unexpected high
imports growth in January.
</P>
<P>
But overseas buying of the local currency pushed it higher
against the US dollar. The Australian dollar ended at 75.74 US
cents from 74.58 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The imports volume rose four percent to 6.723 billion
Australian dollars (5.04 billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted
in January after a five percent growth last December, according to
figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
today.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that the country's monthly current
account deficit failed to surge above 2 billion Australian dollars
(1.5 billion US dollars) only because of sustained growth of
exports.
</P>
<P>
They said that a blowout of the current account deficit would
have a negative impact on the Labor Party's drive to retain office
in the March 2 federal election.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was weaker against other currencies under
the weight of a falling US dollar against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 79.59 yen from 80.05 Friday. It
dropped to 1.0981 German marks from 1.1109.

<HEADLINE> Manila May Bring Case vs. EU Before WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is considering
filing a complaint against the European Union (EU) in the World
Trade Organization (WTO) as the EU refuses to reclassify the
country's carageenan exports as a non-toxic food additive,
</P>
<P>
Edna Espos, head of the Bureau of International Trade Relations
at the Department of Trade and Industry, said today, "We are
exhausting all means to have this case resolved harmoniously."
</P>
<P>
He said that Manila is exploring all avenues for dialogue
before it asks the WTO to broker a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Despite claims by EU health officials that the products contain
toxic substances, the Codex Alimentarius Commission on food
additives and contaminants last year said Philippine natural grade
carageenan was a safe food additive.
</P>
<P>
A strong lobby three years ago prompted the EU to revive a
five-year-old directive reclassifying PNG carageenan as processed
eucheuma seaweed with acid insoluble matter of not more than two
percent.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed reclassification had been approved by the Codex
Alimentarius Commission on food additives and contaminants, PNG
carageenan, which contains between 10 percent and 15 percent AIM,
would be banned as a food additive in European markets.
</P>
<P>
The country's seaweed exports to Europe amounted to 26.5
million US dollars in 1994, from 24.1 million dollars the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Build Bridge In Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia will proceed with
construction of a bridge across the Mekong River at My Thuan in
southern Vietnam, said a news release available here today.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, to be jointly funded by Australian and local
governments in Vietnam, is expected to cost around 83 million
Australian dollars (62.25 million US dollars), with Australian
contributions to be about 55 million dollars (41.25 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bridge will be the first across the Mekong in Vietnam and
the overall length of the bridge will be about 1,360 meters with a
main bridge length of 640 meters, according to the news release
issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Around 15 million of Vietnam's some 72 million population live
in the Mekong Delta and they currently cross the river using old,
slow and worn out ferries.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will replace the current ferry service which every
day transports up to 22,500 people, 4,000 tons of freight and
5,000 passenger cars. The demand is expected to double by the
year 2000, even without a bridge.
</P>
<P>
An announcement regarding the construction of the bridge was
made by Prime Minister Paul Keating during a visit to Australia by
Vietnamese Minister for Transport and Communications Bui Danh Luu
last July.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon
Bilney, also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Luu for the
detailed design phase of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Tenders have been called and shortlisting will be completed
soon. A contract for the design is expected to be signed by
around March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge is scheduled to begin in June 1997
and to be finished towards the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Transit Goods Through Tanzania To be Escorted To Various Destinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Goods cleared at
Tanzanian ports for transit to neighboring countries will be
escorted to their various destinations in order to prevent tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Finance Minister Simon Mbilinyi was quoted by a
local press today as saying that the government was introducing
an escort system to prevent tax evasion by imports declared to be
on transit to neighboring countries but actually sold in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a seminar over the weekend that under the
scheme, trucks carrying in-transit consignments from the harbours
would be escorted by special vehicles up to the border. He said
that monitoring of goods in transit would be conducted by a
special department already established at the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Mbilinyi said that the department was to be provided with
special vehicles and other communicaton equipments, like the
"global Positioning system"(GPS) to keep track of moving vehicles
by satellite control. Radio communication network would monitor
vehicles' movement from the harbours to their respective
destinations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Government is believed to be losing millions of Tanzania
Shillings in revenue every year due to off loading of goods in
transit for sale in the country, with no customs duty or sales
tax paid.

<P>
PYONGYANG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- An official daily of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today accused the
United States of continuously increasing tension in the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on U.S. military exercises held in February in
South Korea and surrounding areas, the official daily Rodong
Sinmun said that the U.S. war games against the DPRK have been
intensified and are "staged in South Korea almost every day."
</P>
<P>
It warned that the increasing tension in the peninsula will not
only endanger the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. framework
agreement but also threaten peace in Northeast Asia and the
Asia-Pacific as a whole.
</P>
<P>
That will not be good for the United States either, it said.
</P>
<P>
If the agreed framework is to be smoothly implemented, it is
necessary for both sides to create favorable conditions for its
implementation, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The United States should give up its attempt to stifle the
DPRK and the idea of confrontation if it really wants to ensure
peace in the peninsula, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It said that one of the best ways to improve relations between
the DPRK and the U.S. and achieve a lasting peace in the peninsula
is to establish without delay a new peace mechanism as proposed by
the DPRK.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has urged public transport operators to observe safety
precautions to minimize the loss of lives at all times and
drivers to be always alert.
</P>
<P>
He made the demand at a memorial service held on Sunday for
the Moleli High School pupils who perished when their boat
capsized in Lake Chivero in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the Lake Chivero disaster in Harare province,
which claimed 22 lives, was a result of gross negligence by the
owners of the boat since there were no precautionary measures in
place to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it was unfortunate that so many lives were lost
because of sheer carelessness.
</P>
<P>
If there had been such precautionary measures the extent of
the loss of lives could have been minimized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that disasters involving school
children had seemed to be on the increase. Last weekend two
pupils from Jameson High School in Harare drowned in a swimming
pool at the school, barely three months after the Lake Chivero
disaster.

50 billion T.Shs. (about 90 million U.S. Dollars) at the Dar es
Salaam Port, which were on transit to Europe from Zambia.

</P>
<P>
The contraband originating from Kakonde of Zambia, whose
shipping papers purported that it was tea, was intercepted
following a tip to the police, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Consignment was to be shipped to Odessa of Ukraine aboard
MV Afro Asia Star.
</P>
<P>
On opening the container, police found 7.97 tonnes of drug

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Supports Palestinian Self-Rule in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Yossi Beilin, Minister at
Prime Minister's Office, said he supports granting administrative
responsibility to Palestinians over their lives in east Jerusalem,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The solution will be to set up an independent administration
in east Jerusalem, Beilin said in a Television interview Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, a key architect of the Oslo peace accords between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization when he was
deputy foreign minister, said that it will be a solution, which
will best serve both the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The plan which he supports, Beilin said, is one put forward by
former Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek.
</P>
<P>
He said that, within this framework, each community will be
responsible for their own needs, and full Israeli sovereignty
will be preserved over Jerusalem, which will therefore remain
Israel's undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
Beilin's statement came after a sharp row erupted between
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu
over Jerusalem Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Peres issued a strongly-worded statement refuting a Likud
allegation that he would agree to repartition of Jerusalem. He
angrily declared that the charge was not only baseless, but also
constituted "incitement," given public sensitivity to the future
of the city.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Carbomb Blasts in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Algiers, February 19 (Xinhua) - Twelve people were killed
and 22 others injured in two carbomb explosions in Algiers on
Sunday, the official Algerian news agency APS reported.
</P>
<P>
The blasts occurred in two districts on the outskirts of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The APS quoted a communique issued by the security services as
saying that the first blast at 06:50 p.m. (1750 GMT) in Ain Naadja
district killed four people and injured 18, and the second carbomb
exploded ten minutes later in Ain Taya killing eight people.
</P>
<P>
Both blasts came just as people were gathered to eat their
first meal of the day. They also came on the eve of festivities
marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were the latest in a series of carbomb explosions
since Ramadan began on January 21.
</P>
<P>
The government announced on Sunday, before the two car
bombs, that after the end of Ramadan it would permanently lift a
night curfew imposed four years ago to help its troops fight
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, an official statement said Algerian
security forces had killed 29 armed Muslim militants over the
past week in operations in 15 regions across the country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50,000 people have been killed in Algeria's political
violence since early 1992 when the government cancelled a general
elections which Islamists were poised to win.

DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi army has started
to withdraw from poll duties performed during the election
process, an official of the Election Commission (EC) said today.

<P>
In the capital, the army has already left their positions and
gone back to the barracks, the official said.

process around the country," he said.

law-enforcing agencies in helping maintaining security and law and
order during the polls.
</P>
<P>
The army sent troops to various parts of the country to recover
illegal arms and tried to ensure smooth polling.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders to Pay Less Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Finance
Minister Bill Birch today announced details of the long-awaited
tax cuts, putting the focus on high-income earners and working
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, effective from July 1 if getting through
the Parliament unchanged, people now earning between 9,500 dollars
(one NZ dollar equals about 0.66 US cents) and 30,875 dollars a
year will pay 24 percent as income taxes, compared with 28 percent
at present.
</P>
<P>
The rate will further drop to 21 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the threshold for the top earners, meaning those now
paying a tax rate of 33 percent will rise from 30,875 dollars to
34,200 dollars this July and 38,000 dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
But greater emphasis is laid on working families, who will
enjoy income tax cuts, bigger family support payments and a new
independent family tax credit.
</P>
<P>
It is calculated a working low-income family will get 35
dollars more a week, compared with top-income earners who will
have an extra 22 dollars a week.
</P>
<P>
According to Birch, giving working families special treatment
will improve incentives to work, as beneficiary families will
benefit only marginally from the tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
"The new tax credit lets us achieve two goals at once. It eases
the financial pressure on low and middle-income working families
and at the same time, makes it a lot more attractive for
beneficiary parents to move into full-time work," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Drama At Harare Police Station As ''Wife'' Turns Out To Be Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- There was drama at Harare
central police station last Friday when a ''woman'' who had been
arrested together with a man on suspicion of attempted fraud
refused to be escorted to cells for females and requested to be
detained with men, the local ''The Herald'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ''woman'' confessed that he was in face a man, drawing
laughter from investigating officers who, at the time, had begun
questioning ''her'' sanity.
</P>
<P>
To prove ''her'' point, ''she'' pulled off her shirt and
removed ''shr'' bra, transforming into a man. Pieces of old
cloth which were stuffed inside the bra cups to form artificial
breasts fell, much to the disbelief and amusement of the
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
''They claimed it made their job much easier as a couple
because most people would not regard a husband and wife teaming
up to do anything sinister. They were innovative conmen,''
police said.
</P>
<P>
It all started with the two, one of them dressed as a woman
and posing as the wife of the other, attempting to pay for
groceries at a shop in Harare at the weekend using a stolen
credit card.
</P>
<P>
An alert cashier noticed something amiss. The name on the
card was ''European'' while the couple looked decidedly
''local''.
</P>
<P>
Further investigations by police revealed that the two were
also allegedly involved in theft from cars and bag snatching in
the city, mostly outside night clubs.

NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sunshine Group Company in

<HEADLINE> Bonded Business Grows in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade has gained many
benefits from bonded business in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Jiangsu, one of China's economic powerhouses, had
48,400 bonded contracts, valued at 41.56 billion yuan, making it
the second largest bonded trade province in China following
Guangdong, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has 219 bonded factories, 71 bonded warehouses and 12
bonded trade enterprise groups, leading other provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has developed bonded business because processing with
imported materials accounts for a large segment of foreign trade,
which has averaged a growth rate of more than 30 percent since
1990.
</P>
<P>
To help the expansion of bonded trade, local customs have
assessed credit and risks in enterprises involved in bonded trade
and enforcement of regulations has also been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
While allowing the best enterprises in bonded trade to
discipline themselves in 1995, customs officials made more efforts
to check others and have collected 280 million yuan of tariffs in
arrears, doubling the figure for 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Suzhou, where there is an industrial park sponsored by the
Chinese and Singapore governments, the customs department has set
up a special system to make the import of materials convenient and
ensure the collection of tariffs.

COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan expatriates living

by funds collected from abroad. Some expatriate Tamils living in
England and elsewhere in the West, fan the flames of terrorism by
willingly contributing to the cause."

The rebels have been engaged in operations in Britain and other
Western countries since 1983 and using the offices there both for
propaganda purposes and for collecting funds.

<HEADLINE> Kohl in Moscow for Talks With Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
arrived here late today for a three-day visit during which he will
try to allay Russia's fears of the NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's another aim is to demonstrate his support for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's bid to win a second term in the June
election.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, due to meet Yeltsin on Monday, is the first Western
leader to be received by Yeltsin after he declared his
presidential candidacy last week.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Germany have clashed over the NATO's planned
eastward enlargement to compass former Warsaw Pact nations and
some former Soviet republics, including Russia's neighbor Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin official told reporters recently that Moscow had made
it clear to Germany that its opposition to NATO's expansion was
out of concern about state security.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has also warned Germany, which is a staunch supporter of
NATO expansion, that the expansion would jeopardize cooperation
between Russia and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
But the official said the differences will not impede the
development of a partnership between Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"No thorny issue exists in Russian-German relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will also discuss the protracted Chechen conflict with
Yeltsin. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Australian Labor Narrows Gap With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Australian Labor
Party is closing in to the Liberal-National opposition coalition
from behind after three weeks of federal election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The latest McNair Poll conducted last weekend showed that on a
two-party preferred basis, the Labor government's support rate
rose three percentage points to 47 percent, while the coalition's
dropped three points to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
Labor had halved the gap between the two groups from 12
percentage points to six percentage points in the past week, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The past week saw dramatic developments in the election
campaign, with both Labor and coalition released their major
policies.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader and Prime Minister Paul Keating tried to focus
public attention on the republic issue, promising to give all
Australian's a say in whether the country should have an elected
president to replace the Queen of the United Kingdom as head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Labor also waged a massive attack on the funding measures of
election promises released by the coalition. Deputy Prime Minister
Kim Beazley alleged that the coalition would be unable to push
through three billion Australian dollars (2.25 billion US dollars)
of its savings measures.
</P>
<P>
The coalition proposed to slash public service expenditures and
sell one-third of the government-own telecommunication company,
Telstra, to fund its promises.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are opposed by public servants and ethnic groups,
who will be the hardest hit under a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Conservation groups also criticize the coalition for its
linking environment funding with the unlikely sale of Telstra.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that the coalition could not find enough money to
honor its promise of providing one billion Australian dollar (750
million US dollar) tax rebates for middle-income families over
three years.
</P>
<P>
He narrowly beat the coalition leader, John Howard, in a
television debate a week ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the opinion poll was conducted before the launch of
the coalition's election campaign Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition offered the voters direct cash rebate on income
taxes, while the Labor government only promised indirect profits
such as better children health care and more social welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
Both sides confessed that the contest was extremely close.
Experience in the past federal elections showed that public
opinion swung widely and could not indicate the final result until
the last few days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
With two weeks to go to the March 2 election, Labor has yet to
come within striking distance of the coalition.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Finance Minister
Lajos Bokros offered to resign today after he came to see that it
was impossible to push forward with reforms in the country's
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn accepted Bokros'
resignation and at a press conference here after a cabinet
meeting, he praised Bokros for advocating a policy of economic
austerity.
</P>
<P>
Hungary will continue to implement Bokros's policy and reforms,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bokros, maker of the country's current economic policy, had
been enforcing measures of austerity since March 1995 when he
assumed office as the second finance minister of the Horn cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Bokros had asked for resignation several times in recent months
under the attack of his opponents and some groups harmed by his
austerity policy.
</P>
<P>
Bokros became the seventh minister to resign in Hungary since
June 1994 when Horn formed the cabinet. And all the resignations
were related to the country's economic policy.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Seek Governments Help over Bosman Case Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Member nations of European
soccer's ruling body UEFA are to seek help from their governments
to discuss the transfer regulations and nationality restrictions
by the European Union last December following the Bosman case.
</P>
<P>
Meeting here on Sunday, members decided to seek more time to
implement the EU ruling.
</P>
<P>
They feared the Bosman judgement removing UEFA's three
foreigners restrictions for teams in European competitions could
threaten the future of the sports.
</P>
<P>
The EU gave UEFA a March 1 deadline to remove their
nationality restrictions and UEFA would be watching closely to see
whether the voluntary policy would work when the next ties were
played on March 6.
</P>
<P>
UEFA spokesman David Will said that the transfer system had
evolved over 100 years and the nationality restrictions had
applied for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"We want governments to see national identities are retained in
sport which we feel should be a special case," he added.
</P>
<P>
UEFA president Lennart Johannson said: "We shall turn to
national governments for their assistance in getting special
treatment for sport in future. That might take some time but we
have to start somewhere."
</P>
<P>
UEFA chiefs would continue their discussions in London on
further talks on the Bosman ruling and other issues.

fulfilled and the 1980 gross national product (GNP) quadrupled
five years ahead of schedule.

all-French final of the 539,250 U.S. dollars Marseille tennis
tournament on Sunday.

He needed one hour and 33 minutes to upset the compatriot.

Pioline, a former U.S. Open finalist, made too many unforced

Forget has now won 11 ATP Tour titles with eight of them in
France. He has dropped from fourth place in the world rankings in

<HEADLINE> British Public Supports Talks with Sinn Fein: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Two out of three British voters
think that negotiations with Sinn Fein should be reopened despite
the powerful bomb blast in east London on February 9 plotted by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), says a poll published here today.
</P>
<P>
The NOP poll conducted for the Sunday Times weekly shows that
89 percent of the votes blamed the IRA for scuppering the peace
process, but the poll dashes any home among the government
ministers that the bomb explosion would turn the public against
the political aim of Irish nationalism, namely the reunification
of the whole island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Only one in three voters wants Ulster to remain part of the UK
in the long term, and furthermore 40 percent want all British
troops out of the troubled province within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows 63 percent of the voters think that the
government "should be willing to talk to Sinn Fein in order to
find a way to restore the ceasefire".

<HEADLINE> France to Buy Pilotless Spy-Planes from Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France will purchase five
pilotless espionage aircraft from Israel, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency quoted Israel Radio as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The deal amounts to 20 million U.S. dollars, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The French newspaper Le Monde reported that France bought the
Israeli Hunter planes because the unmanned spy plane it was using
was unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Hunter was chosen because it is equipped
with optical and infrared intelligence-gathering devices and the
means for transmission in real time. The plane can fly for nine
hours continuously with a payload of 110 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The plane can reach an altitude of 5,500 meters at 200
kilometers per hour and requires only 600 meters for landing and
taking off, the paper said.

ADDIS ABABA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of Twenty
on Refugees of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) met at OAU
headquarters here today to discuss the refugee situation in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU source here, the meeting attended by

report of OAU Secretary General Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim to the
forthcoming 63rd ordinary session of the council of ministers to
be held here on February 26-28.

minority Tutsis and hutu moderates in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops have rung up at least two refugee camps in the
east to pressurize one million refugees to return to Rwanda, but
they fear that once they return, they would be killed by the
Tutsi-dominated troops at home.
</P>
<P>
There are 7 million refugees and 20 million displaced people
in African continent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Political Parties Fail to Set Balloting Date, Peres Prefers May 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- As the election campaign
heated up, Israeli's rival political parties today still failed to
agree on a date for the balloting.
</P>
<P>
In a stormy meeting today, the ruling Labor Party and the
opposition Likud could not settle on a date. Labor decided
afterwards that it would move without the opposition's consent.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said he wanted to hold the
voting on May 20, which was originally slated for late October.
</P>
<P>
Peres said he preferred May 14, but would agree to a delay of
several days if religious parties, which wanted the election
later, asked for it.
</P>
<P>
But Labor officials said they would reject Likud demands to
push the date to June 4.
</P>
<P>
A parliament committee was to meet Tuesday to work out the date
before a final decision on the date which must be held this week.

<HEADLINE> UN-Iraq Talks on Oil-for-Food Terminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The talks between the
United Nations and Iraq on oil-for-food plan came to an end here
today after 14 sessions of discussion, a senior U.N. officer said
here today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell, head of the U.N.
delegation, said that the discussion was conducted in a
business-like and positive manner.
</P>
<P>
But, no agreement has been reached as the talks were technical.
"This was a normal procedure in any negotiations of the kind in
which we have involved. It is natural to have it before a decision
is ultimately made at the political level," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the fruit of the talks, he said that a paper reflecting the
discussions will be presented to Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"We had a difficult task. But, we have done our duty and we are
now in a position to report to our principals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that there are many technical aspects hidden
behind the text of the resolution (986) and many of them are quite
complicated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they had to discuss very detailed issues like oil
production and sales, the escrow account to be established
following Resolution 986, purchase, transportation and
distribution of food, bank transaction related to both purchase of
food and oil sales, and observation of equal distribution of food,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq talks began on February 6 with the U.N.
delegation headed by Hans Corell and the Iraqi side led by
Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, former Iraq's permanent representative to
the United Nations and currently ambassador to the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions, including oil embargo, on
Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The five and a half years long sanctions have crippled Iraqi
economy and hurt a whole generation of children in the country.
According to a report of the World Food Program, four million
or one fifth of the Iraqi population suffer from severe
malnutrition. They include 2.4 million children under the age of
five and 600,000 pregnant and nursing women.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation there,
the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export petroleum worth two billion dollars in six
months for import of food and other necessities. The Iraqi
government, however, refused to implement the resolution until
January 16.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Bomb Explosion in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today condemned a bomb explosion in London Sunday night as a
"cowardly act of terrorism" and promised continued support for
peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Reports from London said that the Irish Republican Army has
claimed responsibility for the explosion which destroyed a
double-decker bus in London's tourist district and injured nine
people.
</P>
<P>
"I condemn these acts of violence in the strongest terms and
hope those responsible are brought swiftly to justice," Clinton
said in a written statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
He vowed the United States will continue a dialogue with the
Irish and British governments and the parties involved in the
conflict "to support their efforts to restore the ceasefire and
find a lasting and just peace."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president had condemned a deadly bomb attack on
February 9 in east London, which broked a 17-month truce.
</P>
<P>
"We must not let the men of the past ruin the future of the
children in Northern Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a press report here said that Clinton will delay his
decision until the last minute on whether to grant a U.S. visa to
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA political wing Sinn Fein, to see if
the violence continues. Adams wants to visit the United States
for St. Patrick's Day in mid-March.
