<HEADLINE> Britain's Chancellor Favors Joining Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British finance
minister Gordon Brown said here on Monday that Britain will not
rule out joining the single currency as its economic interests
lied in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Party Conference at this northwestern
coastal city, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at a time
when the balance of risks in the world economy is shifting, "a
Britain facing up to the challenges must work with other countries
and implement a reform agenda for global stability and growth."
</P>
<P>
"A Britain which sees that our national economic interest lies
in a Europe, that is a zone of stability and growth will reject
the isolationism of the Conservative Party, and refuse to rule out
constructive engagement, particularly on the single currency, on
the basis of ideological dogma."
</P>
<P>
So far Britain has stated it would not join the first wave of
the single currency in the current parliament that ends in 2001
under strong domestic pressure. The European Monetary Union will
be launched on January 1, 1999 and 11 out of 15 EU members have
qualified to join the single currency at the first wave.
</P>
<P>
He said the task of the British government was to make the
country equipped for every challenge of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Brown also said that to ensure global coordination and a better
equipped IMF and World Bank, the British government will put
forward a proposal at next weeks IMF meeting in Washington on a
new and pioneering global code of conduct for social policy.
</P>
<P>
He would travel to the IMF on Tuesday personally to argue for
policies for stability, growth and fairness to ensure that our
obligations to the unemployed and the vulnerable are nmet in every
part of the world.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
John Major Monday paid tribute to outgoing German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who was defeated in Sunday's German general election.
</P>
<P>
Major, whose Conservative Party was defeated in British general

His image sometimes over here has not been good because it has
been portrayed in a very downbeat way."
</P>
<P>
"But the truth is that he was and is a very remarkable man.
Insofar as his policies could accommodate it he was very
pro-British and was often extremely helpful. He rarely got credit
for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major, who described German reunification as a "very remarkable
event", also paid tribute to Kohl's role as a "strong NATO ally"

<HEADLINE> Singapore FM Calls for Sticking to Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar, has outspoken to defend globalization, as Asia's
economic crisis is arousing more skepticism over the drive,
according to a summary released by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the 53rd session of the United Nations
General Assembly Monday, Jayakumar said the way ahead is not to
turn backs on globalization, adding that it is not a viable or
realistic option.
</P>
<P>
"To repudiate globalization will hurt our long-term growth
prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing there was "no subject more important" than
globalization, Jayakumar said: "The process of globalization had
enhanced the free flow of goods and services, capital and
information, spurred innovation and competition and lifted
hundreds of millions of people out of poverty."
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing that East Asia had enjoyed unprecedented
growth, he conceded that the opening up to the global market by
the economies desiring for a freer flow of capital had made them
more vulnerable, and the forces of globalization had transformed
what should have been a national problem into a regional problem
that was fast threatening to become a global crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar cautioned against the temptation to take the easiest
way and close doors on globalization. Instead, he called for the
U.N. to play a leading role in the international effort to help
countries "reap the benefit of globalization."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the alternative -- to turn the clock back
and walk away from free trade -- would have implications that were
not just domestic or merely economic.
</P>
<P>
"If countries were unable to gain access to the raw materials,
goods and services they need through peaceful and open
competition, they would resort to other means," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Economic rivalries could have political and military
consequences and a return to global tensions could not be ruled
out," he added.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the only way forward was to find solutions to
deal with the vulnerabilities brought by globalization, and called
for higher standards of government, the strengthening of
regulatory and supervisory frameworks, the improvement of
corporate governance, increased transparency, and less government
interference in market decision.

<HEADLINE> U.N. High-Level Delegation Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-level
delegation from the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP)
arrived in Iran on Monday on a seven-day visit, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of the mission is to elaborate, in close
consultation with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
a strategy to effectively address the current flow of illicit
opiates into Iran from Afghanistan, and the abuse of these drugs
within the country," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Iran, the delegation will appraise the
general drug control situation in Iran and assess the measures
currently being taken by the Iranian Government against the
illicit drug trafficking from Afghanistan, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
They will also review the status and level of activities for
the prevention of drug abuse in Iran, as well as the Government's
efforts to promote public awareness against drug abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current visit is an outcome of the two recent official
visits to Iran by Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the
Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, in April and July
this year. On the both occasions, Arlacchi had an opportunity to
meet with Iranian President Mohmmed Khatemi to discuss matters of
common interest in the field of drug control.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Vice President of the European
Parliament Renzo Imbeni, is composed of senior diplomats from
Germany and Belgium, high-ranking officials from drug control
organizations in France, Spain and the UNDCP. A law enforcement
consultant from the United Kingdom is also part of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Iran has exerted strenuous efforts to stem
the illicit flow of morphine base and heroin of Afghan origin
destined to the illicit markets in the Western countries, by
developing large numbers of law enforcement personnel in the
border areas to combat traffickers and by investing large
financial exclusively from national budget.

LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles

</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Taylor will hold talks with French
President Jacques Chirac Monday, and is likely to discuss
possible French assistance in rebuilding the main power plant in
Liberian capital Monrovia, which has not been functioning
properly since the civil war began in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Finance Minister Elie Saleeby, who arrived in Paris
earlier along with other members of the delegation, was quoted as
saying that the talks between the two sides will focus on economic
issues.

The two sides will also review two important bilateral
agreements on the protection and promotion of investments and

Noting that seven years of civil war has left a devastated
infrastructure and a substantially displaced population, the
minister said, "Liberia is just emerging from a fragile war
situation and needs international assistance to resolve pressing
post-conflict problems."
</P>
<P>
Critical areas include re-settlement of refugees, re-training,
creation of jobs and rebuilding of the country's social and
economic infrastructure, he said.

<HEADLINE> 30 Percent Food Lost Annually in Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The annual pre and post
harvest food losses due to insects, diseases, birds and rodents
are estimated to be over 30 percent in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Abera Dilo, Deputy Director of the
Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization, at an international
conference on the controlling of post-harvest losses in maize and
wheat, which was opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, Abera said, a higher proportion of the potential
yield of crops grown is lost due to pests and diseases than in
any other part of the world.
</P>
<P>
For countries where millions of people are suffering from lack
of adequate food, such a loss cannot be tolerated, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Abera, it is estimated that about 10 to 15
percent of the world's maize production is lost every year to
insects, diseases and other pests.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is jointly organized by Sasakawa Globe 2000
and the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization, is attended
by delegates from African countries, including Tanzania, Uganda,
Burundi and Ethiopia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yemen Opens First Conference on Oil and Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yemen opened its first
conference on oil and gas here on Monday in an effort to attract
more investment to the economically vital sector.
</P>
<P>
The conference, under the auspices of the Yemeni Ministry of
Oil and Mineral Resources, was to brief investors on Yemen's
economic potentials and its policy on developing oil and gas and
encouraging investment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani said Yemen attaches great importance to new investments
in the oil and gas sector and has signed contracts with five
foreign companies for oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues boosted national economy and brought down the
inflation rate and budget deficit and helped stabilize the
exchange rate of the national currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more investment opportunities will
be created in Yemen's oil and gas sector by the current conference.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources Mohammad al-Khadim
al-Wajeeh told the participants that his ministry has given
concessions to 13 companies from different countries to prospect
19 out of 57 areas that are hopeful of oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Five are already producing oil and gas, he said. Another 33
sites are open for investment, and 40 local and foreign firms are
working there, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, attended by some 300 participants
representing Arab and foreign firms and international
organizations, will discuss 60 papers and feasibility studies on
oil and gas exploration in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni government will launch several projects to enhance the
use of gas a source of energy instead of crude oil, whose
production stands at 380,000 barrels a day.

UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would cooperate
fully With the U.N. chief in good faith as well as in a
professional and objective manner in solving the recent standoff
between the United Nations and Iraq, Tareq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tareq made the remark after holding one-hour meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Aziz and Annan discussed the recent
standoff between Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM)
as well as Annan's ideas for a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions which demand Iraq scrape all its
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Aziz said " The comprehensive review is
not a reward to Iraq. The Idea that Iraq should do this or that
concession before the comprehensive review takes place is not
legal and is not logical."
</P>
<P>
"The review is a moral and legal action by the U.N. Security
Council itself in accordance with its own resolution 687. That
resolution requires it implement the obligation in every six
days," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has complied with resolutions of the Security Council for
seven years and a half, and the Security Council has not taken
steps to reduce or lift the sanctions against Iraq according to
its own resolution," Aziz added.
</P>

The Deputy Prime Minister described his meeting with Annan as
cordial and constructive.

Aziz arrived at the Headquarters of the United Nations over the
weekend. He will stay here for a couple of days during which he is

<HEADLINE> Russia Moves to Pay Soldiers' Back Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
paid off its debt in back wages to soldiers, and students will
soon receive their stipends, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wage and pension arrears have long dogged Russia, where many
workers, teachers and soldiers go without pay for months, even
before the onset of the latest bout of financial crisis that came
to a head August 17 when the Sergei Kiriyenko government
effectively devalued the ruble and defaulted on some domestic and
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who took office just two weeks ago and is still
struggling to form a fully functioning government, has repeatedly
stressed the payment of such debts as the top priorities.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates published in the Kommersant earlier this
month, Russia owed a total of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in back
salaries and social payments. Of that sum, 233 million dollars was
owed to the military.
</P>
<P>
The painful process of government-forming continued Monday,
when President Boris Yeltsin appointed Farid Gazizullin as head of
the Committee for State Property Management, the agency in charge
of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Boris Fyodorov, seen in the West as a strong proponent of
market-oriented reform, was dismissed from his posts of acting
deputy prime minister and tax chief. Acting Deputy Prime Minister
Viktor Khristenko was also ousted, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
So far, posts of nine ministers remain vacant, but First Deputy
Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said the formation of the government
had been completed.
</P>
<P>
Gustov made the statement as he presented the new nationalities
minister, Ramazan Abdulatipov, to his subordinates on Monday, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin will appoint Valery Kirpichnikov minister in
charge of regional policy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kirpichnikov is currently vice-governor of the Leningrad region
and president of the Union of Russian Cities.
</P>
<P>
Judging from Gustov's statement, it appeared that the Primakov
will make do with two first deputy prime ministers and three
deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The fourth deputy prime minister, Alexander Shokhin, who was
put in charge of financial policy, resigned from the cabinet last
Friday after just 10 days on the job.
</P>
<P>
He said he was stepping down to protest the reappointment of
Mikhail Zadornov as finance minister. He insisted that Shokhin was
among those to blame for the previous cabinet's August 17
decision.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yeltsin said Shokhin's decision to quit was "an act
not becoming a statesman."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he was not going to make haste in filling
Shokhin's slot after his "unexpected demarche".

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Quick Delivery of Oil Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua)-- Iraq Monday called for quick
delivery of the badly-needed equipment for its oil sector, blaming
the United States and Britain for the delay of approval of
contracts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told a press
conference Monday evening that no spare parts for oil equipment
have arrived in Iraq after four months has passed since the start
of the current fourth phase of oil-for-food program which began in
June.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said 28 contracts concerning Iraq's purchase of oil
production equipment had been held by the U.S. and Britain, adding
that a total of 59 contracts valued at more than 200 million
U.S. dollars and concluded under the fourth phase oil-for-food
deal have been blocked by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister complained that the oil-for-food deal has
not alleviated the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained repeatedly that the slow process of
approving contracts by the U.N. Sanctions Committee on Iraq and
delivering the contracted goods have caused deaths among citizens
suffering curable illnesses and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agreed to increase the oil-for-food
program to 5.2 billion dollars under the fourth phase from the
previous 2 billion dollars every six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also allowed Iraq to import 300 million dollars worth
of spare parts and equipment to repair its oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq says it cannot meet the ceiling but would manage
to sell 4 billion dollars of oil for the current six months period
due to low world oil prices and production problems.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria Ready for Talks With Turkey Over Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official has
said that Iraq and Syria are willing to hold dialogs with Turkey
over river water sharing.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Irrigation Minister Abdul Salman voiced the
position after the meeting of a technical committee Monday, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Salman said "Iraq and Syria are ready for dialogs to find a
solution that will take into considerations of the legitimate
rights of these two countries."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salman said both Iraq and Syria were deeply
concerned over Turkey's continuation in building dams over the
upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates, which make it more
difficult for them to get more water.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Syria and Iraq have long been haggling over the water
sharing of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which originate in
Turkey and flow down to Syria and Iraq before pouring into the
Persian gulf.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol signed between Turkey and Syria in 1987,
Turkey releases at least 500 cubic meters of Euphrates water per
second to Syria prior to the completion of Turkey's Ataturk Dam on
the river.
</P>
<P>
The protocol also stipulates that the two countries should
hammer out a new agreement on a higher share once the dam was
completed.
</P>
<P>
The dam was erected in 1991, but no new agreement has been
sealed because of the strained relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants, who have been fighting
since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq have been lobbying the Arab world to pressure
Turkey to release more water to them.
</P>
<P>
But Ankara has insisted that the water dispute should be
discussed only after the Syrian government halt its support to the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ankara failed to attend the just concluded six-day meeting of
the tripartite technical committee, which was set up in 1980 and
held its last meeting in 1992, though an invitation was extended.
</P>
<P>
However, Salman said possibilities still exist to continue
these meetings in the future in any time and at any place as long
as Iraq and Syria receive invitation from the Turkish government.

Clinton told reporters he have asked Netanyahu and Arafat to
come back again in mid-October while Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Ambassador Ross will go back to the Middle East in
early October.
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm convinced that the two leaders and the people they

Clinton.

Albright and Ross will "try to see how much preparatory work

added Clinton.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting of the three leaders, Clinton also met
privately with Netanyahu while Arafat returned to New York to
address the U.N. General Assembly. Arafat is expected to be back
to the White House to meet Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>

The Middle East peace process has been in an impasse because
the Israelis disagreed on a U.S. proposal that Israeli troops
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, claiming it created too

Israel agreed reportedly that it would withdraw from 13 percent
of the land if three percent of the territory was set aside as a
nature reserve, where security was provided by Israelis.
</P>

Arafat and Netanyahu met in New York under the auspices of
Albright, the first one-one-one meeting they had in a year.

ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Four rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in recent military
operations launched by Turkish government troops, the Anatolia
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an official statement as saying that these

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Wishes a Larger Cooperation with Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister
Radu Vasile Monday expressed the hope that his country would have
a larger and more fruitful cooperation with Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to convey to you the sincerest congratulations on
the victory of Social Democratic Party in the general election in
Germany," Radu Vasile said in a congratulatory letter to Gerhard
Schroeder, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, who won
the general election on Sunday and will serve as the new
chancellor of Germany.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good opportunity for me to reaffirm Romania's interest
in a larger and more fruitful co-operation with your great
country," said the Romanian Prime Minister, expressing his hope
that Romanians would enjoy Schroeder's visit to Bucharest as soon
as possible, "which would be a positive sign of bilateral
relations being relaunched."
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on Monday evening, Radu Vasile also
praised the outgoing chancellor Helmut Kohl for his contribution
to the unity of his nation as well as to the strengthening of
German-Romanian bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of German elections evoked reactions among Romanian
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Romanian-German relations will not be influenced by
the German elections outcome. Foreign policy is a national one not
that of a single political party. I hope we will further enjoy
Germany's support for the Romanian economy's recovery,"
Ion Diaconescu, the Speaker of the Romanian Chamber of
Deputies and the leader of the ruling coalition's major party
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ion Iliescu, leader of the Party of Social Democracy, the
largest opposition, expressed the hope that the relations between
Romania and Germany will keep developing, after the new
Governement's coming to rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has grown into one of
the largest third-party ship management centers in the world,
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day international meeting on marine insurance
opened here Monday, Christodoulou said there are about 100
offshore enterprises on the island in 1996 with fully fledged
offices which engaged in ship management and other maritime
services.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus ranks fifth on the list of the leading maritime
nations in the world, and the country also enjoys comparative
advantages.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus offers numerous tax incentives and inexpensive
registration and annual fees, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Cyprus flag should not be regarded as a flag of
convenience," Christodoulou stressed, noting that Cyprus has
ratified the major international conventions on maritime safety,
prevention of sea pollution, training, certification and
watch-keeping of seafarers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was participated by more than 10 countries from
Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It will discuss issues relating to insurance of vessels and
cargo transportation, European Union policy on sea safety and
prevention of sea pollution.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Launch Year of Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will on October 1 launch the International Year of
Older Persons 1999 to promote action strategies on the
fast-changing demographic picture of older persons.
</P>
<P>
Annan will speak on the theme of the year "towards a society
for all ages", the U.N. Department of Public Information said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Population Division defines older persons as those
aged 60 years and above. Growing longevity has caused global life
expectancy to climb 20 years since 1950 to the current level of 66
years.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of the world population is now 60 years or
older. By 2050 the figure will soar to 20 percent and by 2150 it
will be 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The share of those aged 80 years or older in the older persons'
group will grow from the current 11 percent to 27 percent by 2050.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the numbers and proportions of the aging will
have influence on social and economic development in terms of
health care, employment, social security and other areas
especially in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The designation of 1999 as the International Year of Older
Persons was decided in 1992 by the U.N. General Assembly to
facilitate older persons' concerns and encourage activities within
a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
The Year's activities are expected to focus on raising
awareness of all ages to promote active aging, develop
appropriate care-giving strategies, address the situation of older
women, prepare youth for the future and promote good early
childhood development.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Approves Partial Privatization of Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved the partial privatization of the Nigerian Ports
Authority (NPA) in a bid to change the under-utilization of its
port facilities, the official News Agency of Nigeria said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of Transport, Pestus Porbeni made the
remarks at the weekend in Port Harcourt, in southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Porbeni said the government was trying to pave way for
investments in the ports, including leasing port facilities to
investors.
</P>
<P>
If investors were allowed to operate in the ports, more job
opportunities would be created and more ships would be attracted
to the ports, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the NPA to ensure that investors were
encouraged. He also urged the NPA to enter into leasing
arrangement, saying that those against the on-going leasing
arrangements were ignorant of the fact that it was the only
option left for the government to bring port facilities out of
their idleness.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the privatization exercise is not
going down well with the Senior Staff Association of the NPA,
which insisted that it ought to have been consulted so that the
exercise would not lead to mass entrenchment in the port system.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, the reform has already begun in the
Apapa port in Lagos, where some offices, warehouses and stacking
areas have been leased to private investors.

MAPUTO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique started Monday to
inoculate for the second time children under five years against
polio.
</P>
<P>
The objective set by the health authorities is to vaccine
about three million children by October 2.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said 97 percent of children under five
around the country were vaccined during August 24 and 28.
</P>
<P>
Four cases of polio were reported in Mozambique last year, all
of which were discovered in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Health experts believe that there is still the danger of the
possible spread of the disease so long as there are virus
carriers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government has mobilized the press and medical
personnel to ensure every child under five years of age is
inoculated against polio.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year EFF $864 Mln for Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Monday announced the approval of a three-year credit
for Bulgaria equivalent to some 864 million U.S. dollars under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided to support the government's medium-term
economic report program for July 1998 to June 2001. Of the total,
the equivalent of about 72 million dollars is made available
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The medium-term program targets strong growth, at 4 to 5
percent GDP growth per annum, a decline in inflation to about 5
percent per year by 2001 and a substantial decline in the public
and external debt burden. The external current account deficit
will be kept in the range of 3 percent of GDP, a level considered
sustainable based on conservative assumptions about inflows of
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria joined the IMF in September 1990. Its quota is about
640 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 983 million dollars.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Buoyancy on Wall Street, amid
growing optimism of a U.S. rate cut Tuesday, supported European
equity markets Monday.
</P>
<P>
Strength among Wall Street's banking stocks, prompted by
optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates
Tuesday, helped London shares shake off their earlier lethargy to
finish on the upside.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed up 32.5 at 5,093.5, just below its 5,097.3
session best, set about half-an-hour before close.
</P>
<P>
Steady Asian markets and the Dow's resilience Friday to fears
of more hedge fund woes initially saw shares higher. But buying
support had evaporated by mid-morning. At one point, the FTSE 100
hit a session low of 5,022.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that with the end of the third quarter
approaching, some players had decided to sit tight in volatile
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We are really just trading on the day-to-day stories which
affect stocks, like LTCM last week" the dealer said. "There are
still opportunities to buy at bargain prices."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares moved higher in late afternoon
trade, lifted by Wall Street's strong start. The Xetra Dax closed
97.06 points higher at 4,681.47.
</P>
<P>
However, gains were tempered by a slide in utility stocks on
the possibility that the new Social Democratic majority may
increase energy taxes.

<P>
In Paris, shares shook off mid-session losses to move ahead on
the back of a bullish start to New York trade. The Cac 40 finished

Traders said news of a fall in overall demand for French
industrial goods in the past three months clouded sentiment.

The foreign minister made the remarks as he was addressing the
general debate of the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"We may be sliding toward worldwide recession. We may even be
on the edge of a global depression if urgent steps are not taken
through international collaboration and cooperation to halt the
slide and reverse the trend," said Badawi, whose country has been
badly battered by the turmoil affecting East Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis that "descended on East Asian countries
over a year ago" had brought social misery, political instability
and economic turmoil, Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
The rights of millions to live a life free from the scourge of
poverty and to have a decent standard of living with some basic
necessities had been "trampled by the manipulators of the currency
markets. Indeed, the super rich have impoverished the poor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Badawi called for reform of international economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"There must be rules to encourage greater transparency.
Financial operators must abide by certain internationally accepted
regulations," he said. "They must accept closer supervision so as
to distinguish between genuine investors and currency
speculators."
</P>
<P>
A few developed countries on their own could not resolve the
problem and "cannot forever remain rich and prosperous if more
than two-thirds of the countries of the world remain poor and
socially and political unstable," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his welcome to a call by U.S. President Bill Clinton
for a conference in Washington on the financial and economic
crisis facing the world.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, in the absence of reforms or internationally
well-tested formula or guidelines, Malaysia has taken steps to
impose currency and capital controls to insulate its economy from
currency uncertainties while at the same time continue to be
active in international trade and continue to welcome foreign
investment," the foreign minister added.

<HEADLINE> CPP Agrees to Recount Unused Ballots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) agreed on Tuesday to recount all unused
ballots in the July 26 election in response to a demand by
the opposition Funcinpec party and the Sam Rainsy Party.(SRP)
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation was reached on Tuesday at the first
three-party negotiation in Phnom Penh. The three sides sent a
working team composed of seven members for the joint session and
told the press they had reached two agreements during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement is to ask the National Election Committee
(NEC) to recount all unused ballots in the July election. Second
is to reconvene the three-party working teams session on October 5
to elect the chairpersons of the National Assembly and nine
special committees.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP are demanding a recounting of the
ballots and a review of the formula used to determine seat
allocations in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the two demands were not negotiable because
the opposition had dropped two other demands for recounting votes
and re-voting in certain parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and Funcinpec Monday briefly outlined their objectives
for the coalition negotiations. CPP politicians reiterated that
they expected their negotiations with Funcinpec would focus on
setting the new government in motion.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec announced three objectives in the coalition
negotiations: to ensure the National Assembly will function
fairly, to calm down outstanding election complaints and to
acquire amnesty for five Funcinpec officials.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Funcinpec and SRP staged a series of protests in
the capital. At least two people were reportedly killed in clashes
between protesters and police.

ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped the situation in
neighboring Albania would soon return to normal, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the resignation of Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano, Reppas said that if democratic institutions were working,
the transfer of power from one person to another did not
constitute a dramatic development.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also said Tuesday
that Albania was currently in the throes of a political crisis,
which could lead to new operational procedures of the neighboring
country that would disengage it from the policies of the past.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece could offer its undivided support for
stabilization of the political system if the democratic procedures
and political decisions were respected in Albania.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Receive More Aid From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan is considering an
additional assistance of around 100 million U.S. dollars to
Bangladesh for flood relief and post-flood rehabilitation, the
official BSS news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry indicated to Bangladeshi
Ambassador in Tokyo that Japan is considering this additional
assistance on the basis of recommendations of a Japanese
fact-finding team that recently visited Dhaka, BSS quoted a
message from the Bangladeshi Embassy in Tokyo as saying.
</P>
<P>
This would be in addition to the Japanese emergency
humanitarian assistance of 220,000 dollars which was provided
immediately after the devastating floods hit Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Besides the additional assistance, Japan is also considering
extending yen loans for a Dhaka flood protection embankment
project upon receiving details of the project from the Bangladeshi
government.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is also considering building flood
shelters and would conduct further discussion and study on this
matter, the message said. It added that the additional package of
aid is expected to be announced soon.

CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Transport and Communications
has decided to resume Cairo-Amman-Baghdad bus trips in two weeks,
which was suspended after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
Egypt's Alam Al Yom daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chairman of the Arab Land Transport
Company Sami Fayed as saying that Egypt has reached an agreement
with two passenger companies of Jordan and Iraq on operating the
business.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- The Beirut-based Arab Civil Aviation Organization
has decided to restore the membership of the Iraqi Airways, which
was suspended after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Airways General Manager Rabie Mohamed Saleh said that he
has met with Secretary General of the organization Abdul Wahab
Tufaha on the issue and the members of the organization have
agreed to restore Iraq's membership.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian Arab Bank has announced that it would

<HEADLINE> Player's Death Caused by Heat: Autopsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A 13-year-old American
kid who collapsed last month during a football practice at St.
John's College High School died as a result of heat stroke, the
D.C. medical examiner's office said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It was an accidental death as a result of the exercise in a
hot environment," said Randy Moshos, director of forensic
investigations for the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bell, an incoming freshman at the Northwest Washington
private school, suffered a seizure on August 18 and was taken to
Children's medical center, where he died seven days later.
</P>
<P>
The outdoor temperature was 92 degrees Fahrenheit at the time
Bell collapsed. The combination of heat and exertion caused a
spike in his body temperature that damaged his vital organs and
cardiovascular system, said Jonathan L. Arden, the chief medical
examiner.
</P>
<P>
Bell's situation is "an extreme result," Ardan said. "We can't
always explain why one person has heat stroke. Some people will
cross a line where they lose temperature regulation. The amount
of heat and stress overwhelms their ability to regulate their
temperature."
</P>
<P>
Bell was running sprints on the field toward the end of the
first day of football practice when he appeared to be dizzy and
began to run in circles.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A domestic flight of Sri
Lanka's private Lionair from Jaffna to Colombo, with 48 passengers
and four crew members on board, went missing within half an hour
after its departure Tuesday afternoon, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The flight which left the Palaly Airport in the Jaffna
peninsula at 1:45 p.m. (local time) did not reach Ratmalana
airport in Colombo as scheduled at 2:45 p.m., the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The plane's crew members include two Russian pilots and all the
passengers are civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lionair is one of the two private airlines which carry civilian
passengers from Colombo to the war-torn North Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The airline has been recently threatened by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been fighting a 15-year war
for a separate state.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the LTTE rebels had anything to do with

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coach Search Awaits Queiroz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- If Carlos Queiroz agrees,
and can get out of his contract with the United Arab Emirates,
the well-respected coach from Portugal could be hired as the head
coach of the U.S. national soccer team.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Soccer Secretary General Hank Steinbrecher,
Queiroz, a Portuguese who recently completed a long awaited
report evaluating soccer in the United States, has yet to be
interviewed by USSF president Robert Contiguglia and is not easy
to interview.
</P>
<P>
"Carlos is in the middle of coaching right now," Steinbrecher
said. "They beat Qatar the other day."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an interview will occur, Steinbrecher said.
"Bruce Arena (D.C. United coach) may be favored but these things
continue to be fluid," Steinbrecher said.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. coach Bora Milutinovic, acquired by the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars, remains in the running, Steinbrecher
said, but Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira has dropped behind.
</P>
<P>
Steve Sampson's replacement likely will be chosen during the
Major League Soccer playoffs. The United States plays against
Australia on November 6 in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
If the new coach is not available then, Steinbrecher said,
Thomas Dooley could serve as player-coach or a national team
assistant could take over.
</P>
<P>
Also, the German Soccer Federation announced it will play the
United States on February 6, and Argentina on February 9 or 10.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Gold Store Presents Gold Book on Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading gold store in
Shanghai has "published" a book made of pure gold on late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, a volume said to be the first of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
The book, titled "Deng Xiaoping -- A Great Man of the Century",
was created by the Shanghai Laofengxiang Gold Store, which has a
history of 150 years. The book includes a collection of 50
pictures depicting Deng's life.
</P>
<P>
The producers say they applied technologies such as high-energy
physics to turn the gold paper, which originally was fragile and
easily broken, into soft and pliable material, all the while
maintaining its high purity.
</P>
<P>
The book was sent for display at the Second China Gem and Jade
Fair which opened today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is said to be China's largest market for the sale of
gold ornaments, and the volume of retail sales in the city's
jewelry and jadeware market totalled two billion yuan (about 250
million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the city hopes to establish itself as
one of the largest gem and jade markets in Asia by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Gem and Jade Fair is being held at the Shanghai No.1
Department Store, and will last six days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tactics Towards Iraq Changed, Says Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to
Kuwait James Larocco said here Tuesday that the U.S. has not
changed its policy towards Iraq, but "the tactics have changed,"
the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists and trainees at Kuna's Center for the
Development of Media Skills, Larocco reiterated that he hoped an
agreement would be reached between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Other options are not ruled out in case of a failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that the review of U.N. sanctions on Iraq will
take place "only if cooperation is resumed with the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM)" on eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see where this goes. What we have declared now is that
if all of this fails, we will not rule out any options including
military options to force Iraqi compliance," Larocco added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq triggered the latest Iraqi-U.N. standoff by deciding on
August 5 to suspend cooperation with both IAEA and UNSCOM. The
Iraqi move led to a U.N. stop of its regular 60-day reviews of
economic sanctions on Iraq on September 9.
</P>
<P>
Larocco warned last Wednesday that Iraq's non-cooperation with
the U.N. will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. "was pursuing a diplomatic option at this
time and we will continue to do so," but added "there are no
options off the table."
</P>
<P>
Larocco was accompanying David Good, director of the Office of
North African, Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs at the United
States Information Agency, who delivered a lecture to journalists
at Kuna, on "U.S. Public Diplomacy."

<HEADLINE> Speakers Focus on Globalization in General Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- As the 53rd General
Assembly session began the second week of its annual general
debate, high-level speakers called attention to the potential and
risks associated with economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Sigapore's minister for foreign affairs, Shanmugam Jayakumar,
said the world should not turn its back on globalization. Rather,
the international community should come together to help countries
reap globalization's benefits. He said the United Nations should
continue to serve as a forum for dialogue on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi called
for reform of the world's financial markets. "It has been said
that the markets would punish those countries which do not possess
proper financial structures and disciplines and which lack
transparency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the international financial market itself lacks
transparency," he said, adding that the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of currency bought and sold each day was under no global
surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
Domingo Siazon, the secretary of foreign affairs of the
Philippines, also addressed the "phenomenon of massive amounts of
capital flowing across national borders at lightening speed,
bloating economies into fragile bubbles as they rush in and
shaking economies to their foundations as they are withdrawn." He
said this aspect of globalization was fraught with risk and
required closer study.
</P>
<P>
James Michel, the vice-president of Seychelles, said that the
international community must extend support to developing
countries. In particular, he appealed to the European Union to
accept the request of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
for an extension of trade preferences under a World Trade
Organization waiver for a protracted period of time.
</P>
<P>
Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, the minister for foreign affairs and
international cooperation of the United Republic of Tazania, said
that the establishment by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
had been a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed concern about the "conditionalities associated
with this initiative." He said that the criteria for that
initiative should be made more objective so that more least
developed countries could qualify.
</P>
<P>
Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, the foreign minister of Brunei
Darussalam, stressed that as the United Nations worked to reform
itself, efforts should be made to ensure that the world body
continued to work on behalf of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
The work of the United Nations in the field "gives the
organization meaning to billions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Launch Campaign Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Health and Welfare
Ministry said Tuesday it would launch a six-month educational
campaign to spread information about AIDS and dispel myths
surrounding people inflicted with the disease.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it would conduct presentations and pass out
educational materials at school festivals in high schools and
universities across the country, starting at Hokkaigakuen
University in Sapporo on October 11 and continuing through next
March.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said they are targeting Japanese youth
because of the recent sharp increase in young people infected with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese who contracted the HIV virus last year
totaled 268, of which 88 or 33 percent were in their twenties, up
17 percent from 1996, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also prepared educational kits aimed at
teaching elementary school, junior high school and high school
students about AIDS.

BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 overseas
Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan gathered
in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing this evening to
celebrate the 49th founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the

Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China is enjoying increasing prestige worldwide with
the achievements scored in the reform and opening-up over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Although China suffered from severe floods this year, the army
and the people made joint efforts to fight the floods, and won a
significant victory in the campaign, he said, noting that the
Chinese people are confident and able to overcome all difficulties
and build China into a strong, prosperous, democratic and
civilized country.
</P>
<P>
Qian also voiced thanks to overseas Chinese for their help in
the flood-relief work, and said the Chinese government will
continue to offer a good investment environment and improve
services for them.

<HEADLINE> Arab Media to Launch Jerusalem Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab media experts will meet
here on Wednesday to work out plans for helping protect Jerusalem
from Israel's judaization attempts, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the experts will draw up an action plan to
expose Israel's incessant attempts to alter Jerusalem demographic
landscape by demolishing Arab houses and evicting Arab
inhabitants, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian permanent representative to the Arab League
Mohamed Sobeih is due to submit a detailed report to the meeting
on the developments of the Jerusalem issue and the Arab, Muslim
and international efforts against the illegal Israeli measures.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government drew Muslim anger and a chorus of world
criticism early this year when it made public a scheme to expand
the boundaries of Jerusalem, which is holy to Muslims, Christians
and Jews.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state while Israel claims
Jerusalem as its "undivided, eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
"The media plan also involves the publication of a series of
booklets entitled `Jerusalem Is of Arab Identity' in a number of
foreign languages, tracing the historical facts of the holy city,
and its Islamic and Christian landmarks," Sobeih said, quoted by
MENA.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the United Arab Emirates has financed the
production of a film on Jerusalem, which will be broadcast on Arab
TV channels soon.

<HEADLINE> AL Hails U.S. New Efforts in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Tuesday hailed the U.S. offer to hold
a tripartite summit in Washington next month as a sign of its
continuous efforts in Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab world sees that holding a second trilateral summit in
Washington of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a
necessary step towards overcoming a deteriorating Mideast peace
process," the AL chief told Egyptian Voice of Arabs in New York.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has invited Arafat and Netanyahu to return to
Washington in mid-October to try to wrap up a deal on the overdue
Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called on Israel to hand over 13 percent more of
the West Bank land to the Palestinians in exchange for intensified
Palestinian efforts to fight Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has accepted the formula, and Israel
agreed to hand back 10 percent of the West Bank to full
Palestinian control, with an additional 3 percent turned into a
nature reserve in which Israel has full security control for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Abdel-Meguid also affirmed the Arab solid
support of the palestinian people in their right for
self-determination and the establishment of their own state.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. Resolution 181 of 1947 called for the establishment of
two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, and all Israeli
attempts to obstruct the establishment of this state are
unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
With Palestinian-Israeli peace talks deadlocked for 18 months
due to Israel's intransigence, Arafat has threatened to announce
the intention to unilaterally declare independence next May, a
deadline for the completion of the historic Oslo accords, when
addressing the U.N. General Assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of announcing his statehood threat Monday
after he met with Clinton and Netanyahu in Washington.

BONN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Martina Hingis
beat Conchita Martinez of Spain 6-2, 7-5 in the women's opening
game of the 6.7 million U.S. dollars Grand Slam Cup in Munich,
Germany, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who turns 18 on Wednesday, needed one hour and 20
minutes to overcome the 26-year-old Spaniard and reach the
semifinals of the women's singles event.
</P>
<P>
Eight women are participating for the first time since the
inauguration of the cup in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The tournament nominally brings together players with the best
records in the four Grand Slam events of the year, which are the
Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year will miss the
tournament, including Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras of the
United States, U.S. Open winner Patrick Rafter of Australia and
Spain's Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
</P>
<P>
Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA) is to spend more than 100,000 U.S.
sub-regional development office in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
UNECA acting director Robert Okello said in an interview here
Monday that the initiative was intended to facilitate information
sharing among all sub-regional offices and the headquarters in
Ethiopia, Times of Zambia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The information center which is expected to be operational by
mid next year will be linked to Zamtel, a local government-owned
telecommunication company, and will be done through radio and
satellite, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to set up the center because we need to share
information between sub-regional offices and our headquarters in
Addis Ababa," Okello said.
</P>
<P>
Presently the UNECA information center at the local
sub-regional office situated in Lusaka operates manually which
has created some communication problems.
</P>
<P>
The local office has been operational since 1966 and has since
worked in collaboration with various organizations in capacity
building.
</P>
<P>
The organizations that have benefited from the information
center include the Lusaka-based Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern Africa Management
Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Health cooperation between
Egypt and Iraq will expand in the period ahead "for the health of
the Iraqi citizen," Egyptian Health Minister Ismail Sallam Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, who visited Baghdad last month and
performed operations on some Iraqi patients, made the remarks
following meeting with his Iraqi counterpart Omeed Medhat Mubarak,
who arrived here early in the day for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Sallam and Mubarak agreed during their talks on holding
meetings of a number of joint panels to explore prospects for
deepening health cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Health cooperation between the two countries has been conducted
in line with an agreement covering pharmaceuticals, prophylactic
medicine, medical training and exchange of expertise, according to
Sallam.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official praised the Egyptian humanitarian
assistance to his country which has been suffering under
eight-year U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian exports to Iraq in the light of the U.N.-Iraq
memorandum of understanding stood at 230 million dollars from
January till the end of August, which are composed of food,
medicines and other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cairo and Baghdad have witnessed noticeable
improvement recently when visits at high level have been exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program struck in 1996, Iraq
is permitted to sell a limited amount of oil every six months to
import food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Liaohe River Valley Proved to be Cradle of Chinese Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of noted Chinese
archeologists and historians have ascertained that the Liaohe
River Valley in north China, like the Yellow River Valley and the
Yangtze River Valley, is one of the cradles of Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was recognized by more than 100 scholars and
experts from both home and abroad after the scientists completed
their explorations early this month of the cultural relics of the
Xiajiadian culture, the Post-Hongshan culture, and Yinhe Rock
paintings in the Liaohe River Valley.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the study of Chinese civilization merely focused
on areas from the south to the Great Wall and ignored the regions
north of the Wall, said Zhang Zhongbai, a well-known Chinese
archeologist. "That is a big mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese culture originated in three areas
including the north China region centered on the lower and middle
reaches of the Yellow River, the south China region centered on the
lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the northeast
China region of the West Liaohe River.
</P>
<P>
The West Liaohe River connects with the plains of northeast
China and the Mongolia Plateau. In the past 10,000 years, four
layers of cultures there included the Hongshan, Xiajiadian, Lower
Layer and Upper Layer, and the Qidan-Liao cultures.
</P>
<P>
Xue Zhiqiang, director of the Institute of North China Studies,
said that the West Liaohe River civilization which originated
8,000 years ago was earlier than the culture of Huangdi in
Chinese legend. The Hongshan Culture, which flourished abut 6,000
years ago, was made up of many tribes forming an ancient state in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that as early as 5,000 years ago, the Chinese culture
emerged in the Liaohe River Valley in northeast China and
gradually advanced with the building of temples.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the Yellow River civilization represented
farming culture and the Yangtze River civilization was a
combination of farming and marine culture, but the Liaohe River
civilization was a manifestation of the transition from nomadic to
farming cultures.
</P>
<P>
Xue noted that the influence of the Liaohe River civilization
on the origins of Chinese culture was equal to that of the Yellow
River and Yangtze River valleys.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Withdraws Proposed Rule on Expression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Tuesday withdrew a proposed regulation in lieu of law on freedom
of expression, but said it would still submit a draft law on the
same matter.
</P>
<P>
"The draft would be submitted soon, as up to date the mechanism
for freedom of expression has not yet been regulated," Minister of
Defense and Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto said at a plenary
session of the House of Representatives here.
</P>
<P>
He said expressing opinions is the right of everybody and every
group, as long as what is submitted to is a positive input, demand
or suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"But, now, there has been a drastic change where rallies have
turned out to be a pressing and forcing movement highlighted by
brutality, anarchy and other destructive things," he added.
</P>
<P>
Students in Jakarta and other cities held rallies almost every
day this month to protest against the spiraling prices of basic
commodities. They urged President B.J. Habibie to take concrete
measures to solve the economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the rallies were also exploited by a certain
interest that could not be controlled," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Muladi said the draft had been submitted to
the president for his signature prior to being conveyed further to
the House.
</P>
<P>
The official explanation of the draft will be delivered by the
government on October 2, he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulation, submitted by the government to the
House of Representatives earlier this month, had got both positive
and negative responses from the people, especially concerning its
issuance and some of its contents.
</P>
<P>
House members had questioned the limitation to 50 of the number
of participants in rallies without approval and some other aspects
of the proposed regulation had also been questioned, including the
requirement for written approval and the time and place for the
expression as well as methods for dispersing such actions.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Navy to Strengthen Presence in Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Iranian navy
Abbas Mohtaj announced here Tuesday that his force would
strengthen presence in the Caspian Sea, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony arranged by the Ports and Shipping
Organization on the occasion of the International Seafaring Day,
Mohtaj said that having a stronger presence in the Caspian is
among the future programs of the navy.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Iran announced to build up its naval
force in the Caspian. Iranian government had repeatedly stated
that the Caspian should remain a "non-military zone," for the
benefit of peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj did not spell out the reasons behind Iran's new move in
the world largest inland waters, but he underlied the country's
need to "detect and deter threats."
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear how many troops the Iranian navy so
far deployed in the Caspian. Tehran had in the past focused its
attention on the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the discovery of
oil and gas resources under the Caspian seabed, have brought up
disputes on how to share the resources among littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Iran holds that the resources should be commonly shared by all
the five littoral states, while Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan
and Azerbaijan prefer the division of the sea into national
sections.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among those neighbors are still underway to work
out a legal framework to solve their dispute over the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj added that the naval force of the Iranian Army and the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had managed to restore
security in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 year, the Iranian Army and the IRGC have been
trying to guarantee security in the region, he said, the country
now enjoys full security.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Fighting Heroes Speak to Audience of Nearly 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight people crowned
"Flood-Fighting Heroes and Models" spoke to an audience of nearly
10,000 about their experiences and heroic deeds during the
country's two-month-long battle against the worst flooding in
decades at the Great Hall of the People in downtown Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The speakers included officers of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) and the armed police force, which mobilized over 300,000
soldiers and officers to participate in the flood-fighting and
rescue operations, officials from regions most severely hit by the
floods, and ordinary citizens who made outstanding contributions
to the flood-fighting endeavor.
</P>
<P>
One of the speakers was Wang Zhancheng, a handicapped man in
his late 60s and a citizen of Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, Wang, who has decades of flood-fighting experience,
used his own body to plug a one-meter gap in the city's
embankment. He was named the "Top Flood-Fighting Hero
of Wuhan".
</P>
<P>
Today's eight speakers are part of a newly formed lecturing
group, which has nine other members. The group plans to travel
around the Chinese capital to give more talks.
</P>
<P>
Today's event was jointly hosted by the Departments of
Publicity and Organization of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, the General Political Department of the PLA,
the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, and other central departments.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yunshan, executive deputy head of the Publicity Department
of the CPC Central Committee, presided over today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
From July to September, severe flooding hit the vast Yangtze
River basin and then attacked northeast China's Nenjiang river and
Songhua river basins, affecting a dozen provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
Government reports say that 3,004 people were killed nationwide
in the floods, and direct economic losses totalled some 20 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Proposal Negative: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government believes
the international community considers a Turkish Cypriot proposal
for a Cyprus confederation as negative, government spokesman
Chirstos Stylianides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A joint statement by the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council and comments by U.S. officials now indicate
that the world community assumes a negative stance toward the
unacceptable Turkish position," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman has just returned from New York, where he
accompanied President Glafcos Clerides attending the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward a proposal
last August for the establishment of a confederation of two equal
states in Cyprus as "the only structure" of a settlement. The idea
has been rejected by Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in a
statement last week reiterated that a political settlement in
Cyprus should be in accordance with the Security Council
resolutions, which provide for a bicommunal, bizonal federation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Clerides' meetings in New York, Stylianides said
it was an intensive week of meetings and the outcome of which will
be assessed by the island's political leadership at a meeting of
the National Council, the top advisory body to the president on
handling the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports about an arms sales agreement between
Turkey and Britain, Stylianides said the two countries have a
trade accord on defense matters, to which Cyprus does not object.
</P>
<P>
"What we are interested in is that Britain backs the
U.N. resolutions and supports Cyprus' right to self-defense and
Cyprus' right to move on with its accession course to the
European Union," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to help
unify the divided island, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa's GSM Network Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of expansion of
the global system for mobile communications (GSM) network in
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has been completed
and the upgraded network began operating this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications authorities in Lhasa initiated the GSM
network in August 1997, but because of a shortage of funds
network capacity was only 4,000 users at that time, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The city had registered 3,600 GSM subscribers by the end of
April this year.
</P>
<P>
When the optical-fibre cable between Lanzhou, Xining and Lhasa
opened in August, Wu Jichuan, minister of Information Industry,
promised to help upgrade the region's GSM equipment.
</P>
<P>
Tibet then obtained 80 million yuan (about 9.64 million
U.S. dollars) in financial aid from the central telecommunications
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Urges Speedy Rehabilitation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Tuesday asked the authorities concerned to relax and
simplify the approval procedure for projects relating to
post-flood rehabilitation, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The directive came at a meeting of the Executive Committee of
the National Economic Council which approved eight projects with
an estimated cost of 14.6 billion taka (about 310.3 million U.S.
dollars) including project aid of over 7 billion taka (about 148.9
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the need for giving top-most
priority to post-flood reconstruction and rehabilitation programs
to recoup the enormous losses caused by the devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Hasina directed the Planning Commission to issue necessary
directives for speedy approval of various projects.
</P>
<P>
She also asked the authorities concerned to take into serious
consideration the effects of flood, cyclone, tidal surge, water
logging, river erosion and other natural disasters and calamities
while preparing designs for construction of bridges, culverts and
other infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The 10-week-long flood, which started hitting the country in
early July, has affected 52 of the 64 districts, with nearly 30
million people seriously affected and the flood-related death toll
rising to more than 1,000. The preliminary economic loss is
estimated at about 3.4 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen today voiced the hope that the Taiwan authorities will do
something practical to boost cross-straits exchanges and pave
the way for political dialogue between both sides across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a reception held here today by the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council to mark
the 49th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese nation is now faced with the historical
mission to realize peaceful reunification between both sides of
the Taiwan Straits, with the return of Hong Kong and the
approaching return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
As concerted efforts of the people on both sides, cross-straits
personnel, economic and cultural exchanges have maintained steady
growth, Qian said, noting that the attempt to create "Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" will be
firmly rejected.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the central government will continue to
implement the principle of "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems" and the eight-point proposition for
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits political dialogue has been put on the agenda,
and the interests of the Taiwan compatriots will be entirely
protected under the "one country, two systems" concept, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the love of Taiwan and the love of the
motherland by the Taiwan compatriots are in complete accord with
each other.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, go together with Taiwan compatriots, Hong
Kong and Macao compatriots and overseas Chinese, and jointly
strive for the great cause of peaceful reunification of the
motherland," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said today that the Chinese government is deeply concerned
about the attacks on Chinese-Indonesians which occurred in
Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the Indonesian government promised to
deal with the incident in a serious way," Qian said at a National
Day reception held by the State Council's Office of Overseas
Chinese Affairs, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the
Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that the Indonesian side would handle the incident
properly as soon as possible and prevent such things from
happening again," he said.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the Chinese-Indonesians, together with
other Indonesians, have made indelible contributions to the
social and economic development of Indonesia, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, they should be respected the same as other Indonesians
and should enjoy the same treatment and rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their personal safety and just rights and interests
must be fully safeguarded by the Indonesian government, Qian added.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- For more than four years, United Nations arms inspectors

<HEADLINE> Single Parents Head 14 Percent of EU Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- There are nearly 7 million
single parents with dependent children in the European Union (EU),
or 14 percent of all EU families, Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said the number of single parents witnessed a large
increase over the 9 percent in 1983.
</P>
<P>
EU-wide, 84 percent of all single parents are women.
</P>
<P>
At 23 percent, Britain has proportionately the highest number
of single-parent families, whereas Greece has the lowest at 7
percent within the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The rise in single parenthood has been one of the most striking
demographic and social trends in recent years, Eurostat said. From
1983 to 1996, the number of single parents rose by an average of
58 percent in the eight EU member states with available data.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 single parenthood data is the latest available in
Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Single parents doubled in Ireland and rose by 94 percent and 75
percent in Britain and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The statistical bureau attributed the reason for the growing
number of single parents to a breakdown in marriages and births
outside of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
Single parents, according to Eurostat, face higher
unemployment, lower educational achievement and three-quarters the
income of two-parent families with dependent children.

the east, a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from Kinshasa quoted Congolese presidential affairs
minister Pierre-Victor Mpoyo as saying that over 1,000 Chadian
soldiers would take part in a major counter-offensive due to be
launched soon in the rebel-held towns in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries want to come and fight," Mpoyo said. "We've
received several offers, but we are still seeing what to do."
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "We have not decided yet."
</P>
<P>
Chadian Information Minister and government spokesman
Sekimbaye Bassane confirmed in a statement on television Tuesday
that Chad is providing "total and multi-faceted support for
Kabila" and rendering "unconditional backing" for the Kinshasa
government to fight the rebels, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's government asserted that its troops and those of
their allies have encircled the rebel-held towns in the east and
will launch a final offensive against them soon.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been no fighting reported in the east for
several days. The rebels took up arms against Kabila since August
2 in the east and Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to
help rout the rebels in the west last month.
</P>
<P>
The dispatch of Chadian troops to Congo (K) followed a summit
of French-speaking, central African states held in the Gabonese
capital of Libreville last week which voiced support to Kabila
and condemned Rwanda and Uganda for allegedly invading to back
the rebels. But both denied direct involvement.
</P>
<P>
A Kinshasa-based independent daily newspaper Tuesday quoted
Congolese Information Minister and government spokesman Didier
Mumengi as saying that the counter-offensive was being delayed by
regional efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians, Libyans Asked to Leave Somalia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Six break-away political
organizations from Somalia's numerous political factions issued
an ultimatum demanding the representatives of Egypt and Libya to
leave Somalia as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the political factions threatened that
they will not shoulder the responsibility of the consequences
when their orders are not obeyed.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Hajji Bod, former Vice Chairman of Ali Mahdi Mohamed
faction and one of the signatories of this statement, said they
are going to give the Egyptian and Libyan representatives no more
than 48 hours to leave Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The statement has accused the diplomats for re-arming and
supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid factions.
</P>
<P>
The statement which was issued after a meeting by the
break-away faction leaders Monday also condemned what they called
the alliance of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed
factions for carrying out what is termed as various inhuman
actions in four locations, three in Mogadishu and an alleged
attack against five villages in Bay region.
</P>
<P>
What prompted the strongly-worded statement is not known,
however the statement came shortly after the Egyptian ambassador
to Somali, Mohamud Mustafa, had made a donation of few boxes of
medicine against malaria to the administration of Mogadishu led
by Hussein Ahmed Ali.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya are among the outspoken countries from the
Arab League trying to support the disputed administration of
Mogadishu in accordance with the Cairo peace deal signed in
December last year.

MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said Tuesday that it has approved a 42.6-million-U.S.-dollar
loan to support the Bangladeshi government's efforts to reduce
poverty by providing microfinance services to the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said in a press release that nearly half
a million impoverished households in rural areas in Bangladesh
will be organized into cooperatives to start their own enterprises
under an ADB-funded microfinance project.

<P>
The ADB will also provide a technical assistance grant of
800,000 dollars to help set up a pilot microcredit bank owned by
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the rural areas of Bangladesh is seasonal and
nearly half of the rural population is officially considered poor,
the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The project will target disadvantaged women and will raise
their awareness and self-confidence by providing them with skills
to undertake income-generating activities and with credit to
develop microenterprises.

</P>
<P>
The information center which is expected to be operational by
mid next year will be linked to Zamtel, a local government-owned
telecommunication company, and will be done through radio and
satellite, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to set up the center because we need to share
information between sub-regional offices and our headquarters in
Addis Ababa," Okello said.
</P>
<P>
Presently the UNECA information center at the local
sub-regional offl3H.Z:uated in Lusaka operates manually which

<P>
KIEV, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ukranian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and his Belarus counterpart Sergei Ling reached an
agreement here Monday on mutual settlements.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers discussed ways to fend off the negative
impact of the Russian financial crisis and agreed to continue
their mutual settlements on a barter basis.
</P>
<P>
Barter trade reportedly accounts for 35 percent of the
Ukraine-Belarus trade, which totaled 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in
1997 and is expected to drop to 1.1 billion dollars this year
because of the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
To promote bilateral economic cooperation, both sides have
decided to work out as soon as possible a ten-year economic
cooperation program. They plan to submit it to the presidents of
the two countries for endorsement by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the program is expected to increase
bilateral trade volume by 500 million to 700 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached a preliminary agreement on forming a
banking consortium among Ukraine, Belarus and Russia for an
early solution to their payment problems.
</P>
<P>
Ling arrived in Kiev Monday on a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Classifications of Ownership Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Statistics Bureau
has adopted a new method classifying China's publically owned
and non-publically owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the new classifications aims to have accurate
knowledge of the ownership structure of Chinese enterprises, said
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the public economy includes firms
owned by the State and the collective, while the non-public
economy covers private firms, foreign funded firms, and companies
with investment from Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The bureau noted that the former classifications adopted in
1992 are unable to reflect accurately the ownership structure of
China's economy and the proportion of the State-owned economy.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also issued two accessory rules recently on methods
of calculating into which category an enterprise properly should be
classified.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Warns Against Regional Separatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov warned regional leaders Tuesday of "the danger
of separatism" as the government plans to draft a law that would
sack what it describes as "separatism-mongering regional bosses."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of cabinet members and leaders of regions
concerned about the country's socio-economic situation, Primakov
said that only 50 percent of anticipated taxes were collected in
September, due in part to the suspension of tax payments by
regional governments to the federal coffer.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who assumed office two weeks ago and is still in the
process of filling slots in his cabinet, also pointed to the
shortage of consumer goods resulting from dwindling imports.
</P>
<P>
Following the previous government's August 17 decision to
devalue the ruble and default on some domestic and foreign debts,
the import of foods dropped more than 83 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The national currency now stands at about 16 rubles to the
dollar, down 60 percent from the pre-crisis rate of 6.3 rubles to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"This situation has undermined the available food stockpiles in
large industrial centers," Primakov said, adding that the
situation is aggravated by poor harvests.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of "political ambitions" in the planned October
7 national protest in the midst of rising social discontent.
</P>
<P>
"Political ambitions must not eclipse the main thing, the love
of the Homeland and desire to promote the well-being of all the
people of Russia," Primakov said. He expressed the hope that
organizers of the protest would "act with honest ends in view"
rather than "rock the boat."
</P>
<P>
"We must not tolerate any unlawful and anti-constitutional
actions such as the blocking of roads," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Coal miners blocked key railways around the country last
summer to demand payment of back wages, costing the country
millions of rubles. Authorities have threatened to bring charges
against organizers of blockades.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control of Capital Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will further tighten
control over capital accounts, and any domestic enterprises
holding foreign-currency income capital accounts abroad without
state approval must transfer the money back to China before
October 1, a senior finance official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoling, director of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, told a press conference that according to China's
existing foreign-exchange control regulations, foreign-exchange
incomes of domestic institutions, if not approved by the state,
must not be left abroad, and must be transferred back to China
in time.
</P>
<P>
"So what I announced today is not a new policy, but an attempt
to correct the illegal activities conducted by some enterprises
with capital accounts, and it has nothing to do with
normal capital funds of enterprises investing abroad," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Since the overwhelming majority of enterprises will abide by
the law in their business operations, she said, the amount of
capital illegally left abroad would not be large, and
bringing the money back should not have a major impact on
enterprises from the interior areas with investments in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Discusses Troops in Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The stationing of troops by
China's central government in the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) was one of the major topics discussed
here Tuesday by chief representatives of both sides of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese
JLG, told reporters that China had notified Portugal of the
arrangements of troops stationing before Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side expects that the Portuguese side will make
cooperative efforts so that Chinese troops can enter Macao in time
after the Chinese government resumes sovereignty over Macao next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The central government of China is to carry out its
responsibility of managing defense affairs in the Macao SAR as it
decides to send troops here in line with the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and the Macao Basic Law," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Santana Carlos, chief of the Portuguese side of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, noted after the meeting that the Joint
Declaration does not make it clear that the Chinese central
government will station troops in Macao. He said it was not long
ago that Portugal had come to know what he called China's "new
stance."
</P>
<P>
Han responded that according to the stipulations in the
declaration and the Macao Basic Law, China's central government is
responsible for defense affairs in the Macao SAR. Therefore, the
stationing of troops falls into the category of China's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
When drawing up the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, the
Chinese side had made explanations about the article concerning
Macao's defense affairs, making it explicit that the central
government has the right to station troops in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the friendly relations between China and Portugal,
China had notified the Portuguese side of the stationing of troops
in advance (of a relevant announcement)," Han said. "But China
regards the stationing of troops as a matter within the sphere of
China's sovereignty and there is no need of consultation between
the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Now it is time for the Sino-Portuguese JLG to discuss the
concrete arrangements of troops stationing in the Macao SAR, Han
said.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting which lasted more than five hours, the two
chief representatives also talked about other major issues
concerning the power transfer of Macao, such as official languages
to be used in Macao, Macao's budget for 1999, the localization of
laws and allowances to senior civil servants.

Khai made his call in a government report to a national
conference of the Provincial People's Committees and People's
Councils here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khai listed major issues that the central government and local
authorities need to address in their socio-economic development
plan for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 socio-economic plan will focus on continuing the
renovation process, bringing into strong play domestic resources
to minimize negative effects of the regional economic crisis on
the national economy, maintaining stability in socio-economic
development, and keeping under control the slowdown of the growth
rate, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said it is necessary to create favorable
conditions to rapidly develop a number of sectors for the rest of
this year and the next year.
</P>
<P>
The first task is to maintain socio-economic development
stability, focusing efforts on resolving problems which may cause
economic bankruptcy and decline, Khai said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth rate for 1999 will not stand as high as
that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But the sectors of agriculture, forestry and aquatic products
processing, which are less affected by the crisis, and industries
and services employing large workforce and having outlets abroad
should be developed strongly to make up for the losses in other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister set as major tasks to adjust the economy
while continuing to boost the renovation process in line with the
party's policies and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The revision of the economic growth rate and major targets,
Khai said, is a solution aimed to create fundamental conditions
for the stable and sustainable development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the revision does not deflect the
development orientation of the country's socialist economy.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to review investment projects that are
underway, or that are expected to be implemented with state
fundings, Khai urged.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam should diversify the production of goods for
export to meet requirements of new markets in the future.
</P>
<P>
As a densely populated country, the domestic market is of great
potential, Khai said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to increase the purchase power of the
population in general and those living in rural areas in
particular, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Foreign Exchange Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China has taken measures to
strengthen management of foreign exchange, a senior government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoling, director of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE), told a press conference that a recent
nationwide foreign exchange inspection uncovered fake
customs reports involving several billions U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said that SAFE and other related government organizations
jointly launched a foreign exchange inspection in July to verify
the validity of customs reports valued above 200,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has also prohibited Chinese banks from buying and
transferring foreign currencies for their customers in cities
other than the customers' locations.
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that foreign banks will be allowed to
continue conducting such business for the convenience of
foreign-funded enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will adhere to the convertibility of its
currency under current accounts. She said the country will
guarantee the supply of foreign currencies for legal transactions,
debt repayment and normal capital flow and crack down on illegal
capital flow in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that devaluation of the yuan will not be chosen
by China as a way to stimulate exports.
</P>
<P>
She said that "increasing domestic demand is a key" for China
to secure a fast growth rate.
</P>
<P>
"A country this big cannot rely on devaluation (of its
currency) to stimulate economic growth," she said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Party Agrees to Join Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chart Pattana Party (CPP),
the third largest political party in Thailand, decided unanimously
at its meeting Tuesday to join the ruling coalition, paving the
way for a planned government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after the CPP meeting, CPP leader
Korn Dabbaransi said his party decided to join the ruling
coalition in a bid to help the government solve the problems the
country is facing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Sanan Kachornprasart, secretary-general of the
Democrat Party, the core party in the coalition and Thailand's
second largest political party, went to the CPP headquarters to
offer a formal invitation to CPP, a major opposition party in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said at another press
conference that CPP's accession will be conducive to the
solidarity of the government.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government consists of the Democrat
Party, Chart Thai Party, Social Action Party, Solidarity Party,
Seritham Party and 12 Prachakorn Thai Party members who defected
to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Holding 206 seats in the 389-strong parliament, the coalition
enjoys just a slender majority.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that at a time when the coalition was shaken by
the forced resignation of two health ministers of Social Action
Party over a hospital supplies scandal and the threat of expulsion
of 12 Prachakorn Thai Party rebels from their party, absorbing the
CPP into the coalition becomes extremely urgent.
</P>
<P>
Local television station Channel 9 reported that parties within
the ruling coalition welcomed the CPP's move, saying they are
willing to sacrifice some of their portfolios to the new comer.
</P>
<P>
As to which portfolios will go to the CPP, Sanan said it is to
be decided after negotiations among secretary-generals of all the
ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
Channel 9 predicted that the CPP will take about 10 posts,
including one deputy prime minister and portfolios of industry,
public health, labor and social welfare and minister of the prime
minister's office.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Stocks Up 2.15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Seoul's main index rose 6.6
points, or 2.15 percent, closing at 312.33 Tuesday due to seven
bank labor unions' retreat from a threatened strike and
expectations for a U.S. interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Turnout was 61.38 million shares worth 293.1 billion won (some
209 million U.S. dollars). Advancers outnumbered decliners 470 to
282, with 106 shares unchanged.
</P>
<P>
A strike would have hurt the financial markets, but news that
many bank unions were resuming normal operations boosted investor
confidence, market observers said.
</P>
<P>
Expectations for U.S. Federal Reserve's imminent announcement
on interest rate cuts, together with the South Korean government's
strong determination to revive the economy, also helped elevate
market sentiment, they said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government's pledge Monday to inject 21
trillion won (some 1.4 billion dollars) into the financial sector
this month also encouraged both foreign and domestic investors to
buy more orders, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Monday, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung announced that his
government will expand the money supply and fiscal spending at the
expense of incurring a wider budget deficit, prop up domestic
consumption and lower interest rates while continuing fast and
effective reforms.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Impose Full Closure on Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel will impose full
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip over Yom Kippur (Day of
Atonement), the most important holiday on the Jewish calendar,
Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The closure on the Palestinian areas, which will bar more than
2.5 million Palestinians including tens of thousands of workers
from entering Israe, will start on Tuesday afternoon and last
until 1 o'clock on Thursday morning, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The holiday will begin at sundown Tuesday and end at sundown
Wednesday. The Jews are expected, on this day, to pray, fast and
ask God for forgiveness for their sins.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces will continually be on high alert
throughout the country in the holiday and troops will provide
backup to the police forces in the major cities. In addition,
synagogues in the country will be protected by the civil guard
units.
</P>

Israel routinely seals off its borders with the Palestinian
areas during Jewish holidays in a bid to avoid terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since Israeli troops killed two activists of the
Islamic militant group Hamas early this month, Hamas has
threatened to revenge and Israeli security forces have been on
alert.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel can reach an
agreement on troop redeployment in the West Bank with the
Palestinians during the next two weeks, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told the Israel Radio that he is optimistic that the
agreement on the second stage Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank can be signed next month in Washington when Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
meet in the White House again with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said there are several options for reaching the agreement
and the options will be discussed in detail during the visit to
the region next week by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Aging Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a series of
old people-friendly projects and hold symposiums on the aging
problem during the forthcoming International Year of Old Persons.
</P>
<P>
The International Year of Old Persons with the theme of
"Towards a Society for All Ages" was scheduled by the United
Nations General Assembly in 1997. It will start on October 1,
1998, said Zhang Wenfan, president of the Chinese Old Citizens
Association.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that to follow the theme, China will try to build a
society, which will be developed with concerted efforts of the old
and young and enjoyed by all.
</P>
<P>
China will become an aging country by the year 2000, when 130
million people will reach the age of 60, making up over
one-tenth of the total population.
</P>
<P>
"It is ten years earlier than the time when the whole world
enters the aging society in 2010," said Prof. Zhang Xianqiao with
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, adding that by the year
2040, the aged population will grow to 25 percent of China's
population.
</P>
<P>
"The aging process of Chinese society will only take 13 years,
much faster than that in developed countries, which was 50 to
80 years," Prof. Zhang said. "This will apply more pressures to
China in dealing with the aging problem."
</P>
<P>
The number of senior citizens above the age of 80 in China has
almost doubled since the early 1980s, because of the extended
average life expectancy, he said. As a result, the government as
well as individuals have become more concerned with taking care of
 the aged.
</P>
<P>
Special apartments and other social service centers for the the
aged are mushrooming in big cities of Shanghai, Beijing and
Tianjin cities and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hunan and Sichuan
Provinces which have already entered the aged society,
</P>
<P>
Activities will be conducted between the traditional Chinese
festivals for the old persons in October in 1998 and 1999 to mark
the International Year for the Old Persons, said Zhang Wenfan.
</P>
<P>
The activities, which will include symposiums on the policies
for aging society and various projects to aid senior citizens, are
designed to promote the drive to respect and love old
people and solve the aging problem, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Leader Wants Anwar Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Parliament
opposition leader Lim Kit Siang Tuesday called for the release of
Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim from detention under
the Internal Security Act (ISA).
</P>
<P>
Anwar should be freed "to prepare for his own self-defense" as
he has been charged in court with corruption and sodomy, Lim, who
is also Democratic Action Party secretary-general, told reporters
at the parliament lobby Tuesday, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"It is a mockery of justice for him to be charged and still
(detained) under the ISA. It is unfair of him to be in double
jeopardy," Lim was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested under the ISA on September 20 following
riots by his supporters in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
He was produced in Sessions Court 4 at the Courts Complex here
Tuesday morning to face nine charges, five of corruption and four
for committing sodomy, to all of which Anwar pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was charged in the court with sodomizing an adopted
brother, his ex-driver and two others. Anwar, 51, is alleged to
have committed the offenses between March 1993 and April this
year.
</P>
<P>
He is accused of committing the offenses under Section 377B of
the Penal Code which provides for imprisonment up to 20 years and
whipping upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
The case was later transferred to the High Court for hearing on
a date to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar told the Sessions Court that he was beaten by police
while being held in the Bukit Aman lockup here.
</P>
<P>
Judge Hasnah Mohd Hashim allowed Anwar's application made via
his counsel Christopher Fernando to complain about the injuries he
sustained while in police custody.
</P>
<P>
When approving the application, the judge said the case had
been transferred to the Kuala Lumpur High Court and the Sessions
Court was merely recording the complaints.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was allowed by the Sessions Court earlier to be examined
by an independent doctor to be appointed by his family.
</P>
<P>
Hasnah said Anwar's complaints were limited to the injuries he
sustained to his left eye.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, two of their daughters and
Anwar's father and father-in-law were present in court Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Clad in brown pants and a checkered shirt, Anwar was smiling as
he entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, his daughters
and his father.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine charges mentioned at the court, one more
charge of unnatural sex act against Anwar will be mentioned at the
Petaling Jaya court near here Wednesday, said an announcement by
the Attorney-General's Chambers earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement signed by Special Officer to the
Attorney-General, Shamsuddin Hassan, the attorney-general as the
public prosecutor was satisfied that there was sufficient "prima
facie" evidence to charge Anwar with the offenses.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance on September 2 and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization the following day for "low morals."
</P>
<P>
Anwar's supporters had held several assemblies in the Jalan
Raja courthouse area here since his detention, forcing police to
impose tight security.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Criticizes U.N. Resolutions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- There is a certain
incompatibility in various U.N. resolutions on Iraq, with one
imposing sanctions, another imposing a humanitarian program, said
a senior U.N. official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Denis Halliday, the outgoing U.N. humanitarian coordinator for
Iraq, made the remarks at a press conference here when talking
about reasons for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
"One U.N. resolution imposes sanctions, and another imposes a
humanitarian program with all of its shortcomings and politics
trying to counter the first resolution, ... as representative of
the United Nations, I have to deal with that," said Halliday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also admitted that he "has had difficulties
in the relationship" between the U.N. headquarters and his mission
in Iraq, but stressing that this "is an established phenomenon"
and should not be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on U.N. Resolution 986 which allows Iraq to sell
limited amount of oil to buy back humanitarian supplies for its
suffering people, Halliday said "none of us wanted 986."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that under circumstances of sanctions, this
humanitarian program "is modestly working and does make a
difference."
</P>
<P>
Halliday, at the U.N. assistant secretary-general level, is
one of the U.N. senior officials who are strongly advocating the
lifting of sanctions on Iraq imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Halliday told the press conference that he has been invited to
go to Washington next week to brief some 40 members of
U.S. Congress in a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
"This will give me an opportunity to brief important
decision-makers in Washington as to the impacts the sanctions
have had here in Iraq in terms of the economy of the country and
most important of all, of course, the people and the children of
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Halliday, a national of Ireland, also cited a personal reason
for his resignation from the post he has taken for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lovely 15-year-old daughter, and I would like to go
back to spend some time with her because she grows up completely
and goes off to university," he said with emotion.
</P>
<P>
Halliday will leave here on Wednesday. U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has appointed Hans von Sponeck, a national of Germany
to succeed Halliday.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck will leave his current post as regional representative
and director of European affairs at the U.N. Development Program's
office in Geneva and take up his new duties in Baghdad towards
the end of October.

</P>
<P>
"Kenya invites the Chinese business community... to invest in

rich culture," he said, adding that Kenya is the ultimate tourist
destination in east Africa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indian Researchers Claim New Bioformulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Agricultural
Research Institute based here said it has developed two
eco-friendly bioformulations that are not only effective against a
number of crop-damaging fungi but will also increase crop yield.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday that both the
formulations, named Kalisena SD and Kalisena SL, were prepared
from the AN 27 strain of aspergillus niger, a black-colored fungus
present naturally in soil.
</P>
<P>
The kalisena (black army) formulations are mixtures of an
anti-fungal compound and two growth promoters present in
aspergillus niger, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the institute claimed that the mixtures are
effective against six soil fungi which cause widespread damage to
various crops.
</P>
<P>
What made them superior to conventional applications is that
only a single application of Kalisena SD to seeds and Kalisena SL
to nurseries is needed to control fungi, said Bineeta Sen, leader
of the research team from the institute's Department of Plant
Pathology.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they have a prolonged shelf-life of two years which is
not offered by any other bioformulations and are safe for use, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Farm trials carried out by the institute's scientists in 10
states against different crop diseases have proven kalisena's
efficacy, according to Sen.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that soil pathogens are responsible for 25
percent of annual crop loss due to diseases.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Reaps Good Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has got a bumper
rice harvest this year for the third consecutive year with
production reaching 35.6 million sok, or 5.1 million tons, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although it dropped 5.8 percent from the 37.8 million sok of
rice yield in 1997, this year's figure shows a five percent more
than the ministry's 1998 target of 33.9 million sok.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rice production per 100 square meters was
tallied at 485 kilograms, exceeding the annual average of 470
kilograms achieved in 1993-1997, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rice harvest to high temperatures
and good weather since late August, and efforts by the government
and farmers to secure more rice-cultivating areas and develop
high-quality paddies.
</P>
<P>
South Korea transformed about 4,000 hectares of idle land and
3,000 hectares of reclaimed land into paddy fields this year. The
paddy fields decreased an annual average of 21,000 hectares in
1992-1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the total area of paddy fields jumped 7,000
hectares from a year earlier to 1.06 million hectares in 1998.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's rice stockpiles are expected to increase from 6.5
million sok at the end of October this year to 7.3 million sok at
the end of next October, surpassing the optimum level of 5.5-5.8
million sok recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Former Malaysian Deputy PM Claims Police Beat Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim told the Sessions Court here Tuesday
that he was beaten by police while being held in the Bukit Aman
lockup here following his arrest under the Internal Security Act
on September 20.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said this before Judge Hasnah Mohd Hashim after she
allowed his application made via his counsel Christopher Fernando
to complain about the injuries he sustained while in police
custody.
</P>
<P>
When approving the application, the judge said the case had
been transferred to the Kuala Lumpur High Court and the Sessions
Court was merely recording the complaints.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was allowed by the Sessions Court earlier to be examined
by an independent doctor to be appointed by his family.
</P>
<P>
Hasnah said Anwar's complaints were limited to the injuries
recorded by the court that is in relation to the injuries he
sustained to his left eye.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was Tuesday charged in the same court with sodomizing an
adopted brother, his ex-driver and two others. Anwar, 51, is
alleged to have committed the offenses between March 1993 and
April this year.
</P>
<P>
He is accused of committing the offenses under Section 377B of
the Penal Code which provides for imprisonment up to 20 years and
whipping upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was produced in Sessions Court 4 at the Courts Complex in
Jalan Raja Tuesday morning to face the nine charges, five of
corruption and four for committing sodomy, to all of which Anwar
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
The case was later transferred to the High Court for hearing on
a date to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, two of their daughters,
Anwar's father and father-in-law were present in court when the
case was mentioned Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clad in brown pants and a checkered shirt, Anwar was smiling as
he entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, his daughters
and his father.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested by police on September 20 under the Internal
Security Act following riots by his supporters here.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine charges mentioned at the court here, one more
charge of unnatural sex act against Anwar will be mentioned at the
Petaling Jaya court near here Wednesday, according to an
announcement by the Attorney-General's Chambers earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement signed by Special Officer to the
Attorney- General, Shamsuddin Hassan, the attorney-general as the
public prosecutor was satisfied that there was sufficient "prima
facie" evidence to charge Anwar for the offenses.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance on September 2 and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) the following day for "low morals".
</P>
<P>
Anwar's supporters had held several illegal assemblies in the
Jalan Raja courthouse area here since his detention forcing police
to impose tight security.

percent from the previous month's 3.61 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fall was the first time in the past eight months due to
falling exports and growing interest payments for the country's
foreign debts, the Bank of Korea said Tueaday.
</P>
<P>
On a custom-cleared basis, South Korean exports decreased for
the fourth consecutive month to 9.82 billion dollars in August
while imports tumbled 38 percent to 7.12 billion dollars due to
shrinking domestic demand, reflecting the ongoing deepened
recession in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike at Hyundai Motor Co., Russia's moratorium
declaration and seasonally sluggish industrial output in August
were also factors causing downing exports, said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In terms of interest rate payments, South Korea registered a
substantial deficit of 250 million dollars resulting from interest
payments to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest figure brought up the nation's current
account surplus for the year through August to a relatively
healthy 27.8 billion dollars, compared with the 5 billion
dollars deficit in the same time of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The surplus for the year is likely to surpass the initial
target of 37 billion U.S. dollars," said a spokesman of central
bank.

<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman has signed
an ordnance removing import duty on tomatoes for the duration of
the Jewish holiday season, which will last into mid-October, the
Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after tomato prices skyrocketed because
of a shortage of supply, which was caused by the recent heat
waves.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury believes the temporary move will lead to a 20
percent to 30 percent cut in prices, which currently average some
11 shekels (about 2.86 U.S. dollars) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate stood at 9.1 percent in
July, a slight increase from 9 percent in both May and June, the
Jerusalem Post quoted official figures as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Central Bureau of Statistics said that
although the unemployment rate growth slowed down, the growing
trend will continue for a few months.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, meanwhile, increased at an annual 6
percent in July and August, compared to 4 percent in May and June,
the figures show.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The exports of Israel's software industry topped 1
billion U.S. dollars last year, according to a comprehensive
survey of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey showed that software exports during the
first six months of 1998 reached 700 million dollars, representing
an increase of 20 to 25 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
North America was the most important market for Israel's
software products, absorbing 38 percent of the total exports;
Western Europe was just behind, with 37 percent of the market. The
East Asia and Southeast Asia accounted for 9 percent of the
purchases.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- As the service trade became a major area of activities
in the world, Egypt's share of it is still modest, Egyptian
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmad Gowaili said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide service exports in 1996 reached 1,260 billion
U.S. dollars against 5,000 billion dollars for the commodities
exports, said Gowaili at the inaugural session of a seminar here
on real estate and tourist investment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's share of service trade in the world is still modest as
it ranges at merely between 7 to 8 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the Suez Canal, the remittances of the Egyptian
expatriates and tourism constitute the major part of it, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Kuwait Company for the Development of Small
Projects announced that it would establish more projects to
attract small Kuwaiti investors, the Kuwait News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company's board chairman Adnan Al-Sultan told a news
conference here that his company had established five projects
with a total capital of 1 million Kuwaiti dinars (3.3 million
U.S. dollars) and had received 100 investors.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said the projects included two industrial businesses,
two handicraft ones and a commercial one.
</P>
<P>
Sultan pointed out that the small investors must meet certain
company requirements, namely, being a Kuwaiti national, having an
acceptable experience on the proposed activity, with a
contribution of at least 50 percent of a project's capital, which
must not exceed 1.5 million dinars (4.95 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial assistance, the company will provide
small investors with strategic help to guarantee the success of
the projects, Sultan added.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait Company for the Development of Small Projects was
established by the Kuwaiti Public Authority for Investment in
June, 1998 with 100 million dinars (330 million dollars) for
managing national investment portfolios.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Social Action Party Leader Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Montri Pongpanich, leader of
the Social Action Party (SAP), the third largest party in the Thai
ruling coalition, announced Tuesday to resign over the difference
within the party, television station Channel 9 reported.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Channel 9, Montri said that there is no unity in his
party as it has been divided by different factions.
</P>
<P>
Montri, who will be replaced by SAP Secretary-General Suvit
Khunkitti, said that now as an ordinary SAP member, he will still
back his party to stay within the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some of the SAP members have voiced their
will to withdraw from the six-party coalition, which enjoys just a
slender majority in the 389-strong parliament.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government consists of the Democrat
Party, Chart Thai Party, Social Action Party, Solidarity Party,
Seritham Party and 12 Prachakorn Thai Party members who defected
to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Montri as SAP leader is a prelude to an
inevitable major reshuffle of the Chuan Leekpai government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has invited the opposition Chart Pattana Party
(CPP), the third largest political party in Thailand which holds
51 seats in the lower house, to join the government in a bid to
consolidate its majority.
</P>
<P>
However, CPP leaders have not given a reply to the coalition's
open arms, saying they will hold a party meeting to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, also leader of the Democrat
Party, core party in the coalition, had preferred a limited
change. However, growing dissatisfaction with two resigned SAP
ministers and the endangered career of 12 Prachakorn Thai rebels
have forced him to accept a wider reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana and
his deputy Thirawat Siriwansan, both SAP members, were forced to
step down over the scandal that the ministry has forced hospitals
to buy medical equipment at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
And the 12 Prachakorn Thai rebels are facing threat of
expulsion from their party and thus lost their status as
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Now the ruling parties are waiting for an answer from the CPP.
If the CPP accepts the invitation, every party in the coalition
has to sacrifice some of their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, a Democrat,
said his party will not give up the key economic portfolios so
that the work on the economic crisis could go on undisrupted.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Efforts on Human Rights: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang said here today that China's decision to sign up the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights demonstrates
once again the country's determination to promote and protect
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced on September 23
at the 53rd session of the UN General Assembly that China will
sign up the covenant in early October. China signed up the
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
last October.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to work with other countries to continue
efforts in promoting the cause of human rights," Tang said at
today's routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached importance to the positive role the
international human rights covenant played in promoting and
protecting human rights, the spokesman said, adding that China has
signed up 17 international covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government respects human rights, and
has adopted legislative, judiciary and administrative measures
to promote and protect people's economic, social, cultural, civil
and political rights.
</P>
<P>
Since the initiation of reform and opening-up 20 years ago,
China's democratic and legal construction has witnessed great
improvement, and the legal protection of people's various rights
has been continuously reinforced, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
According him, in recent years, China has made greater strides
in legislation, and the Chinese National People's Congress and its
Standing Committee have passed a series of important laws
concerning labor, education, national compensation, prison,
judges, procurators, police, and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Especially from 1996 to 1997, China revised and amended its
Criminal Proceeding Law as well as the Criminal Law, which greatly
improved the legal protection over human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, while developing economy, will also
make unremitting efforts to develop democracy, reinforce legal
construction, and guarantee the human rights of its citizens, Tang
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices extended gains
on the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as widespread expectation of

end at 938.51 points.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Parties Hold Three-way Coalition Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's main political
parties met here Tuesday afternoon to begin negotiations on
forming a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by representatives from Cambodian
People's Party (CPP), Funcinpec Party and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP),
is expected to set a preliminary agenda for ongoing coalition
talks and outline procedures to be followed at Wednesday's
National Assembly meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 122-member parliament, which was sworn in Thursday in the
northern town of Siem Reap, is expected to begin work on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member Funcinpec team was led by General Secretary
Tol Lah, and included Rural Development Minister Hong Sun Huot,
Co-Interior Minister You Hockry and Cambodia's envoy to the U.N.,
Prince Sisowath Sirirath.
</P>
<P>
The six-member CPP delegation was led by Co-Interior Minister
Sar Kheng, and included cabinet head Sok An, Co-Defense Minister
Tea Banh and Secretary General Say Chhum.
</P>
<P>
The SRP's seven-member delegation included Vice General
Secretary Meng Rita and Sam Rainsy's legal advicer U. Bunlong.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the two major parties disputed on whether Sam Rainsy
Party (SRP) would be represented. Funcinpec officials said they
would follow the advice of King Sihanouk, who said last week that
the coalition talks should involve all three parties.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the King will leave Siem Reap for Beijing
on October 5 to have regular health check.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the CPP and Funcinpec briefly outlined their
objectives for the coalition negotiations. CPP politicians
reiterated that they expect their negotiations to meet with
Funcinpec counterparts to focus on getting the next government
going.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec has three objectives in the coalition
negotiations: ensure the National Assembly will function fairly,
resolve outstanding election complaints and amnesty requests for
five Funcinpec officials and work on the formation of government.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Funcinpec and SRP threatened to boycott
parliament in protest of alleged violation in the July 26
election. They staged more than a month of protests in the capital
during which at least two people were reportedly killed in clashes
between protesters and police.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Economy Faces Greater Challenges: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said here on Monday that the country's economy is facing
"greater challenges" due to natural disasters and the negative
impacts of regional financial and currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remarks in a government report he delivered to a
national conference of the provincial People's Committees and
People's Councils here.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years of renovation, Vietnam has scored great
achievements in the economic field, with its gross domestic
product up by nearly 8.5 percent annually in the 1991-1997 period,
Khai said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, while entering 1998, Vietnam's economy has
to face "great difficulties and challenges," including the heavy
losses in agriculture, forestry and fishery caused by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also stressed that the Vietnamese
government has taken measures to overcome the difficulties,
control the slowdown in production and business, keep the growth
rate at between 6.1-6.3 percent, and stabilize its macro-economic
scale.

<HEADLINE> Seventy-six Percent of Indian Women Abused: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 76 percent of
India's women suffer from some form of sexual abuse, of them 40
percent by family members and 31 percent by known persons.
</P>
<P>
The abusers within the family include maternal and paternal
uncles and male cousins (42 percent), according to an extensive
survey conducted by Recovering and Health from Incest (RAHI), a
Delhi-based women's support group.
</P>
<P>
Fathers and brothers, male neighbors and family friends, and
even servants were also listed as abusers by the survey published
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, "Voices from Silent Zone," is based on experiences
of incest and childhood sexual abuse of 600 middle and upper
middle class Indian women.
</P>
<P>
Respondents recalled their confusion, anger, disgust,
helplessness, fear, shame, humiliation, guilt and self-blame at
being abused by persons they trusted.
</P>
<P>
The survey gave details of some women who were abused since
their childhood.
</P>
<P>
A 35-year-old advertising professional had been abused by her
paternal uncle, male cousin and two male domestic servants between
the ages of 4 and 6, 8 and 22.
</P>
<P>
"I was abused from 8 years onwards everyday in the summer
holidays, from 16 years onwards almost everyday till I was 18,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that the earliest age at which a woman
recalled being abused was only 2. One of the respondents recalled
being abused even in the nursery.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 50 percent of the abuse has taken place below the age
of 12 years and 49 percent above 12," said Anuja Gupta, director
of RAHI. "The abuse clearly spans almost half a century and is
spread over different kinds of family systems."
</P>
<P>
The study is said to be the first in the country to have such a
vast data bank from the middle and upper middle class.
</P>
<P>
The report also throws light on the background of the
respondents, who were broadly divided into 7 categories in terms
of their occupation.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of the respondents were students, the
remaining were a mix of employed women and housewives.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that 73 percent of the respondents were between the
ages of 18 to 25, whereas 22 percent were above the age of 25 and
5 percent below the age of 18.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Renews Call for Preferences for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Tuesday repeated his call for all Australian voters,
including One Nation (Party) supporters, to send their preferences
to his coalition in a bid to get enough votes for re-election.
</P>
<P>
"I ask all Australians who don't vote for either the coalition
or the Labor Party, to think of the outcome if they vote for the
(opposition) Labor Party," he told reporters in Queensland state,
where the support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party is
stronger than the national average.
</P>
<P>
"And if people voting for minor parties - be it the Greens, be
it the Democrats, be it One Nation, be it anybody else - if they
don't want a Labor government then they should take care, no
matter what their preferred party's how-to-vote-card says, to
direct their preferences to the coalition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The renewed appeal for preferences came as the latest opinion
poll, which was published Tuesday in the national newspaper The
Australian, shows the support for both the ruling Liberal Party
and National Party coalition and the Labor Party is still
neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll conducted last weekend, the coalition
gained only 43 percent of the primary votes and the Labor Party
won 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor has retained an election-winning lead on the
two-party preferred vote, making the distribution of One Nation
preferences vital to the October 3 poll outcome.
</P>
<P>
As 47 out of a total of 148 Lower House seats are marginal and
neither the coalition nor the Labor is expected to gain more than
50 percent of the primary votes, the second preferences would
decide who is the winner of the election.
</P>
<P>
Under Australia's preferential voting system, voters are
required to rank candidates representing different parties or
groups in order of preference on the ballot papers. To be elected,
a candidate must achieve an absolute majority, namely, at least 50
percent plus one vote, either on first preference or following
distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate has more than half of the votes, the candidate
with the fewest votes is excluded. This excluded candidate's votes
are transferred to the other candidates according to the second
preferences shown by voters on the ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
This process of excluding candidates one by one, continues
until one candidate has more than half the total votes and is
declared elected.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Howard last week called on voters to direct the
second preferences to his coalition if they refuse to direct their
first ones.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
ended stronger Tuesday, shrugging off earlier losses on the back
of a solid performance by Australia's telecommunications giant
Telstra and other industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index climbed 12.0 points to
2,603.6, off an intra-day low of 2,570.0.
</P>
<P>
However, brokers said investors remained cautious, sticking
with so-called safe-haven stocks ahead of the meeting of the
Federal Open Markets Committee, which is expected to announce a
rate cut of at least 25 basis points in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 266.01 million shares valued at
583.48 million U.S. dollars. Rises narrowly outpaced falls by 474
to 448, with 395 stocks steady.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index firmed 23.6 points, or half a
percent, to 4,565.6 while the all resources index edged up 2.1
points to 1,022.4.
</P>
<P>
Telstra installment receipts surged 20 Australian cents, or 4.3
percent, to 4.81 Australian dollars on volume of 21.77 million
shares worth 61.27 million U.S. dollars, placing it at the top of
the turnover table.

Diversified miner BHP forfeited eight cents to 12.27 Australian
dollars, global miner Rio Tinto moved up six cents to 20.26

better at 296.60 U.S. dollars per fine ounce by 15:20 Australian

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Firmer on U.S. Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Tuesday as financial markets around the world prepared
for an interest rate cut in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) will
meet early Wednesday morning (Australian Eastern Standard Time).
</P>
<P>
Glen Howard, an expert at Perpetual Funds Management, said a
boost in the price of gold helped the local currency sustain its
gains.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 59.78 U.S. cents from 58.85
U.S. cents at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
Howard said if the U.S. committee decides to cut interest rates
the Australian dollar would be traded at 60.00 U.S. cents level
again.
</P>
<P>
An FOMC meeting that resulted in no interest rate cut could
have adverse effects on the market, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 80.40 Japanese yen from 79.92 yen
Monday and 1.0003 German marks from 0.9916 marks.

<HEADLINE> Descendant of Chinese Bankers Revives the Family Tradition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Mao Minghui, a 31-year-old
antique shop owner in China's Shanxi Province, is a descendent of
China's earliest banker, and reflects the old family spirit.
</P>
<P>
He earns 200,000 yuan annually, 41 times the annual income of
an ordinary worker, from the antique shop, which is on the site of
the money exchange that dealt in loans and money changing, opened
by his forefathers.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of visitors come here because of the name and
prestige of my family," he says proudly. "My great great
grandfather, Mao Honghui, opened the first money exchange in China
on Western Street in the city of Pingyao 170 years ago."
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, it had more than 400 branches across China, and
dominated the financial sector in China. It also had agencies in
Russia, Mongolia, Japan and Korea. Southern Street alone had 22
banks and was known as the "Wall Street" of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
However, the old family banking business declared bankruptcy in
the 1930s as a result of the great increase in the number of
foreign financial institutions in China and the failure to shift
to more modern methods.
</P>
<P>
For quite a long time afterwards, the descendants of this
notable family had to live on less than 100 yuan a month and
couldn't even afford the maintenance costs of the houses they had
inherited.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky to live in the days of reforms," Mao says, "in
recent years, the local government has had a series of
preferential land use, loan, and tax policies to encourage the
descendants of local traders to carry on the family line."

<HEADLINE> Polio, Ebola May Spread out of Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Diseases such as polio and
even the dreaded Ebola virus could strike the rest of the world
from Africa unless vaccination efforts keep rolling, a UN health
official has warned.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Samba, regional director of the World Health
Organization (WHO) for Africa, joined U.S. Surgeon-General David
Satcher in warning that Africa's vaccination campaign may be
starting to falter, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Samba noted that some outbreaks of Ebola, a highly contagious
virus that causes haemorrhage, killed 70 percent of its victims
and polio once killed two million people a year.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the extraordinary progress toward polio eradication,
progress in Africa has not kept pace with progress in other
regions," Satcher was also quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
WHO, which hopes to eliminate polio by 2000, says some
countries are not contributing as much as needed.
</P>
<P>
He said that conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone and some other African countries had
badly interfered with the vaccination program.

Southern Street is now a busy shopping center with 73 stores,
60 of them involved in the antique business. Together, they do
300,000 yuan in business daily, and have become the largest
antique market in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a government policy to diversify the economy, the
number of private businesses in Pingyao have gone from a dozen in
the early 1980s to more than 10,000 now in retail sales, food
processing, coal, textiles, and transport. The taxes paid by these
companies accounted for 18 percent of the county's annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
Mao signed a 10-year land lease with the local government, with
no rent for the first two years, and only fifty percent for the
remaining eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The key to becoming a wealthy merchant is to have a shrewd
brain," he says, "I often ponder customers' demands, write down
their requests, and get more information about antiques from the
Internet, TV programs, and newspapers."
</P>
<P>
Since Pingyao was listed as a key world heritage site by UNESCO
in 1997, Mao's shop is always packed with people from all over.
</P>
<P>
Kong Xiangyi, a banking analyst, says that those bankers in
Pingyao had a great deal of prestige a century ago, and that
glorious tradition and pioneering spirit can be carried forward by
later generations.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, more flexible government policies and economic
reforms may just give them the chance to exercise their abilities,
he adds.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Fraud Move Helps Increase Foreign Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Director of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) Wu Xiaoling said today
that the nationwide foreign exchange inspection conducted recently
will help increase China's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The figure of foreign exchange reserves to be released for
September will surely be bigger than that contained in the last
release," she said.
</P>
<P>
The official figure of foreign exchange reserves in early
August was 140.2 billion U.S. dollars, lower than the figure of
140.7 billion U.S. dollars published at the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the latest anti-fraud move has discovered several
billions of U.S. dollars in fake customs reports.
</P>
<P>
She said that there are a number of reasons for the stagnancy
of the country's foreign exchange reserves: delayed payment by
trade partners in some Asian countries hit by the financial
crisis; the raising of the quota of foreign exchange for
individual applications; residents prefer to deposit in foreign
exchange after interest cuts of Renminbi; and foreign exchange
fraud.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Objects Iraq's Return in Arab Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti sports
official said Kuwait will stand against all attempts that aim at
bringing Iraq back to Arab sports events, a local Arabic daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Kuwaiti Olympic Committee and the Kuwaiti
Soccer Federation, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd said in an interview with
Al-Anba that "Kuwait's position is clear and no one has the rights
to overlook Kuwait's rights."
</P>
<P>
There were news reports saying Kuwait has accepted Iraq's
participation in the upcoming Arab Cup Soccer Tournament to be
hosted in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad said that Iraq, which invaded and occupied Kuwait in
1990-1991, can only return to Arab sports events after
implementing all United Nations resolutions, including the release
of Kuwait's prisoners of war (POW) and detainees.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claimed that Iraq is still holding about 600 Kuwait's
POWs, an allegation that the Iraqis denied.
</P>
<P>
"We will not shake hands stained with blood before they return
to us all rights," Ahmad said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Set for Transformation: Kenyan Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for East
and South Africa (COMESA) clearing house is set to be transformed
into a Regional Export Services Agency (RESA) to explore the
regional "enormous" potential, said a Kenyan minister.
</P>
<P>
Minister for East African and Regional Cooperation Nicholas
Biwott said Monday that if the body's Clearing House is well
restructured, 100,000 new job opportunities will be created in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade volume in the region would also go up by
4.8 billion Shillings (800 million U.S. Dollars), he was quoted
by Kenyan press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Clearing House was formed in 1981 to create a
machinery for the settlement of trade and services payments among
the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The transformation is expected to assist regional business by
expediting transfer of funds to suppliers of goods and services,
and providing for continuing education on trade and business
development issues.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Clearing House is expected to offer a
service that covers political risk whenever a financial
institution is willing to cover the associated commercial risk.
This will be known as African Guarantee Facility (AGF).
</P>
<P>
The house will also offer the Fast Payment Facility, based on
reciprocal payments and credits agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the move would generate 177 million Dollars for its
shareholders over the next decade," Biwott said at a one-day
workshop on the introduction of the Fast Payment Facility (FAP),
organized by COMESA.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Industry Shows Huge Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said Tuesday that 1997
saw an increase of 42.10 percent in tourism surplus totaling
161.63 billion baht (4.03 billion dollars), compared with the
surplus of 113.743 billion baht (2.84 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of the sudden reduction in expenditure by
outgoing Thai travelers, from 105.621 billion baht (2.64 billion
dollars) in 1996 to 59.125 billion baht (1.48 billion dollars) in
1997, a 44.02 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from incoming tourists totaled 220.754 billion baht
(5.52 billion dollars) in 1997, about the same as the 219.364
billion baht (5.48 billion dollars) recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said they were both a clear
indication of the impact of the country's economic crisis but also
the importance of inbound tourism in facilitating the return to
economic normalcy.
</P>
<P>
The TAT reported 75.8 billion baht (1.90 billion dollars) in
overall spending on shopping, a decline of 10.76 percent last
year. It was a clear reflection of the diminishing purchasing
power of once high-spending tourists like the Japanese and
Koreans. The figure showed the impact of the economic crisis on
travel and tourism.
</P>
<P>
As for tourism revenue in the first 7 months of this year, the
TAT reported 151.70 billion baht (3.79 billion dollars), a 19.4
percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
International arrivals until July were 4,379,210, a 5.4 percent
increase over 1997.

<HEADLINE> EU Program Targets Kenyan Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan exporters are
expected to benefit from an European Commission-funded program
aimed at improving the quality and diversity of their products.
</P>
<P>
The program will initially concentrate on companies dealing in
horticulture, meat and fish products, packaging materials,
processed foods, agricultural inputs, machinery and equipment,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It aims "to assist Kenyan companies to add value to their
traditional and manufactured exports," said Peter Muthoka, chief
of Kenya's Export Promotion Council (EPC).
</P>
<P>
The program will be administered through six national trade
bodies -- the Federation of Kenya Employers, Kenya Association of
Manufacturers, Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya,
Kenya Fish Exporters Association and the Kenya National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Muthoka also called for more private companies to participate
in the project so as to promote Kenya's share in the European
Union market.
</P>
<P>
The EPC will intensify its activities to promote Kenya as a
source of high quality goods and a good investment opportunity,
especially for the emerging markets, he said.

Chinese origin, and international friends to participate in
China's modernization, reforms, and opening up in various ways,

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Huge Trade Deficit in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded
an unexpected trade deficit of 2.96 billion Rand (about 500
million U.S. Dollars) in August from 253 million Rand (42 million
Dollars) in July, local reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The surprise widening in the deficit took the cumulative trade
balance for the year to a deficit of 257 million Rand (42.8
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists had predicted a 700-million-Rand
(117-million-Dollar) surplus, based on the weaker Rand boosting
exports and inhibiting imports.
</P>
<P>
However, exports plummeted last month from July, falling to
11.86 billion Rand (1.98 billion Dollars) from 14.11 billion Rand
(2.35 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists said exports were hurt by slack demand in Asia,
particularly for precious metals and gems. Demand from the rest
of Africa for South Africa's manufactured exports, especially
vehicles, also appeared to have weakened.
</P>
<P>
Imports were slightly up, rising to 14.82 billion Rand (2.47
billion Dollars) in August from 14.36 billion Rand (2.39 billion
Dollars) in July. The import bill was distorted by the purchase
of an airplane, which accounted for about one billion Rand (167
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists worried that they would have to revise their
forecasts for the current account deficit for the year, but said
they would wait for another month's figures before taking a more
pessimistic view.
</P>
<P>
One of the positive spin-offs of the weak Rand was expected to
be a small current account deficit of about one percent of gross
domestic product this year. The deficit is a key indicator for
foreign investors, especially for South Africa, as the country
has a low level of foreign exchange reserves and needs foreign
capital to cover the current account deficit.

<HEADLINE> Devaluation Is Not Viable Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Director of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), Wu Xiaoling, told a
press conference today that devaluation of the yuan will not be a
choice for China to stimulate exports.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that a country devalues its currency only when there is
a deficit in the international balance of payments and it does not
have sufficient foreign exchange reserves. China does not have
such a problem.
</P>
<P>
She said that devaluation is always a double-edged sword and
that nobody can say just how much it may contribute to exports,
but that it can certainly have a negative impact on people's
confidence in the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the case of China, she said, "increasing domestic demand is
the key. A country this big can not rely on devaluation to
stimulate economic growth."

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China Tuesday
signed on as a platinum sponsor in support of the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Business summit 1998 to be
held in Kuala Lumpur on November 14-16.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China, the leading bank in China, committed a
contribution of 200,000 U.S. dollars under the sponsorship
agreement signed here Tuesday by Abdullah Mat Zaid and Shafiq Sit
Abdullah, Co-chairs of APEC, and Du Chaohua, deputy general
manager of the bank's international department.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China is the sixth platinum sponsor. Five other
platinum sponsors are from the United States and Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Shafiq said on the occasion, "With Bank of China moving
strongly towards a more visible participative role in the region,
we are confident that its role in the summit will help provide
constructive solution to current regional economic contagion."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also praised Bank of China for the sponsorship, saying
Bank of China's decision to sponsor the summit will augur well
particularly at a time when a demonstration of commitment to
Malaysia and Asia during this period of economic uncertainty will
go a long way in promoting a stronger foundation for the future.
</P>
<P>
Du said, "We believe that the upcoming APEC and its Business
Summit 1998 will render positive influences in finding solutions
to the regional and global problems by means of promoting the
exchange of views between the related governments themselves, the
government and corporations, and the corporations themselves. We
sponsor this summit with an aim to promote such exchanges."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Justifies Egypt's Growing Military Might </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has dismissed Israel's jitters about Egypt's growing
military power, saying that balanced peace should be supported
with power.
</P>
<P>
"Israel wants to monopolize all types of nuclear weapons and
missiles and to deny others the right to procure the same
weapons," said Mubarak in an exclusive interview with the mass
circulation Arabic daily "Al Ahram."
</P>
<P>
It is quite surprising that while the whole world is playing
the deaf at such Israeli attitude, questions erupt whenever "we"
obtain a missile, said Mubarak in the interview, the first
instalment of which was published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a balance of powers," the president stressed in
the interview given on the occasion marking the 25th anniversary
of the October 6 victory, noting that Israeli allegations about
the growing Egyptian military power is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said that at a time when Israel owns all kinds of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, its talk about Egypt's growing
military power is either a "pre-emptive attack" to cover up the
missile they have recently experimented or a political lever to
elicit Egypt's pressure on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis are working toward a deal on a
U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. The peace process have languished for 19 months over
Israel's settlement building and their differences over the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1973, the Egyptian army took Israeli forces by
surprise and crossed the Suez Canal, which Israel had held since
capturing Egypt's Sinai peninsula in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were later pushed back, but Arab's first and
initial victory erased the shame of the 1967 defeat and allowed
Egypt to move toward peace.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Wants Erosion Control Law To Be Followed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China is just getting over
the catastrophic floods of this summer as an inspection team of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress sets off
to check on how China's Soil Erosion Control Law is being enforced.
</P>
<P>
The team will visit the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and
the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Soil erosion on the upper
reaches of Yangtze has been widely blamed for aggravating this
year's floods because of excessive logging.
</P>
<P>
The team heard reports here today on how the law has been
enforced by 12 ministries. Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing
Committee and head of the the inspection team, said at the meeting
that the Soil Erosion Control Law is meant to protect the
environment, reduce the effects of natural disasters, and control
water and soil resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the law took effect seven years ago,
government efforts have had a good effect, but, he added, because
of excessive logging, land abuse, and the discharge of waste into
rivers, the ecology of many large rivers has got worse in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
He attributes the catastrophic flooding on the Yangtze,
Nenjiang, and Songhua rivers this summer to severe soil erosion on
the upper reaches. He says he expects the inspection work to
increase awareness of the need for water and soil conservation and
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The people's congresses of Liaoning, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guizhou,
Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces and the Guangxi and Ningxia
autonomous regions and Chongqing municipality have been authorized
to look into the law enforcement situation in regions under their
jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Permitted to Buy, Sell Currency in Other Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to allow
foreign-funded banks to buy and transfer foreign currencies in cities
other than their locations.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoling, director of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE), told a press conference here today that China has
prohibited Chinese banks to handle such business in order to stamp
out fraud.
</P>
<P>
She said that many people used counterfeit documents to
repeatedly purchase foreign currencies from a bank's branches that
are located in different cities.
</P>
<P>
She said that this illegal activity is hard to monitor at
present.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that China will allow foreign banks to
continue to buy and transfer foreign currencies for foreign-funded
enterprises that have already opened settlement accounts with the
banks' branches in different cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
She said that this is aimed to provide convenience for and
retain the business traditions of foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that these foreign-funded enterprises must
apply for registration forms from SAFE.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will intensify supervision on foreign banks
handling sales and transfer of foreign currencies in different
cities.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises have to present the registration
forms when buying or selling foreign currencies in cities
other than their locations. SAFE branches in different cities will
verify the authenticity of the registration forms by calling their
counterpart that issued them.

ZHUHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- France's worldwide supermarket
chain Carrefour plans to open its ninth supermarket in China in
the city of Zhuhai, in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications Zhuhai branch will provide 100 million
yuan in loans for the new supermarket.
</P>
<P>
The group plans to open five more supermarkets in China by the

</P>
<P>
The 14 supermarkets will cover more than 100,000 square meters
of floor space and are expected to bring in about two billion yuan
in business a year.
</P>
<P>
Carrefour's first supermarket in southern China opened in
1996 in Shenzhen. It had 152 million yuan in business during the
first half of this year and has become one of the busiest
supermarkets there.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China has had an average
industrial growth rate of 12 percent annually over the past twenty
years thanks to the reforms and opening-up policy, according to
the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total industrial assets were worth 11.6 trillion yuan,
26.6 times the 1978 figure, and the added value of the industrial
sector as a whole reached 3.2 trillion yuan, 7.6 times the 1978
figure.
</P>
<P>
The SSB figures also show substantial increases in steel,
cement and chemical fertilizer output.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has also had rapid growth and has played an
important role in industrial development. Last year, 76.5 percent
of the added industrial value came from this sector.
</P>
<P>
The SSB attributes the progress to government policies of
greater managerial authority for industrial enterprises and to the
introduction of foreign funds and advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The government has also established a modern enterprise
system. More than 2,000 manufacturers had been either closed down
or declared bankrupt by the end of 1997. Nearly 5,000 enterprises
had been purchased or merged.
</P>
<P>
A number of large industrial groups have been formed to give
full scope to the efficiency of operation of scale and advance the
adjustment of the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
There are, however, some problems, like the large number of
money losers, low economic returns and duplicated construction
projects. The SSB says that more effective measures to deal with
the irrational industrial mix and discrepancies in regional
economic development are needed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs Strike Over Umm Al-Fahem Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arabs started a
one-day nationwide strike Tuesday following the two-day clashes
between Israeli Arabs and the Israeli police in Umm Al-Fahem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces have been put on full alert
to prevent further violence during the strike.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian political leaders also called on the
Palestinians in the self-ruled West Bank and Gaza Strip to join
the strike and show their support for the Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called for by Israeli Arab leaders to protest
what they described as brutal behavior by Israeli police and
border police during the clashes in Umm Al-Fahem, in which over
100 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted Sunday after the demolition of a protest
tent set up three weeks ago by the local residents on disputed
land near Umm Al-Fahem, about 30 kilometers southeast of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said that the area is the army's firing
range. The army also said that an agreement was reached with the
residents to nationalize about 50 hectares of their land in
exchange for about six times as much land elsewhere. But local
residents said the land confiscation is unfair.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman expressed his dismay on Monday about
the incidents in Umm Al-Fahem, saying it is important to have
peaceful coexistence between Israeli Arabs and Jewish citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn to live with the Arab population in this
country," he told the Israel Radio, adding that "it is a shame
there was such a flare-up. Whoever has managed to negotiate a
ceasefire deserves credit."
</P>
<P>
Weizman is scheduled to visit Umm Al-Fahen area Tuesday and
try to settle the dispute, his office said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Urged to Be Realistic in Addressing Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) has been urged to be realistic in
addressing the issue of regional economic crisis instead of
focusing on its long-term vision on what an ideal economy should
be.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal at the two-day fourth APEC Investment
symposium which began here Tuesday, Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said, "Every year during APEC
meeting there is a (new) vision; APEC is the most visionary
forum...I hope it may not be a blurred vision."
</P>
<P>
But if the short-term problems were not addressed properly at
present, they could actually affect the APEC economies in the
long-term as a result, she said while acknowledging that in the
long-term, most members may favor a "perfect" business
environment where trade liberalization is considered as the
ultimate level of achievement.
</P>
<P>
She said that even nations which were not directly involved in
the financial crisis could be indirectly affected due to the
"boomerang" effect if there were no related measures taken at APEC
or other international level.
</P>
<P>
She said every APEC member has the sovereign right to maintain
particular domestic policies based on determined priorities and
objectives because there cannot be one APEC investment regime or
one single APEC framework that can be made applicable across the
board in the region, although some basic investment principles
could be subscribed to by each member economy.
</P>
<P>
It is important that due cognizance be given to the differing
levels of socio-economic development among APEC members which have
made it necessary to implement certain domestic policies to
achieve specific socio-economic activities, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The principle of voluntarism also meant an APEC
economy which cannot subscribe to any particular investment
principle should not be regarded as less favored as a host
location for investors."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in trade liberalization, APEC has "high
ideals" of achieving barrier-free trade and barrier-free
investment environments within the region, with impeded cross-flow
of investments being guaranteed via most favored nation or
treatment status.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, these are noble objectives, but as in anything else
in the real economic environment, such high ideals must
necessarily be tempered by pragmatism and reality," she said.
</P>
<P>
APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium is hosted by the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority (MIDA) on behalf of the APEC Investment
Experts Group (IEG).

<HEADLINE> Popular Chinese Pop Singer Fined for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that
its tax administrative department has imposed a fine of 813,000
yuan on the pop singer Mao A'min for not paying 271,000 yuan in
taxes from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The tax department completed its investigation of Mao's case,
but the judicial department will look into the matter further and
the possible involvement of other persons.
</P>
<P>
Mao and people she works with will have to pay a total of 3.33
million yuan, which includes back taxes, the fine, some fines
levied on associates, and interest on overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
Mao was fined once before for tax evasion in 1989. The tax
department study this time showed that from January 1994 to March
1996, she and her associates failed to pay 1.06 million yuan in
taxes levied on profits from 109 performances in 13 provinces.
</P>
<P>
An open hearing on Mao's case was held today in the city of
Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, where the tax evasion charge is
being adjudicated, at the request of Mao's agent.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Masses at Congo (K) Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan troops have deployed
heavily and have been put on alert along the frontline bordering
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) following reported
bombings of a Ugandan village by DRC war planes Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Bukaka Village in western district of
Bundibugyo was the second in about two months. The first was in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
A New Vision report said Tuesday that commanders of Ugandan
People's Defense Forces could not be reached for the confirmation
of the size of the fresh deployment, but quoted unnamed senior
officers as saying that they have the manpower to guard the
country from any foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts was dispatched to assess the damage from the
bombing, it added.
</P>
<P>
The local paper noted it was still too early to say the
bombing was in retaliation to Uganda's alleged involvement in the
eight-week-long armed conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Banyamulenge soldiers rose against DRC
President Laurent Kabila on August 2, Kabila has directed his
finger of blame at Uganda, souring relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a BBC report said that Sudan declared a state of
general mobilization Monday to confront what it called an attack
by Uganda and Eritrea in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Sudanese government declared a
nationwide mobilization since January 1997 when Khartoum said it
had been invaded by Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Sudan accuses Eritrea, Uganda and Ethiopia of fighting with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army. All the three countries deny
the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Yangtze River Can Clean Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River, which
runs through China's several nonferrous-metal-rich areas, has not
suffered any metal pollution, and scientists recently discovered
that the river can clean itself up.
</P>
<P>
Metal pollution accidents have been reported on tributaries
along the lower reaches of the Yangtze in Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui
provinces, which are rich in cadmium, mercury, lead and zinc
deposits. The stibium deposits in Hunan account for 48 percent of
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have studied Hunan's Dongting Lake, China's second
largest and a major fish and rice producer, and found that
tributaries running into the lake bring in pollutants like
cadmium, stibium, mercury and lead. But after mixing with the
Yangtze River water, the poisonous elements disappear.
</P>
<P>
They explain that when the Yangtze passes through the Three
Gorges area, its calcium and magnesium content rises greatly and
the water is alkaline. The alkaline water then neutralizes the
acid water from the tributaries in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Chemical compounds from the neutralization process have been
found in soil layers around the lake and, scientists say, are
buried in the soil, controlling the spread of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the river's ability to clean itself is the
reason for its good natural environment and why it has become
China's major rice and fish production base, as well as one of the
origins of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
However, they also warn that human's abuse of the river and
industrial pollution will damage the river's ability to clean
itself and that pollution must be controlled before it is too
late.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
revealed today that a recent nation-wide foreign exchange
inspection has discovered fake customs reports involving several
billions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference today, Director of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) Wu Xiaoling said that
ever since the beginning of this year, the number of foreign
exchange defraud and tax rebate swindling cases with fake
documents have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this situation, SAFE and some other related
government organizations jointly launched a foreign exchange
inspection in July to verify the reality of all the customs
reports valued above 200,000 U.S. dollars under foreign exchange
purchase and payment by TT, LC and D/P in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Based on the findings of this inspection, SAFE has enhanced
verifications for current account transactions, in a bid to
safeguard the national economic security, Wu said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to End Deal With Cathay Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- With Philippine Airlines (PAL)
expected to resume operations next week, the Philippine government
is to end the lease agreement with Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific
Airways, allowing the airline's temporary takeover of the domestic
routes left by PAL.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said here Tuesday that he
has already received orders from President Joseph Estrada to
inform Cathay Pacific of the deal's termination.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has succeeded in brokering an agreement between the PAL
management and PAL labor union that will lead to PAL's likely
re-opening on October 7.
</P>
<P>
Labor union officials informed the president Monday that they
have decided to accept the offer of PAL chairman Lucio Tan for
employees to accept a suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent ownership of
the airline and three seats in the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific and a subsidiary of the Philippine National Bank
signed Sunday a lease agreement allowing the Hong Kong-based
airline to fill the void left by PAL's closure on September 23.
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, Cathay Pacific aircraft began flying major
domestic routes in the Philippines under the lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Executive Secretary Zamora also said that the
government is eyeing the sale of its shares in PAL to investors
who want to infuse capital into the airline.

<HEADLINE> NZ Govt Out to Deal With Serious Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley launched here Tuesday the NZ Government's "Policies
for Progress" to deal with the shrinking economy and worsening
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, which is contained in Shipley's
statement, the New Zealand Government will sell state-owned
Contact Energy, postpone the deadline for removing all tariffs,
and move the floor for superannuation from 65 percent of the
average wage to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said in the statement that the government has agreed to
work towards the sale of Contact Energy. Money from the sale will
"help us back into surplus and pay off debt".
</P>
<P>
According to Treasurer Bill Birch, the Contact Energy has a
book value of 860 million NZ dollars (430 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The NZ government rejected the suggestion of removing all
tariffs immediately in 2000 and has reached agreement on a
timeline for the reduction of tariffs to zero in 2006, Shipley
said.
</P>
<P>
"This track also sees New Zealand meet its international
obligations in good time," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Shipley, the lowering of the floor for
superannuation "will help to ensure the affordability and
sustainability of the current scheme".
</P>
<P>
She noted the "Policies for Progress" see "us managing our
budget so we can invest in our future while still acting
responsibly in relation to international economic realities".
</P>
<P>
The new measures will go through the Parliament in the next
three days, Shipley said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Ban On Cutting Natural Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 loggers in
the city of Chongqing have started planting and protecting trees
instead of cutting them as part of a Chinese government project to
protect natural forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing no longer allows local people to cut down a single
tree. Specialists say that the ecology in the city, which sprawls
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has a very important
bearing on the safety of the Three Gorges Reservoir and the
safety, lives, and property of people living along the middle and
lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Excessive cutting and uncontrolled farming have reduced the
forest coverage in the city to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
A local forestry bureau official says that Chongqing now has
only about 1.14 million hectares of natural forests and he
stresses the significance of protecting natural forests because of
their contribution to soil and water conservation, and climatic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has allocated 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars) to help Chongqing re-employ loggers and people who
work in the forest industry.

<HEADLINE> Securities Bill Tabled in Malaysian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Securities
Industries (Central Depository) (Amendment) Bill 1998 was tabled
Tuesday in Parliament, which aims at ensuring transparency in
security transactions in an effort to restore investor confidence
in Malaysia's stock market.
</P>
<P>
The bill was tabled by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who is also first finance minister, at the House of
Representatives which began a two-day special sitting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments cover 28 clauses, including new
definitions, ruling against security withdrawals, mandatory
deposits for fixed securities and ruling against off-market
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir explained the rationale for the amendments and said
the proposed amendments are necessary to reinforce administrative
measures taken by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), the
Securities Clearing Automated Network Services (SCANS) and the
Malaysian Central Depository (MCD).
</P>
<P>
He said the move was in line with the National Economic
Recovery Plan, It was also in keeping with the need to restore
investor confidence in the market and as such administrative and
legal measures would have to be taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
The amendments aimed at enhancing transparency and transactions
of KLSE-listed shares and confine dealings to only at the KLSE or
other legally recognized stock markets, thus banning off-market
transactions like the Central Limit Order Book (CLOB).
</P>
<P>
The amendments also seek to check misuse of nominees by
requiring all equity holdings be made in the name of the
beneficial owner or authorized nominee.
</P>
<P>
The amendments would also provide for penalties to be imposed
on those contravening the rules and regulations governing
securities trading in Malaysia or trading involving shares of
Malaysian companies.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also beef up enforcement capabilities of
regulatory agencies to ensure prompt and effective actions
against violators of the securities procedures and rulings,
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has exposed various weaknesses in the
securities industry which required to be rectified in order to
restore confidence in the Malaysian capital market, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament will debate at the special sitting several bills
relating to the securities industry, futures trading and
companies.
</P>
<P>
Other bills to be debated include the Securities Industry
(Amendment) Bill 1998, Futures Trading Industry (Amendment) Bill
1998, Securities Commission (Amendment) Bill 1998 and Companies
(Amendment) (No.2) Bill 1998.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives will sit for two days starting
Tuesday while the Senate will sit Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Coal Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up the
development of coal gas as a major new energy source with a series
of preferential loan policies and fee exemptions.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Coal Industry Administration official,
the government will not collect compensation fees for exploitation
of coal gas resources for the initial stage of development, and
loans will be made available for key coal gas projects.
</P>
<P>
China has given priority to coal gas to make up for shortfalls
in the energy supply. The increased use of coal gas is expected to
improve the energy resource structure, reduce air pollution, and
make production safer.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in coal gas resources. Coal fields in the
northern, northeastern and southern parts of China are estimated
to have 3.5 billion cu.m. of recoverable resources.
</P>
<P>
The country has had over 50 coal gas projects, including a
650,000-cu.m. gas storage tank and a total of 620,000-meter-long
coal gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The administration source says that the national annual
utilization of coal gas is more than 400 million cu.m.

<HEADLINE> Former Malaysian Deputy PM Pleads Not Guilty at Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian deputy
prime minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim pleaded not
guilty in the Sessions Court here Tuesday to five charges of
corruption and four for committing sodomy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was produced in Sessions Court 4 at the Jalan Raja
courts complex here Tuesday noon, replied "tidak bersalah, mohon
dibicara" (not guilty, I claim trial) to each charge when the
court interpreter read out the charges one by one to him and each
time he was asked to enter his plea.
</P>
<P>
Judge Puan Hasnah Mohd Hashim presided over the proceedings.
The prosecution was headed by senior deputy public prosecutor
Abdul Gani Patail while Anwar had seven lawyers led by Raja Aziz
Addruse to represent him.
</P>
<P>
Present in court were Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, his
father Ibrahim Abdul Rahman and his father-in-law Wan Ismail as
well as his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
Clad in brown pants and a checkered shirt, Anwar was smiling as
he entered the courtroom. He then embraced his wife, his daughters
and his father.
</P>
<P>
Judge Puan Hasnah later granted an application by the
prosecution to transfer the case for hearing at the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested by police on September 20 under the Internal
Security Act following riots by his supporters here.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrest, Anwar was implicated in two cases of
committing unnatural sex act when his adopted brother and a male
friend confessed in court that they had been sodomized by him.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine charges mentioned at the court here, one more
charge of unnatural sex act against Anwar will be mentioned at the
Petaling Jaya court near here Wednesday, according to an
announcement by the Attorney-General's Chambers earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement signed by Special Officer to the
Attorney- General, Shamsuddin Hassan, the attorney-general as the
public prosecutor was satisfied that there was sufficient "prima
facie" evidence to charge Anwar for the offenses.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance on September 2 and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) the following day for "low morals".
</P>
<P>
Anwar's supporters had held several illegal assemblies in the
Jalan Raja courthouse area here since his detention forcing police
to impose tight security.

to safeguarding and promoting peace, stability and development in
the region and the rest of the world.

mining has threatened one of Mexico's main tourist destinations as
land sinks and buildings crack under the strain.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the city of Taxco, in the state of Guerrero, fear
the situation could result in a tragedy unless they are
compensated for the damage.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, evidence of cracking and flooding in southern
Taxco neighborhoods has appeared, and the residents blame the
misuse of explosives by mining companies, the government news agency
Notimex reported on Monday.

<P>
In some areas, the ground has subsided by 20 meters. so far no
deaths or injuries have been reported but dozens of inhabitants
fear "a great disaster" is in the making, said Notimex.

Romeo Aleman Serrano, leader of the affected group of
households, said his group had sent letters to state governor
Angel Aguirre Rivero, asking for compensation from the mining
companies for the damage and demanding that the area be declared
hazardous.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Year Gems Emporium to Be Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A mid-year gems emporium will
be held here from October 16 to 22 and preparations are underway,
according to the Myanmar mines authorities.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 gems merchants from 20 countries and regions, mostly
from Japan, Thailand, China and China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, are expected to attend the emporium, the
seventh of its kind.
</P>
<P>
At the emporium, gems, jade, pearl and jewelry will be sold at
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, has held gems emporiums annually since 1964 with
additional mid-year ones introduced in the past six years since
1992.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar earned more than 260 million U.S. dollars from the last
35 annual and six mid-year gems emporiums.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated a new gemstone law in September 1995,
allowing local entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport and sell
finished gemstone and manufacture jewelry at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition to allowing the local private sector to mine and
process gems in the country, the government also set up
joint-ventures with companies from Thailand and Malaysia for the
activities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, an Israeli company and a Myanmar private
one jointly set up a gems center here, applying advanced Israeli
methods to produce quality jewelry.

<P>
ROME, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Spanish King Juan Carlos Monday
urged Italian business leaders to extend trade ties with Spain to
help promote development in the backward parts of both countries
and the entire Mediterranean basin.
</P>
<P>
Carlos, on a five-day trip to Italy which began with an early
afternoon meeting with Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
called for new Italo-Spanish business initiatives to help reduce
the unemployment "which afflicts our countries".
</P>
<P>
"Economic collaboration between the Italian and Iberian
peninsulas has a 20-century tradition," Carlos told the gathering
of top businessmen, noting that Italy was Spain's third largest
trade partner.
</P>
<P>
"Today there is a strong desire to find areas of cooperation
that prevail over the possible difficulties linked to our
respective economic interests," Carlos added.
</P>
<P>
The king, who was born in Italy 60 years ago, said the two
economies could be made to complement each other for the good of
the whole Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Spain's economy was less saturated, cheaper and had good
penetration into some non-European Union regions, while Italy's
was more flexible and innovative and had a great capacity to meet
demand, Carlos said.
</P>
<P>
Along with Queen Sofia, he is on his second official visit to
Italy. During his tour, he will become the first foreign head of
state to address the Italian Senate and Chamber of Deputies (lower
house).
</P>
<P>
The royals will also visit Naples and Palermo. During their
stay, they will meet Italian leaders and attend a string of
cultural events.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The garment sector, the major
foreign exchange earner of Bangladesh, will never grow if it
continues to depend on the preferential treatment for export, The
Financial Express daily reported Tuesday, quoting a minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We must depend on high quality production," Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed said while addressing a seminar
on "Consequence of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade) Uruguay Round for the Textile and Garments Sector in
Bangladesh" held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will have to develop backward linkage industries for
the ready-made garments sector to retain its market after
elimination of preferential access to the world market in 2005, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The trade regime after the year 2005 will be an opportunity as
well as a challenge for Bangladesh's garment sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garment sector is the number one foreign
exchange earner of this South Asian country, and it grows at an
average annual rate of over 20 percent. Exports from ready-made
garments stood at 2.845 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 55.09
percent of the total export earnings of 5.16 billion dollars in
the previous fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Hopes Bonn to Keep Push for European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian leaders said Monday
that they hoped Germany would continue to be a driving power for
European integration and European Union (EU) expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram of congratulations to Gerhard Schroeder, leader
of the German Social Democratic Party (SDP), who toppled Helmut
Kohl in Sunday's election to become Germany's chancellor,
Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov said the election victory would
enable the SDP to strengthen Germany's role as a major factor in
world politics.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that your efforts will help Germany continue to be a
driving power of European integration, including EU expansion, and
that your support will enable NATO to activate its open-door
policies," Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The president also hoped that the victory would open up a new
stage in the traditionally good Bulgarian-German relations.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said, "The development of
relations with Germany are based on a very strong legal framework
and we expect them to progress further."
</P>
<P>
He said that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova
would visit Germany soon.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova said at a regular Council of Ministers' meeting on
Monday that she firmly believed that the relations between the two
countries would remain good and joint projects already agreed
would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Schroeder's statement on the eve of the elections provided
grounds to be optimistic that relations between Bulgaria and
Germany will remain good," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Vassil Gotsev said that Bulgaria would
maintain the same good relations with Germany led by Schroeder as
that it had with the Germany led by Kohl.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "I can say Germany realizes very well the
need for EU expansion, including Bulgaria, as well as the need for
this country to become a NATO member in view of security in the
Balkans."

<HEADLINE> Romania's Agricultural Output Falls This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania's grain output is
expected to amount to 14 million tons this year, a 6-7 percent
drop from the average of the past few years, due to floods and
drought.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister of Agriculture and Food
Industries Dinu Gavrilescu on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gavrilescu said fruit output would also decrease by 25 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
He added the number of cattle had fallen from 1997's 3.7
million to the 3.5 million, pigs from 9.2 million to 9 million and
sheep from 11.6 million to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the drop in animal husbandry to the
disbandment or bankruptcy of state-owned farms during their
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, Gavrilescu believed reduction of agricultural output
has not threatened the normal supply in Romania's domestic market
so far.

BUCHAREST, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi said Monday that further cooperation between Moldova and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would help stability
and security in Moldova and the whole region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Kishinev, capital of Moldova, after a
meeting with visiting NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
Madariaga, the president said that as an active member of NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program(PFP), Moldova would continue to work
to strengthen cooperation with NATO, according to Moldovan
state-run television.
</P>
<P>
The development of ties between Moldova and NATO would not
change the country's neutral status, Lucinschi stressed.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Solana said his visit aimed at fostering ties
between NATO and the former Soviet republic and expressed
satisfaction with their present cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He believed the development of ties would provide a possibility
for peaceful settlement of the regional confrontation and
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Solana also praised Moldova for its active role in
strengthening the pan-European security.
</P>
<P>
Moldova is the first stop of Solana's trip to the republics of
former Soviet Union. He will leave Kishinev on Tuesday for Georgia
and then Azerbaijan and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO launched its PFP program in 1994 to help
foster ties with its former Warsaw Pact adversaries and other
neutral countries.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was brought to
the Jalan Raja court complex here Tuesday morning after nine days
in police custody.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The statement said, the public prosecutor had decided to charge
Anwar in court on September 22.

However, as Anwar was detained under the Internal Security Act
on September 20, the public prosecutor deferred mention of the
case until the security situation returned to normal.

scrutinized all the latest statements gathered during police

The report was in connection with the book "50 Dalil Mengapa
Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM" (50 reasons why Anwar cannot become

"The Attorney-General's Chambers wish to state here that the
decision to charge Anwar is based only on evidence produced by the
police," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked from his cabinet posts on September 2,
was arrested by police under the Internal Security Act on
September 20 after calling an illegal assembly here which resulted

TIANJIN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s Caterpillar
recently started construction work on a branch in the Tianjin
Bonded Zone that is being built with two Japanese companies at a
cost of 47.65 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Duane Devore, a representative of the joint venture, says that
massive construction projects in China provide an opportunity for
foreign engineering machinery manufacturers and that this will be
Caterpillar's headquarters for North Asia.
</P>
<P>
The move will help them cut production costs and make
their products more competitive on the world market, he says,
explaining that Tianjin is an ideal place because its harbour
serves much of China and it is in the center of three
heavily-populated countries: China, Japan and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He says that the joint venture will put 26.49 million
U.S. dollars into a forging factory with a workshop and office
building with 43,000 sq.m. of floor space. Caterpillar is also
negotiating with the Chinese to build an engine plant.
</P>
<P>
Caterpillar has spent one billion yuan already on two
Sino-American joint ventures: an engineering machinery plant in
Jiangsu Province and a forging plant in Shanxi Province.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Tourism Expansion in Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwestern China has the
greatest potential for tourism development in China in the new
millennium, according to Sun Gang, deputy director of the China
National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern China refers to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou
provinces, the Tibet and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions, and
the city of Chongqing. It has 35 of the country's 120 major
state-level scenic sites.
</P>
<P>
The region has most of China's ethnic groups and diverse
architecture, unique folklore and local customs, and picturesque
mountains and landscapes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region had 2.42 million overseas tourists and
earned more than one billion U.S. dollars from tourism, up 19.3
and 40.5 percent over the previous year, respectively. Meanwhile
nearly 127 million domestic tourists visited, contributing 25.2
billion yuan in earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, it accounts for less than eight percent of China's
tourism, and a greater effort needs to be made to develop tourist
sector in the region, Sun told a recent tourism promotion
conference in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
An effort has been made to improve the tourist infrastructure,
airports, tourist hotels, and restaurants. And there are 170
domestic and overseas air routes connecting the region with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
At the conference attended by tourism authorities from the
provinces, lists of carefully selected tourist programs were
presented.

CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's four-time 500cc
motorcycle racing world champion Mick Doohan Tuesday said in

Agostini won 68 500cc races between 1965 and 1976, and won the
championship eight times between 1966 and 1975.

Monaco-based Doohan expects to remain living in Europe, rather
than returning home to Australia. "Everything's so familiar to me

world championship -- the Australian GP on October 4 and in

<HEADLINE> Lands To Be Returned to Dongting Lake in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A large part of Dongting
Lake in central China's Hunan Province has been turned into
farmland over the past few decades, but now the provincial
government plans to stop the practice and return the cultivated
land to the lake.
</P>
<P>
The consistent degeneration of wetlands as a result of
excessive reclamation has been widely regarded by local experts as
a major cause of this summer's devastating flooding along the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The lake covered 4,400 sq. km. in 1949, but in the following
decades it suffered a loss of more than one third of its area from
repeated enclosures of wetlands for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking of the lake's water storage capacity has caused
increasingly frequent floods, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has spent a total of four billion
yuan in constructing dikes around the lake in the past four
decades, but has reaped few benefits. This summer's flood caused a
loss of 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial program, Hunan will return a total of
1,260 sq.km. of farmland to Dongting Lake in the coming five
years, involving the relocation of some 1.2 million people, in a
bid to bring the lake back to its 1994 size.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the ambitious program remain unknown, but
China's central government has earmarked special fund estimated
at over 25 billion yuan for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Recently, local people have increased their calls for greater
care for the increasingly-worsening environment in the lake area,
due to decades of urbanization and industrialization.

<HEADLINE> Modernizing China's Golog Grasslands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Dawu, capital of the Golog
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in China's Qinghai Province has
taken on a new look with its wide roads, power grids, and
telephone lines in recent years.
</P>
<P>
No one ever thought that Dawu would have telephone booths along
its streets or electric appliances in the homes of the prefecture
on the 70,000-square-kilometers of grassland in what was one of
the province's most underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
But, in 1994, the local government spent 100 million yuan
(about 12 million U.S. dollars) on a 110-kv power grid that now
allows local people to use such conveniences as televisions,
refrigerators, and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
A 500-kilometer optical fiber cable was run from Xining,
Qinghai's capital, to Golog last June, at a cost of 30 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The head of the local telecommunications bureau said that 60
percent of Dawu's families now have telephones and that some
herdsmen even have pagers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The latest and largest construction project in the prefecture
is the 400-km Ningguo Highway, which shortens the distance from
Xining to Golog by some 300 km. and trucks have begun to bring in
fresh vegetables and rice from southern China and variety to local
markets, so that the once desolate grasslands are beginning to
prosper.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Italy Urge Belgrade to Comply with UN on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his Italian counterpart Beniamino Andreatta Monday
stressed the need to deal firmly with Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic on the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of the two in Rome, Cohen warned that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could use air strikes against
Serb targets if Milosevic failed to comply with the United Nations
resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence in the
Serbian province and the resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian,
has been torn by bloody conflict since earlier this year between
government forces and ethnic separatists fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of past experience, we know that Milosevic won't
be convinced by weak threats. We must therefore be strong, so
that he finally decides to pull his military forces out and allow
humanitarian aid into Kosovo," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to bring him to the negotiating table where we can
peacefully negotiate a resolution for this situation."
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that, with winter coming, some 50,000 people who
fled the violence to nearby mountains might die of hunger and cold.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta, for his part, said he and Cohen had spoken of "the
necessary military pressure which might be required" if Belgrade
failed to comply with the UN resolution.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Milosevic, even at the last minute, realizes how
isolated he is from the rest of the world, as well as NATO's
determination to use all means in defense of humanitarian aims,"
Andreatta said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Italian government would assess its
commitment to possible military action over the next few days.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Accelerate Marine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
recently worked out an ambitious plan which will turn the marine
industry into a pillar of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Shandong expects the marine industry to yield an added value of
180 billion yuan by the year 2010, equivalent to 10 percent to its
expected gross domestic product (GDP) in that year.
</P>
<P>
To meet this goal, the province will optimize its marine
structure and give priority to exploitation of offshore petroleum
and the development of marine pharmaceutical production, refined
chemicals, tourism and comprehensive utilization of seawater.
</P>
<P>
Bordering the Bohai and Yellow seas, Shandong has a
3,100-kilometer-long coastline, one-sixth of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The province began to tap marine resources in 1991 and since
then has led the country in sea aquaculture, chemical salt
production and offshore petroleum development.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's annual marine output value grew by 17 percent in
each of the past seven years and soared to 36.6 billion yuan last
year, accounting for 5.5 percent of the province's GDP.

<P>
SHENYANG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Haicheng, a prosperous
county in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has been urbanizing
by adding hotels, restaurants, gyms, and swimming pools in the
county seat.
</P>
<P>
It also has Xiliu Market, a popular garment marketplace that
did 15 billion yuan in business last year.
</P>
<P>
Haicheng County, which covers 2,700 sq. km. and has a
population of 1.08 million, was selected by China's Construction
Ministry out of 2,000-odd counties as a pilot in the urbanization
drive and 3.15 billion yuan has been spent on urban construction
since the early 1990s, improving infrastructure a great deal.
</P>
<P>
Tap water is now available in 50 percent of the county's rural
areas and 70 percent of the county's roads are hard surface.
</P>
<P>
Computerized telephone service is now available in 27 villages
and towns.
</P>
<P>
The county had a GDP of 16 billion yuan and 480 million yuan in
revenues last year. Per capita income of farmers was 3,641 yuan in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dalian is to the south, Anshan is to the north, the
Liaohe Oilfield to the west, and the coal-rich city of Fushun and
iron-rich city of Benxi to the east. It has abundant talcum and
magnesite reserves and produces fruits, vegetables, rice, and corn.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization development programs in Haicheng were listed as
Sino-Japanese technological cooperation projects at the 17th
annual Sino-Japanese government meeting in Tokyo in May of 1997. A
delegation representing the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency made a fact-finding tour to Haicheng in June.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai
announced at a recent conference on developing Huangpu Harbor area
that it will turn the harbor area in the downtown area into a
multi-purpose commercial center as part of the international
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The city will move all coal, chemical, and bulk cargo docks in
a 2-million-sq.m. area along the Huangpu River to a new port area
on the outskirts of Shanghai and use the site for a modern urban
commerce, tourist, and recreation center within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai port was built in 1843 and is now China's
largest. But, as it expanded into the outskirts in recent years,
wharfs in the urban began to decline in cargo handling and had a
negative effect on the urban environment.
</P>
<P>
The wharf relocating began last year and a coal dock halted
operations early this year, and the Dada Passenger Wharf has
already become a business street.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port Office and the Koos Real Estate Development Group
Regal (Overseas) Assets Ltd. recently set up a joint venture, the
Shanghai P &AMP; K Development Co., to manage the transformation
scheme and the U.S. Skidmore Owings &AMP; Merrill International
Ltd. is responsible for the overall design of the project.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves 1999 Defense Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress on Monday
approved a 1999 defense budget bill totalling 250.5 billion
U.S. dollars which would enable the Pentagon to finance its
anti-missile defenses and a pay raise for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, after a short debate, approved by a vote of 369
to 43 the defense measure. A 21.3-billion-dollar energy and water
bill for the new fiscal year was also passed by 389 to 25 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to approve both measures in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
The defense bill, which accounts for about 15 percent of total
federal spending next year, includes 70.6 billion dollars for
military personnel, 84 billion dollars for operations and
maintenance and 48.5 billion dollars for purchasing new weapons
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
It represents a 2.8-billion-dollar increase over the current
level, but President Bill Clinton and many lawmakers of both
parties say it is insufficient. They are working on a separate
bill that would include 1.9 billion dollars for U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia and one billion dollars for training and
intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
With the personnel spending hike, the services would give the
troops a 3.6 percent pay raise. More than 950 million dollars
will be spent on anti-missile defense research.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, about 500 million dollars will be used to
purchase seven C130 cargo planes and 45 million dollars to
construct a giant LHD-8 transport ship.
</P>
<P>
The energy and water bill includes 1.4 billion dollars for the
construction of more than 200 Army Corps of Engineers water
projects.
</P>
<P>
To balance the accounts, the bill allows for the trimming of
administration requests for the Energy Department's environmental
cleanups and research on solar and other forms of renewable
energy, as well as Tennessee Valley flood control, dam maintenance
and other programs.

<HEADLINE> Shortage Of Funds For Protecting China's Relics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Some ruins from the late
Shang Dynasty (1300-1050 B.C.) at the Yinxu site in the city of
Anyang in central China's Henan Province, where the earliest known
Chinese characters inscribed on animal bones were unearthed, face
many serious threats, but the major one is the shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Many valuable things like foundations of palaces and temples,
tombs, bronzes, jade carvings, and oracle bones have been
unearthed at the site since it was discovered in 1899. Although
the local government has spent nearly 10 million yuan (about 1.2
million U.S. dollars) protecting the Yinxu relics, there are still
problems.
</P>
<P>
An archaeologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
said that excavations at Yinxu over the past 70 years only account
for a third of Yinxu's total area, and there are still immense
quantities of relics buried.
</P>
<P>
Duan Zhenmei, director of the Anyang Yinxu Management Bureau,
said that local people have actually sacrificed a lot in
protecting Yinxu. While farmers in other places become affluent by
developing rural enterprises, farmers in the Yinxu protection zone
suffer from many restrictions on establishing enterprises and
their income is much lower than those outside the protection zone.
</P>
<P>
What is more, farmers have to apply to the relics management
bureau for a permit to build a house and have to pay fees.
</P>
<P>
There are 18 villages with thousands of people. To move these
people out of the protection zone would mean a big problem and at
least 200 million yuan (some 20 million US dollars) just to
relocate two villages, Duan explained.

CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organizers
Tuesday said that they are exploring some new ways of raising
cash for the 2000 Olympic Games, according to reports from
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Organizers want to sell companies the right to put their names
on warm-up events and Games venues in the pre-Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
president Michael Knight said that "We've never budgeted for
revenue coming in from the test events. We've just had this
fabulous test event on Sydney harbour and we never went to the
market place seeking any revenue to come in from that."
</P>
<P>
Knight noted that the test events are not conducted under
Olympic sponsorship rules.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Olympcis budget was revised to 1.475 billion U.S.
dollars. The cost of staging the Games has increased by 76
million U.S. dollars in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales State government has ordered the
organizing committee to put aside any savings in the next two
years to help pay for the swelling costs.

<P>
Local governments have come up with measures to protect the
state-level relics site since 1994, one of the which is the
"Protection Plan" setting the scope and site of the Yinxu area. It
also regulates construction work in the protection zone.
</P>
<P>
The Anyang city government has also passed the "Methods of Yinxu
Protection and Management", the first local regulation on
state-level relics sites in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Anyang city government spent 3 million yuan
on a Yinxu exhibition center on the ruins of ancient palaces,
which has attracted a large number of visitors, but the lack of
money prevents the center from becoming better.
</P>
<P>
And, it will take a lot more money to develop all the
underground ruins to attract more tourists, local government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
Duan said that his bureau has worked out many protection plans
but that they are worried that the plans may remain just plans and
not be put into practice. He said that the Anyang city government
plans to build a Yinxu museum, but the project has been halted
because of shortage of money. Only a storehouse that cost four
million yuan has been built.
</P>
<P>
The city government also wants to rebuild 12 imperial tombs and
over 1,000 sacrificial pits in the Yinxu area and turn it into a
tomb museum, but they need 20 million yuan and can think of no way
to raise the money.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Seeks Overseas Investment for Pollution Control Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
economic powerhouse, seeks overseas investment for a number of
pollution control projects over the next three years, according to
official sources here.
</P>
<P>
The projects, involving a total investment of more than 400
million U.S. dollars, include pollution control, comprehensive use
of resources, production of environment monitoring instruments,
and energy-saving lamps.
</P>
<P>
The projects constitute part of a municipal plan to readjust
the city's economic structure by developing environment-friendly
industries, said a municipal economic commission official.
</P>
<P>
Some of the funds and key production lines will be imported
from abroad, sources said.
</P>
<P>
An iron-smelting project, which will cost 370 million
U.S. dollars to build, is designed to turn out 800,000 tons of
molten iron annually with advanced waste treatment facilities. It
will help prevent the Pudong Iron and Steel Complex from
discharging pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Another is a fluorescent lamp project which will cost 24
million U.S. dollars in overseas funds to import a production line
and auxiliary equipment to produce 12 million T5 fluorescent lamps
annually.
</P>
<P>
The economic commission will announce more pollution control
projects for overseas investment and cooperation in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Chairman of CONI Resigns over Anti-doping Test Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Mario Pescante, chairman of
Italy's national Olympic Committee (CONI), resigned today
following a scandal over apparently fraudulent anti-doping tests
at the organization's main laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Pescante, who announced his departure as he emerged from a
meeting with CONI's two deputy chairmen, said the decision had
been a collegiate one and was intended to "restore serenity to
the scene."
</P>
<P>
There have been calls from Pescante's resignation ever since
he admitted on September 5 that CONI's anti-doping unit in
Acquacetosa, near Rome, had used extremely hit-and-miss methods
in testing soccer players' urine samples.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors in Turin, samples at the Acquacetosa
lab were tested for anabolic steroids only in 20 percent of
cases, for diuretics in only 5-10 percent of cases and never
tested for two illegal growth-enhancing hormones.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the lab issued complete results and last year
was paid four billion lire by CONI for doing so.
</P>
<P>
Pescante's admission came less than two weeks after CONI's
anti-doping panel closed a 14-day investigation with the
announcement that Italian soccer was free from doping.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, on September 18, the CONI chief said that he
has forced to admit that the results of anti-doping tests run on
soccer players appeared to be missing from laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Pescante has denied knowing about the haphazard testing
procedures, but admitted to being formally responsible.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to leave the stage on an Olympic
victory chariot, pulled by white horses," Pescante said. "But the
important thing is to have a past that one can look back on with
dignity."
</P>
<P>
He denied that he was abandoning his post because he was
afraid of what would emerge from the commission of enquiry which
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni ordered to
investigate the scandal earlier this month. The commission will
report on its findings by mid-October.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not resigning because I think I'm guilty of anything,"
Pescante stressed. "I prefer to see it in a positive light and
say I'm doing it to restore calm."
</P>
<P>
Pescante, 60, who won national honors in middle-distance
running as a schoolboy, had been CONI's chairman since June 30,
1993. He was reelected in July 1997 and was to have remained in
the job until after the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last year he failed to achieve a key ambition when Rome's bid
to host the 2004 Olympic Games was beaten by a stronger challenge
from Athens. Before becoming CONI chairman, Pescante spent 20
years as CONI secretary general. He headed the Italian team at
five summer Olympics and five winter ones.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Open Sky Policy Limited to Charter Flights: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
recent decision to allow international airlines to fly from their
home bases to all major destinations in the country is being
limited to chartered flights and will not apply to scheduled
services.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Giri Suseno Hadihardjono told
reporters here Monday that foreign airlines must also obtain
permits from the local authorities before flying passengers from
their home base to destinations in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign airlines must notify the authorities of their
flight plans from their home base, be it the United States, Europe
or other international points, and they must return straight to
their original embarkation point," Giri was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said prior permits or notification were necessary to settle
technical matters because many of the country's airports were not
suitable for big carriers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three airports in Indonesia are capable of handling
international flights but only about 14 of them currently serve
foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
"If other airports are to receive foreign carriers, they must
improve their air navigational facilities and prepare customs,
immigration, and quarantine services," he said.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie said last week the government would
allow foreign airlines to carry foreign tourists directly to all
domestic destinations in an effort to boost the country's battered
tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The government's current limited open-sky policy only allows
certain aircraft to enter areas outside the capital Jakarta.
Several foreign carriers have complained about not being allowed
to fly directly to popular destinations such as Bali.
</P>
<P>
However, Giri indicated that the government had no immediate
plan to adopt a full open-sky policy, saying there were many
aspects to study before implementing such a move.
</P>
<P>
"We will look into the positive and negative aspects of such a
policy on our airline industry, and once we are ready, we will go
toward that direction," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Becoming Less Dependent On Wheat Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will become less
dependent on the international market for high-quality wheat over
the next few years when a new wheat strain begins to be widely
used, Chinese wheat experts said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The new No. 906 wheat gives high yield, high quality, and is
resistant to common wheat diseases and drought.
</P>
<P>
The strain was developed by Shen Tianmin, a wheat breeding
expert in Henan Province after 18 years of research.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests show major indicators like protein and gluten
content and water absorption equal to national high-quality wheat
standards.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in Henan Province, a major wheat producer in the
country, resulted in a per-hectare yield of from 7,500 kg to 9,000
kg, which is 2,700 to 4,200 kg higher than ordinary strains.
</P>
<P>
Fan Lian, a wheat specialist, said that China imports 2.6
billion U.S. dollars worth of high-quality wheat every year and
had tried every possible means to halt its large wheat imports but
failed to find a high quality strain that also gives high yield.
</P>
<P>
Fan expects No. 906 to be widely used in China soon.

CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The coalition has nosed ahead of Labor leading into the
vital last week of an extremely tight campaign, but still cannot
be certain of winning the election. While Labor has lost its lead
on primary votes, it has retained an election-winning lead on the
two-party-preferred vote.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor has moved to exploit the possibility of a narrow
coalition win in Saturday's poll, raising the specter of a more
powerful National Party using its numbers to force a retreat on
key policies such as tax and Telatra-sell.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Victorians were warned Monday to expect another two weeks
without gas, and at least six months of restrictions, as technical
experts from around the world were flown in to help revive the
crippled gas processing site at Longford.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard stepped into the Victorian gas
crisis Monday night promising financial assistance to the 100,000
workers likely to be laid off in the next week, as industrial
shutdowns spread to other states.

<P>
HARBIN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed techniques to raise potatoes without soil to improve
production and quality greatly.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Agriculture Academy of Sciences in
Heilongjiang Province, northeast China, developed the technique to
protect potatoes from contagious diseases that reduce production
sharply.
</P>
<P>
After cultivating potato buds in tubes, they put them in rock
and sawdust, and water them with nutrients. They later had
progress in putting the buds in a greenhouse where the buds grow
rapidly in the sealed environment, with weights that are five
times that of potatoes cultivated with the common technique.

<HEADLINE> Foreman and Holmes to Fight in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- George Foreman and Larry
Holmes, both grandfathers near 50 years old, announced Monday in
Houston that they will have a fight on January 23.
</P>
<P>
The two heavyweight champions of last year are both Americans.
Foreman, fighting in his hometown, will celebrate his 50 years
birthday on January 10, while Holmes turns 49 on November 3.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the doctors check a fighter's heart, but with Larry
and me, they're just going to see if we have a pulse," Foreman
said.
</P>
<P>
Holmes, (66-6) expects a better fight this time. "This will be
a classic, it's history," he said. "It's two men who over the
decades, never fought. Two men with lots of pride. Two men will
give it all and only one will win. I'm sure that it will be me
and George thinks it will be him."
</P>
<P>
Foreman (76-5) made a comeback from retirement in 1987, and
became the WBA champion in 1994 with a 10th-round knockout of
Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
Foreman was champion in 1973-74 before he lost his title to
Muhammad Ali on October 30, 1974. Holmes' championship career
lasted from 1978-1985.
</P>
<P>
"Larry Holmes was a second-rate fighter sparring for Ali when
I had my original career," Foreman said. "This is the only time
this fight could be made. This is the only time it is important.
It's going to be a good fight, a mental matchup."
</P>
<P>
Foreman reportedly will win 10 million U.S. dollars while
Holmes take four million.
</P>
<P>
The combined age of the fighters at 99 is the highest in
boxing history.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we're 900 years old," Holmes said. "You got
two old guys almost the same age that are going to fight. We
might not fight like young guys today, but are going to fight."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Septembe 28 (Xinhua) -- Pil Ozersky caught Mark
McGwire's 70th home-run ball on Sunday, but the 26-year-old
American baseball fan said he is not sure what he'll do with it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, because I didn't expect to get this ball," he
said. "Right now I'm excited to see Mr. McGwire and shake his
hand, and that's about as far as I'm looking ahead."
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit his 70th homer to set a fabulous record in his
closing match of the season yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Baseball memorabillia collectors have said they would pay as
much as one million U.S. dollars for the final home-run ball in
McGwire's record run.
</P>
<P>
Ozerskey was in a party room at Busch Stadium with a group of
Washington University research lab scientists and knew he was
lucky to have the ball after diving to come up with the prize.
</P>
<P>
He had a black eye, but he didn't say whether it came from a
struggle for the seventh-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Woodson, a body-shop worker, caught No. 69 in the third
inning yesterday. He was hoping against hope it would be the last
one, hence the most valuable ball.
</P>
<P>
Woodson doesn't know what he's going to do with his ball
either, but when McGwire hit No. 70, he said, "Well, it takes the
pressure off me to decide what to do with the ball."

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Semiconductor Market to Grow: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide
semiconductor market will grow almost 12 percent in 1999,
following a 6 percent decline this year, according to a study
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its study, Dataquest, a California-based leader in the
market intelligence industry, picked out dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) because of the strong effect of its market
volatility. The company made forecasts of the semiconductor market
with and without DRAM.
</P>
<P>
With DRAM, worldwide semiconductor revenue will reach 155
billion U.S. dollars in 1999. Excluding DRAM, the revenue is
expected to reach 124 billion dollars in the same year, up 9.7
percent over the 1998 revenue.
</P>
<P>
Although the microprocessor market should rebound in some
regions during the fourth quarter this year, Dataquest said, the
global impact of weak Asian economies means key semiconductor
markets will likely not strengthen until the middle of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor market will continue to confront oversupply,
Dataquest said. The foundry oversupply will persist for the next
18 months, while the DRAM oversupply will last until mid- or late
2000, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the only region Dataquest projected to maintain
positive growth in 1998. The region's semiconductor market is

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
of the United Nations Monday met on an Arab-sponsored draft
resolution which demanded an immediate U.N. probe into the U.S.
bombing on Sudan's pharmaceutical factory last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the council ended its meeting, the
council's President Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said he had received a
letter from Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubrak, the current head of
the informal group of Arab states, known as the Arab Group, with a
copy of the draft resolution in it.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of today's meeting is that consultations will
continue among members," Dahlgren said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accused the El Shifa factory of being
linked with terrorists and producing chemical weapons. But Sudan
says that the factory only produces medicines and veterinary
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. accuses
immediately after the August 20 attack.

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries Need World Attention: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday appealed to the international community for more
assistance to 48 least developed countries (LDCs) in their efforts
to improve their conditions.
</P>
<P>
"There are three areas in which such help would be particularly
useful: official development assistance (ODA), debt burdens and
market access," he told the annual ministerial meeting of LDCs
held here in the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he will continue to be "a strenuous advocate" for
reversing the decline of ODA.
</P>
<P>
Turning to trade problems, he said LDCs face high tariffs in
key sectors such as textiles and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Most of the LDCs, with a combined population of close to 600
million, are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Despite positive growth in their per capita income in the
second half of this decade, the current financial turmoil in
different parts of the world could wipe out the gains made by them
in recent years, Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on U.N. to Back Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Monday called on the U.N. General Assembly to
support the establishment of a Palestinian state as a five-year
transitional period ends on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of reaffirming his intention to make a
unilateral declaration of an independent Palestine statehood if a
final peace accord with Israel is not competed by that date.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to call upon all of you, from this place, the
source of international legitimacy and peacekeeping, the guardian
of freedom, security and stability, and the source for the
achievement of justice and prosperity for humankind, to stand by
our people, especially as the five-year transitional period
provided for in the Palestinian-Israeli agreements will end on May
4, 1999 and our people demand of us to shoulder our responsibility
and they await the establishment of their independent state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This independent Palestinian state must be established as an
embodiment of their independent people to self-determination," he
said. "I assure you that our people will continue to pursue and
protect the peace of the braves in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Arafat delivered the speech after returning from Washington,
where he held a last-minute summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had previously said that he would use the General
Assembly speech to restate his intention of unilaterally declaring
an independent Palestinian state next year -- even if there is no
final peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Arafat has made some concessions, but
the speech he gave Monday appeared to conform with his original
intention.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as has
always been the case in the decisive moments of the history, the
present and the future of our people," Arafat said. "Help us to
achieve the national goal of our people."
</P>
<P>
Arafat was received with prolonged applause as he was escorted
into the assembly hall by the U.N. chief of protocol. He waved his
right hand and bowed in acknowledgement. U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan sat on the podium when the Palestinian leader was
delivering his speech.
</P>
<P>
It was Arafat's fourth appearance before the assembly since
1974, including a session in Geneva in 1988 when he was denied a
visa to come to New York.
</P>
<P>
However, this was the first time a Palestinian representative
took part in the general debate of the General Assembly -- one of
the fruits of an assembly decision in July to upgrade the status
of the Palestinian U.N. mission, which has U.N. observer status
but is not a full-fledged U.N. member.
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted the occasion in his opening statement, thanking
the assembly for giving the Palestinians the enhanced status
"which we consider to be an essential step towards full
membership."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader was expected to address the morning
session, but his appearance was postponed to allow him to travel
to Washington to meet with Clinton and Netanyahu.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- It was legal and
logical for the Security Council of the United Nations to ask Iraq
to cooperate first, Council President said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hans Dahlgren was responding to the remarks made by Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz. Aziz said Monday afternoon that
the U.N. Security Council should make the first move towards
ending the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is both legal and logical to ask Iraq to
cooperate first and then to take the comprehensive review,"
Dahlgren said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested that the Security
Council have more direct engagement with Iraq and conduct a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. relevant
resolutions after Iraq reverses its policy of suspending its
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>

Aziz, who arrive here over the weekend at the invitation of the
U.N. chief, met with Annan Monday morning. He is due to meet with

<HEADLINE> Leftist Party Leaders Face Arrest in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The chief prosecutor at the
Ankara State Security Court demanded Monday that Chairman of the
leftist Workers' Party (IP) Dogu Perincek and eight of his
colleagues be arrested.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that the
prosecutor, whose name was not disclosed, accused Perincek and his
party members of being involved in separatist activities launched
by the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Perincek, IP General Secretary Mehmet Bedri Gultekin and
several other members of the party have been detained by the
police because of the alleged links with the PKK which has been
fighting since 1984 for an independent state in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Perincek has reportedly begun a hunger strike to protest the
detention.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said the police uncovered three unlicensed guns in
IP's office building in the capital. But Perincek said that he
knew nothing about the guns.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of IP members from across the country staged a
demonstration Monday in Ankara to protest the detention of their
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
IP Deputy Chairman Hasan Yalcin read out a statement during the
demonstration, saying that "no one could ban us from politics."

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Mayor Pleads Lenient Penalty for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A former Rwandan mayor
in connection with the 1994 genocide pleaded Monday with judges
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to hand
down a less severe penalty on him.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations court, based in Arusha, north Tanzania,
will on October 2 sentence Jean-Paul Akayesu, former mayor of
Taba in central Rwanda, after finding him guilty of genocide and
crimes against humanity early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to a ICTR statement faxed to Xinhua, Akayesu said
during his pre-sentence hearing at the court that it was
difficult for him to prevent the killings because he was
powerless at that time.
</P>
<P>
"I was a mere bourgmestre (mayor) with only eight police
officers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking for pardon... I regret what happened in Rwanda."
he said. "I also lost my relatives, my friends and many others,"
he told a panel of three judges -- the president of the court,
Laity Kama of Senegal, Lennart Aspegren of Sweden and Navanethem
Pillay of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I cry for all these people and God please forgive me. I place
my fate in your hands. Honorable judges, and before God. I am
innocent in this case," he pleaded for mercy.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were brutally massacred in just three months in the middle of
1994 in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council set up the ICTR in November of that
year to try chief suspects of the genocide. The maximum sentence
the court can impose is life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution Trial Attorney Pierre Prosper requested the
Chamber 1 of the court to impose a sentence which is retributive
and deterrent because of the gravity of the offence committed by
Akayesu.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor asked the chamber to impose multiple sentences
of life imprisonment on the accused for count one of genocide,
count three of crimes against humanity (extermination), count
four, direct and public incitement to commit genocide
(incitement), and count 13 of crimes against humanity (rape).
</P>
<P>
He also asked for multiple sentencing to life imprisonment of
a minimum of 30 years for counts five, seven and nine of crimes
against humanity (murder), a minimum of 25 years in prison for
count 11 of crimes against humanity (torture) and 10 years
imprisonment for count 14, crimes against humanity (inhumane
acts).
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor argued that, in determining the sentence, the
chamber should take into account the general practice in Rwanda
regarding prison sentences, the gravity of the offence, and the
individual circumstances of the convicted person, any
circumstances in aggravation and/or mitigation and consider other
sources in arriving at the sentence.
</P>
<P>
The United States ambassador to Tanzania, Rev. Charles Stith,
visited the tribunal and attended the pre-sentencing hearing in
the case.

<HEADLINE> SADC Troops to Stay in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Southern African troops
would remain in Lesotho until order is restored in the country,
the defense ministers of Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana said
in Maseru, capital of Lesotho, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries are guarantors of peace in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The ministers maintained that the military intervention in
Lesotho last week by troops from South Africa and Botswana was in
line with Southern African Development Community (SADC)
agreements that no legitimate government in a member country
should be toppled by the military, said South African Press
Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
South African and Lesotho opposition parties have called for
the withdrawal of SADC troops as a first step toward talks to
resolve Lesotho's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The troops entered Lesotho last Tuesday in response to a
request by the Lesotho government, who said it feared an imminent
coup from mutinous soldiers and opposition parties. Claims by
Lesotho's political opposition that the country's general
elections in May were rigged to return the ruling party to power
triggered protests in the country.
</P>
<P>
The intervention sparked fierce fighting between rebel
soldiers and SADC troops, and arson and looting which destroyed
much of Maseru business center.
</P>
<P>
Although approximately 100 people are thought to have been
killed in the SADC intervention, confusion still surrounded the
official death toll Monday evening, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho police said Monday afternoon that 47 civilians were
killed and 15 injured in the fighting. Red Cross officials
claimed over the weekend that they had collected 68 bodies in
various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
By Monday evening, neither the Lesotho government nor the Red
Cross could confirm the official death toll and it was rumored
that families had already collected the remains of their loved
ones and buried them.
</P>
<P>
The SADC force said 58 Lesotho and eight South African
soldiers died in skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise Monday warned
remaining rebel Lesotho soldiers hiding in the mountains that
they would be hunted down and dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts are being made to get the Lesotho
government and opposition parties to the negotiating table as the
South African government continued to justify the intervention in
the face of widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho King Letsie III is to meet South African President
Nelson Mandela in Cape Town Tuesday. Mandela requested the
meeting to share ideas with the king about developments in the
kingdom, and particularly to give fresh impetus to normalizing
the situation, and to political negotiations for a lasting
solution.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties indicated that they were willing to
negotiate with the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Sends Reinforcements to Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More volunteers from
universities, and more tanks have been sent to Sudan's southern
province of Equatoria to take part in the "final battle" against
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Hassan, spokesman of the National Service in charge of
enlistment, said Monday the 5,000-strong reinforcements have set
out for the battlefields to fight alongside the army in an all-out
offensive on the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and its
allied Ugandan forces.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said the classes at Sudanese universities have been
suspended for a month to enable the students to take part in the
fightings.
</P>
<P>
Fightings surged up two weeks ago in southern Sudan,
particularly in Equatoria province, between government forces and
the SPLA which has been seeking greater autonomy for the south's
Christians from north Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese army claimed Friday that 400 rebels and 50 Ugandan
troops have been killed in fightings over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
President Omar el-Bashir has also said that "this is the final
battle. They (the SPLA and the Ugandans) have brought the best
they have to this battlefield. They wanted it to be the final, and
they will have it."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan said that some 7,000 new recruits from
government apparatus are prepared to go to the front lines.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdul-Rahman
Serrel-Khatm expected more fierce battles in the Equatoria
province the coming few days as the SPLA has called in troops from
other province.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese government has urged all those who are able to carry
weapons to join the battles.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the
Philippines, hit by the Asian financial crisis, called Monday for
the reform of the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual U.N. General Assembly debate, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said, "significant changes should
be made to the international financial architecture."
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the international financial markets lack
transparency, he called for rules governing the currency
transactions.
</P>
<P>
"In today's financial system, more than 1.2 trillion U.S.
dollars of currency is bought and sold every 24 hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no system of surveillance, no open reporting of any
kind and no WTO (World Trade Organization) kind of regulating
authority for this most lucrative trade in the coveted commodity,
that is money itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries should be given the time to
strengthen their economies, enabling them to participate
meaningfully in global free trade.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon told the General
Assembly that the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly the
International Monetary Fund, are insufficient in containing the
Asian financial crisis and restoring the health of affected
economies.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries should contribute to the replenishment
of IMF resources, to lend support for increasing the funds of the
World Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Asian financial crisis as his country's
immediate global concern, the minister urged rich nations to
remove export barriers for goods from the developing countries and
give more development aid to bring South Asian economies back to
normal.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Pledges Full Cooperation With U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would cooperate
fully With the U.N. chief in good faith as well as in a
professional and objective manner in solving the recent standoff
between the United Nations and Iraq, Tareq Aziz, Iraq's deputy
prime minister, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tareq made the remark after holding a one-hour meeting with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Aziz and Annan discussed the
recent standoff between Iraq and the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction (UNSCOM) as well as Annan's ideas for a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions which demand
Iraq scrape all its prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Aziz said, "The comprehensive review is
not a reward to Iraq. The idea that Iraq should do this or that
concession before the comprehensive review takes place is not
legal and is not logical."
</P>
<P>
"The review is a moral and legal action by the U.N. Security
Council itself in accordance with its own resolution 687. That
resolution requires it implement the obligation in every 60
days," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has complied with resolutions of the Security Council for
seven years and a half, and the Security Council has not taken
steps to reduce or lift the sanctions against Iraq according to
its own resolution," Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister described his meeting with Annan as
cordial and constructive.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived at the Headquarters of the United Nations over the
weekend. He will stay here for a couple of days during which he is
due to meet members of the Security Council and to meet the U.N.
chief once again by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the United Nations came when Iraq
announced suspension of its cooperation with the U.N. weapons
inspectors after talks collapsed between Iraq and the UNSCOM in
early August.
