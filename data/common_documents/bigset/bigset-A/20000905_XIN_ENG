<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Lithuanian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REYKJAVIK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top
legislator Li Peng held talks here Monday with Lithuanian
President Valdas Adamkus on bilateral relations, international and
regional situation and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus said he was pleased to make a stop in Iceland to meet
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, on his way to New York for the
upcoming U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
China, as a big country, pays great importance and respect to
small states like Lithuania, which clearly reflects China's
consistent principle of equally treating all countries and has
gained his own and his people's appreciation, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the good basis of Sino-Lithuanian relations and a
series of bilateral agreements, Adamkus hoped the two sides could
expand their cooperation in politics, economy, culture and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
 Talking about international situation, Li said peace and
development remain the two main themes of the times.
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the end of the
Cold War, the world is not tranquil and regional conflicts break
out from time to time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic development of all countries is not balanced, with
disparity between the poor and the rich widening, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political multipolarization and economic globalization continue
to develop, he noted, adding that some basic principles should be
stressed during this process, such as treating all countries as
equals irrespective of their sizes, wealth and strength, respect
for sovereignty of all countries and their rights to choose
independently their road of development in accordance with their
own reality.
</P>
<P>
It is under these principles that China recognized three Baltic
countries, developed diplomatic relations with them quickly and
committed itself to developing friendly cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>
 Li stressed that China will adhere to the peaceful foreign
policy of independence and self-determination, wishing to develop
friendship with all countries in the world. Differences in
ideology and social systems could not obstruct developing friendly
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China has no fundamental interest conflict with Lithuania, Li
said, adding that maintaining and developing friendly relationship
between China and Lithuania coincides with the common interests of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li also said China and the three Baltic countries should
consolidate and expand the achievements that leaders of the three
countries have made through visits to China, continue enlarging
cooperation in all fields, and deepen friendship between the
peoples of China and Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said he understands and respects the efforts the Baltic
countries have made to join the European Union. He also praised
Lithuania for its one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus said he agreed with Li Peng's comprehensive
elaboration of the principles of international relations, and
expressed his gratitude to China for its respect of the
sovereignty of the three Baltic countries and its friendship to
the three peoples.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Lithuania and China would further their cooperation in
economic and other fields and cooperate more closely in
international arenas such as the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hariri Makes Comeback Amid Deteriorated Economy by Huang Ling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's second and last round
of parliamentary elections Sunday consolidated ex-premier Rafik
Hariri triumphing victory and augmented his chances to be re-named
as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Official results showed that the camp of Hariri, who served as
prime minister from 1992 to 1998, seized 18 of the 19 seats in
pivotal Beirut constituency in the third parliamentary elections
since the devastating 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese sitting Prime Minister Salim Hoss conceded defeat
Sunday morning. It is the first time in post-independence Lebanon
since 1943 that a reigning prime minister was ousted from the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's camp has made striking gains in the first round on
August 27, with 41 of the 63 newly elected lawmakers being outright
supporters or sympathizers of Hariri. His allies, Druze chief Walid
Jumblat, Maronite Christian politicians Nassib Lahoud and Sleiman
Frangieh were among the opposition winners. 
</P>
<P>
Hariri therefore can secure 92 seats in the 128-member assembly,
well above the required 86 for premiership.
</P>
<P>
Under constitution, President Emile Lahoud, who sacked Hariri in
1998 and had appeared determined to block the construction tycoon's
comeback, must consult parliament on the choice of a prime minister
and he promised Sunday to observe the constitutional procedure.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said the swift comeback of Hariri, who resigned after
few weeks of bickering with the Maronite president and amid
accusations of plunging the country into huge foreign debts,
reflect Lebanese discontent with the stagnant economy, soaring
unemployment and the government's incompetence in coping with the
snafus.
</P>
<P>
Hoss took over in 1998 on a platform of administrative and
economic reforms to control the 21 billion public debts left behind
by Hariri's massive postwar reconstruction program and reactivate
the economy by boosting tourism and attracting foreign investments,
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon economy registered a mere 0.5 percent growth last year
and a further slide since the outset of this year. Unemployment
rate remains at more than 30 percent and every year tens of
thousand of youths seek jobs abroad. The huge budget deficit, which
contributed to Hariri's stepdown, has widened further in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed Lebanese turned once more to Hariri, hoping he can
remedy the crisis. The construction magnate has promised to
stimulate growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
As Safir newspaper said the voters' sympathy for the ex-premier
when President Lahoud set out on lambasting Hariri's six-year reign
and prosecuting his senior aides still lingered.
</P>
<P>
The people "translated that sympathy into an overwhelming
declaration of allegiance to Hariri as the leader of Beirut in the
polls," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Political money also played a big role in the election. It was
reported that Hariri, a billionaire who accumulated his fortunes of
about 4 billion dollars through construction projects in Saudi
Arabia, has earmarked about 50 million dollars for the election.
</P>
<P>
A voter, who declined to be identified, said Sunday morning
outside a polling station near State Stadium that a vote for each
candidate in Hariri's list can be paid 200 dollars, the highest
among the contesting blocs.
</P>
<P>
The tacit consent of Syria, the power broker in Lebanon and
stationing 35,000 troops across the country, also clear the way for
Hariri's comeback. Hariri's return poses no threat to Syria's grip
on Lebanese politics as he and Lahoud, like all major Lebanese
politicians, are solidly in Damascus's camp, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri himself has long cultivated ties with Damascus. It is
reported that Hariri has helped set up a holding company in Saudi
Arabia that is keen to invest in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The power in postwar Lebanon is equally divided on sectarian
line, with the president coming from Maronite Christians, the
speaker from Shi'ite Muslims and the prime minister from Sunni
Muslims. So is the case in Lebanese parliament and the 128 seats
are divided in equal parts between Muslims and Christians and the
shares are further sub-divided among the 18 recognized religious
sects.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Faces Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) needs 20 billion Tanzanian
shillings (about 25 million U.S. dollars) to purchase gas for its
thermal power plant to run at full capacity in the next four
months to avert power rationing due to shortage of rains, a senior
government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund was imperative for the company to meet the power
demand during this period and preserve the decreasing water in the
dams of the hydropower plants, added the official, who declined to
be named.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, TANESCO can not afford to make such an
investment because it has been experiencing financial problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the government has taken measures to
cut the 33 billion shillings (about 41.3 million U.S. dollars)
power bills defaulted by government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the one-year tax exemption granted to TANESCO by the
Ministry of Finance from June this year will save the company
billions of shillings.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, about 26 percent of electricity
generated by the company was from thermal plants and the rest from
hydropower plants.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 95 percent of the electricity consumed in
Tanzania is produced by TANESCO, which is also responsible for the
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Parachuters to West Africa While Hostage Negotiations Going on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has sent Parachuters to
West Africa as a "precautionary measure", while negotiations
continue to free six British soldiers being held hostages.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) reported on Tuesday
that more than 100 parachuters have been sent to Dakar in Senegal,
near Sierra Leone, where the British soldiers were captured by a
faction of the rebels 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The BBC quoted a Ministry of Defense source in London as
stressing that the move was a contingency and said negotiations
with leaders of the notorious West Side Boys remained the priority.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of talks have been held with the rebels, called
the West Side Boys, over the past three days and on Monday the
British military mission in Sierra Leone said negotiations were
progressing well.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys, estimated to have a few hundred members,
are an offshoot of forces loyal to the junta that ruled from May
1997 to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, many members are common criminals freed from prison
when the militia took part in the rebel invasion of Freetown in
January 1999, according to the BBC.
</P>
<P>
The group split from the rebel Revolutionary United Front a
year ago and declared allegiance to the government. But after
repeated clashes with government troops, it is now considered a
renegade militia.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the rebels placed demands including the release of
supporters and family, recognition by the Sierra Leone government
and the establishment of an interim government. The Sierra Leone
Government has rejected their demands.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Submarine Emergency Drill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of last month's
deadly Russian submarine incident in the Barents sea, NATO forces
from Italy, the U.S. and Turkey will launch joint exercises off
the Turkish coast to test their abilities to react to a submarine
emergency, NATO sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several other nations will send observers to the
Gulf of Mersin to watch the exercises, dubbed "Royal Sorbet 2000",
Italian news agency Ansa quoted NATO sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drill scenario calls for NATO units to provide emergency
help to a submarine trapped at the bottom of the sea, rescuing the
crew and assisting them once they reach the surface.
</P>
<P>
Italy will participate with a surface emergency unit, the Anteo,
and with a Sauro-class submergible craft, Prini.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will also have a submarine and an emergency assistance
ship, while Turkey will provide the lion's share of equipment:
three submarines, a frigate, three emergency-response units, as
well as Coast Guard boats, helicopters and planes.
</P>
<P>
Observers from Sweden, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Singapore,
Israel, India and Egypt are expected to be present.
</P>
<P>
The August 18 incident involving the Russian submarine Kursk
left 118 sailors dead and triggered an international firestorm of
controversy over delays in rescue attempts and the Russian
government's often conflicting accounts of what caused the nuclear
submarine to explode.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Use Dollar as Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's official currency,
the sucre, will cease to exist on Saturday to give way to the
American dollar as the country has entered a dollarization process
of its economy since January 9.
</P>
<P>
Starting from September 9, sucres in bills and coins will
become invalid and cease to circulate and Ecuadorians will have to
use the American dollar bills, a government decree said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of sucres for dollars will be done till September
9 at all private banks. From this date till March 6, 2001,
Ecuadorians will exchange their sucres only at the central bank
windows. If this period is exceeded, sucres will lose all value.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial surveys, 76 percent of the Ecuadorian
population is unhappy with the disappearance of the sucre. And in
rural areas, many peasants do not know about dollarization or how
to use the American dollar.

<HEADLINE> 21 Egyptian Muslims Given Jail Terms for Role in Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one Egyptian Muslims were
sentenced Tuesday to prison terms of up to 10 years for involvement
in the country's worst violence between Muslims and Christians in
decades.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were found guilty of rioting, looting and setting
fire to shops in the southern town of Dar el-Salam on January 2
after violence spread there from neighboring Kosheh, where 20
Coptic Christians and a Muslim were killed, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported. The other 18 accused men in the case were
cleared.
</P>
<P>
Four were given in absentia 10 years imprisonment with hard
labor, four two years, 12 one year and the 21th six months. In
Egypt, the defendants tried in absentia usually receive harsher
sentences than those appear in court.
</P>
<P>
The accused murderers and rioters in the Kosheh case are due to
stand trial in October at the same criminal court in Sohag, 500
kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out in Kosheh on December 31, last year, sparked
by a financial quarrel between a Muslim and a Coptic merchant over
a piece of cloth.
</P>
<P>
Kosheh is one of many towns and villages in southern Egypt that
have large proportions of Copts, who account for around 6 percent
of Egypt's population of 65 million.

<HEADLINE> Delay in Statehood Declaration Possible: PNC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 5 ( Xinhua ) -- Delay in Palestinian statehood
declaration is "on the cards" if it can serve the purpose of
restoring the occupied Palestinian territories, Palestinian
National Council (PNC) Chairman Salem Zanoun said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The postponement is possible should it aim to restore some
parts of our occupied lands or lead to a fresh meeting as promised
by United States President Bill Clinton," said Zanoun in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Farouk al Kadoumy, director of the political department of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said at a press conference
in Cairo on Monday that he did not think a Palestinian state would
be declared on September 13 as long as negotiations were still on.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian government can delay the declaration of its
statehood once more as long as there are convincing reasons," added
Zanoun. He also expressed hope that this postponement would not
harm the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official also said the meeting of the Palestine
Central Council of the PLO on September 9-10 would be very
important and serious as threats posed to the Palestinian
delegation during the failed Camp David summit would be probed.
</P>
<P>
The two-week summit in July between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Clinton failed to
produce an agreement over key final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Invitations were extended to all Palestinian factions, including
the radical opposition Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
Islamic Jihad, which are opposed to the Palestinian authority's
peace talks with Israel, to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting held in Gaza on July 1, the central council
decided to declare an independent Palestinian statehood on
September 13, when the interim phase expires.
</P>
<P>
However, after the failure of the Camp David summit, Israel and
the U.S. have repeatedly cautioned the Palestinians against a
unilateral declaration of statehood.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Emir Offers Condolences for Egyptian Victims in Gulf Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Isa al-Khalifa on Tuesday offered his "heart-felt condolences" over
the death of Egyptian nationals in the Gulf Air plane crash last
month.
</P>
<P>
"I express my heart-felt condolences to President Hosni Mubarak,
the Egyptian government and people for the Egyptians who died in
the Gulf Air crash," Sheikh Hamad said upon arrival in Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria for a visit.
</P>
<P>
He later went into a meeting with Mubarak to discuss ways of
strengthening bilateral relations, the Middle East peace process as
well as the air disaster, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad said he came to Egypt to offer his sympathy for the
Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Air Airbus A320 went down in the Gulf off Bahrain on
August 23, killing all 143 people aboard, including 63 Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini emir voiced his appreciation for the Egyptian
leading role in regional affairs and policies under Mubarak on
seeking Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was satisfied with the development of the
Bahraini-Egyptian cooperation and that he was committed to further
boosting the deeply-rooted and historical bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Cyprus in 2000 Expected to Reach 2.7 Million: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Commerce, Industry and
Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis on Tuesday expected the tourist
arrivals to the island this year to reach 2.7 million and relevant
income to be 1.17 billion Cyprus pounds (1.87 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two-day "Cyprus Airways Sales Conference", which
started Tuesday in Nicosia, Rolandis said the tourist arrivals to
the island reached 2.43 million last year, a rise of 9.5 percent
compared to 1998, and this year the increase is expected to be
around 10-11 percent, which will mean 2.7 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from tourism in 1999 were 1.02 billion pounds (1.63
billion dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by 16 directors and representatives
of Cyprus Airways branches in 16 countries, officers of the company
and all those involved in the income department of the air-carrier,
as well as delegates from the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO).
</P>
<P>
According to Rolandis, tourism is the powerhouse of Cyprus'
economy in real terms and this year the contribution of tourism to
the GDP (gross domestic product) may reach 21 or 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main points raised in Tuesday's session were the priority of
the CTO in the tourism development, the shortage of beds in hotels
this year, the allocation of CTO marketing and promotional funds,
and how to distribute the funds among tour operators, trade
professionals and the public.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Cyprus Airways President Haris Loizides
stressed "
the promotion of winter tourism," and asked for more authority and
flexibility for the CTO officers abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also termed France, Italy and some countries in Eastern
Europe as potential markets for the tourism to Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repeats Sovereignty Claim Over Disputed Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday repeated Iran's claim to
the "complete sovereignty" over three strategic islands in the
Persian Gulf which are also claimed by the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
</P>
<P>
Iran regards the islands, namely Abu Mussa, Greater and Lesser
Tunbs, as "an inseparable part" of its territory, as it has
repeated on numerous occasions in the past, Asefi was quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran is ready to discuss the "misunderstanding"
between the two countries by inviting officials from the UAE to
Tehran. But he did not say when the invitations would be extended.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the UAE, the islands issue was raised at the
two-day meeting of Arab League foreign ministers that ended in
Cairo on Monday. Earlier on Saturday, the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) also called on Iran to cooperate and open direct negotiations
on the islands dispute.
</P>
<P>
Asefi expressed dismay over the Arab League and the GCC's stance
over the dispute, which Iran considers clearly biased to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over control of the three Gulf islands, which are
close to the strategic Hormuz Strait, in 1971 after the British
colonist forces retreated from the region. However, both Tehran and
Abu Dhabi claimed sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it is willing for talks to resolve what it calls a
case of "misunderstanding." But the UAE wants a clear agenda and a
specific timetable for talks, and suggests referring the dispute to
international arbitration if negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
After years of mutual suspicion caused by the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran, Iran has been trying to improve relations with
neighboring Arab countries in the GCC, namely the UAE, Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. But the islands issue
remains a stumbling block for a smooth development of relations.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, a GCC committee comprising foreign ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman was set up to mediate and help open
negotiations between the UAE and Iran. Iran pays no heed to the GCC
committee and insists on solving the dispute with the UAE through
bilateral means.
</P>
<P>
So far the committee has achieved little, which is a
disappointment to the UAE.

<HEADLINE> IMF Not to Resume Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance and Economic
Development Minister Simba Makoni said Tuesday there is no
likelihood the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will resume
balance of payment loan to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"There are no indications at the moment and I was not expecting
any either," Makoni told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the current government expenditure pattern,
the controversial land acquisition policy and the army still in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the IMF will just
remain aloof to Zimbabwe's need for aid.
</P>
<P>
He said an IMF technical team led by IMF Assistant Director for
Africa Paulo Neuhaus has been in Zimbabwe in the past two weeks to
assess the state of the economy and give advisory policies to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Makoni said the issues discussed included the land acquisition
program, the government's involvement in the DRC war where it has
spent 200 million U.S. dollars since August 1998 and the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe economy has been in turmoil with inflation and
interest rates reaching record highs while there seems to be no
end to the foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe broke its ties with the IMF last year after the
government missed a number of crucial targets under a 193 million
U.S. dollars stand-by credit arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parliamentarian Calls for Troop Withdrawal from DRC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contributing to debate on the Presidential speech, Mackenzie
said he did not see the logic of keeping the troops in the DRC
when the economy could not sustain any further expenditure in that
country, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabweans had been hit hard by economic hardships and
blamed the situation on the deployment of the troops in the DRC
where the government has spent at least 200 million U.S. dollars
since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Several Members of Parliament from the Zanu-pf and the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change have implored the
government to withdraw the 11,000 troops in the DRC, saying it was
costly and unnecessary to maintain a presence in the war ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zimbabwe's Finance and Economic Development Minister
Simba Makoni told Parliament that Zimbabwe had so far spent
slightly more than 200 million U.S. dollars since deploying troops
in DRC.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Encourages Maize Import to Ease Food Shortage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statement issued by the Tanzania Information Services says
that importers are encouraged to move food-stocks close to deficit
areas such as Dodoma, Singida, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Mara,
Mwanza, Shinyanga, Tabora and Morogoro regions.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that importers will positively respond to this
notice as support to government efforts to ensuring food security
for all, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Food shortage has been singled out as the major problem the
country will face during the 2000/2001 financial year and the
government has charted out a number of strategies to check the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said during the June
Bunge (Parliament) session that there will be a shortage of about
680,840 tons of food crops due to persistent drought.
</P>
<P>
He has been exhorting businessmen to continue importing food as
well as buy food from those areas in the country where there is
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The premier also has been urging livestock keepers to sell
their livestock in exchange for enough food stock to last them
until next season.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Strategic Grain Reserve silo in Dar
es Salaam needs some 5.9 billion Tanzanian shillings (some 7.4
million US dollars) to replenish food stock.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that since it waived import duty on grain
in June, the famine-hit Kenya has been attracting thousands of
tons of grains from Tanzania though the latter bans grain exports.
</P>
<P>
Due to prolonged drought, millions of Kenyans are also under
the threat of famine.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Major U.S. Media Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed the hope here today that the U.S. media should help the
American people better understand China and contribute to the
development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here on Monday to attend the U.N. Millennium
Summit scheduled from September 6-8, made these remarks this
morning during a breakfast meeting with the leaders of some major
U.S. media at the Waldorf Hotel where he stays.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of The
News Corporation Ltd., represented the U.S. media to express his
admiration for the positive efforts and contributions the Chinese
President has made to strengthening the mutual understanding
between the Chinese and U.S. people, and between the Chinese
people and people the world over.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. relationship, Jiang said that it is the right
choice of history to establish and maintain a healthy and stable
ties between the two countries, which is in the long-term
interests of the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during his meeting with President Clinton in
Seattle in 1993, he pointed out that the two sides should handle
the Sino-U.S. relations from the strategic and long-term point of
view.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that at the dawn of the new century, it is more
necessary for both sides to take such an attitude to push forward
the development of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
When answering questions about the across-straits talks, Jiang
said that the message we have sent is very simple: only when the
Taiwan leader recognizes the One China principle, can the talks
begin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that Taiwan issue is an important
one with high sensitivity in Sino-U.S. relations and he expressed
his hope that the U.S. government should keep its promise to
explicitly support the cause of China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that U.S. media people will go to China to see with
their own eyes the great changes occurred so that they can better
understand that country and present a realistic picture to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
This will help promote the mutual understanding and friendly
cooperation between the two nations and play a more positive role
in pushing forward the stable and healthy development of Sino-U.S.
relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
Director of the Information Office of the State Council Zhao
Qizheng and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing
were present at the meeting.

CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian woman and her 14
followers were convicted Tuesday for exploiting Islam.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one-year-old Sheikha Manal Wahid Manei, arrested last
November, was convicted of "provoking civil unrest" by holding
seances in her Cairo flat, during which she claimed the Muslim
Prophet Mohammed appeared, and she was sentenced to five years in
jail with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Sheikha Manal confessed that she had told some of her followers
not to pray five times a day or make the pilgrimage to Mecca, both
of which are pillars of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The verdict of the state security misdemeanors court said that
the group were found guilty of "exploiting Islam to spread
extremist ideas with the aim of provoking civil unrest and
disdaining the religion," the Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The court also extended punishments to her 14 followers from
three years imprisonment to a fine of 1,000 Egyptian pounds (around
285 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sheikha Manal and around 50 supposed followers were arrested on
November 12 in Cairo's poor neighborhood of Sayyeda Zeinab after
one of her seances, but only the seance leader and 15 followers
were brought to trial.
</P>

One of the defendants died before the trial ended.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Armed Forces Attaining Self-sufficiency: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian armed forces are
attaining self-sufficiency in military hardware and aerospace
technology, Iran's navy commander Rear Admiral Abbas Mohtaj said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's navy has equipped all its vessels and bases with
domestically-made missiles, the commander was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying at the opening ceremony of a seminar
on aerospace technology.
</P>
<P>
The navy was dependent on foreign suppliers in repairing its
vessels and equipment before the 1979 Islamic revolution, but now
Iranian technicians can conduct overhaul, repair and reconstruction
of naval hardware independently, Mohtaj noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran has been successful in a number of tests of
domestically-made aerospace equipment, which indicated that the
Iranian armed forces have attained a high level of self-
sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The progress made by the armed forces in technology and know-how
helped develop cooperation and exchange of experience between Iran
and its Persian Gulf neighbors, Mohtaj said. The U.S., Iran's arch
rival, has long accused Tehran of threatening regional security by
developing its military power.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government Calls For Substantive Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government on
Tuesday once again called for substantive talks on the Cyprus issue
within the principles set out by the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily briefing here, government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said the "investigative phase" has been
completed and the U.N.-sponsored Cyprus talks should now go into "
the substance."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides is in New York
and will have a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said Clerides will raise ways of making the talks more
substantive as "a dialogue of the deaf cannot continue."
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided into the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third after an abortive coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
between the two communities, in an effort to pave the way for
substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A fourth round of talks is scheduled to start on September 12 in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou noted that until now Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has been using the procedure in the hope that his
breakaway state in northern Cyprus will be recognized.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Denktash will never achieve the recognition of
his "illegal regime" and "the sooner Denktash comes to acknowledge
this fact the better it is for the Turkish Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possibility of confidence building measures
between the two communities, Papapetrou made it clear that any
ideas relating to this should be put forward in Nicosia, adding
that President Clerides is in New York to discuss the substance of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"The government is willing to discuss confidence building
measures that in no way lead to the recognition of the illegal
regime in the Turkish occupied areas," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared a state in 1983, which is only
recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Opposition Demands Release of Palestinian Hamas Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The influential opposition Muslim
Brotherhood in Jordan has called for the release of a leading Hamas
member after a Palestinian court handed down a 12-year prison term
against him, sources with the Brotherhood said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the release of the hero resistance fighter (against
Israel) Mahmoud Abu Hannud and all other heros held in Palestinian
jails." the Brotherhood said in a statement faxed to reporters
based in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hannud is a leader of Hamas (the Islamic Resistance
Movement), a radical Palestinian group which remains opposed to the
ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and stands
for a holy war to liberate all Palestinian territories from Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian court handed down a 12-year imprisonment again Abu
Hannud after a closed-door session last Friday, accusing him of
belonging to an armed group, illegal weapons possession and aimed
to topple the mainstream Palestinian National Authority headed by
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last week in a hospital in the Palestinian-
controlled town of Nablus where he was getting treatment for his
injuries sustained during an earlier shoot-out with Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers were killed mistakenly by their
colleagues during the cross fire on August 26 in a West Bank
village, but Abu Hannud escaped from the Israeli effort to arrest
him.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and verdict against Abu Hannud also triggered
protests in Palestinian self-rule areas, where his supporters took
to the streets to demand his release and called him a hero against
Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> Iraq-Jordan Relations to Progress in All Fields: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq believes that bilateral
relations between Iraq and Jordan will soon witness rapid progress
in all fields, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan made the remarks during
his meeting with the two visiting Jordanian ministers, Minister of
Trade and Industry Wasif Azar and Minister of Transport Mohammad
Kalaldeh.
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident that the cooperation between Iraq and
Jordan will soon witness rapid progress in all fields," Ramadan was
quoted by the INA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan hailed the stance of Jordan which has been calling for
lifting the decade-old United Nations sanctions off Iraq, and
condemned the United States and Britain for their continuous
bombings of the two so-called no-fly zones in southern and northern
Iraq, set up by Western allies after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the two Jordanian ministers expressed the hope
that their visit will help strengthen the bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, they held separate talks with Iraqi Minister
of Industry and Minerals Adnan Abd Al-Majid Jasim Al-Ani and
Minister of Finance Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
After they arrived here on Monday evening, the two Jordanian
ministers said their visit was aimed at boosting overall
cooperation between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan visited Amman in July and bilateral relations have since
witnessed a major improvement.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held talks with the Iraqi
vice president. It was the first time for the Jordanian king to
meet a senior Iraqi official since he assumed the throne in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb, who took office on June
19, has pledged closer ties with Iraq and to help end the U.N.
sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.

JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The draft Firearms
Control Bill was aimed at making it as difficult as possible for
people to obtain firearms, South African National Assembly safety
and security committee chairman Mluleki George said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
George told committee members, who began deliberations on the
controversial legislation on Tuesday, that they had to keep this
fact in mind during their discussions and debate on the measure.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bill was intended to ensure that only proper and
fit people obtained legal firearms.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the Bill was meant to stop the proliferation of
firearms in South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee will probably spend most of this week
discussing the merits or otherwise of hundreds of proposed
amendments, changes and additions to the Bill, made by pro and
anti-gun organizations and individuals during public hearings

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Landmine Clearing Firm Shooting Video on Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean landmine clearing
firm Tuesday said it has begun shooting a film on landmines which
will be part of material used to train non-governmental
organizations and U.N. staff members who work in danger areas.
</P>
<P>
Mine Tech Marketing Manager Elsa Fuchs told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the video to be provided by her company is an addition
to a handbook with information on landmines in countries ravaged
by war or where war is still going on.
</P>
<P>
"The video will be used together with the handbook," Fuchs said,
adding that the handbook has information on landmines in countries
or regions including Kosovo, Croatia, Somalia, Mozambique and
Angola.
</P>
<P>
A few shots have already been done in Kosovo, she said. "
Instead of going to Kosovo this time we decided to shoot the video
in Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe there have been 12,500 recorded accidents involving
landmines since 1980, with about 46 people having been killed and
210 injured. Thousands of wild animals and livestock were also
killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department estimated that between 60 and 70
million landmines now remain in countries around the world. Among
the worst-affected nations are Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia,
Croatia, Eritrea, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Nicaragua and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> NATO Cluster Bombs Continue to Threaten Civilian Lives in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Cluster bomb submunitions,
landmines and other ordnance have killed or injured nearly 500
people in Kosovo since the end of NATO's military attacks against
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Among the 492 casualties reported to the United Nations Mine
Action Coordinating Center (UNMACC) database in Pristina, cluster
bomb submunitions and anti-personnel mines were the leading cause
of deaths and injuries, with about 36 percent of casualties
resulting from each, according to a report released here Tuesday
by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
A cluster bomb is a metal canister that is dropped from an
aircraft. At a pre-set altitude or after a specific time delay,
the canister opens and ejects many dozens or hundreds of
submunitions into the air. These submunitions then fall to the
ground, sometimes with the help of a parachute, where they are
meant to explode upon impact.
</P>
<P>
A significant proportion of the submunitions failed to explode
on impact in Kosovo. Citing conservative NATO estimates, the ICRC
said that it could be presumed that around 30,000 unexploded
cluster bomb submunitions remained after the conflict.
</P>
<P>
As of May 31, 2000, organizations operating under the auspices
of the UNMACC had reported the clearance of 4,069 cluster bomb
submunitions, the ICRC said. These figures do not include the
submunitions or other unexploded ordnance cleared by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Unlike anti-personnel mines, incidents involving the cluster
bomb submunitions usually result in death or injury to several
people as a result of their greater explosive power, the ICRC
stressed. Children appear to be disproportionately at risk of
death or injury from these devices. As compared to those killed or
injured by anti-personnel mines, those injured or killed by
cluster bomb submunitions were 4.9 times as likely to be children
under the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
Based on the finding in Kosovo, the ICRC urged the
international community to consider the following recommendations:
</P>
<P>
-- The use of the cluster bombs and other types of submunitions
against military objectives in populated areas should be
prohibited;
</P>
<P>
-- Users should take responsibility for the clearance of all
unexploded ordnance;
</P>
<P>
-- All necessary technical information concerning the location,
dangers, detection and destruction of cluster bombs and other
munitions should be made available to the U.N. and demining bodies
immediately after the end of hostilities;
</P>
<P>
-- Warning of the threat posed by explosive "remnants of war"
should be provided to civilian populations immediately after their
use in a given area;
</P>
<P>
-- In order to reduce the risk to civilians in future conflicts,
cluster bomb and other submunitions should be fitted with
mechanisms which will ensure their self-destruction immediately
after the device fails to explode upon impact as designed;
</P>
<P>
-- The use of cluster bombs should be suspended until an
international agreement on their use and clearance has been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly Concludes 54th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly concluded its 54th session on Tuesday at the
United Nations headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a closing ceremony, Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of
the 54th session of the United Nations General Assembly, said the
outgoing session was the first ever session of the General
Assembly which straddled two centuries and two millennia.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the session, Gurirab said the most memorable thing
was the responsibility for preparing for the unprecedented United
Nations Millennium Summit of heads of state or government to be
held from September 6 to 8, a historic moment both for the United
Nations and humanity at large.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said a total of three special sessions were held during
the 54th session which all adopted action-oriented declarations
and platforms for implementation, taking into consideration the
outstanding progress made by member states.
</P>
<P>
The 54th session was actively engaged in the reform of the
United Nations, especially the reform and enlargement of the
United Nations Security Council, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The debate of the reform and enlargement of the Security
Council was into its seventh year and it proved once again
impossible for member states to resolve the major sticking points:
the admission of new permanent members, the exercise of veto
powers and some problematic procedural matters, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He renewed his call for more closer and regularized cooperation,
coordination and action among main U.N. bodies, especially the
General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social
Council, and the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The session decided to convene in 2001 a critical
intergovernmental conference on financing for development, which
is a topical subject today at the core of the current debate on
development, poverty eradication, debt cancellation, full
employment and prosperity for all, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations faces challenging times in this new century
and one of the best ways of ensuring its efficiency and
performance is for it to be provided with sufficient resources and
assured political support, Gurirab stressed.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he urged member states to pay their assessed and
legally obligatory contributions on time, in full and without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly, set up in 1945 under the Charter of the
United Nations, is the United Nations main deliberative organ and
provides a forum for multilateral discussion of the full range of
international issues covered by the Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly comprises all members of the United Nations and
meets in regular session each year from September to December, and
thereafter as required.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly will open its 55th session
Tuesday afternoon which is designated as the Millennium Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Oil Sale Rationed in Part of France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The local governments in
several prefectures of France Tuesday decided to ration the sale
of oil to automobiles because of the blockage of oil storehouses
and refineries by protesting truckers.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government of Nord in northern France decided
to ration the distribution of oil products in the provinces of
Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Somme and Ardennes in order to avoid oil
shortage for vehicles of prior importance.
</P>
<P>
Many service stations must preserve 25 percent of their stocks
to provide them exclusively for ambulances, taxis, fire engines,
police vehicles and public transport, according to a decree issued
by the prefect.
</P>
<P>
Two prefectural governments in Alsace in eastern France ordered
49 service stations to guarantee oil supply for vehicles of prior
importance and limit sale of oil to individual cars.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government in Loire, central France, also
ordered 17 service stations to keep oil stocks for emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
Truckers have been blocking oil storehouses, pipeline terminals
and refineries across France for a second consecutive day on
Tuesday to protest the rise of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
France has called on the European Union to exert pressure on
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
increase production, after the oil prices rose to a 10-year record
high Tuesday.

awarded a special prize for her body of work Monday night at the
close of the 11-day Montreal World Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
The famous Chinese actress also shared honor for best actress
with France's Isabelle Huppert.
</P>
<P>
The jury split the vote for Gong Li's performance in Breaking
the Silence and Huppert's in Merci Pour le Chocolat.
</P>
<P>
Presenting Gong Li with her best actress trophy, Festival
President Serge Losique was all smiles answering warm applause by

</P>
<P>
Gong Li, who was in her usual beauty of sweet smile, expressed
her heart-felt thanks to Montreal, to Chinese director Sun Zhou
and to the jury.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy to enjoy so much honor the first time I've been
here in Canada. I wish to have more opportunities to come again,"
she told a friendly audience.
</P>
<P>
Losique praised Breaking the Silence as "a great movie" to
express mother-child relationship and true emotion shared by all
human beings.
</P>
<P>
"There's no border" for movie and "so many people were glad
when they saw the movie (Breaking the Silence)," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dutch UMTS Auction Meets Objective: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Dutch government officials
said on Tuesday that the Dutch auction of the UMTS licenses had
met the objectives of the government policy.
</P>
<P>
UMTS stands for universal mobile telecommunications standard,
the latest generation of cellular phone service. UMTS boasts of a
transmission speed 40 times faster than that of the existing GSM
standard.
</P>
<P>
The higher telecommunication speed makes possible new
capabilities such as mobile phone connection to the Internet and
video displays.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Monique de Vries and Finance Minister Gerrit
Zalm said in a joint statement received here that it would be
misleading to compare the Dutch auction proceeds with those in
Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the Dutch UMTS auction meets the widely
shared objectives of the government policy, and the Dutch
telecommunications policy is aimed at generating a first-class
telecom market by the early provision of high-grade infrastructure
and services so that the Netherlands will remain one of the front-
runners in Europe, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands put five third-generation UMTS licenses at
stake in the July auction and the government set forth an opening
price at 470 million Dutch guilders (202 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch auction proceeds finally amounted to 6 billion
guilders (2.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The licenses on offer will entitle holders to use allocated
frequencies for the provision of services until December 31, 2016.
The UMTS services turn mobile telephones into multimedia devices.
</P>
<P>
Eight companies took part in the auction. They included KPN
Mobile and Libertel, the largest and second largest mobile phone
operators in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the second European country after Britain to
have auctioned UMTS licenses. In April, the British government
got 22.5 billion pounds (34 billion U.S. dollars) from the auction
sales of five UMTS licenses, more than five times the sum
previously expected.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Vows to Remove Barriers Against Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese former premier Rafik
Hariri, the biggest winner in the parliamentary elections, has
vowed to boost economy and activate agriculture and industry if
appointed next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who served as prime minister from 1992 to 1998, made a
striking comeback in the just-concluded parliamentary elections,
with his bloc and allies winning at least a third of the total 128
assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in his luxurious residence in Beirut
Tuesday morning, Hariri expressed thanks, on behalf of his "dignity
election group," to all Beirut people. "I will not forget their
confidence to us and the responsibility on our shoulders," he
said. "We should develop our economic relationship with Arabic
country and eliminate those existing barricades of our regulations
and laws in the economic life. We also should create jobs for our
youths," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of cutting down on budget next year
if he becomes the premier. "On the contrary, we will increase the
expenditure of government. We will consider hire more employees,"
he said. The huge budget deficit resulted from Hariri's massive
post-war reconstruction program has contributed his resignation in
1998.
</P>
<P>
He promised his group will work for Beirut's interest, find out
what local people need and restore the city's "vanguard" role in
the fields of education, economy and humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said he hoped to activate "domestic dialog" and "widen
participation" in national reconstruction in a bid to restore
Lebanon's former status in local and international scene.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he attached importance to the freedom of expression
and promised to respect the constitution, human rights and reserve
public freedom in the country. "We shall give judicatory
departments full independence in our political life," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the possibility of President Emile Lahoud's opposition to
his designation as premier, Hariri said it is "a rumor form
authority" and he believe it will not take place.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanese constitution, a prime minister's designation must
get approval of the president and at least 86 deputies in the 128-
member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is expected to be able to secure 92 seats and Lahoud, who
sacked Hariri two years ago and had appeared determined to bloc the
construction tycoon's comeback, has promised to observe the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he reiterated the importance of the relationship
between Lebanon and Syria. "Our relations are very stable and
critical," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker of Lebanon and stationing 35,000
troops across the country, had publicly said that it would remain
neutral in the elections. Syrian official sources earlier said "it
is Lebanon's affair and it will support president Lahoud's
decision."

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A local court in Haikou, the
capital of the southernmost Hainan Province, today sentenced a
former persecutor to 18-years imprisonment for taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
Wang Deli, a former deputy procurator of the municipal
procuratorate, is also deprived of his political rights for five
years and has had 24,967 yuan of his illegal income confiscated,
according to the ruling of the Haikou Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Wang is convicted of abusing his position for personal gain. In
one case, the former persecutor helped release a swindler on bail,
after having sex with the younger sister of the defendant.
</P>
<P>
In another case, Wang rejected the application by local police
for arresting Wang Limin who was suspected of taking public
property after Wang Deli was given 100,000 yuan.

<P>
In a third case, Ye Guangsheng, a local smuggler paid the
former deputy procurator 50,000 yuan for help, when he was
arrested by the municipal procuratorate.

<HEADLINE> Over 80,000 Afghan Refugees Repatriated From Iran Since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 83,777 Afghan refugees have
returned home from Iran since April 8 as part of a "voluntary
repatriation program," the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program will continue until October in line with an
agreement signed between the Iranian government and the UNHCR, said
Toshiro Odahsima, who is in charge of the UNHCR office in Tehran,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, signed in February, some 100,000 Afghan
refugees are to be repatriated to Afghanistan in six months.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR puts the total number of Afghan refugees in Iran at 1.
4 million, of which some 70,000 are living in Iran illegally.
</P>
<P>
Afghan refugees have been blamed for contributing to the high
rate of unemployment in Iran. Labor Minister Hussein Kamali said in
May that about 2 million refugees, most of them Afghans, are
working illegally in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 154 members of Iran's Majlis (parliament) also
urged President Mohammad Khatami's government to repatriate Afghan
refugees living in Iran to their civil war-torn homeland.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing number of Afghan refugees and their long
presence here has given rise to numerous problems for Iranian
citizens," the Majlis members said in an open letter to the
president.

<P>
REYKJAVIK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li
Peng concluded his visit to Iceland on Tuesday and left here in
the morning for Lithuania, the second leg of his current five-
nation visit.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit to Iceland, Li met with Icelandic

<HEADLINE> France Concerned About High Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The French government on Tuesday
expressed its concern about the high oil prices, which have
triggered off widespread protests in France by truckers, taxi
drivers, farmers and workers in fuel products-consuming
industries.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the present situation of oil prices and their
volatility as worrying and we attach great importance to the
stability (of oil prices) for consumer countries," French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rose to their record high in 10 years in London as
the market considered an increase in oil production by Saudi
Arabia alone as insufficient to make up for the deficiency of
stocks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, a main member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), said last week that it would increase
oil production to one million barrels a day from 500,000 barrels
in order to alleviate the pressure on the market.
</P>
<P>
French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot on Tuesday asked
the European Union (EU) to exert pressure on OPEC to increase its
oil production.
</P>
<P>
French truckers, farmers and taxi drivers have been staging
demonstrations, blocking oil storehouses and refineries for the
last two days in protest against the rising fuel prices.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: U.N. Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Millennium Summit
will be held September 6-8 at the U.N. headquarters in New York,
with the theme of "the Functions of the U.N. in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The idea of convening such a summit was first raised by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1997 and was adopted at the 53rd U.
N. Assembly on December 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 heads of state or government will attend the
summit, making it the largest ever convention in the U.N. history.
Its size will exceed the celebrations in 1995 of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The participants will focus on the issues of peace and
development, improvement of the functions of the U.N.
organizations, economic globalization, the intensification of
north-south differences and the marginalization of the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Besides elaborating their stances on major international issues
at the summit, the leaders will also attend four geographical
round tables to discuss the report on the working plan of the U.N.
in the 21st century, submitted by Annan in April.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the African, Asian, East European, and Latin
American and Caribbean blocs will each hold interactive round-
table meetings. Countries belonging to no particular blocs will
attend these round tables after consulting with chairman of the U.
N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A political declaration will come out of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Security Council member states and the five
permanent members of the Security Council will each hold a summit,
while the U.N. Economic and Social Council will hold an informal
high-level meeting on information technology at the time of the
summit.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin Tuesday
again lashed out at the idea of forming a joint government with

</P>
<P>
Beilin, one of the architects of the Oslo peace accords which
ushered in a new era in Israeli-Palestinian relations, argued that
the government can not give up peace efforts in return for what he
termed as "the deception of an artificial unity government."
</P>
<P>
The minister who has devoted great efforts to nurture the
fragile peace process, charged that such a government would, more
than anything else, signal Israel's willingness to stop making

<P>
BERLIN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The WTA Tour announced Tuesday
it will move its season-ending championships from New York's
Madison Square Garden to Munich's Olympia Halle in 2001, according

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's supply and marketing
cooperatives which have been loosing money for years are expected
to become profitable at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Bai Lichen, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President
of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
made the prediction at the third national congress of the
Federation held here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Bai, the supply and marketing cooperative system
reduced its losses by 3.9 billion yuan, or 63 percent of the total,
in the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that an ailing supply and marketing
cooperative system is not able to smoothly serve rural areas and
farmers. Turning losses into profits will greatly improve China's
rural economy.

<HEADLINE> China's Cotton Output to Hit 3 Million Tons in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Cooperatives also predicted that the quality of cotton produced
this year will be better than 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country currently has a cotton-growing area of 3.67 million
ha. The cotton-producing regions along the Yangtze River, the
Yellow River and in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have
started to purchase new cotton at the end of August and early
September.
</P>
<P>
The official analyzed that China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will increase the country's textile export, and
accordingly stimulate the domestic demand for cotton.
</P>
<P>
However, since China's cotton export subsidy will be erased
after WTO entry, foreign cotton will rush into China once the
domestic cotton price exceeds the international level, then
further intensify the competition on the domestic cotton market.

<HEADLINE> Supply, Marketing Cooperative Important for Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's supply and marketing
cooperative system is a vital part of the rural economy and should
play an important role in the country's rural reform and
development, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third national congress of the system, he said
supply and marketing cooperatives should contribute more to the
rural economic growth since they have formed a comprehensive
business network across the country China.
</P>
<P>
China's supply and marketing cooperative system is a major
channel for rural commodities distribution, helping farmers sell
their products and providing farmers necessary materials for
production.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the system has members from 180
million rural families and has nearly 30,000 grass-root
organizations all over country.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, stressed that the system should
first turn losses into profits so as to better serve farmers and
the rural economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wu Bangguo has

</P>
<P>
The vice premier made the remark here today at a State Council

</P>
<P>
A series of major accidents which occurred in the first half of

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Expand Science Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientific and technological
cooperation between Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan will be promoted, said an official of the Guangdong
provincial government today.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has made a plan to enhance scientific cooperation as
a part of the province's strategy of development through science
and education, said Ma Xianmin, deputy director of the provincial
science and technology department.
</P>
<P>
Although no definite cooperation agreement has been reached
among the local governments, non-governmental scientific
cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan has
increased day by day, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, enterprises from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan only
invested in the processing sector in Guangdong. However, in recent
years, more and more research and development institutions under
the enterprises entered Guangdong, employing a large number of
researchers from the mainland, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
High-tech projects in the province have become the target of
venture capital from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. At the same time,
a number of high-tech enterprises in Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities
are ready to be listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The official also expressed the belief that Macao will become a
bridge between Guangdong and Europe in further economic and
scientific cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Police Chief Urges Districts to Crack Down on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Qiang Wei, police chief of
Beijing, signed special contracts today with heads of sub-public
security bureaus in three districts to curb rampant criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts, police officers in Chaoyang, Haidian and
Fengtai districts will be promoted, rewarded or dismissed in
accordance with the results of their work.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the signing ceremony, Qiang urged the sub-
bureaus, which are made up of 33 police stations, to improve the
local security situation within one year.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at better safeguarding social stability of
Beijing by maintaining the "Strike Hard" attitude toward criminals,
in an effort to create a sound social environment for the city to
contend for hosting Olympiad 2000, according to the police chief.
</P>
<P>
The three districts which have drawn special concerns from the
authorities are where lots of China's "floating population" are
believed to be responsible for most of the criminal cases
uncovered in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, these districts accounted for half of the crimes
reported in the city. This year, local police have focused on
cracking down on thieves, robbers and swindlers in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Fighting Dies Down As Election Campaigns  Kick Off  By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The latest fierce fighting
between Sri Lankan government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels died
down on Tuesday as a record number of candidates has officially
kicked off campaigns for the October 10 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers and rebels were reported to have been
killed in the heavy fighting in the northern Jaffna peninsula. The
military put its losses at 132 soldiers killed and some 800
wounded while claiming to have killed some 300 rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and wounded another 300.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said troops are
consolidating the newly captured areas in Colombuturai area, in
the eastern outskirts of Jaffna town.
</P>
<P>
The offensive began on Sunday when thousands of troops - backed
by ground attack aircraft - advanced into Colombuturai, Sarasalai,
Maduvil and Nunavil which were lost to the rebels earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said the LTTE rebels had launched two
ferocious counter-attacks against military positions at
Colombuturai on Monday, but were repelled.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released from their London office on Tuesday,
the LTTE rebels said they had repulsed a major offensive launched
by the Sri Lankan Army in the Jaffna peninsula killing at least
150 soldiers and injuring over 1,000 after two days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
The statement said 60 rebels were killed in the heavy fighting
on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The military said it had recovered the bodies of 69 rebels and
would hand over 37 of them which were in good condition to rebels
through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said they were in contact with both sides over the
issue of returning bodies. The clandestine radio of the LTTE said
on Tuesday that the rebels were planning to hand over 50 bodies of
soldiers to the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The latest bloodshed erupted as the campaigns officially kicked
off after nominations closed Monday for the October parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
A record number of 5,048 candidates from 29 political parties
and 99 independent groups submitted their nominations to contest
the 225 seats in the parliament. The last general elections in
1994 saw only 1,449 candidates trying to win over voters.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 million voters will go to the polls on October 10 to
elect their representatives according to the proportional
representation system.
</P>
<P>
Nine seats are allocated for the war-torn Jaffna district,
which the LTTE rebels want to claim as part of an independent
Tamil homeland called Eelam. Tamil parties, which could not
contest the large urban area of the Jaffna peninsula in the last
parliamentary elections in 1994 because the region was controlled
by the LTTE, are mounting an election campaign in the area despite
threats from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting a 17-year war against majority Sinhalese
dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate state for
minority Tamils in the country's north and east. More than 60,000
people have been killed in the ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
More than a month before the vote, election fever has already
swept Sri Lanka, with posters of candidates everywhere. Although
there are a record number of parties and independent groups
contesting the elections, the battle is expected to be dominated
by the ruling People's Alliance (PA) of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
led by former premier Ranil Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
The October election is widely seen as a referendum on the
constitutional reform proposals which seek to devolve greater
power to the regions of the country, particularly the Jaffna
peninsula, where the minority Tamil community dominate.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga has made her constitutional reform bid the main
plank for the PA to seek a fresh mandate from the electorate. The
president has said she will press ahead with the controversial
power-sharing plan even if she fails to muster the required two
thirds majority in the parliament. She promises to implement her
new constitution within two months of coming to power.
</P>
<P>
In August this year Kumaratunga had to shelve the draft
constitution in the parliament as the UNP refused to support.
Nationalist Sinhalese groups and senior Buddhist monks have also
rejected the draft constitution on the grounds that it might lead
to the disintegration of the country.
</P>
<P>
In its elections manifesto released last weekend, the UNP said
it would not rush any constitutional reforms, but would open
dialogue with all parties in and outside parliament while raising
the professional standard of the military.
</P>
<P>
The UNP said it hoped to set up a military council comprising
the chiefs of the armed forces to conduct offensive operations and
establish a committee of retired generals who will advise the
armed forces on strategy and tactics.
</P>
<P>
Security in and around Colombo has been stepped up in advance
of the elections as the government is importing a fleet of bullet-
proof cars for ruling party leaders who are likely targets for
LTTE's suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed the elections on October 10 is vital as
it will determine the fate of President Kumaratunga's draft
constitution and the prospects for peace in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> 25 Killed in Clashes Between Rival Clans in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people were
killed and more than 18 others wounded after heavy fighting
erupted Monday morning between two rival clans in northwestern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to eye witnesses, nearly 100 heavily armed militiamen
from the Galje'l clan attacked a village near Jowhar town, 90
kilometers north of Mogadishu. The village was mainly inhabited by
the Hawadleh clansmen.
</P>
<P>
A counterattack from the Hawadleh clan later spread the armed
confrontation between the two clans to another village nearby,
which further increased the casualties.
</P>
<P>
The fighting resulted from a conflict between the two clans in
Jowhar town last month, in which 20 people from both sides were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's different clans frequently confronted with each other
over territory and the country has been divided into different
clan-based fiefdoms since 1991 when the then president Mohamed
Siad Barre was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
The election of Abdiqassim Salad Hassan as Somali president
during the Djibouti peace conference has raised hope among people
for the forming of a central government in 10 years. But Hassan
still faces stiff opposition from some warlords in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> First Accession to EU to Complete by End of 2003: Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Romano Prodi, president of
the commission of the European Union (EU) said on Tuesday that the
first accession for more countries to join the EU will complete by
late 2003.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to make sure that the first accession will
actually take place by the end of this commission's term in office,
" said Prodi while addressing EU diplomats stationed in other
countries for their biannual meeting.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that EU expansion is one of the two priorities of
the current five-year-term commission. The other priority is
internal reform.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that this commission will live up to the
historic challenge to unite Europe during the years to come. I
place the utmost importance on the commission's proactively
carrying forward the enlargement process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's remarks came after a commissioner had caused a panic
about a German referendum on the EU's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Guenther Verheugen, European commissioner in charge of
enlargement, has told the German newspaper Sueddeutsch Zeitung
that the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder should ask the German
public how they feel about the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission clarified on Monday that what
Verheugen meant was to get the broadest possible public support
for the process of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Prodi has asked the commissioner for an explanation on his
remarks to the German newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The EU started a publicity campaign about the enlargement in
August.
</P>
<P>
It began talks in 1998 with Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus about their entry into the union.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta have
been added to the applicant country list that has started
accession negotiations. Turkey is also on the list but will enter
the negotiations a few years later.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Down in EU in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
European Union (EU) went further down to 8.3 percent in July while
the jobless rate in the euro zone remained unchanged at 9.1
percent, Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical agency of the European
Community said the lowest unemployment rate was registered in
Luxembourg which was 2.2 percent, while the highest was posted in
Spain which stood at 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Eurostat figures, unemployment fell in all EU
member states in July, with the biggest falls registered in the
Netherlands (from 3.4 percent to 2.6 percent), Ireland (from 5.7
percent to 4.5 percent), Sweden (from 7.1 percent to 5.6 percent),
France (from 11.3 percent to 9.6 percent) and Austria (from 3.8
percent to 3.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
Observers regarded the falls in unemployment as a sign for
sound economic growth in both the EU and the euro zone. The EU has
suffered from the problem of unemployment in the past two decades
when some of its member states hit double-digit jobless rates.
</P>
<P>
At the Lisbon summit held last March, the EU decided to boost
employment through knowledge-based new economy.

<P>
The meeting, which opened today, aims to solidify cooperative

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan has painted a rosy picture for the development of Sino-
African relations in the 21st century, characterized by "sincere
friendship, equality, unity and cooperation, and common
development."
</P>
<P>
"These are the core of the proposals on developing long-term
and cooperative Sino-African relations in an all-round manner made
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his 1996 Africa trip,
reflecting the characteristics of Sino-African relations and
envisaging broad prospects of such relations in the future," Tang
said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Now Sino-African ties will get a boost with the convening of
the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, a ministerial-level meeting
scheduled for October 10-12 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The forum will provide a golden opportunity for China and
African countries to discuss ways for further cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China an Important Supporter of Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua)-- John Gee, deputy director-
general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW), said here today that China has always been an
important supporter of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech at Beijing University, Gee said that
China holds a seat on the OPCW's Executive Council, which it is
likely to occupy on a permanent basis in the foreseeable future.
China has also provided professional personnel to the Secretariat
as well as a number of other experts, and it is represented on
many of the organs and subsidiary bodies of the OPCW.
</P>
<P>
Gee is in Beijing for a five-day symposium on the
implementation of the CWC, co-sponsored by the Chinese government
and the OPCW. More than 80 participants from more than 20
countries are expected to exchange views for promoting an overall
and effective implementation of the CWC.
</P>
<P>
Gee said as a victim of chemical weapons, China has large
quantities of chemical weapons which were abandoned on its
territory by the former Japanese army during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"The OPCW Secretariat is pleased to note that China has played
a constructive and positive role in working with Japan to ensure
the destruction of these weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a responsible member of the international community, China
has been at pains to demonstrate its compliance with provisions of
the Convention, Gee said. According to him, as of last month,
China had received a total of 38 inspections by the OPCW,
including inspections at abandoned weapon sites and chemical
industry sites.
</P>
<P>
"It can be said that the contribution being made by the
Convention processors to global security environment, of which
China is part, and to the regional environment, within which China
is geographically positioned, is already very significant," he
said.

The forum will focus on two topics -- how to push ahead with
the establishment of a new international political and economic
order of fairness and justice in the new century, and how to
promote Sino-African economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries are expected to summarize
cooperation experience in the areas of politics, the economy,
social development, and put forth guidelines and concrete plans
for future cooperation, according to the minister.
</P>

Moreover, two documents will be published -- the Beijing
Declaration and the Sino-African Cooperation Guidelines for
Economy and Social Development, to reflect the views of the two
sides on major international issues and their stance on
establishing a new international order, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Adheres to One-China Principle: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The mainland maintains that
there is only one China in the world and both the mainland and
Taiwan belong to the same China. And China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity are inalienable.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by Zhang Mingqing, the
spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, while
explaining the mainland's constant and clear stance on the one-
China principle, at the first news conference held by the office.
</P>
<P>
He said the key issue concerning the current cross-Straits
relations is to adhere to the one-China principle or to separate
Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
So far, the leader of Taiwan Authorities has not accepted the
one-China principle and is still denying and avoiding the
consensus of "the two banks of the straits are both adhered to the
one-China principle" which was reached in 1992 between the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, of the
mainland, and the Straits Exchange Foundation, of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the leader of Taiwan Authorities has
recently said that "reunification is not the only choice" and that
"Taiwan is a country of independent sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the substance of such remarks is to adhere
to the separatist avocation of "Taiwan independence", which is "
very dangerous" and "should aroused the vigilance of the whole
Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to hear what he says and to see what he does,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang went on to emphasize that the mainland is still adhered
to its basic principle of "peaceful reunification and one country,
two systems", as well as the Eight Proposals raised by President
Jiang Zemin in January 1995 on the current development of the
cross-Straits ties and pushing forward the peaceful reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the two sides should start to hold talks and
negotiations under the one-China principle as early as possible,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland is willing to increase contacts with different
Taiwan-based parties, groups and individuals who adhere to the one-
China principle and in favor of developing the cross-Straits
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland will try efforts to strengthen cross-Straits
economic exchanges and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, in the first half of this year, the
indirect cross-Straits trade topped 14 billion US dollars, up 36.4
percent compared with the same period of last year, with Taiwan's
imports at 11.6 billion US dollars, up 30.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mainland approved 1,399 Taiwan-funded projects,
up 13.65 percent, and received 1,378,000 visitors from Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Justice Minister Rejects Coalition with Likud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister
Yossi Beilin Tuesday again lashed out at the idea of forming a
joint government with the right-wing Likud party, and called for
continued efforts to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, one of the architects of the Oslo peace accords which
ushered in a new era in Israeli-Palestinian relations, argued that
the government can not give up peace efforts in return for what he
termed as "the deception of an artificial unity government."
</P>
<P>
The minister who has devoted great efforts to nurture the
fragile peace process, charged that such a government would, more
than anything else, signal Israel's willingness to stop making
peace.
</P>
<P>
In late August, Prime Minister Ehud Barak reached out to the
opposition Likud in a surprise move, saying that if the peace talks
fall through, the ruling One Israel would set up a national unity
government with Likud, and suggested that Likud leader Ariel Sharon
would be qualified for the post of foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak has since been repeating the overture, which is seen by
some observers as a scare tactic to pressure Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat into showing more flexibility in his positions.
</P>
<P>
In response to request not to pressure Arafat, Barak, who is in
New York to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit, extended a few more
weeks for the peace talks to run its course.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday,
Barak said he would give the peace process another "few weeks"
before turning his attention inward and move to form a national
unity government with Likud.
</P>
<P>
Barak also called Sharon Monday night to brief the opposition
leader on his talks in New York. Sharon reiterated Tuesday that
they did not discuss the possibility of a national unity government
if Israel and the Palestinians fail to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told Israel Radio that "I spoke to Barak...He told me he
wanted to hear 'new ideas'...These are very dangerous for Israel's
future."
</P>
<P>
"This government is a failure. We are doing everything possible
to change it," Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
Following the collapse of the July Camp David peace summit, the
U.N. Millennium Summit is widely seen as a great opportunity for
the Israelis and Palestinians to break the current deadlock in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Tuesday ahead of his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday. Clinton is also to meet Arafat in a bid to further
advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A trilateral meeting between Barak, Arafat and Clinton has not
been scheduled, but sources here have not ruled out such a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's delegation to the United Nations have
expressed pessimism over the chances of securing a breakthrough in
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, observers here believe both Barak and Arafat will
value the opportunity at hand until all efforts to reactivate the
peace process are exhausted.

RABAT -- The Moroccan Finance Ministry has rejected the idea of
devaluating the national currency, dirham, despite the losses
suffered by the country's economy from the downturn in the exchange
rate between euro and U.S. dollar.

A source with the ministry said such a notion was unacceptable
at present due to its threat to the stability of prices in local
market.
</P>
<P>
The source expressed grave concern over the prospects of
Moroccan exports in view of the pressures brought about on the euro
to which dirham is linked within the international currency
basket.
</P>

"Foreign trade is likely to be negatively affected and we are
making new counterpart arrangements," he said without elaborating.

"Forms and procedures now have to be undertaken by the company
for the listing. Any other GCC company can submit an application

So far, according to the spokesman, no other GCC firm has

<HEADLINE> Libyan Envoy Back to Manila to Speed up Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Ambassador Rajab
Azzarouk returned to Manila Tuesday to work for the release of the
remaining hostages, including American Jeffrey Schilling, being
held captive by the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
When arriving, together with another Libyan negotiator
Mohhammad Hassan, arrived at the Manila International Airport in
the afternoon, Azzarouk said he is glad to be back again and
expressed optimism that the hostages would be released in due time.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sent by Libyan leader Moammar Khadaffy to hold
fresh negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf for the speedy release of
the remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he is also negotiating for Schilling, he said he
will do it as a sign of goodwill to the American people.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the ongoing negotiation is being coursed
through non-government organizations in Mindanao so that all the
remaining captives would be released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the American hostage abducted on August 28, the
rebel group is still holding five of the original group of 21
hostages snatched from Malaysia's Sipadan island on April 23, and
two French journalists seized in Jolo last month.

<HEADLINE> Manila Claims No Swap Deal on Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
not about to release suspected terrorist Hadji Ahmad Upao, who is
believed to be Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya's kin, just to get the
group to negotiate with government negotiators for the release of
its American hostage.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing Tuesday, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said the case of Upao is an entirely different matter that should
not be dragged into the hostage case.
</P>
<P>
"His uncle, assuming that he is in fact Sabaya's uncle, was
picked up in a completely unrelated matter," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier quoted Sabaya as allegedly saying the Abu
Sayyaf will not negotiate with the government for the release of
American Jeffrey Schilling unless his relative, referring to 73-
year old Upao, is released.
</P>
<P>
Upao was arrested by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task
Force for allegedly plotting the abduction and murder of Fr. Rhoel
Gallardo.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was also believed to be part of the Abu Sayyaf
faction that kidnapped a priest, teachers and pupils in Basilan in
March. The priest and two other captives were killed by the Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government would be willing to give up Upao should
Sabaya convey his request through any of the government
negotiators dealing with the Abu Sayyaf, Zamora said "it is hard
to engage in exchange deals."

<HEADLINE> Border Posts Along Guinea Bissau-Senegal Frontier Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- All border posts along the
frontier between Guinea-Bissau and Senegal have been closed, a
source of the Interior Ministry of Guinea-Bissau was quoted by the
Portuguese news agency Lusa as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the Senegalese authorities closed on
Saturday the only border post between Sao Domingos in northwest
Guinea-Bissau and Mpack in Senegal. This crossing leads to
Ziguinchor, capital of southern Senegal's Casamance Province,
where separatist rebels have waged an 18-year rebellion against
the Dakar government.
</P>
<P>
A week ago the border at Cambadju in northeast Guinea-Bissau
was closed after local authorities on the Senegalese side
protested against delays in returning allegedly stolen cattle.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, President of Guinea-Bissau Kumba Iala paid an
official visit to Senegal, during which he discussed with his
Senegalese counterpart Abdoulaye Wade on the issue of the border
situation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents promised to study an "ideal schedule" for
Guinea-Bissau to undertake its commitment to mediate between the
Dakar government and the separatist Casamance Democratic Forces
Movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chiefs of staff of Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, have
pledged never to use force against each other and to collaborate
in tightening border controls to avoid arms trafficking and cattle
rustling.

ADDIS ABABA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two percent of
school age children in Ethiopia do not have access to formal
education, the government-owned Ethiopian Herald newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report presented to a two-day workshop
on basic education in Ethiopia as saying that the drop-out at the
first cycle of the primary education is as high as 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The disparity between states and gender gap remains high even
though the government budget expenditure on education has reached
more than 15 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, educationists urged the whole society to
make efforts to popularize basic education in the country to
promote the quality of the population.
</P>
<P>
Although schools intake, enrollment rate, text ration per
student and other indicators of the level of basic education in
Ethiopia has shown remarkable rise over the past five years,
rigorous efforts should be deployed to meet the national education
program, they said.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Turkey with Vaccine for Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Tuesday
shipped the first lot of a special vaccine to Turkey to combat the
foot-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
The trivalent vaccine was formulated from antigen stocks kept
at the EU's antigen bank.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is expected to combat an exotic strain of the foot-
and-mouth disease in ruminants in the Thrace region of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious disease of
ruminants and swine, known to cause significant economic losses to
livestock farmers.
</P>
<P>
In general an outbreak of the disease immediately leads to
restrictions on international trade in livestock and in products
such as fresh meat, milk and certain milk products originating
from the country affected.
</P>
<P>
The disease in animals, however, does not pose any danger to
human health.
</P>
<P>
The European Union follows a non-vaccination policy against the
foot-and-mouth disease. Vaccines are only used in emergency
situations. The EU maintains a bank with about 30 million vaccine
equivalent doses of different antigens of the foot-and-mouth
disease virus.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Survey Finds Alarming Hormone Disrupting Substances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive official survey
has discovered human hormone disrupting substances at alarming
levels in South Korea, said the Environment Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 17-month monitoring program and analysis of the ecosystem of
South Korea, which ended last month, found endocrine disrupters at
113 locations, including rivers, streams, air and soil, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is the first comprehensive survey by the South Korean
government.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin, known as a carcinogen, measured at high levels at
Panwol industrial complexes in Ansan, South Korea, at 8.62 pgTEQ (
picogram toxic equivalent quantity) per cubic meter, much higher
than the average 2.726pgTEQ.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the dioxin levels were generally higher
in the air and soil than in waters, as much as 2.5 times more than
the average in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fish, frogs and other living organisms sampled from the tainted
locations were found to have defective reproductive systems.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it will introduce a law designed to contain
the spread of toxic substances and start a special monitoring
system in the areas that were found to be contaminated by these
substances.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Before the Japanese court made a
final judgment over the 13-year-torture he had borne in Japan, Liu
Lianren, a forced Chinese laborer during the World War II, died in
his hometown in Shandong Province over the weekend. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
Liu, born in 1913 in Gaomi County, in east China's Shandong
Province, was captured by Japanese invaders in 1944 and was forced
to be a laborer in a mine in Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Liu escaped into the mountains in Hokkaido in July, 1945. There
he spent 13 years in a cave eating wild herbs in summer and kelp
in winter.
</P>
<P>
Liu had almost lost his linguistic ability when he was found by
local hunters in January, 1958. Three months later he returned
home via Tokyo with the help of the Chinese government and some
friendship organizations of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Liu was received by top Chinese leaders at that time, including
Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Liu was invited over 1,800 times to give reports on his
sufferings in Japan. He visited Japan six times to expose the
crimes committed by the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Television and a television station from Japan shot a
TV film of Liu's experience.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Liu became the first Chinese civilian to ask for
compensation from Japan when he began a suit in the Tokyo local
court. He was believed an "unarmed hero".
</P>
<P>
The final judgment of the case was scheduled to be announced
early next year.

This portrait was painted to express the Chinese people's
respect for Mr. Chennault and to promote cultural exchange between
the two countries, Wei said. He also added that he will host a
painting exhibition next year at the hometown of Mr. Chennault in
America.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-American social
activist Anna Chan Chennault today expressed her delight with a
portrait of her husband presented to her by the Luzhou Painting
Studio in Southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The two-meter by one-meter painting, titled "Portrait of
General Chennault", is a meticulous-style Chinese work done in
colors of oil-painting style. In the picture, Mr. Chennault is
wearing a dark-green army suit, with three-star general shoulder
marks. His facial expression is solemn but fire-eyed.
</P>
<P>
The artist, Wei Wensheng, said he spent six months on the
portrait, which was done on dacron cloth.
</P>
<P>
He said that he created the painting based on Mr. Chennault's
photos and other reference materials offered by Mrs. Chennault.
</P>
<P>
Wei Wensheng also painted a portrait of Mrs. Chennault titled "
Herald of Spring", which was presented to Mrs. Chennault on
September 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
"I had never seen Chennault in person, but relied on a photo
and her autobiography to re-create her likeness," the painter said,
adding that the painting, which is a meticulous-style Chinese work
done in soft colors, was taken back to Washington by Mrs.
Chennault and is on display in the conference center of the
Council for International Cooperation of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The portrait of Mr. Chennault" will be displayed in the
private museum of Mrs. Chennault in the office building of the
Council for International Cooperation of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The museum collection mainly consists of photos, paintings, and
documents and materials about the "Flying Tigers" and the Anti-
Japanese War.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault's husband, General Claire Lee Chennault, was
commander of the U.S. 14th Air Fleet during World War II. He
organized a group of American pilots, known as the "Flying Tigers,
" who transported arms and other materials, and joined in an air
raid supporting China against Japanese invaders.

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Average beverage consumption
in China will double in five years, according to an official
source.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, beverage consumption in China will be 20 kilograms,
and beverage output will be 27 million tons, up 14 percent every
year.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, ten types of beverage including soda pop,
mineral water and ade, have replaced the former one and the only
beverage -- soda pop in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the annual beverage output by domestic
manufactories has reached 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Beverage output and consumption will continue to rise with
increases in income, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the demand for healthy, natural, low-in-sugar
beverages is increasing, which will promote the growth of new
types of beverages.
</P>
<P>
China's annual consumption of ade, which is one kilogram per
person, is low compared with the world average annual consumption
of seven kilograms.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, beverage output and

<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation consisting of
China's seven top leaders of Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism
and Christianity, returned to Beijing this afternoon, after
attending the Millennium World Peace Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
Fu Tieshan, head of the delegation and chairman of the China
Catholicism Association, said that the delegation's trip, the
first of such sort since the founding of the People's Republic in
1949, is a vivid demonstration of China's policy of religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua during the flight, Fu said that
during their stay in the United States, the Chinese religious
leaders aired their proposals on maintaining world peace at the
millennium summit, introduced China's religious affairs to the
outside world and exposed the nature of the Falun Gong cult and
the separatist motive of the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the Dalai Lama is a political exile who, for a
long time, has abused religion to split the motherland. The Dalai
Lama attempted to enter the millennium summit but was rejected.
However, he had ordered some people to read out his letter to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Fu said, Chinese religious leaders proposed to
safeguard the purity of religion and opposed anyone from
conducting splittism activities in the guise of religion, which
gained wide acclaims from most of the delegates at the summit. (

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Promulgate Notary Law Before 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
disclosed here today that China is scheduled to promulgate a
notary law before the year 2002, in an effort to further clarify
the legal functions of notarization.
</P>
<P>
Duan Zhengkun, vice-minister of justice, made the remark at a
press conference here this morning, adding that China plans to
complete the establishment of auxiliary laws before 2010, so as to
provide a legal insurance for the work of notarization.
</P>
<P>
He said the current notary system is a governmental system,
which could not adapt to China's socialist market economy and the
global notary systems.
</P>
<P>
China began reforming its notary system in 1993, and in 1994, a
national conference decided to transform the country's notary
system from a governmental one to a institutional one.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 20 percent of China's notary offices are
professional institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quality examination of China's public notaries
will be opened to the public. For the coming national notaries
examination in September, more than three-fourths of the
applicants are from outside the notarial service system.
</P>
<P>
Duan also pointed out that the reform will further perfect the
notary compensation system, so as to promote notary agencies to
become real institutional legal bodies, which can independently
conduct their business, bear liability, and carry out the
functions of notarization following market rules and the operation
of self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts of some 3,200 public notary offices, with a
total staff of more than 18,000.
</P>
<P>
Coming into being in the early 1950s, China's public notary
system was abolished in 1957 and then resumed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the State Council promulgated China's first public
notary regulation, namely the Interim Regulation on Public Notary
of the People's Republic of China.

The company, the only listed flagship of China Insurance Group,
registered a total turnover of 350 million HK dollars (44.87
million U.S. dollars) in the past six months ended on June 30, 10.
5 percent higher than the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, profit attributable to shareholders was 47 million HK
dollars (6.02 million U.S. dollars), 4.9 percent lower than the
same period last year, according to Yang Chao, chairman of the
group.
</P>
<P>

and life reinsurance of 107.7 million HK dollars (13.8 million U.S.
dollars), 231.8 million HK dollars (29.7 million U.S. dollars) and
3.6 million HK dollars (0.46 million U.S. dollars) respectively,
which translate to a 20 percent, 4.4 percent and 119 percent
increase from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The significant increase showed a sign of the economic
recovery in Hong Kong and Asian markets," Yang told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, Yang said the company's management firmly
believed that with the recovery in the underlying economy and
enormous business opportunities of the insurance market in China,
his company is expected to grow substantially.
</P>
<P>
"The group is in the process of setting up representative
offices in Beijing and Shanghai to promote its business," Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, by establishing strategic alliances with China
Reinsurance Company and China Life Insurance Company, we plan to
develop assets management and reinsurance business," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang said, "although the investment income from the company's
listed investment portfolio may be influenced by the overall stock
market conditions in the coming months, we are looking forward to
achieving satisfactory results for the whole year as the major
components of the company's investment portfolio consists of debt
securities and cash."
</P>
<P>
The company is well-positioned to benefit from the rapid growth
of China's insurance market and its entry into the World Trade
Organization, the chairman concluded.

the next fiscal year is expected to reach 52.9 trillion rupiah (7.
557 billion U.S. dollars) or higher than the current figure which
stands at 44 trillion rupiah (6.285 billion dollars), 3.7 percent
of the country's gross domestic product, an official said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General for State Budget at the Ministry of Finance,
Anshari Ritonga said the increase of budget deficit in the fiscal
year 2001 is largely due to the huge financial burden that should
be carried out by the government.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is determined that the country's 2001 budget
will still not be able to give significant stimulus to the
economic activities," Ritonga said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the draft of the next state budget, the
country's expenditures are targeted to reach 283.3 trillion rupiah
(40.471 billion U.S. dollars) while the income was only targeted
at 230.4 trillion rupiah (32.914 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ritonga also said the government will try to get foreign
borrowing to overcome the deficit, saying that Indonesia still
needs huge foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign borrowing is expected to reach 27 trillion rupiah (3.
857 billion U.S. dollars) for the last two years," he said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sailors Bowled over by Sydney Strong Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A freak wind blast of 40 knots
caused massive damage to several Olympic class yachts on Sydney
Harbour Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic sailors were caught unawares when the stiff breeze hit,
with many suffering broken masts.
</P>
<P>
Sydney's water police said the harbour was temporarily awash
with battered yachts but there were no reports of serious injuries
to any sailors.
</P>
<P>
Australian Tornado pair Darren Bundock and John Forbes were one
of the first crews hit by the wind gust and were unceremoniously
flipped over.
</P>
<P>
"We did a bit of cartwheel -- the wind just came in and flipped
us over big time, we didn't have a chance," Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't really see it coming. One minute it was a steady
10 to 15 knots and then it was 40 knots and it stayed like that
for four or five hours."
</P>
<P>
As the pair made their way ashore, Forbes said there were
already signs of disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Woollahra Sailing Club was hosting a regatta when the
strong winds hit.
</P>
<P>
Club spokesman Lou Carter said four 49ers -- from Denmark,
Ukraine, Sweden and Japan -- had to be towed ashore because the
winds were too strong to sail in.
</P>
<P>
Four other 49ers -- all non-Olympic yachts from Australia --
were temporarily abandoned along the eastern shore of the harbour,
where they were tied down until the wind eased.

<HEADLINE> China's Local Beverage Producers Regain Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's local beverage
producers are regaining a share of the domestic market from their
powerful international rivals such as Coke and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the 2000 China International Trade Fair
for Food, Food Processing and Packaging, the top 10 local
producers led by Robust, Jianlibao and Wahaha accounted for 45
percent of the country's beverage production in the first half of
the year, compared with 22 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total production by the 10 companies amounted to 3.4
million tons in the six months, a year-on-year growth of 46
percent, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
International brands such as Coke and Pepsi swept over the
Chinese market in the first years of their entrance into China
with the country beginning to open to the outside world in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of Chinese producers have been growing over
recent years, with their products gaining increasing popularity
among consumers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the China Association of Beverage Industry
attributed their success to good quality control, innovated
products, and most importantly, the implementation of successful
brand strategies, which they learned from their foreign
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the rise of these local producers marks
the end of a beverage industry heavily dominated by foreign
producers and the beginning of a new age characterized by healthy
competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China,
the central bank, announced today that major reforms on the
administrative system of interest rates of foreign currencies will
be implemented from September 21.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said that this move aims to promote a market-
oriented interest rate reform so that China's banking industry
will open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued today by the bank says the lending rate of
foreign currencies will be liberalized. Financial institutions are
authorized to define by themselves the lending rate and interest
settlement patterns of foreign currencies according to the
fluctuations of interest rates in the international financial
market, as well as financing costs and risks.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate of foreign currency deposits equivalent to
three million U.S. dollars or over will be decided through
negotiations between financial institutions and their clients.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, the interest rate of petty foreign
currency deposits will be designated by the China Association of
Banks as a unified rate to be carried out by all financial
institutions.

Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing from
September 28 to October 6, a celebration conference to be held at
Beijing University, and a ceremony at the National Library for the
launching of two books on the development of space technology, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
A copy of China's first experimental manned space shuttle will
be on display at the exhibition for the first time, the official

MACAO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) will buy a large amount of
computer software from Microsoft at rather favorable prices, the
Macao Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The software will have a market value of more than 10 million
patacas (1.25 million U.S. dollars). As a result, 44 government
departments will have their software upgraded or begin to use
authorized software in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
In view of the mass purchase, Microsoft will offer a 35-percent
discount at least.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Public Administrative and Civil Services of
the Macao SAR government are scheduled to sign an agreement with
representatives of Microsoft Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will not benefit educational institutions which
might enjoy a bigger discount, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On April 10 this year, the chief executive of the Macao SAR
issued an administrative decree demanding that all government
departments use authorized software.

Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Free Trade
Area (FTA) to be effective this October, Zambia Daily Mail
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have asked for permission to suspend
proceedings before joining the FTA to allow them iron out certain
difficulties in their respective countries, according to COMESA
public relations official Mweusi Karake.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, only 12 COMESA countries have so far confirmed
participation in the FTA which will be officially launched on
October 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Karake also confirmed reports that Tanzania has finally pulled
out of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike other countries which can ask for permission to suspend
their proceedings in the COMESA, Tanzania has not given any
official reason," Karake said.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices to Go up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pump prices of petroleum
products are set to rise substantially in Kenya due to the
increased cost of crude oil and the depreciation of the Kenya
shilling, the East African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials in oil marketing firms were quoted by the paper as
saying the retail prices of super and regular petrol, diesel and
kerosene will go up by two to three shillings (about 0.038 U.S.
cents ) per liter, registering a 4 to 6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the increase to the rising crude oil price in
the international market from 27.55 dollars per barrel in July to
28.65 U.S. dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
Oil firms here adjust retail prices depending on changes in the
cost of crude oil, shilling-dollar exchange rate, taxation, cost
of transport and profit margins among other factors.
</P>
<P>
The officials said a hike is inevitable as the international
crude oil price had shot up by 1.10 dollars per barrel and the
exchange rate between shilling and dollar depreciated from 74
shillings to about 79 shillings last month.

<HEADLINE> Observers Pessimistic Over Soeharto's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Observers and legal experts in
Indonesia expressed here Tuesday their pessimism over the trial
process against former president Soeharto, saying that Soeharto
might be found innocent.
</P>
<P>
Teten Masduki of the Indonesian Corruption Watch (ICW) told
reporters that," I am pessimistic that the trial will yield
positive result as we all have been waiting for. I am pessimistic
on the Soeharto's trial. I am not sure that he could be found
guilty. The indictments are too weak," he said.
</P>
<P>
Masduki said the 79-year old man should be charged in his
capacity as a (former) head of state instead of chairman of the
foundations.
</P>
<P>
"Because if Soeharto is charged in his capacity as chairman of
the foundations there were no evidences that he broke law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He should have been charged in his capacity as a (former)
president who has abused his power by issuing the government
decrees and regulations to enrich his own family and cronies,
Masduki added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gaguk Subagyanto, a former prosecutor at the
Attorney General Office regretted at the indictments. "That is a
sad indictments,"Subagyanto said, referring to the indictments
against Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Law and Human Right Affairs Yusril Ihza
Mahendra refused to comment on the trial process against the
former president.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not intervene in such a process," the
minister told reporters at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
But, earlier he also expressed his pessimism if Soeharto could
be found guilty as the former president, who ran the country for
more than three decades with an iron hand, was only charged with
corruption in his capacity as the chairman of foundations.
</P>
<P>
The former five stars general has been charged by state
prosecutors with allegedly misusing some 1.4 trillion rupiah (155
million U.S.dollars) and 416 million U.S. dollars of state funds
that had gone to his seven tax-free charity foundations.
</P>
<P>
He is principally charged with violating article 1(a) of
corruption law No.3/1973 and he is also subject to a subsidiary
charge under article 1 (b) of the same law with abuse of power
which causes losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to prove that Soeharto has done a corruption crime
if he was charged in his capacity as the foundations chairman
because under the foundations statutes, Soeharto has rights to
distribute the foundation's funds. He did no crime in this matter,
" Frans Hendra Winata, a member of the National Law Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
"But there has been no changes for the prosecutors to revise
their indictments as such things have been filed to the court and
the session itself has been taking place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's trial began on Thursday, August 31 with the absence
of the defendant due to medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Chief judge Lalu Mariyun then decided to adjourn the trial
until Mid-September.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's City Arrest Status Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's South Jakarta
District Court extended here Tuesday the city arrest status
against former president Soeharto for 60 days, as of September 7.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the district court, Lalu Mariyun said the extension
was aimed at giving judges more time and chance to verify the
state of health condition of the 79-year-old man who failed to
appear before the initial hearing on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto failed to attend the trial at that time, according to
his lawyers, due to medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mariyun also said that the move is intended to give time for
prosecutors to complete the dossiers of the former strongman.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta District Court is in charge of trying the
former ruler. It will resume the trial again in Mid-September to
hear reports from Soeharto's medical team on the health condition
of the former president who was forced to step down in May two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's city arrest firstly was imposed on August 9,
following the imposition of the house arrest on him. But Soeharto'
s house arrest status has expired on August 10, after three times
of extension.
</P>
<P>
Mariyun, who is also chief judge for Soeharto's trial, added
that his side has formed an independent medical team to reassess
the Soeharto's health condition.
</P>
<P>
The team consists of medical experts and doctors from some
reputable universities in the country such as the University of
Indonesia Jakarta, the Gadjah Mada University Yogyakarta and the
Airlangga University Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua tried to contact Soeharto's lawyers, Juan Felix
Tampubolon and Mohamad Assegaf, to get confirmation on the 79-year-
old man's city arrest status extension, but the two were not
available.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Initiative to Boost Employability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore announced Tuesday
an initiative to enhance the employability of workers and ensure
that every industry has a responsive system to upgrade skills.
</P>
<P>
The National Skills Recognition System (NSRS) will define
current competence of workers and encourage skills improvement
through byte-sized modules at training centers established by each
sector.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is targeted at some 500,000 workers with only
secondary education, those who made up about one-third of
Singapore's workforce and yet the most vulnerable to retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
The initial target is to establish 1,000 skills standards in
100 key industries and to certify 300,000 workers by 2005.
</P>
<P>
With the system, the Ministry of Manpower and the Productivity
and Standards Board aim to develop 1,000 skills standards in 100
industries.
</P>
<P>
About 166 million Singapore dollars (about 97 million U.S.
dollars ) have been set aside to implement the initiative over
five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a pilot implementation of the skills recognition
system was conducted in three sectors - hotel, marine and cleaning
- in which 27 companies attended between March last year and April
this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Establishes Venture to Commercialize Gallium Arsenide Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of
Semiconductors with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and four
other companies signed an agreement here today to commercialize
the institute's semi-insulated gallium arsenide technology.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the agreement will bring about 100 million
to 200 million U.S. dollars in export earnings for China.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Compound Crystal Technology Co., Ltd.
will be set up by the five entities with a registered capital of
100 million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars), including
technology valued at 30 million yuan (about 3.6 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The five entities, including the China Energy Conservation
Investment Corporation, plan to invest 300 to 400 million yuan (
about 36 million to 48 million U.S. dollars) in importing
production equipment and building a plant.
</P>
<P>
The planned plant, the only one of its kind in China, is
expected to produce single crystal and epitaxial wafers of semi-
insulated gallium arsenide, which are expensive materials for
integrated circuits used in optical fiber and mobile
telecommunications products, such as mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Li Jin-min, assistant director of the institute, said the five
partners plan to have the joint venture listed on the stock market
as soon as it is approved by government departments.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Introduces Electronic Fraud Detection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Finance Ministry has
commissioned a special computer program to combat invoice and
export fraud crimes, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the program, called the deterrent Early Warning
System, Ankara will be alerted immediately if a tax office which
has a definite annual turnover approves an export tax rebate of an
extraordinary sum of money on a single day.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Ankara will be automatically alerted if a businessman
who pays certain amount of money in corporation tax a year receives
an unusual sum of value-added tax rebate all of a sudden.
</P>
<P>
Fikret Sevinc, the Finance Ministry director general for
accounting in charge of the project, said that in such cases, the
computers will not only flash a red light but also issue an audible
warning.
</P>
<P>
The system was adopted after waves of invoice and export fraud
cases occurred in the country's customs offices, which had caused
the country losses of million of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Izmir, southwest Turkey last week, police launched a drive
code-named Operation Whale and foiled an export fraud, which
involved 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also uncovered during the operation was an invoice fraud
involving a total of sum of 110 trillion Turkish liras (roughly 180
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By now 52 people have been detained. The clues have led to
certain high-level bureaucrats in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Barak Rejects Israeli Army's Budget Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak had
rejected Israeli army budget demands for a real-term hike of 250
million U.S. dollars in the 2001 fiscal year, the Ha'aretz daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, now in New York for the United Nations
Millennium Summit and a critical meeting with United States
President Bill Clinton, had made the decision before he departure
Sunday night, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces argued that under an agreement with
the Finance Ministry last December, it should get back the 250
million U.S. dollars deducted from this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
However, the Treasury vehemently rejected the IDF demands,
saying the army had financially benefited from the withdrawal from
south Lebanon this May, which could amount to 375 million dollars a
year according to various estimates.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Finance Ministry officials and IDF Chief of
General Staff Shaul Mofaz, Barak shifted his earlier support for
the army's demands to the Treasury's position.
</P>
<P>
This settled the 2001 budget for defense to 36.3 billion shekels
(about 9.1 billion dollars), 195 million dollars more than this
year's budget. However, the real-term increase will only be 22.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, which will be debated in Israel's Knesset
(parliament) after it's summer recess ends late October, had not
been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be put to a parliamentary vote in December and
seems difficult to get the endorsement because the Barak government
now controls only one-third seats in the 120-member legislature.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Hails Arab Warning over Jerusalem Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Tuesday hailed a strongly-worded warning
that Arab countries will collectively rupture relations with any
country that moves its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The warning, issued Monday at the conclusion of a two-day
meeting of Arab League foreign ministers council in Cairo, is "the
most positive and strongest decision ever taken by the Arabs on the
Jerusalem issue," said the Arabic-language daily Al Ittihad.
</P>
<P>
The state-run newspaper said that such a warning coincided with
the assurance given by the ministerial meeting that Jerusalem is
the key to the Arab-Israeli peacemaking, and that peace will not be
achieved without a fair and logical solution based on international
legitimacy, even if negotiations take decades.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab stance expressed by the Arab League Ministerial
Council comes after a long silence by the Arab countries, an issue
which created some doubts about Arab public opinion towards the
stance of the Arab governments," noted the paper.
</P>
<P>
"This was especially when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
became subject to tremendous pressures at Camp David, which
compelled him to ask for support and back up from Arab and Islamic
countries," the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"From now onwards, we should employ this stance as a cornerstone
for any Arab and Islamic movement dealing with the issue of
Jerusalem and Al Aqsa mosque, where our stance should be summarized
as no peace without Jerusalem," the paper concluded.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
declared the whole of the city its "eternal and indivisible
capital," a claim the international community has never recognized.
The Arabs are insisting on Palestinian sovereignty over the eastern
sector of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Increase Mombasa Port's Handling Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
has unveiled plans for expanding Mombasa Port's handling capacity
to at least 10 million tons of cargoes by 2020, reported the East
African weekly available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the authority managing director Brown Ondego, KPA
will also increase its container handling capacity to 910,000
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) by 2020.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mombasa Port in southeastern Kenya now
handles some 8 million tons of cargoes and 248,000 TEUs annually
and it is the gateway for imports and exports of some African
inland countries such as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ondego made the remarks at a recent investment sensitization
seminar for councilors and senior officials of the Mombasa
municipal council.
</P>
<P>
He said KPA's vision is to make Mombasa a world class port in
the delivery of services and promote it as the primary gateway to
East Africa's hinterland, and restore and maintain a clean and
safe environment.
</P>
<P>
Ondego noted that his authority will continue to contact and
coordinate with port users and other organizations involved in the
port operations like shipping agencies and clearing and forwarding
firms.
</P>
<P>
"For overall improvement of all port services and for better
utilization of resources, the government has recognized there is
need to commercialize some of the port's facilities and services,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Govt Urged to Privatize Commercial Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan parliamentary
committee on
finance has proposed that the Uganda Commercial Bank Limited (UCBL)
should be sold within six months or be entrusted to a private
management firm, the New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the House Monday, the committee said
it was irregular for the Bank of Uganda (BOU) to act as the
regulator and manager of UCBL at the same time for two years.
</P>
<P>
"For a regulator to be a manager of a commercial bank for such
a time is irregular, since it will be liable in case anything goes
wrong in that commercial bank," said the report.
</P>
<P>
If UCBL is not privatized within the next six months, BOU
should enter into an independent management contract for private
management of UCBL, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members said the government should present a report
to the House on the state of the UCBL under the management of BOU.

<HEADLINE> Worsening Environment Calls for Sustained Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state and
government across the world are gathering in the U.N. headquarters
in New York this week to discuss the major challenges facing the
whole mankind in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges they will debate on is the deteriorating
environment and the strategy of sustained development.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented development over the past few hundred years
has resulted in the most brilliant civilization of today. But the
price is dear: global warming, water shortage, spreading
desertification and disappearing bio-diversity. The homeland of
mankind is losing its fertility and beauty, a bitter fruit borne
out of an unsustainable way of human activity.
</P>
<P>
In the 20th century, half of the earth's wetlands were
destroyed and an equally half of the rivers across the world were
polluted. During the last quarter of the century, the per capita
fresh water supply declined by 30 percent and desertification
ruined or threatened to ruin the life of nearly 1 billion people
in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
The global bio-diversity decreased by 30 percent in the past
three decades. In addition, more than 30 percent of the mammals,
over 10 percent of foliage species and 10 percent of plant species
are in danger of extinction. The forest is disappearing at a speed
of 16 million hectares a year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Environment Program, in its Global
Environment Outlook 2000 last September, says that as global
efforts in tackling major environment issues are outpaced by
environment deterioration, the human race is progressing on the
path of unsustained development and that the issue of environment
is one of the most severe challenges the humankind faces in the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The very fact that the Millennium Summit slated for September 6-
8 has treated the environment problem as one of the most pressing
global issues fully demonstrates the importance the entire world
has attached to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The mankind has only one earth and should not act in an
arrogant way as to violate the law of nature.
</P>
<P>
The experience drawn from environment protection has provided
us with a significant reference: respect for the nature, seeking
harmony between man and nature, changing the pattern of excessive
consumption, exploring a global economic system accommodating the
environment, concerted efforts by all countries with developed
nations bearing more responsibility in enviorenment protection.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are the major contributors to such global
issues as environment pollution and irrational and unjust
international and economic orders, the main consumers of natural
resources and the largest beneficiaries of the progress of human
civilization.
</P>
<P>
So they are liable to shoulder greater responsibility than
developing countries to meet the new challenges.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, developing countries should draw lessons from
the experience of developed countries in economic development and
strive to take a path of sustained development.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Firm Opposition to U.S. NMD Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China today voiced again its
firm opposition to the National Missile Defense (NMD) program of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question at a press conference this afternoon,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi urged the US to go along the
trend of the time, carefully listen to the just appeal of the
international community, and completely abandon its anti-missile
plans at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the U.S. development of advanced anti-missile
systems, in the form of the NMD or the Theater Missile Defense (
TMD), is designed to ensure its own absolute security and the
freedom of action, and to seek a U.S.-led mono-polar world.
</P>
<P>
He said that such an attempt will undermine the global and
regional strategic balance and stability, and get the process of
international arms control and disarmament and anti-proliferation
deadlocked, and even reverse the process and lead to a new round
of arms race in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of the matter are detrimental to all the
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have expressed concerns about the U.S. attempt
to develop anti-missile systems, and some of its allies also
expressed doubt and unrest, Sun said, adding that such an attempt
is also opposed by Americans.
</P>
<P>
"All these demonstrate that the U.S. anti-missile plans are
unpopular," the spokesman stated.

process until the middle of October to run its course, after which
he will turn inward and try to restructure his government and
reconstitute a Knesset (parliament) majority.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak has
rejected the request of Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz for a real-term
increase of a billion shekels (about 250 million U.S. dollars) in
the Israeli Defense Forces' budget for 2001.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiary of this decision will be the education
budget, including higher education.
</P>
<P>
The IDF based its request on a compromise from Barak that he
would restore the billion shekels that were cut in this year's
budget. The defense budget for 2001 will be 36.3 billion shekels
(about 9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrived in New York on
Monday to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit and also to meet with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in an effort to break the impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak has slightly relaxed his pressure campaign against Arafat.
After trying to raise expectations about this week's meeting in New
York and describing it as the decisive point in the peace process,
Barak spoke on Monday about another "few weeks," at the end of
which Israel will know whether it has a "partner of peace."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer put an
end to the monopoly of domestic telecommunications by the major
telecommunications company of Bezeq on Monday by signing
regulations that open the market to competition and allow for the
introduction of few Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Eliezer's decision follows the introduction of competition
in international phone calls, cell-phones, and multiple-channel
television broadcasting, and Ben-Eliezer said he was sure that the
public will reap the benefits of better service and lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Up to 4.6 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine year-on-year
inflation rate rose to 4.6 percent in August from 4.3 percent in
July mainly due to increased fuel price, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office (NSO) said in a press release
that the month-on-month inflation in food, beverage and tobacco
and services also increased by 0.7 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the inflation came as fuel price increase pushed
up the cost of living and the peso extended its slide against the
U.S.dollar.
</P>
<P>
The pickup in inflation "doesn't ring any alarm bells," said
Erico Claudio, a local market researcher. "We've been used to much
higher rates in the past."
</P>
<P>
According to the NSO, the inflation rate a year ago was 5.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Big Prospects for China-Africa Co-ops: Foreign Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua)-- China's foreign trade minister
Shi Guangsheng today expressed satisfaction over Sino-African
economic and trade cooperation, saying there are big prospects and
great potential for further cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the China-African Cooperative Forum scheduled in
Beijing in October, Shi reviewed the overall economic and trade
relations between China and Africa in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China has reached trade agreements with the
majority of the 53 African countries and set up mixed committees
on economic, trade, and technology cooperation with many of them.
</P>
<P>
China's trade with Africa has continued to increase in recent
years. In the early half of this year, total trade volume reached
4.7 billion US dollars, up 69.5% year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Africa remains as China's large potential market for contracted
projects. A total of 573 contracts were signed in the first half
of this year, involving 1.2 billion US dollars, up 3.6% over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have started investment projects in Africa.
By the end of this June, China had established some 480
enterprises in 47 African countries, with a joint contracted
investment of 820 million US dollars, of which 530 million is from
China.
</P>
<P>
China has also set up 62 trade projects in 12 African countries,
involving a joint investment of 117 million US dollars, of which
80 million is from China exclusively.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has set up 11 promotion centers for
investment, development and trade in Africa, which, by providing
cooperative information for both sides, have played an active role
in expanding trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Shi pointed out the Chinese government has always provided
assistance within its limits to African countries. So far, it has
helped establish 640 projects in such fields as agriculture,
herding and fishing.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform in assistance forms in 1995, China has
provided preferential loans to 33 projects in 23 African countries,
most of which have produced both positive social and economic
results.

<HEADLINE> China, Africa to Further Expand Economic &AMP; Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua)-- China's foreign trade minister
Shi Guangsheng said today that China and Africa would jointly
explore new ways to cooperate in a bid to lift bilateral economic

prior to the China-African Forum scheduled in Beijing in October.
Together with Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Shi will act as
honorary chairman of the forum, an unprecedented event in new
China's 50-year diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Shi suggested that in the future both sides should make good
use of and further improve the already existing bilateral
relations. Along with changes in trade relations, agreements
should be appropriately amended relating to economy and trade,
encouragement and protection of investment, and avoidance of dual
taxation.
</P>
<P>
With development of its economy and increase of its
comprehensive national strength, China will continue to offer
economic and technological assistance within its limits, to
African countries, including further relaxing conditions for
preferential loans, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage enterprises to carry out economic and
trade cooperation in Africa, especially setting up of projects
that promise market benefits, he added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested both sides actively expand bilateral trade. China
will encourage its enterprises to import more from Africa and
have them better informed of trade.
</P>
<P>
Shi said China will continue to encourage its enterprises to
participate in the economic development of African countries
through contracting projects, technology and management
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that they are also encouraged to practice flexible
means of payment in cooperating with local companies with a view
to reaching a trade balance.
</P>
<P>
The function of the 11 promoting centers for investment,
development and trade in Africa should be further improved so that
they can provide more information and assistance for both sides,
the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China and Africa should also increase
cooperation in international or multi-lateral organizations and
coordinate their stance as developing countries while
participating in the stipulation of economic and trade system and
principles, and join hands to establish a just and rational new
political and economic order of the world.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Finds Another Snake Imported from Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Snake-free New Zealand has
found a juvenile Australian Eastern Small-Eyed snake.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said in a
press release here Tuesday that the 30 centimeter-long snake was
found alive on Sunday when a shipping container of used vehicle
batteries from Australia was being unloaded into an industrial
building in the suburb of Petone, Wellington Region.
</P>
<P>
The snake, common to the East Coast of Australia, would have
been able to survive in New Zealand conditions, it said.
</P>
<P>
The snake was killed and the area where it was found is being
searched as a precautionary matter, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The snake find comes after New Zealand Minister for Biosecurity
Marian Hobbs announced in April an increased level of inspection
on cargo coming from "high risk" countries. The minister's
announcement followed the unprecedented discovery of three snakes
over a period of three weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso breached
the crucial 45.50:1 support level against the U.S. dollar early
Tuesday as sentiment on the peso remained low.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.489, weaker to Monday's close of 45.300.
</P>
<P>
It opened at 45.400, immediately hitting a low of 45.595 in
early trade.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said banks held onto their dollars on expectation the
peso would weaken further due to the lingering worries over the
budget deficit and the insurgency problem in Mindanao.

<P>
"It's sentiment driven, you can really tell the market is
afraid to short sell the dollar," said a trader at a local bank.
</P>

Value of trade turnover reached 112 million dollars in mid-
trade.

<HEADLINE> China-Africa Economic &AMP; Trade Ties Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua)-- China's foreign trade minister
Shi Guangsheng today voiced strong confidence about China's
economic and trade ties with Africa, noting that reinforcing
cooperation is in the common interest of both sides.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the China-African Forum, an unprecedented
ministerial-level meeting hosted by China, Shi said new progress
will certainly be achieved, based on the principle of equality and
mutual trust, diversity, actual results and common development.
</P>
<P>
The forum, scheduled for October in Beijing, will attract
foreign ministers and foreign trade ministers from over 40 African
countries, and many government leaders are expected to attend the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As one of the two honorary chairmen of the forum, Shi believed
that China, as the world's largest developing country, and Africa,
as the continent housing the largest number of developing
countries, share common interest in the process of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the new century when the world is undergoing
profound political and economic changes, to increase economic and
trade links between China and Africa would help them both face up
to the challenge of economic globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, participants from China and Africa will
review cooperation in the past decades, jointly explore
cooperative principles in the new century, and define specific
direction for cooperation in all fields including trade,
investment, assistance, medical and sanitation, and education.
</P>
<P>
Shi expressed the conviction that the forum would strongly
consolidate the existing Sino-African friendship, stimulate south-
south cooperation, and push forward for a just and rational
political and economic order of the world.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Exports Hit Record High In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka recorded in July
this year the highest-ever export earnings for a single month
during the past five years, reaching 570 million U.S. dollars, the
Central Bank said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exports "recorded an impressive growth of 35 percent
compared with July 1999," said the bank in a statement. The higher
growth in exports in July resulted in a trade surplus of 13
million dollars, the first trade surplus since September 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the export sector continued to
improve during the first seven months of 2000, maintaining the
growth momentum achieved in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from January to July 2000 increased by 22
percent, reflecting the continued growth in textiles and garments,
rubber-based products, fish products, gems, diamonds, jewelry and
tea.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure on imports increased by 18 percent to 557 million
dollars, reflecting a growth in intermediate and investment goods.
</P>
<P>
All major categories of imports grew in July 2000. However,
food imports declined by 16 percent due to lower imports of rice,
flour, sugar, wheat and milk.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Mori Fail to Make Breakthrough in Territorial Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori failed to
make substantive progress on concluding a peace treaty after
ending their summit in Tokyo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, in a statement issued shortly after their
third round of talks Tuesday morning, confirmed negotiations on
the treaty will continue.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Mori "agreed to continue negotiations on concluding a
peace treaty while resolving" a territorial dispute blocking the
pact, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, Putin said that a 1997
agreement committing the two countries to strive to sign a peace
treaty by the end of this year is only a target, and not a promise.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is not the deadline" but each other's
goodwill, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The statement says the two leaders will continue talks on the
treaty based on previous agreements, including those in 1993 and
1998 committing them to solve the territorial row on the basis of
historical and legal facts, and accelerate peace treaty
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The statement also calls for new guidelines for accelerating
work by a joint committee on the peace treaty headed by the two
countries' foreign ministers, and a joint working-level panel on
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The decades-old territorial dispute has prevented Japan and
Russia, which established diplomatic ties in 1956, from signing a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The two countries remain far apart over a string of Russian-
held islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Japan has called for the return of the islands, which were
seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II, but Russia has
rejected the calls.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's talks, Mori and Putin also issued 15 other
documents on bilateral cooperation, including a new program for
boosting economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who is in Japan on a three-day official visit, will
leave Tokyo later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up Disaster Insurance Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
approved plans to set up a fund to insure crops against damage
caused by natural disasters, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund will cover every area of the country that grows rice,
both regular and off-season, and corn for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The government will contribute 59 baht (1.47 U.S. dollars) per
rai (0.16 hectares) to the fund for regular rice crops, 30 baht (0.
75 dollars) per rai for off-season crops and 72 baht (1.8 dollars)
per rai for corn.
</P>
<P>
The maximum insurance coverage is 1,000 baht (25 dollars) per
rai for regular rice crops, 1,500 baht (37.5 dollars) per rai for
off-season rice crops and 1,300 baht (32.5 dollars) per rai for
corn crops.
</P>
<P>
The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives will
manage the fund and the Commerce Ministry's Insurance Department
will help find insurance companies to insure the crops.
</P>
<P>
The government allocation to the fund is expected to be 1
billion baht (25 million dollars) a year, or 50 percent of the
total fund, with 310 million baht (7.75 million dollars) as a
contingency reserve. The participating farmers will contribute the
remaining amount.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government expects that half of the country's total
agricultural land will be covered by the scheme and plans to
extend the scheme to other crops once it is established.

<HEADLINE> Tension Reappears Along Thai-Lao Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Tension reappeared along the
Thai-Lao border since Lao militia was deployed on three yet-to-be-
demarcated islets in the Mekong River off the Chiang Saen district,
Chiang Rai Province, 785 kilometers north of Bangkok, The Bangkok
Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Rai Governor Samrerng Boonyopakorn was quoted as saying
that since last week, about 30 Lao militiamen from Bo Keo Province
in the Lao side have been deployed on the three islets of Koh Mano
1, Koh Mano 2 and Koh Pha Kham in the border river of Mekong.
</P>
<P>
Koh Mano 1 and 2 are about 100 meters from the Thai bank of the
river and Koh Pha Kham 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the Lao unit has prevented some 60 Thai
families who have long planted maize there from entering the
islets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials had received a letter from Laos saying Thai
villagers could harvest crops on the islets until September 15.
</P>
<P>
To ease the tension, Thailand has invited Lao provincial
governors to Friday's meeting of the Thai-Lao border committee to
discuss the issue, the English language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have been enhanced along the border since
July 3,when more than 100 Lao rebels attacked a Lao customs
checkpoint across the Sirindhorn district in the Thai border
province of Ubon Rachathani, 629 kilometers northeast of Bangkok.

CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Fog and smoke blocked the
security experts investigating the crash of a light plane in
Queensland, northeast Australia.
</P>
<P>
A Queensland police spokesman was quoted by the Australian

fog and smoke from a bushfire ignited by the crash.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine light plane with seven gold miners and one
pilot on board crashed Tuesday morning in a remote area in
Queensland.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that all the eight on board may have died in
the crash which took place shortly after the plane took off from
Perth last night when the cabin depressurized. The plane had flown
on automatic pilot for four hours, covering almost 3,000
kilometers across three states before the crash.

1,449 candidates trying to win over voters.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that of the total number of candidates 3,883
represent 29 political parties while the rest will contest as
independent groups. On Monday alone a total of 417 nomination
lists were submitted to contest the 22 electoral districts. The
nominations started on August 28 and concluded by noon on
September 4.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of candidates are to contest in the Colombo,
Kurunegala, Trincomalee and Wanni districts.
</P>
<P>
Only four political parties -- the main opposition United
National Party (UNP), the leftist JVP or Peoples' Revolutionary
Front, Puravesi Peramuna (Citizen's Front) and the Sinhala
Urumaya (Heritage) -- will fight in all the 22 electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Peoples' Alliance has handed in nominations for all
the electoral districts except Jaffna. The most number of
independent candidates are for the Nuwara Eliya district. The
largest number of candidates, or 575 in all, are for the Colombo
district from 20 political parties and five independent groups.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 million voters will go to the polls on October 10 to
elect their representatives according to the proportional
representation system. Political parties on the national list will
appoint 29 legislators who will not contest any electorate. All
contesting political parties and independent groups also handed
over their national lists with each containing 29 names.
</P>
<P>
Although police have strengthened security in the run-up to the
polls, 32 incidents of election-related violence have been
reported so far since the dissolution of the parliament on August
18. In the eastern Digamadulla electoral district two UNP
supporters were gunned down in eastern Sri Lanka on Monday and

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first public speech of the former lifetime senator
since August 8 when the Chilean Supreme Court revoked his
parliamentary immunity and thus paved the way for the former
leader to stand trial on 170 charges against him.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, read by his granddaughter Maria Jose Martinez in
his house at Dehesa, the retired general said he cherished the
hope that the disagreement and the pain of yesterday will be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
The former paramount leader of the South American country said
that unity is necessary for the next generation because they need
a generous attitude to settle the previous conflict and contribute
to peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who accompanied his granddaughter in her reading,
did not answer any question of reporters. His lawyer Fernando
Barros told reporters that by issuing the letter, Pinochet wants
to call for respect of the pain suffered by numerous Chileans in
the past.
</P>

According to official statistics, more than 3,000 people died

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia Issue 15 Documents on Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia issued 15
documents on agreements for expanding bilateral cooperation
Tuesday, the final day of Russian President Vladimir Putin's three-
day official visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Prominent among the documents are a joint statement on
cooperation on international issues, a new program on economic
cooperation, and an agreement for promoting joint economic
activities on four disputed Russian-held islands off Japan's
northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
In the statement on international issues signed by Putin and
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, the Russian president
committed his country to supporting Japan's bid for permanent
membership of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement also spelled out cooperation on Asia-Pacific, as
well as global issues including conflict prevention, disarmament
and nuclear nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Mori called for further dialogue between South Korea
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to ease
tension, while welcoming the first-ever inter-Korean summit held
in June.
</P>
<P>
On the joint economic activities on the disputed islands, the
two leaders agreed to accelerate expert-level talks toward
realizing a marine farm for sea urchins and shellfish.
</P>
<P>
The new program also reiterated Japan's support for Russia's
bid to join the World Trade Organization and offers technical
assistance to that end.
</P>
<P>
The documents are aimed at improving the environment for Tokyo
and Moscow to proceed with negotiations on their 1997 agreement
that calls on both sides to strive toward resolving their long-
standing territorial dispute and signing a peace treaty by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
During talks on Monday and Tuesday, Putin and Mori failed to
narrow their differences over the territorial row which concerns
the islands of Etorofu, Kunashiri and Shikotan, and the Habomai
islets.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Project to Ease Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a project
to divert water from the Yellow River to Tianjin in north China to
ease the city's acute water shortage, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was scheduled to be finished in early
November, will have the capacity to supply the city with 40
billion cubic meters of water per annum, a water resources
official surnamed Liu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Water from the Yellow River will travel 440 kilometers from the
Weishan Gate of Donge County in east China's Shandong Province, to
reach Tianjin's Qiuxuan Gate, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth time that Tianjin has used water from the
Yellow River since the first diverting in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has suffered water shortage since 1997, when severe
droughts hit the city, and the daily water supply has dropped to
less than 1.7 million cubic meters from more than two million
cubic meters, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin also resorted to other channels to ease its water
tension. Water from Hebei Province's Panjiakou Reservoir, more
than 300 kilometers northeast to Tianjin, was diverted into the
city on August 27.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation to Exceed 7 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
estimated that the country's inflation will exceed the 7-percent
level for 2000 instead of the assumed target of 5-7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The government's plan to reduce the fuel subsidy in October
2000 plus the holidays in December will likely set the inflation
higher than 7 percent," The Indonesian Observer daily Tuesday
quoted Finance Minister Prijadi Prapto Suhardjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the inflation rate from January to August 2000 reached
4.71 percent while the inflation rate in August was recorded at 0.
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the local currency's exchange rate, the newly-appointed
minister said that although the rupiah managed to strengthen to
the 8,200-8,300 per U.S. dollar level at the end of August, it is
still difficult to predict movements in the national currency.
</P>
<P>
This is because fluctuations in the rupiah is more affected by
non-economic factors, such as the vulnerable socio-political and
security stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Prijadi also projected a deficit of between 3.5 and 3.9 percent
of the gross domestic product in the 2000 budget, compared with
the 4.8 percent targeted in the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Prijadi, the expected improvement was due to
higher crude oil prices and lower government expenses.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 fiscal year covers a truncated April to end-December
period because Indonesia is aligning its fiscal year with the
calendar year from the previous April-March system.

JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rescuers continued
to search for survivors of a ship which carried 43 passengers and

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Attack Oil Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Three oil pipelines in Colombia,
which export more than 200,000 barrels of oil daily, are out of
service due to guerrilla sabotage, said the state-owned oil
company Ecopetrol.
</P>
<P>
The most seriously affected pipeline, the Cano Limon-Covel
pipeline, which once pumped 105,000 barrels of oil daily, has
operated only 80 hours since July 23 because of 24 dynamite
attacks by the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
Ecopetrol said it had to stop foreign sales of oil produced in
the Cano Limon-Covel field, which is located on the border with
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The municipalities in the oil-producing zone have experienced
more than 126 million dollars in losses as a direct result of the
sabotage, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, the second largest guerrilla group in Colombia, has
been conducting attacks against the 780-kilometer Cano Limon-
Covenas pipeline since 1986 in an effort to exert pressure against
foreign oil companies and force them to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
While FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla army in Colombia,
attacks the pipelines sporadically as part of its ongoing military
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Oil is the main product of the Colombian economy. Export income
for this year was forecast at nearly 5 billion dollars, a goal
that probably will not be met due to guerrilla sabotage.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Presidential Campaign Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. presidential
campaign entered a pivotal stage as Republican and Democratic
nominees kicked off their fall campaign on Labor Day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate, Texas Governor George W.
Bush, started his fall campaign with a week-long tour through
swing states. His trip will take him to nine cities in Illinois,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio, the states
that have 107 electoral votes up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
His multi-state campaign will focus on medicare, economy, taxes,
defense and social security, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
Bush and his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
arrived in a Chicago suburb early Monday to take part in the Labor
Day parade.
</P>
<P>
"As we come down to the stretch, we're ready for the contest.
We feel great about our chances," Bush said during a rally in
Naperville, Illinois.
</P>
<P>
"The surplus doesn't exist because of the ingenuity and hard
work of the federal government. The surplus exists because of the
ingenuity and hard work of the American working people," he said.
</P>
<P>
While Bush touted his 10-year, 1.3 trillion dollar tax-cut plan
in Illinois Monday, his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore
continued his 27-hour non-stop campaign blitz designed to reach
out to core Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
Gore, in his speech to steelworkers in Pittsburgh Monday,
renewed his pledge to raise the minimum wage, build more public
schools, secure passage of a patients' bill of rights, and provide
prescription drug coverage for seniors.
</P>
<P>
"What it all comes down to is whether or not we're going to
fight for those who most need the help," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore's marathon campaign trip around Labor Day includes a
meeting with construction workers in Pennsylvania, exchange of
greetings with autoworkers and hospital employees in Michigan, a
breakfast with firefighters in Florida, and a rally at an outdoor
motor speedway in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Labor Day is seen as the traditional start of the fall campaign
as many Americans will start to pay attention to the presidential
race after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Polls show Bush and Gore neck-and-neck in most of the states,
therefore millions of independent voters who tend to swing between
the two major parties will probably decide the election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this year's election might be the closest contest
in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush and Gore have not yet agreed on the timetable and
venues of the presidential debates before the November 7 election.
</P>
<P>
Gore's campaign rejected Bush's offer on Sunday to participate
in three presidential debates, including one on September 12
during a special prime-time edition of NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Bush also offered to hold a debate on October 3 in Los Angeles
on CNN's "Larry King Live" and another one on October 17 at
Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Gore, instead, insisted that Bush should first accept the three
90-minute debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential
Debates.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about what is best for George W. Bush or what is
best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people,"
said Gore Monday. He has already accepted the commission's offers
for three 90-minute debates.
</P>
<P>
Gore maintains that the three events proposed by the commission
will reach the widest audience, while what Bush has proposed will
not.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Closure of Polluting Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to shut
down polluting small coal mines, cement plants, oil refineries,
steel factories and thermal power plants despite increasing demand
for such products in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission ordered that
enterprises which failed to meet workplace safety requirements and
contaminated the environment would be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Banks will be encouraged not to grant loans to redundant
projects, or projects without dated production capacities,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Administrative means, including power cuts and revoking
operation licenses and permits, will also be employed to ensure
the success of the shut-down drive, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem of product stockpiles and a downturn in
economic efficiency, China has closed down 36,000 illegal and
badly sited coal mines by the end of June this year. It has also
closed down 5,600 oil refineries in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has reaffirmed the order to shut down
ecologically unsound businesses because some localities allowed
them to restart production due to market demand.

<HEADLINE> Panels to Oversee Forest Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ten supervisory groups, headed
by directors of the State Forestry Administration (SFA), have been
sent all over China to oversee nearly 50 major cases of illegal
logging, woodland abuse and poaching of endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, these cases are among the 500,
000 similar cases reported throughout China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is a major step by the administration to conform
with the central government's strategy of achieving sustainable
development of China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
The administration blamed local officials and authorities, who
are often tempted by short-term economic gains from illegal timber
businesses, for a large number of forest-related problems, the
English-language newspaper claimed.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted SFA deputy director Ma Fu as saying that
the mature forests in state-owned zones have been all but
destroyed in recent years while the overall quality of the country
's forests kept declining.
</P>
<P>
From 1994-1998, most provinces exceeded their logging quotas,
with more than six million cubic meters of timber over-logged in
five major forest-growing provinces, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Two million hectares of forest land are damaged each year,
according to Ma Fu.
</P>
<P>
The cases that SFA investigates this time include poaching of
Tibetan antelope and other endangered animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Four rebels were killed in
Aceh, Indonesia, on Sunday, just one day after the government and
Free Aceh Movement (GAM) extended their three-month cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer Tuesday quoted local police chief
Lieutenant Colonel Endang Emiqail Bagus as saying three rebels
were killed on Sunday during a 30-minute gunbattle in the north of
the province.
</P>
<P>
He said the fight took place after a failed ambush attempt
against a convoy of police trucks passing through Pidie's Mutiara
subdistrict. Police had seized two automatic rifles, a handgun and
more than 300 bullets from the victims.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a rebel was shot dead when allegedly
planting bombs in Deah Pangwa village in Pidie district.
</P>
<P>
The death brought to 75 the number of people killed in Aceh
since the original three-month truce went into effect on June 2.
Each side has blamed the other for the bloodshed while pledging to
maintain support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed last Saturday to extend the Joint
Understanding on Humanitarian Pause for one month while preparing
for a new round of peace talks in mid-September in Geneva,
Switzerland, where the initial deal was struck.

Li Tieying, also president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, and his delegation were warmly welcomed by Pastrana, who
said that the visit will not only strengthen and lead to more
exchanges and cooperation between the two ruling parties in
Colombia and China, but also help to promote bilateral cooperation
in the fields of politics, economics and trade, culture,
technology and science.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Pastrana recalled his visit to China in
May 2000, saying that the brief trip was of great significance.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled the visit to China by his late father, former
Colombian President Misael Pastrana Borrero in 1974, when he had
the chance to meet with the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who
made such a deep impression, that when Pastrana Borrero returned
to Colombia he wrote two books about that experience.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying expressed his appreciation to Colombia for its
support of the One-China policy and China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past 20 years, the value of bilateral
trade between the two countries has increased twenty-fold, and
that during the first half of this year, Colombian exports to
China have increased 170 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived in Bogota on September 1,
following a visit to Santiago. It finished its four-day visit to
Colombia on Monday, and will continue its trip to Havana on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A light plane crashed early
Tuesday morning in Queensland in the northeast of Australia.
</P>
<P>
All eight people on board were believed to have been killed,
the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane ignited on impact and caused a bushfire in a remote
area.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine prop plane, chartered by one of Australia's
largest gold producers, was flying to the West Australian Gold
Fields town of Leonora from Perth but lost radio contact shortly
after its takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Flight recorders were not required on the light plane so
investigators would have to solve the mystery of what happened
after the plane took off with other information.

<HEADLINE> Graham Predicts Chaos over Transfer Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur manager
George Graham predicted chaos on Monday while officials of soccer'
s world governing body FIFA wait to find out if the transfer
system is to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission wants to abolish transfer fees and
binding contracts, which they think are restrictive.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter called last week for transfer fees
to be abolished for players aged over 24, but for compensation
payments to be made for players aged 18 to 24.
</P>
<P>
Graham had paid a club record 11 million pounds (16.09 million
U.S dollars) for 26-year-old Ukrainian star Sergei Rebrov. He
felt the current situation unacceptable. "No-one knows what route
FIFA and UEFA will go down but this situation cannot be good for
the game -- it will leave it in chaos," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of speculation about what will happen but one
thing is for sure -- the days of spending vast sums of money on
transfers have gone now. I can't see any more big transfers
taking place while there is all this uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"Some clubs in European competition might be prepared to take
a chance on four million or five million pound (5.8 or 8.6 million
U.S. dollars) players to strengthen their squads but that is
hardly big money nowadays. But everyone else will be sitting
tight to see what happens."

<HEADLINE> Most Populous Province Becoming Aging Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- People above the age of 60
make 10.34 percent of China's most populous province of Henan,
indicating the province is entering the aging society.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest population sampling survey done by the
province, some 960,000 people in the hinterland province are over
the age of 60. And people above the age of 80 account for 1.71
percent of the 93 million people in the province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junzhe, an expert on population, was shocked by the fast
growth of the aged population in the province, saying that in the
future there would be more senior citizens than young people in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Henan will become the home to the most numerous aged people in
China around the year 2040 when one out of every four to five
people will be 60 or above, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the survey team suggested that the provincial
government work out policies as soon as possible to deal with the
issue of the elderly such as pension system, basic medicare, and a
social welfare system.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the first municipality in China which has entered
the aging society. Fourteen municipalities and provinces,
including Beijing, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, have also
joined the rank of aging society, which normally means people aged
above 60 make up more than 10 percent of the whole population.

KUWAIT CITY, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-

<P>
African diplomatic sources based in Saudi Arabia said the Saudi-
Ethiopian talks, which was held in the western Saudi city of
Jeddah, tackled the development of the situation between Ethiopia
and Eritrea since the two African neighbors signed a cease-fire
agreement last June. Ethiopian and Eritrea had fought a two-year
border war.

King Fahd, whose country was leading calls for a peaceful
solution to the problems between Eritrea and Ethiopia, also
discussed with the Ethiopian president possible means of enhancing
stability in the African region, said the Saudi Press Agency

<HEADLINE> Diamond Countries to Adopt Certification System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials of diamond
producing countries,
</P>
<P>
investigating how to stop the sale of diamonds from war zones,
will propose a system of international certification, a Namibian
official said Tuesday after a meeting on "conflict diamonds".
</P>
<P>
Another proposal, to etch legitimate diamonds with laser
markings, was simply too complex and expensive, said Kennedy
Hamutenya, Namibia's director of mines and acting diamond
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to come up with a simple process that can be
easily implemented by all countries concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamutenya was speaking ahead of a conference in South Africa
later this month where ministers from diamond-producing countries
are expected to formally adopt measures to outlaw conflict
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The proposals had been debated at meetings in South Africa,
Angola and London over the past four months, Hamutenya said.
</P>
<P>
 He said these measures would then be forwarded to the
United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the European Union
and other international organizations for ratification.
</P>
<P>
Poverty in diamond-producing countries in Africa must also be
addressed urgently, Hamutenya said.
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of Africa just being the source of rough
diamonds, "he said, calling for more cutting and polishing plants
to be established in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Although African countries mine the bulk of the world's rough
diamonds, most of the profit from the gems is made in European and
Asian cutting and trading centers, he said.

<P>
The reports quoted military sources as saying that the rebels
or the West Side Boys had seized the village of Mgbini from pro-
government militia on Saturday, killing three militiamen.
</P>
<P>
"They are now in control of the area, trying to spread their
position along the Masiaka/Mile 91 highway," Sierra Leone Army
spokesman Major John Milton said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the West Side Boys, meanwhile, spent a second day
with the hostage-takers at their Occra Hills base 50 kilometers
from Freetown, trying to persuade them to free the six British
soldiers and a Sierra Leonean soldier seized with them.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys seized 11 British soldiers, who had been
training a new Sierra Leone Army, on August 25. They freed five of
them on August 30 after an earlier visit by the relatives.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys, estimated to have a few hundred members,
are an offshoot of forces loyal to the junta that ruled from May
1997 to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the rebels placed demands including the release of
their supporters and family, recognition by the Sierra Leone
government and the establishment of an interim government. The
Sierra Leone Government has rejected their demands.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Pulls Out of Millennium Summit in Protest Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Hyong Chol,
ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to
the United Nations, said Tuesday that his country had decided to
pull out of the Millennium Summit in protest against the "rude and
provocative treatment" by the U.S. to its delegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Ambassador Li Hyong Chol said Kim Yong-
nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly
of the DPRK, and his entourage who were in transit in Frankfurt
airport on their way to the Millennium Summit were compelled to
cancel their participation in the summit and return home due to
the unjust obstructive maneuvers of the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that on September 4, the president and his
entourage were just about to go on board American Airline flight
AA 172 bound for New York after passing through all departure
procedures in accordance with the recognized regulations at
Frankfurt airport in Germany.
</P>
<P>
At that time, U.S. air security officials turned up, opened
suitcases and handbags of each member of the presidential
entourage, forced them to take off clothes and shoes and
thoroughly searched even the sensitive part of the body, and they
attempted to impose such rude search even on the president, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"This rude and provocative act of the U.S. done to the
president of the Presidium representing the DPRK, a dignified
member state of the U.N., constitutes grave encroachment on the
sovereignty of a sovereign state, violation of and insult to the
human rights and flagrant challenge to the exercise of the rights
of the U.N. member state conforming to the U.N. Charter and to the
U.N. itself as well as to the summit organized by it," the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also an arrogant and rude act ignoring the international
laws and practices," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly denounce this unjust act of the U.S. as an
outrageous violation of and challenge to the U.N. Charter and to
the first ever Millennium Summit held in the history of the U.N.,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side should make an official apology for its act
committed against the president of the Presidium and take full
responsibility for all consequences resulting therefrom," the
ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's Army Controls Borders With Brazil to Curb Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's Army was deployed
at the border area with Brazil to control cattle movements and
prevent foot-and-mouth disease advancing toward Uruguay, National
Defense Minister Luis Brezzo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior official pointed out that army units control land
borders and navy units over Merin Lagoon and Uruguay River, in
order to stop cattle coming from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay was declared the country free of foot-and-mouth disease
without vaccination six years ago. "To keep this title is very
important for Uruguay," Brezzo added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Livestock Minister Gonzalo Gonzalez said
Tuesday that Uruguay has formally requested an inspection of
technicians of International Organization of Epizootics to prove
that Uruguay is free from this illness.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives Raise Election Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's main opposition
Conservative Party Tuesday increased the pace of preparations for
the next election with the publication of a draft manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The document, named "Believing in Britain," has been heralded
by Tory leader William Hague as containing the "key elements of a
bold program for the next Conservative government."
</P>
<P>
The program is -- for the first time -- to be voted on by the
whole membership of the Tory party before its October annual party
conference.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to call an early
general election next year, though he does not have to call one
until May 2002.
</P>
<P>
Launching "Believing in Britain," which brings together more
than 100 of the party's policies including a number of new ones,
Hague said he was determined to make Britain "the best place in
the world to do business and the best place in the world to live
and one of the most admired and influential countries in the world.
"
</P>
<P>
Defending his plans, Hague said millions of pounds could be
saved through cutting waste and driving up efficiency, and
reducing the size of Whitehall bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Europe, Hague committed the next Conservative
government to enshrining in law which powers the UK holds in
reserve against future encroachments by the European Commission or
the European courts.
</P>
<P>
He again underlined his party's determination to keep the pound
in the medium term, saying a Tory government would safeguard
sterling for at least the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Extraordinarily, the Conservatives will be the only major
party fighting the next election determined to stop the surrender
of our most precious right as a country -- the right to govern
ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By a combination of deliberate act and complacent failure to
act, within a decade, perhaps less, many of the things that make
our country a country, that make our nation a nation, that make
Britain 'Britain,' could have disappeared," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Turning to perhaps the most radical innovation of the document,
Hague detailed his party's plan to end state funding for
universities and instead to set them up with endowments.
</P>
<P>
He said that future auctions of assets like the recent third
generation of mobile phone licenses would be used to set up
endowment funds for universities, freeing them, he said, from
government control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he repeated Tory plans to reduce the role of local
authorities in education and place more money directly in the
hands of individual schools.
</P>
<P>
Hague also said the document represented "a new Conservative
social agenda of devolving power to local people and local
institutions and local communities [which] shows that we have
listened and learnt, and that we trust the instincts of the
British people."
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also sets out plans to ensure Britain would
maintain its strong early position in the new information and
technology economy.
</P>
<P>
Believing in Britain promises that a future Tory government
would be "ruthless" about combating regulation
</P>
<P>
Hague also pledged to "reform the welfare state to strengthen
family life and personal responsibility" and promised new pension
arrangements for those young people who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
And on health, the Tory leader promised to take politicians out
of the day-to-day management of the National Health Service (NHS).
</P>
<P>
The intensification of campaigning by the Conservatives comes
as the Liberal Democrats prepare to release a similar mini-
manifesto Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Police Seize 156 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian police have seized 156
kilograms of heroin for the past few days in the country's major
western city of Vancouver and eastern city of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Of the 248 million Canadian dollars (about 168 million U.S.
dollars) worth of drug hauls, 99 kilograms were captured in
Vancouver Saturday and 57 kilograms in Toronto Thursday, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a total of 11 suspects in the two separate drug
busts.
</P>
<P>
The heroin seizure was held as one of the largest in Canadian
history and a breakthrough leading to the drug Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
"The drug seizure is significant not only because of the
quantity of heroin seized, but because some of people arrested are
the alleged leaders of this major international smuggling
operation," said Vancouver RCMP Inspector Terry Town.
</P>
<P>
"There are only a few groups in the world that can orchestrate
this type of massive drug movement and we have obliterated this
one," the inspector added, declaring "the only enforcement step
higher would take us into the production fields of the Golden
Triangle."
</P>
<P>
Vancouver police said they had conducted a 20-month
investigation before making the drug bust.

<HEADLINE> Rare Kind of Dolphins Appear in Greece's Aegean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A rare kink of dolphins that
had disappeared 100 years ago from the Mediterranean had been
discovered in the northern part of Greece's Aegean Sea this year.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin, known as "Fokena or Falianos," was 1.8 meters
long, and two such dolphins appeared in the Sea of Thrace near the
coasts of Alexandroupolis in February and March this year, the
Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Chairman of the Greek Society for the
Protection of Dolphins and Whales Emilia Drouga as saying that the
dolphins still lived in the Black Sea and they moved south
together with other kinds of fish due to the pollution in the
region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Opens Debate on PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate opened a
debate Tuesday on a bill to grant permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) status to China after a summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters that the
debate is likely to last for two weeks and he expected a final
vote on the trade bill by September 15.
</P>
<P>
"We hope next week that we will be able to move to cloture, if
necessary, and to the conclusion of the bill by the end of the
week," he said. "That, again, will depend on how the Senate is
doing and what has been offered in terms of amendments."
</P>
<P>
Lott said he could not say for sure whether or not any
amendments will be added to the PNTR bill.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, who framed a bill that could
lead to sanctions against China if weapons proliferation was
confirmed, has threatened to propose the legislation as an
amendment to PNTR if Democrats refuse to vote on his legislation.
</P>
<P>
An amended bill has to be returned to the contentious House for
a new round of vote, leaving little chance for its passage before
Congress breaks for November's presidential and Congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
"If amendments are added, it could well be dead for this year,"
warned Montana Democratic Senator Max Baucus, a supporter of the
China trade pact.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted 237-197 in May to approve
the bill granting PNTR status to China so that the annual debates
on normal trade relations with the country could come to an end.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has made passage of the PNTR bill his
top legislative priority for his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have warned that a further delay in
Senate passage of the PNTR bill could have serious implications
for U.S. foreign and security policy and would cost U.S.
businesses billions of dollars in loss.

A wave of profit-taking in technology, media and telecoms
shares put an abrupt end to London market's six-session winning
streak on the session.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE index of leading shares ended 45.6 points or 0.7
percent down at 6752.5, above the 6737.6 low on the day but well
down from a midsession probe up to 6809.5.

The falls were exacerbated by a weak opening on US markets and
concerns over whether the Bank of England's Monetary Policy

In Frankfurt the Xetra Dax index fell 0.7 percent, or 50.49

<HEADLINE> Long-Term House Prices in UK Will Rise, Says TW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- UK house prices will continue
to rise in the long term despite the current slowing down of the
market, predicted Talor Woodrow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While UK house prices were softening in some areas,
particularly in the southeast, the market remains strong in other
parts of the country, said the property developer.
</P>
<P>
The company said profits before tax in the last six months rose
to 89.4 million pounds, from 49.7 million pounds at the same point
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, figures from both the UK's biggest mortgage lender
Halifax and the biggest building society Nationwide show house
prices coming off the boil.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax said house prices went up 0.5 percent in August but
that the annual rate at which they are rising fell for the fourth
month in a row.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the market has steadied after four price falls
in the past five months, the mortgage lender added.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Chip Sales Reach Record High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide semiconductor
sales rose 50 percent to a record of 17.3 billion U.S. dollars in
July from a year ago, an American industry group reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales were strong in all geographical regions due to
growth in demand for Internet infrastructure and wireless
communications, according to the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA). Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 57
percent. The European market was up 47 percent, while the U.S.,
Canada and Latin America rose a combined 46 percent. Japan sales
climbed 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Intel and other chip makers have struggled this year to meet
demand for the chips that power everything from personal computers
to mobile phones, as consumers buy more devices to connect to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, worldwide chip sales reached 11.5 billion U.S.
dollars. The SIA predicts this year's sales will climb 31 percent
from last year.

NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial

stocks Tuesday, but the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index
fell sharply.
</P>

At the close of session, the Dow index rose 21.83 at 11,260.61
points, extending its gain of 23.68 last Friday. The market was
closed Monday for the labor Day Holiday.

In the retailer sector, stocks of Home Depot and Wal-Mart

<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met with Fidel Castro, president of the Council of State of
Cuba, here Tuesday and the two leaders exchanged views over the
bilateral relations and world issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang who arrived here Monday to attend the Millennium Summit
of the United Nations, spoke highly of the great achievements Cuba
has made in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Castro, who is also president of the Council of Ministers of
Cuba, briefed Jiang on the domestic situation of Cuba. He said
that the Cuban people have since this year conducted a very
arduous struggle against the kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez by some
people in the United States and have won the final victory.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that Cuba is now continuing its struggle against
the unfair treatment long imposed by the United States towards
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese people were very concerned about
Elian's case and shared the pleasure enjoyed by the Cuban people
when Elian was back home.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that in the face of the power
politics of the northern neighbor, the Cuban government and people,
through their hard work, have taken the road of restoration and
development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his admiration for the achievements and victory
won by the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang stressed that the resolution of the
Taiwan issue and the realization of China's reunification are
irresistible, and "peaceful reunification, one country two systems
" is China's fundamental policy in the resolution of the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese people have great sincerity in
realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and also
have the resolve and necessary preparations for foiling any
schemes to split the motherland and safeguarding the sovereignty
and the integrity of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Castro expressed his belief that China will definitely realize
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on the economic and trade
cooperation between the two nations.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Paratroopers to Senegal as S.Leone "Contingency" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday sent
paratroopers to West Africa as efforts continued to free six
British soldiers kidnapped by rebel groups in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A British Defense Ministry spokesman said that 100
paratroopers were being sent to Dakar, Senegal, to position them
in the region should they be needed.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sensible contingency to keep our options open," a
Reuters report quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman denied that this military action was imminent
to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue remains the most likely way that we are going to
resolve this situation, and military action is not imminent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A rebel group in Sierra Leone, known as the West Side Boys,
seized 11 British soldiers as hostages late last month. But five
of the Britons were freed last week.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were captured on a mission near Freetown, the
capital city of the Western African nation.
</P>
<P>
In the latest attempt to negotiate the freedom of the hostages,
Britain offered food and medicine to the West Side Boys' jungle
camp.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, a former British colony, has been in military
chaos in recent years. Britain sent in 1,000 troops in May to help
the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone to maintain
peace. There are now nearly 400 British soldiers still in Sierra
Leone to help training a new Sierra Leone government army.

<HEADLINE> Bush Announces Prescription Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush Tuesday unveiled a 158 billion dollar
plan to provide prescription drug benefit and to improve the
health care program for elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We will honor our fathers and our mothers by providing quality
health insurance for every senior," Texas Governor Bush said in
his speech at a senior center in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
"For eight years the current administration has had this
opportunity and has squandered it," Bush added.
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, a total of 48 billion dollars will be provided
to states over four years to cover the full costs of a
prescription drug program for seniors with incomes below 11,300
dollars for individuals and 15,200 dollars for a couple.
</P>
<P>
His plan would also cover part of the costs of medicines for
individual seniors with incomes up to 14,600 dollars and couples
earning up to 19,700 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plan would pay at least one-fourth of the cost of
prescription drug coverage, whether seniors choose the optional
new Medicare benefit Bush proposes or a private plan. The elderly
poor would get drug plans for free.
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan is expected to sharpen the debate over health care
between the Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
Bush's Democratic rival Al Gore has proposed spending an
estimated 253 billion dollars over 10 years to add a prescription
drug benefit to Medicare, the federal program for elderly and
disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
In response to Bush's plan, Vice President Gore said Bush's 158
million dollar package would not do enough for millions of middle-
class seniors.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly half of all of those who don't have coverage today
would not get coverage under the plan that he's announcing today,"
Gore said during a campaign stop in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
As Bush was promoting his prescription drug plan, the
Democratic National Committee Tuesday unveiled a new TV ad to run
this week in nine key states, criticizing Bush's health care
record.

<HEADLINE> Big Rise in Worldwide Online Holiday Sales Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Explosive Internet access
growth will lead to an 85 percent increase in online holiday sales
worldwide this year, according to a report released Tuesday by a U.
S. market researcher.
</P>
<P>
Gartner Group predicted that worldwide online holiday sales
will reach 19.5 billion U.S. dollars from 10.5 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada will continue to account for more
than half of the sales this year with 10.7 billion dollars. Europe
will reach 5.4 billion dollars, while Asia-Pacific is projected to
gain 1.6 billion dollars. Sales in Japan are expected to rise more
than 180 percent to reach 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gartner noted strong demand for Western goods by the affluent
in Asia and support by governments, retail banks and card
companies.
</P>
<P>
Many consumers were making their first purchase over the
Internet during the holiday season last year. According to Gartner,
many Internet retailers were not prepared for the large number of
shoppers, so some Web sites had difficulties fulfilling orders in
time for the holidays.

<HEADLINE> Annan Disappointed at Cancellation of DPRK Trip to New York </HEADLINE>

<P>
Although the planned meeting at the U.N. between leaders of the
Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) will not now take place, the U.N. chief "hopes that the two
countries will nonetheless continue to build on the progress
achieved thus far towards normalizing relations between them," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People'
s Assembly of the DPRK, canceled his planned visit to New York to
attend the Millennium Summit following an incident at the airport
in Frankfort, Germany.
</P>
<P>
U.S. air security officials there opened suitcases and handbags
of each member of the presidential entourage, forced them to take
off clothes and shoes and thoroughly searched even the sensitive
part of the body, DPRK ambassador to the U.N. Li Hyong Chol told a
press conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
The act constitutes "grave encroachment on the sovereignty of a
sovereign state, violation of and insult to the human rights and
flagrant challenge to the exercise of the rights of the U.N.
member state conforming to the U.N. Charter and to the U.N. itself
as well as to the summit organized by it," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as a "rude and provocative treatment," the
ambassador asked for an official apology on the U.S. part.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong-nam was one of the over 150 heads of state or
government invited to attend the Millennium Summit to take place
Wednesday. The three-day meeting, the largest gathering of the
world body, is to address issues of common interest including the
role of the U.N. in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said leaders of the delegations of the Republic
of Korea and the DPRK had planned to meet during the summit, part
of the 55th U.N. General Assembly.
