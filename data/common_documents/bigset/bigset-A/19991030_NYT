ARRESTS, INJURIES AND SCUFFLES AMID CELEBRATION FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Yankees' ticker-tape parade marched
up Broadway and dignitaries celebrated the team's World Series
victory inside the gated confines of City Hall Park on Friday,
police were kept busy with scattered scuffles and unruliness among
the throngs of fans packed into the surrounding blocks and along
the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday evening, officials said that more than 35 people
had been injured, and police had made at least six arrests. Those
numbers were expected to grow as the tallies continued to be
compiled overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries included people who were hit with bottles,
newspapers, rolls of toilet paper and other objects, officials
said. Two police officers suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the event was
relatively calm. ``They were all minor arrests,'' he said at a news
conference Friday afternoon to announce the seizure of $130,000 in
unauthorized Yankees clothing and the arrests of seven people who
were involved in two separate souvenir-knockoff operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate that on the day that we are celebrating their
victory, we are stopping people who are illegally profiting from
their success,'' added Safir, who attended the ceremony at City
Hall and rode in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   As Safir and the rest of the parade participants passed, the
sound of bottles crashing into the ground could be heard, along
with the angry yells of fans who could not get a good view.
</P>
<P>
   Official crowd estimates were not released by city officials
Friday, but Safir said that he believed there were between 100,000
and 150,000 more people than the 3.5 million estimated by police to
have attended last year's parade. ``It was bigger than '96,'' Safir
said. ``And I can tell you it was a lot bigger than '98.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department deployed 5,000 officers for the parade.
Safir said the number of officers was larger than it had been in
previous years. Other police officials said that additional
officers had been needed partly because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
tacitly approved of schoolchildren taking the day off to celebrate
the Yankees' victory.
</P>
<P>
   There were no incidents comparable to some of those that
occurred in previous years, when fans pushed against police
barricades and trashed cars outside the federal building at 26
Federal Plaza. But fans on Friday could be seen throwing everything
from confetti and toilet paper to cans and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to reports of missing children, assaults,
people attempting to scale the Brooklyn Bridge to catch a better
glimpse of the rally in City Hall Park and other incidents, leaving
little time to enforce the Giuliani's zero-tolerance policies
toward public drinking and other such offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Near the steps of the U.S. attorney's office, only about 100
feet from the entrance to police headquarters, high school students
guzzled beer as confetti drifted in the air around them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the day started off relatively quietly for
the thousands of police officers posted along the parade route and
near subway stations in lower Manhattan. But as the parade
entourage progressed north on Broadway to City Hall Park from
Battery City Park, the streets along the route began to resemble
New Orleans during Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was arrested for taking her clothes off on a terrace
above the crowds at 71 Broadway, and a man standing along the route
was arrested for throwing an explosive object that burst into
flames in the street in front of a group of people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as the crowds became increasingly raucous and
roving groups of teen-agers began to cause trouble in the crowd,
police commanders launched a rapid mobilization, requesting
hundreds of additional officers to respond to the parade, law
enforcement officials said. But no serious problems materialized,
officials said.

INFINITI'S I30 GETS A MAKEOVER
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Infiniti needs a solid hit. Off to a rocky start 10
years ago with its weird, atmospheric ad campaign that puzzled
pragmatic American car shoppers, Infiniti has never scaled the
heights of archrival Lexus or Acura.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cars have been good, especially the big Q45. But Infiniti,
Nissan's luxury wing, never seems to be able to find the right
beat, such as with the late J30, whose unusual styling was either
loved or loathed, resulting in an obscure image.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the restyled and freshly engineered I30 midsize luxury
sedan, with more power, better handling, larger body and interior,
classier styling, and a moderate price tag. Quite an attractive
package, though it lands smack dab in the middle of some fierce
competition of both the domestic and import variety.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the I30's mission is to offer more upmarket flavor and
luxury allure than its near-clone, the Nissan Maxima. Though
derived from the same platform and driveline, the Infiniti needs to
be decidely more upmarket than the Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of the problem with the last generation. It wasn't
hard for alert shoppers to recognize that the I30 and the Maxima
were pretty much the same deal. Except that the Nissan was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a completely different body and luxury interior, the
I30 manages to carve out its own image, and offers luxury buyers a
whole boatload of attractive features and equipment starting at
less than 30 grand. The new Maxima is going for a sportier flare,
with a more aggres sive look and a racier interior.
</P>
<P>
   The I30 is certainly more conserva tive, but it too has a
performance streak, especially the I30t (for tour ing) model tested
here. This version, which lists at $2,000 more than the regular
model, includes a sport-tuned suspension, limited-slip
differential, 17-inch alloy wheels and perform ance tires, Xenon
headlights, a sun roof and motorized rear sunshade (welcomed in
this climate) and some interior enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The touring's suspension is surpris ingly firm, but in the good
way, supplying a tight, controlled ride without buffeting the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The I30t seems to have avoided the plague of mushiness that has
infected so many recent luxury cars. I can't speak for the standard
I30, but it probably isn't far off.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Maxima and I30 have beam-rear-axle setups, unlike the
earlier Maximas, which had a nicely effective independent rear
suspen sion. I was hoping the IRS would reappear with the new
models.
</P>
<P>
   A significant gain for the I30 is its upgraded power, the
3-liter engine putting out a clean 227 horsepower, fully 37 horses
more than last year, due to re-engineered intake and exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima, with 222 horsepower, can be had with a stick shift
as well as automatic, true to its sporting image, but the I30 comes
only with automatic. This is a good tranny, with shifting that is
smooth and positive, upshifting at the right mo ments and
downshifting easily.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, traction control is a $300 option. It certainly should be
stand ard at this level automobile, espe cially with so much power
going through the front wheels.
</P>
<P>
   In black and chrome, the test car looked refined and classically
under stated. The lines are rounded, but with creases and compound
curves that create a jewellike effect. The styling breaks no new
ground, with traditional proportions somewhat like a BMW. A
handsome sedan, but not a standout.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the cabin is roomy, lush and comfortable, with
supportive leather seating and a great stereo system. Much of the
4-inch increase in body length translates to more room inside.
</P>
<P>
   The interior also is traditional and subdued, leaving the flashy
bits to the sportier Maxima. Plastic-wood trim looks OK, but why
not have the real stuff in this upscale ride?
</P>
<P>
   A handsome analog clock, a signa ture Infiniti feature, is set
into the middle of the dash. On top of the dash is a pop-up storage
bin, which eventually will be the site of the I30s optional GPS
mapping system, something that is rapidly becoming de rigueur for
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   The test sedan was a preproduction demonstrator, but still tight
and rattle-free, with good fit and finish.
</P>
<P>
   The I30 is a nice piece, especially for the price, though it
comes hard up against a pair of worthy competitors, the Acura 3.2TL
and the Lexus ES300, as well as some notables from Oldsmobile,
Buick and Chrysler, and the Cadillac Catera and Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the segment leaders, BMW's 3-series and
Mercedes-Benz's C-Class, both of which are pricier than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The I30 should be a contender, especially with a base price of
$29,465. The Maxima and I30 con tinue Nissan's hitting streak for
2000, part of several new and innovative products that, hopefully,
will lift up the automaker after a couple of lean years.

AT 90, BORGE STILL WOWS AUDIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE _ Warned that temperatures in the Phoenix area could still
be in the 90s when he plays a concert at Gammage Auditorium on Nov.
7, pianist and humorist Victor Borge responded brightly, ``I'm in
the 90s, too!''
</P>
<P>
   As Borge approaches his 91st birthday in January, the genial
entertainer is as hot as ever, having just returned from a tour of
his native Scandinavia that had him playing eight sold-out concerts
in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly get a ticket myself,'' he says with a laugh,
phoning from his home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can slow the man known as the Great Dane, who made his
orchestral debut at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Only the rigors of travel take their toll. Once he's on stage,
his mind and his fingers are as nimble as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Though Borge began his musical career as a child prodigy, the
son of a violinist with the Danish Symphony, he began to combine
his exquisite skills at the piano with his irrepressible wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't decide it,'' he says. ``It came absolutely
naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   He would make a humorous remark, the audience would laugh, and
that encouraged him. The wisecracks also helped to ease his
nervousness at the piano.
</P>
<P>
   His characteristic style evolved: A few bars of a classical
piece, a few witticisms. Music and mirth. It's a mix that has kept
him among the top entertainers in the country he adopted 60 years
ago after he fled Europe and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In his early 20s, he had become a leading film star in
Scandinavia, but when the Nazis invaded Denmark in the late 1930s,
he couldn't resist taking shots at the stormtrooping interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What's the difference between a dog and a Nazi?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: A Nazi lifts his arm.
</P>
<P>
   After such jabs landed Borge a spot on Hitler's blacklist, he
fled to Finland and then to America on the last American passenger
ship out of northern Europe before World War II began.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, he has performed on stage, in
films and on radio and television in this country, endearing
himself to legions of fans who warm to his gentle humor and his
musical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Borge's musical gifts come from his father, as does his sense of
humor. His father was quite the card, he says: ``He always had a
joke, even if it was the same one over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Borge style comes spontaneously. He writes no monologue,
preferring to speak off the cuff, tickling the funny bone while
tickling the ivories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's time to talk, sometimes it's time to play,'' he
says. ``It depends on the audience and how I feel at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not jokes. It's like a caricature. I'm a caricaturist of
happenings.''
</P>
<P>
   Borge's caricatures never lampoon current politics. Audiences,
he says, ``want to be entertained, not irritated.''
</P>
<P>
   His music is all classical, nothing ``strange or modern.'' He
shudders to think he would bore someone with strange, modern music.
</P>
<P>
   When he's performing in another country, his conversations are
still in English, though he favors the Scandinavians with dialogue
in Danish, which most northern Europeans understand in addition to
English.
</P>
<P>
   Humor loses much in a translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't translate humor,'' he says. ``I explain things that
happen. I use expressions that come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Borge will be a featured guest in a Kennedy Center
Honors tribute for which he says ``it's hard to express the
gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a recipient of the Medal of Honor presented by the Statue
of Liberty Centennial Committee, he jokes that he's disappointed
that Kennedy Center honorees are not asked to perform, just bask in
the adulation of their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the honors he's garnered, this is ``one of the most
important,'' he says, because he will be singled out as a
celebrated Dane:
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects my home country.''
</P>
<P>
   Borge, married 46 years to his second wife, Sanna, has five
children and nine grandchildren. He's also an accomplished
yachtsman.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent visitor to the Phoenix area, he says he enjoys the
audiences here but bemoans the fact that he never gets to see the
sights _ he flies in, performs, sleeps, retreats.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve of the next millennium will be spent at his
Connecticut home with Sanna, and he'll begin celebrating around 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's midnight in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Just another evening for Borge, a man for whom the ship of
freedom took him to a new and celebrated life 60 years ago, with
hope and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' he says, ``is a new year.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ With toilet paper streaming from office buildings and
cheers roaring up from teeming sidewalks, New York threw yet
another ticker-tape parade for its world champion Yankees on Friday
that was by turns jubilant and somber, but at times surprisingly
rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   The clear skies above lower Broadway were a shimmering blizzard
of shredded spreadsheets and endless printouts, the streets below
athunder with the cheers of truant schoolchildren and their
compliant parents, as the Bronx Bombers rolled by in what threatens
to become an annual rite.
</P>
<P>
   But the long wait for those who rose at dawn to claim a decent
vista along the parade route seemed to have exhausted the patience
and civility of a number of people, who hurled refuse at each
other, at police, and at the riders of open flatbed trucks and
double-decker buses whose names they did not know. At least 30
people were injured and police arrested at least six people on
charges ranging from sexual abuse and indecent exposure to inciting
a riot and assaulting a police officer, the authorities said late
Friday afternoon, though the number of arrests was expected to grow
as reports filtered in.
</P>
<P>
   The parade once again culminated in an afternoon rally for the
25-time champions at City Hall, where pure politics was the order
of the day in ways seen and unseen. As the players waited to be
introduced, the banner of a police department band draped
momentarily over a larger banner, briefly obscuring the name of the
celebration's host, ``Mayor Rudy Giuliani.'' But only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the crowd of dignitaries who had been allowed beyond
locked gates to within sight of the stage included dozens of local
politicians eager to soak up a little Yankee glory and electoral
goodwill. But some Democratic members of the state Assembly were
officially barred from the day's events because they had voted to
repeal New York City's commuter tax, aides to Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that the third such celebration in four years
might produce a blase response in a city legendary for its
been-there, done-that affectations was rendered ridiculous long
before the parade began at 12:10 p.m. By 10:30, the sidewalks along
Broadway between Battery Place and Chambers Street were crammed
full _ police, who are given to generous estimates of ticker-tape
crowds, estimated this year's attendance at slightly more than last
year's figure of 3.5 million _ and the more athletic fans had
clambered atop telephones and traffic lights and bus-stop signs and
even the old bell tower in the Trinity Church graveyard. Everything
and everyone was covered in paper; the gargoyles that adorned
dignified office buildings could have been wearing Yankee hats
underneath, for all anyone knew.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A block off the parade route, vendors near the Municipal
Building and along Church Street did a brisk business in Yankee
T-shirts and hats, while dime stores and hardware shops sold out of
mops, scrub-brushes and anything else that could pass for a broom,
to signify the Yankees' second consecutive sweep in the World
Series. Sanitation crews, walking behind mounted police in
performance of perhaps the least-desired job in New York, were
greeted as enthusiastically as Yankee Stadium's groundskeepers
dancing to ``YMCA,'' as fans giddily chanted ``Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep!'' _ and no one mistook the shouting for a directive.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Though Wall Street did manage to function Friday, it seemed
likely that businesses and government agencies all over the
metropolitan area were operating at less than full strength,
judging from the number of prison janitors, elevator mechanics,
teachers and software developers who left work to be at the parade,
with permission or without. Rose Minoughan, 34, a police officer in
Newark, N.J., who held a bright-pink sign saying ``Torre for
Pope,'' said she had called in sick with a ``migraine'' _ just like
last year. ``You're going to get me in trouble!'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   But children, tens of thousands of them pressed against police
barriers, seemed to outnumber the grown-ups. If these ticker-tape
parades continue much longer, school officials may want to think
about writing them into the official calendar. As it was, public
high school students were given a half-day off for afternoon
parent-teacher conferences, but many youngsters _ and their
parents, too _ seemed to have borrowed a lesson from math class and
rounded up.

   Diane Carusalle, who shepherded her sons Dean, 13, and Lenny,
10, and their three cousins from Staten Island, said she would fess
up on Tuesday in her note to the nuns at her boys' parochial school
explaining their absence. ``I'll take my chances admitting we went
to the Yankee parade,'' she said, as the boys stared down Broadway
for a glimpse of the first float. ``I pay them enough every year.
They'll have to get over it. Plus, Friday was a teacher conference,
and Monday they're off for All Saints' Day. So we'll call it a
five-day weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   As the parade slowly lurched up from Bowling Green, which was
declared by one fan's poster as ``Yankee Stadium South,'' many in
the crowd showed off the swagger that visiting players said made a
trip to the Bronx a foray into truly hostile territory,
bad-mouthing the nowhere-to-be-found Boston Red Sox and Atlanta
Braves, the last two victims of the Yankees' postseason juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   There were, too, the usual hordes of girls and young women
waiting to swoon for Derek Jeter, the Yankees' star shortstop and
reigning heartthrob. And this year, for the first time, there were
nearly as many young and not-so-young women holding signs declaring
their love for Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman of the errant
throws; it seemed as if some wanted to take care of him more than
to adore him, as if all he needed was some TLC to clear his head.
</P>
<P>
   But many less boisterous parade-goers seemed deeply affected by
the human travails that this year's Yankee players were forced to
overcome, to tell from the dozens of carefully lettered banners
held aloft memorializing the fathers of Paul O'Neill, Luis Sojo and
Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ana Jordan, 19, of Staten Island, who had scrawled O'Neill's
name on her right cheek, and his number, 21, on her left, said she
had gotten the day off from her job at a supermarket to come to the
parade to show her admiration for the right-fielder, who lost his
father early Wednesday but still played in the series clincher that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was really brave of him to play through the last
game after his father died,'' Ms. Jordan said. ``He also played
with a broken rib, that's how into the team he is. Jeter cares more
about looking good on the field. O'Neill is just concerned about
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   That humanity came pouring out later on the platform in front of
City Hall, when Darryl Strawberry followed a number of teammates to
the podium to say a few words. After a short speech, the
oft-troubled Yankee designated hitter, who recovered from a battle
with colon cancer last fall only to be arrested for solicitation
and drug possession early this year, began to thank his manager,
Joe Torre, when he broke down and doubled over, sobbing
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   As he cried for a full minute, Torre walked to Strawberry and
put his arms around him, and the crowd began to applaud, louder and
louder, until even the Yankee players were clapping in a standing
ovation of moral support. Finally, Strawberry lifted his head, his
eyes hidden behind sunglasses, and managed: `I'd just like to say
to Joe, thank you for caring for me.'' To his teammates, he added:
``And I love you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the bunting and balloons that bedecked City Hall seemed
fitting for a presidential inauguration, Giuliani, who apparently
would settle for a Senate seat for now, kept his remarks brief,
nonpartisan and sentimental, also noting the Yankees' ability to
turn the ``adversities of life'' into ``something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how the season started on a rainy day in April. ``It
ends on a beautiful and glorious day in an October New York sun
that is shining and that's bright,'' he added. ``Because the
Yankees and New York own October.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Yankees' ticker-tape parade marched
up Broadway and dignitaries celebrated the team's World Series
victory inside the gated confines of City Hall Park on Friday,
police were kept busy with scattered scuffles and unruliness among
the throngs of fans packed into the surrounding blocks and along
the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday evening, officials said that more than 30 people
had been injured, and police had made at least six arrests. Those
numbers were expected to grow as the tallies continued to be
compiled overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries included people who were hit with bottles,
newspapers, rolls of toilet paper and other objects, officials
said. Two police officers suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the event was
relatively calm. ``They were all minor arrests,'' he said at a news
conference Friday afternoon to announce the seizure of $130,000 in
unauthorized Yankees clothing and the arrests of seven people who
were involved in two separate souvenir-knockoff operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate that on the day that we are celebrating their
victory, we are stopping people who are illegally profiting from
their success,'' added Safir, who attended the ceremony at City
Hall and rode in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   As Safir and the rest of the parade participants passed, the
sound of bottles crashing into the ground could be heard, along
with the angry yells of fans who could not get a good view.
</P>
<P>
   Official crowd estimates were not released by city officials
Friday, but Safir said that he believed there were between 100,000
and 150,000 more people than the 3.5 million estimated by police to
have attended last year's parade. ``It was bigger than '96,'' Safir
said. ``And I can tell you it was a lot bigger than '98.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department deployed 5,000 officers for the parade.
Safir said the number of officers was larger than it had been in
previous years. Other police officials said that additional
officers had been needed partly because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
tacitly approved of schoolchildren taking the day off to celebrate
the Yankees' victory.
</P>
<P>
   There were no incidents comparable to some of those that
occurred in previous years, when fans pushed against police
barricades and trashed cars outside the federal building at 26
Federal Plaza. But fans on Friday could be seen throwing everything
from confetti and toilet paper to cans and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to reports of missing children, assaults,
people attempting to scale the Brooklyn Bridge to catch a better
glimpse of the rally in City Hall Park and other incidents, leaving
little time to enforce the Giuliani's zero-tolerance policies
toward public drinking and other such offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Near the steps of the U.S. attorney's office, only about 100
feet from the entrance to police headquarters, high school students
guzzled beer as confetti drifted in the air around them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the day started off relatively quietly for
the thousands of police officers posted along the parade route and
near subway stations in lower Manhattan. But as the parade
entourage progressed north on Broadway to City Hall Park from
Battery City Park, the streets along the route began to resemble
New Orleans during Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Sara Miltenberger, a 21-year-old college student from
Indiana, was arrested for taking her clothes off on a terrace above
the crowds at 71 Broadway, and an unidentified man standing along
the route was arrested for throwing an explosive object that burst
into flames in the street in front of a group of people, officials
said. Another man, Carlos Vargas, 37, was arrested for gropping at
a female spectator.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as the crowds became increasingly raucous and
roving groups of teen-agers began to cause trouble in the crowd,
police commanders launched a rapid mobilization, requesting
hundreds of additional officers to respond to the parade, law
enforcement officials said. But no serious problems materialized,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman, said the final tally
of arrests would not be available until later Saturday. During last
year's parade, 18 people were arrested.

THE SEASON OF THE WITCH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The season of darkness is moving in. It started Saturday morning
at 7:15 with the latest sunrise of the year. Saturday night the
clocks turned back to winter _ psychologically, at least, for
although the weather is still mild, the mood shifts deep into
sweater country when Standard Time steals the late-afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   September was a comparative romp, when summer lingered in the
promise of a bright autumn. There was plenty of time to think about
putting gardens to bed, cleaning storm windows, and getting ready
for the long slog to March. But on the cusp of November a person
has to pick up the ax and get serious about the woodpile.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the dark season begins with Halloween. A person
can put on a fright mask and stare down the inevitable or become a
clown and laugh it off. The celebration of goblins and ghosts is
supposedly for kids, but adults love the magic of disguise and the
freedom to become someone, or something, else.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Celts used to dress up in animal skins when they
honored Samhain, the lord of the dead, who supposedly allowed
departed spirits to return to earth on the night of Oct. 31. It was
a kind of new year's eve festival, for the Celts began their year
on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   There will probably be no authentic animal skins at the door
Sunday when early nightfall starts the doorbell ringing well before
supper. The first trick-or-treaters will be the cutest _ the
under-6 set masquerading as bunnies, ballerinas, and black cats.
Later the more sophisticated space aliens and famous, or infamous,
political characters will come up the steps _ and in New Hampshire
they really could be running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Later still some very big kids dressed as pirates or robbers may
ring the bell, and the wary homeowner might decide to turn out the
porch light and chance a pumpkin-smashing. It's a scary world out
there 365 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Time to burrow in, light the fire, nail down the flapping
shutter, and seal the cracks against the whistling wind. That noise
is the wind, isn't it?

THE TERRIBLE TRUTH IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longer the war in Chechnya goes on, the clearer Russian
intentions become. This week Kremlin officials and top military
officers dropped their pretense of conducting a limited
antiterrorist operation. With the confidence that comes from
knowing that this time their assault on the Chechens has domestic
support, Russia's political and military officials are trumpeting
their aim of reconquering the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   This clarifying of intentions is crucial. It sheds light on
Moscow's preparations for the current assault and on Russian war
aims.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is clear that the current military campaign had to be
planned well in advance of the provocations that were used to
justify it, no one should accept the Kremlin line about a
retaliation against Chechen bandits. Even if one honors Russia's
right to pursue terrorists in Chechnya, Russia's bombing and
shelling of Chechen cities and villages leave no doubt that the
purpose of the war is not to clean out terrorist nests but to
recapture a rebellious region of the northern Caucasus before
Russian parliamentary elections in December and the presidential
election scheduled for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev could not have been more explicit
about Kremlin war aims when he declared Thursday, during a visit to
troops in Chechnya: ``We have come to never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the words of a colonialist reconqueror, and for
Chechens they have terrible reverberations. They signify a cruel
coda to the czarist military campaigns described in Tolstoy's
novella ``Hadji Murad'' and remind Chechens of Stalin's deportation
of nearly the entire population of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond domestic politics and old imperialist reflexes, the war
in Chechnya is a Russian attempt to gain control of the pipelines
for oil and natural gas from the Caspian Sea. Russia's aggression
in Chechnya is the barbaric expression of a kleptocratic state, and
US officials should not go on pretending to accept the Kremlin's
prattle about a war against terrorism.

GANASSI CHOOSES TOYOTA ENGINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ A need to stay ahead of the pack closing in on
his championship team and the desire to remain on the leading edge
were the reasons Chip Ganassi switched engines.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi, the CART FedEx Championship Series car owner whose
drivers have won the last three titles, announced he'll be
Toyota-powered in 2000 after running Honda engines since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for that edge, breaking new ground,''
said Ganassi, preparing for Sunday's Marlboro 500 at California
Speedway. ``This is one of the most exciting decisions I've made in
the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, using the Honda power plant, Ganassi has won 30
races and 24 pole positions. Furthermore, Jimmy Vasser and Alex
Zanardi have used Honda engines to win driving titles.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Toyota has yet to win a Champ car race since
joining CART in 1996. Currently, Toyota powers cars run by Dan
Gurney, Arciero-Wells, Team Gordon and Della Penna Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a bad job anybody else did and I agree Honda
is the No.1 engine,'' Ganassi said. ``This is about a new program,
staying on the leading edge and continuing to win with our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi hit on the package of Reynard chassis, Honda power and
Firestone power in 1996 when Vasser won the crown. Now, he feels as
though the field is catching up with him and he's ready to take
another step with Toyota RV8D engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen the hunger to want to win in any manufacturer
as this one,'' Ganassi said. ``I see it their attitude, eyes and
level of commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttman gets contract: Bobby Hamilton, the Winston Cup driver
who took advantage of the off-week to qualify for today's NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series NAPA 200, gave Joe Ruttman a belated
birthday gift.
</P>
<P>
   A day after his 55th birthday, Ruttman was given a contract to
drive the DANA-sponsored Dodge next year for Hamilton. Ruttman,
fired by Jack Roush last December after finishing third in points,
was a midseason replacement this year after Butch Miller was
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge. Last year was such a tremendous blow to my
ego,'' Ruttman said. ``I thought maybe I was out. This is sheer
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said Ruttman's input was one of the reasons he retained
the veteran driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought the team around 180 degrees. The biggest factor was
that he brought the guys up. He drives like a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti honored: CART unveiled the Mario Andretti Trophy, which
will be presented to the driver who receives the most votes for the
inaugural all-star team. The 95-pound, 38-inch-high statue,
composed of bronze, marble and walnut, took artist Elie Hazak five
months to complete. Eight cars are featured, symbolic of Andretti's
career ranging from dirt cars to Formula One to current Champ-car
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally flattering and I didn't hesitate to accept
it,'' Andretti said. ``The championship rewards the best driver,
but not always. This doesn't forget the driver who was spectacular
but maybe not lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   So long hot dogs: Race fans who have seats in the new skyboxes
atop the grandstands have quite a choice as far as the menu from
Sportservice goes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to race track staples such as hot dogs, nachos and
hamburgers, the menu includes a Tuscan antipasto platter, tangy
Thai curry chicken skewers and a California raw bar complete with
oysters on the half shell, littleneck clams, jumbo shrimp, cracked
lobster and smoked salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Other entrees available to the 28 suites include beef
tenderloin, herb-crusted salmon, pesto cream chicken tortellini and
a mozzarella-stuff chicken breast. John Costello, former executive
chef at the FleetCenter in Boston, is the general manger for
Sportservice at the speedway and is being assisted by 40 managers
from throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Lights: Jonny Kane won the pole for Sunday's PPG-Dayton
Indy Lights 100 in qualifying early Friday evening and Oriol Servia
moved a step closer to wrapping up the season-long points title.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, locked in a tight battle with Scott Dixon for the Indy
Lights' Rookie of the Year award, edged Servia for the pole with a
top speed of 186.346 miles per hour and a lap time of 39.198
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Servia was second at 186.057 and 39.259. He maintained his
14-point lead over Casey Mears in the points race, but, since Mears
couldn't pick up the one point awarded the pole winner, he now
needs only a sixth-place finish to wrap up the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championship is always there, obviously. I arrived here
thinking about just this race,'' Servia said. ``I'm going to try to
win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Mears, a teammate of Servia's, qualified in the eighth position.
The third member of the Dorricott-Mears Racing Team, Philipp Peter,
qualified in the third position. Sunday's race will begin at 9:50
a.m. and precede the CART race, which is set to start at noon.

WHEN BOMBERS ARE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, November 1, 1999)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the moment in 1998 when an American cruise missile struck a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's capital, Khartoum _ ostensibly to
retaliate for two terrorist bombings of US embassies in Africa by
the wealthy Saudi radical Osama bin Laden _ concerned parties
inside and outside the US government have had misgivings about the
selection of the al Shifa factory as a proper target.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, all misgivings would be aired before the
missiles be launched. The decision makers would be wise enough to
ask the right questions, recognize the right answers, and act on
the appropriate first principles. But one of the revelatory
discoveries in a New York Times review of the decision-making
process was that President Clinton and his advisers believed they
had to act swiftly because of reports that bin Laden might be
preparing another terrorist attack, perhaps with chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the ``fog of war'' pertains also to the practice of
statecraft. Nevertheless, the Times report suggests a telling lack
of curiosity, both before and after the missile launch, about shaky
evidence that al Shifa was then being used for chemical weapons and
was linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times account, debate was cut off at a crucial
junture with the argument that the administration ``would rightly
be pilloried if the United States did not destroy al Shifa and Mr.
bin Laden initiated a chemical attack that could have been
preempted.'' This argument reflects a political fear of looking
soft to domestic critics. Such an anxiety may be inevitable, but it
should have been balanced against the damage that could be done
internationally if there was no solid basis for targeting the
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing a site with no proven connection to bin Laden makes the
United States look like a superpower that is all too eager to
intervene militarily everywhere. This is a version of reality that
suits anti-American forces in several key countries, strengthening
their argument for coalitions to counter what they call American
hegemonism. Considerations of this kind should have been part of
the decision to strike the unguarded factory in Sudan.

<P>
   Professor Henry Higgins would never have approved, but the
editor of a pocket edition of what is considered the bible of
proper speech _ ``Fowler's Modern English Usage'' _ thinks
Americanisms have enriched the British tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Allen, editor of the ``Pocket Fowler's Modern English
Usage,'' which came out last week, says H.W. Fowler, author of the
1926 classic, ``certainly had a bee in his bonnet about borrowed
words.'' Allen feels that linguistic snobs need to open a less
partial ear to the cross-pollination of language _ and it is
cross-pollination, for Americans have adopted as many expressions
as they have given away.
</P>
<P>
   People go to ``the flicks'' in the United States as often as
they go to the movies and have been known to ``queue up'' for the
tickets. Every time they say ``miniskirt'' or ``gay'' or ``telly''
or do the ``walk this way'' routine from Monty Python's Ministry of
Silly Walks, they are enjoying the breadth of borrowed words and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the Brits when they eat ``fries'' instead of
``chips'' or reach for a ``diaper'' instead of a ``nappie'' or
stroll down the ``sidewalk'' instead of the ``pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stop such infiltration is like trying to stop the
wind, for language does fly that fast, especially in the age of
telecommunications, and it does bring people closer together.
</P>
<P>
   People who try look a bit silly, as the BBC looked a few years
ago when it banned American slang from its broadcasts and as the
French Academy did when it insisted on ridding French of
``Franglais,'' the odd coupling responsible for such offspring as
``Le airbag.'' Obviously purists over there have lost their grip on
the old joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen is not afraid of fun and calls condemnation of a
versatile American vocabulary ``linguistically misconceived and
historically unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Right on, baby! Jolly good, too.

<P>
   Sacking someone is a horrible task, as near to commanding a
firing squad as most civilized people get these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite as unpleasant as being sacked, of course, and it
is easier if you can delegate your dirty work to somebody in Human
Resources. But the sheer nastiness of telling somebody it's time to
go is enough to make the toughest hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this truer than in the boardroom. Confronted with a
chief executive whose strategy is not working, the instinct of many
company directors is to wait in the hope that something _ the
shares, ideally _ will turn up. Far better to find a replacement,
quickly, and pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   An able chief executive has extraordinary power to make or break
a company. Take the way that Robert Ayling has turned Britain's BA
from ``the world's favourite airline'' into just another troubled
carrier. Or look at how Gil Amelio damaged Apple Computer and
Edzard Reuter wrecked Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed with which Apple's resurrection followed the
return of Steve Jobs, or the vigor with which Jurgen Schrempp has
restructured Daimler and Jean-Marie Messier has transformed
France's Vivendi, all show the value of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Such influence reflects the demands of running a large firm
these days. Backed by the corporate bureaucracy, a chief executive
might once have got by with good managers, cost-control, and a
beady eye on the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although such things still matter, a chief executive now has to
think for himself. He needs to be an innovator and an entrepreneur
with a global vision. He needs political skills, to steer a course
through the regulatory maze. He needs to be a salesman and a
preacher to woo consumers, employees and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a firm with a good boss does everything in its
power to hang on to him _ and why some of the most successful chief
executives, such as the late Roberto Goizueta of Coca-Cola, spent
years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the costs of failure are so high, it is also
essential to get rid of an underperforming boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, more boards are doing their duty. Indeed,
running a big American firm or a Silicon Valley start-up is now
riskier than being grand vizier in the court of the Ottoman sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Boards in other parts of the world are too reluctant to pull the
trigger. A few firms go to the other extreme and become serial
sackers; many others, even American ones, seem stuck with a
fossilized strategy and a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rakesh Khurana, of MIT's Sloan School of
Management, most boards give the chief executive a honeymoon of
between two and three years. Then follow a couple of dangerous
years. After that, the longer you are chief executive, the less
likely you are to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   A change might do the world of good in such companies as Disney
or Britain's Rentokil Initial, both of which have recently done
poorly under long-serving chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of such firms should ask themselves whether their
bosses are stars like Goizueta, or tyrants like Armand Hammer, who
ruled Occidental Petroleum as his fief into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is inaction, institutional investors bear part of
the blame. Rather than step in when performance flags, many prefer
to sell the shares or sit back and wait for a free ride on the
activism of others.
</P>
<P>
   When investors act, as they do increasingly in America, they
discover that replacing the boss is a labor of behind-the-scenes
negotiations. Which is why sacking the boss ultimately comes down
to the judgment of a firm's directors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet boards find many excuses for doing nothing. The boss is near
retirement; he is the founder; he is the founder's son. It would
look bad; it would be hard to find someone better; it would show
that the corporate strategy had been less brilliant than the board
had told shareholders at the previous AGM.
</P>
<P>
   How to change this? An essential is to structure the board so
that it can scrutinize the chief executive. That is best done when
the roles of non-executive chairman and chief executive are
separate, so that rebellious directors have a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Non-executives should meet without the chief executive, and make
a regular evaluation of the boss's achievements. Directors will do
this better if they have a stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have grasped the need to align the interests of
chief executive and shareholders, with shares or (less good) share
options; far fewer have seen the need to align the interests of
directors and shareholders in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Many mediocre chief executives owe their jobs to bad boards. The
longer a chief executive has been in the job, the more likely he is
to have appointed the executive directors and brought in his chums
as ``independent'' non-executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the chief executive's tennis coach and golf partner have to
decide his future, they are unlikely to vote for execution _ a
reason for ensuring that non-executives are truly professional, and
value their reputation for independence above their board fees.
</P>
<P>
   When it is time to make a change, firms should reluctantly
accept that they may have to pay a bad boss to leave. To pay a
crooked one would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, when a chief executive leaves under a cloud, his
career is wrecked and he is unlikely ever again to run a firm of
similar size.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out the boss may be the fastest way to give a company a
fresh start. A fresh start is exactly what many companies need. &QL;

HOUSTON GRABS POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ That Andy Houston will start out front in
today's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series NAPA 200 at California
Speedway is no surprise. After all, Houston turned the trick last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, with a steady Santa Ana wind whipping around the
two-mile speedway, Houston pushed his Chevrolet Silverado to a
record lap of 173.561 mph (41.484 seconds), better than Mike Bliss'
old mark of 173.198 set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The first three trucks all had the red bow tie, Chevrolet's
trademark nameplate. Jay Sauter was second to Houston at 173.456
and Jack Sprague third at 172.881.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not surprising that Joe Ruttman, fastest Thursday,
led the Dodge contingent. Ruttman, the former Upland resident
driving for Bobby Hamilton, was fourth with a lap of 172.790.
</P>
<P>
   The stunner was the top Ford driver. No, it wasn't Greg Biffle,
the series' points leader with nine wins this year. As a matter of
fact, Biffle finished 24th in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was Carlos Contreras. With a lap of 171.895,
Contreras became the first Mexican national to qualify for a major
NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for Mexicans and Spanish-speaking people,'' said
Contreras, a 10-year racing veteran in Mexico. ``I want to do good
and make everybody proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Houston: ``I'm impressed. He obviously must have talent to
be able to get his truck going that fast so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, a two-time stock car champion in his native country,
has already turned heads. His first day in a truck was Wednesday
during the test session and Thursday he turned in a solid
performance before his run Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my first trips, I was very nervous,'' said Contreras, who
has competed in five different Mexican series. ``I was not at full
power because I felt the speed. ``After maybe about six laps, I was
full power. I like the speed and I like the entry into the curves
(turns).''
</P>
<P>
   The trucks have roughly 400 more horsepower than Contreras has
in his stock car. Drafting was also a new experience, especially
with the high speeds the trucks generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first time in traffic,'' said Contreras, who is
running the truck owned by David Hudson on Impact Motorsports and
sponsored by the Latin American division of Hot Wheels. ``I learned
what happened, but I need more laps to get confidence with guys.
But I am a fast learner.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras is among the various story lines in today's 100-lap
race. The main focus is the series championship with Biffle trying
to hold off Sprague and Dennis Setzer, who will start alongside
Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never in my life driven in conditions like that,'' Setzer
said. ``We had a good truck going into qualifying but the wind
really messed things up. I was blown away at how the truck moved up
the track in turns 3 and 4. I was actually off the gas and still
got blown up the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who was unhappy at how his truck handled after the
morning session, indicated the wind took away the aerodynamic edge
enjoyed by the Ford and Dodge trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's windier tomorrow,'' said Sprague. ``I can drive
the truck about anywhere. Our guys got the setup after the morning
practice, they just kept working hard. It was a hair-raising lap.''
</P>
<P>
   For Houston, who will start 14 spots ahead of brother Marty in
the field, winning the pole will ease some of the pain of not
having won in the previous 24 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the first to say we're disappointed with the way the
season has gone,'' said Houston, whose lone CTS win was last year
in New Hampshire. ``If we can't win the race, then this will help
us get through the offseason.

poorly under long-serving chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of such firms should ask themselves whether their
bosses are stars like Goizueta, or tyrants like Armand Hammer, who
ruled Occidental Petroleum as his fief into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is inaction, institutional investors bear part of
the blame. Rather than step in when performance flags, many prefer
to sell the shares or sit back and wait for a free ride on the
activism of others.
</P>
<P>
   When investors act, as they do increasingly in America, they
discover that replacing the boss is a labor of behind-the-scenes
negotiations. Which is why sacking the boss ultimately comes down
to the judgment of a firm's directors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet boards find many excuses for doing nothing. The boss is near
retirement; he is the founder; he is the founder's son. It would
look bad; it would be hard to find someone better; it would show
that the corporate strategy had been less brilliant than the board
had told shareholders at the previous AGM.
</P>
<P>
   How to change this? An essential is to structure the board so
that it can scrutinize the chief executive. That is best done when
the roles of non-executive chairman and chief executive are
separate, so that rebellious directors have a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Non-executives should meet without the chief executive, and make
a regular evaluation of the boss's achievements. Directors will do
this better if they have a stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have grasped the need to align the interests of
chief executive and shareholders, with shares or (less good) share
options; far fewer have seen the need to align the interests of
directors and shareholders in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Many mediocre chief executives owe their jobs to bad boards. The
longer a chief executive has been in the job, the more likely he is
to have appointed the executive directors and brought in his chums
as ``independent'' non-executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the chief executive's tennis coach and golf partner have to
decide his future, they are unlikely to vote for execution _ a
reason for ensuring that non-executives are truly professional, and
value their reputation for independence above their board fees.
</P>
<P>
   When it is time to make a change, firms should reluctantly
accept that they may have to pay a bad boss to leave. To pay a
crooked one would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, when a chief executive leaves under a cloud, his
career is wrecked and he is unlikely ever again to run a firm of
similar size.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out the boss may be the fastest way to give a company a
fresh start. A fresh start is exactly what many companies need. &QL;

<P>
   All the signs are that the Russian government thinks it is going
to swat its pesky Chechen rebels and reassert itself over the
country's turbulent southern rim by force. It is unlikely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's military campaign has so far been a bit less
crass, though hardly less brutal, than it was in 1994-96, when
perhaps 80,000 people were killed, Chechnya won de facto
independence and Russia was humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chechens are no less tough now than they were then.
Today, moreover, the entire Caucasus, not just Chechnya, is a
dangerous mess, and Russia is making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Chechen war, the rest of the world stood aside,
vaguely muttering that it was an internal Russian affair. This
time, with several neighboring countries threatened by the
convulsions, outsiders have every reason to use their influence to
promote a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, a good moment for trying to do that is at hand.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is
soon to hold its first grand summit for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the club's members are the United States, Russia, Turkey,
three ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan and
Armenia) and all the other countries of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE has come up in the world, mainly as an organization
that can discuss human rights and other delicate issues. It also
happens to be Russia's favorite forum.
</P>
<P>
   Its gathering in Istanbul in three weeks' time provides the
ideal opportunity to seek a general settlement in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Halting the bloodshed in Chechnya is the most urgent task. The
way to start would be for Russia, which now declares itself to be
in a position of strength, to offer a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   It could then negotiate with Aslan Maskhadov, Chechnya's elected
leader, and grant Chechnya at least the wide measure of autonomy
promised three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That would provide the best hope of winning the Chechens'
cooperation in the battle against Islamic terrorism in Russia's
cities, which is supposedly a large part of the reason for the
Russian campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will insist that this war in Chechnya, like the
last one, is an internal matter. But the international aspects
cannot be brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   At least 180,000 Chechens are said to have fled their homes;
many have gone west to Ingushetia, a neighboring republic within
Russia; some have gone south to Georgia. Disgracefully, the
Russians are blocking the exodus of more, and are being less than
helpful to charities such as the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russian meddling is feared well beyond its borders, especially
in countries sympathetic to Chechnya. So Georgia, which has a
general election on Oct. 31, suspects it is once more in Russia's
baleful sights.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, which wants the lion's share of the Caspian oil that
Russia covets, is equally nervous; its foreign minister was fired
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, Russia's oldest ally in the area, is convulsed in
political turmoil after its prime minister's assassination on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks _ blood-brothers of the Azeris and therefore, in
Russian eyes, a leading strategic foe _ are watching warily.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the signs are bad. The Russians may now be ready to
accept that most of the newly discovered oil being pumped from
Baku, the Azeris' Caspian-shore capital, will go via a pipeline
through Turkey to the Mediterranean _ and not, as they would
prefer, across their own land to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia might even help fix a deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a settlement of the big arguments in the area should not
mean letting Russia trample roughshod over the small peoples,
Chechens included, as the price for accepting its loss of influence
in the southern half of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The whole region is combustible. One bit affects another. The
summiteers in Istanbul should insist that making peace in Chechnya
is just one part, albeit the most urgent, of the business of
bringing stability to the entire Caucasus. &QL;

<P>
   PRATT, KANSAS AND BROKEN BOW, NEBRASKA _ These may be boom times
in America, but some people feel the hoopla has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In Pratt County, Kan., a farming area that lies about an hour by
road from Wichita, one of the consuming worries is what to do when
you need a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt County's population is growing older: not just because of
the normal passage of time, but because the young folk tend to
leave to find work in the cities and their suburbs. Yet there are
few doctors around _ 14 of them, seven general practitioners and
seven specialists, for 9,000 people _ and few hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to driving long distances to see a doctor used
to be a home visit, with medical tests performed then and there
and, if the patient qualified, the chance of a home-health aide to
give a little extra help with meals and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   But home visits have fallen victim, since 1997, to general cuts
in federal health-care spending.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, four companies that provided home-health
services in Pratt County have gone out of business. In turn, those
closures have pushed county-financed programs to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   With home visits disappearing, patients are increasingly using
the medical system only when they become seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this change is that patients either are not
receiving services, are being readmitted to hospitals much more
often, or are being admitted to nursing homes,'' says Susan Page,
president of the Pratt Regional Medical Center, a private,
nonprofit hospital in Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   The first option increases suffering; the other two are
potentially much more expensive. Rural hospitals are anyway in
difficulties. With few people to serve, it is hard for a hospital
to earn back its original capital outlay and keep pace with new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Page says her hospital is doing fine, mainly because federal
officials have deemed it a ``sole community provider'' in isolated
Pratt County. This means it gets better rates of reimbursement from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the hospital's billings are paid by federal
programs, either Medicare (for the elderly) or Medicaid (for the
poor). And several other programs have helped to cushion the effect
of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical access hospital'' can get financial incentives to
focus on primary care and emergency-room services rather than the
more expensive (but also potentially more lucrative) longer-term
acute care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital judged ``Medicare-dependent'' _ in other words, with
a lot of elderly patients _ can earn higher reimbursements than
usual. Others get more money because, though most of their patients
are country people, the hospital itself is close enough to a city
to be affected by inflated prices and wages.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hospitals in Kansas fall into one or
other of these categories. On the whole, though, federal
reimbursements to rural hospitals are lower than those made to
urban hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this makes sense; the countryside is a cheaper
place to live. Yet expensive hospital equipment is no cheaper to
buy, and in states such as Nebraska _ which has one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the country _ a shortage of medical
technicians has led to severe salary inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional increases in the reimbursements, rural health
officials say, have not solved the problem. ``These jobs require up
to two years of training, and nursing programs take three to four
years of training, so we're really competing with the higher-paying
urban areas for the same people,'' says Michael Steckler, the
president of the Jennie Melham Medical Center in Broken Bow, Neb.
(population 3,800).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steckler's hospital, which is an hour away from the nearest
equivalent medical center, is dependent on federal payments for
about three-quarters of its billings.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of doctors. For a highly trained
professional coming out of medical school with a big debt to pay,
rural postings are not the most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are lower, culture markedly scarcer and jobs for
educated spouses nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Rural doctors also have to be a cross between a missionary and a
cowboy. They are on call more often, because the duties cannot
easily be spread among colleagues; and without the backup of
medical specialists they must themselves become specialists in many
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because rural communities are so small, doctors must often cope
with the strain of getting involved in all aspects of their
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   They must even be prepared to accept odd forms of payment. Paul
Paulman, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC) in Omaha, recalls once receiving a pig for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rural regions have some selling points, including a
calmer pace of life and low crime rates; and some doctors like the
idea of being generalists. But this is not enough to keep rural
areas supplied with medical talent.
</P>
<P>
   So Nebraska, for one, has been trying a different tack. For 50
years, UNMC has been sending its medical students out to rural
areas for short-term appointments.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, it added some new ideas. One is a rural
residency program, in which students spend the last two years of
their training in a country district, first in a very small
community medical clinic, then in a somewhat larger town with a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another program offers undergraduates early guarantees of a
place in medical school if they are willing to practice in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   These measures have been quite successful. Of the 19 students
who enrolled in the rural residency program, 17 have stayed on as
country doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But because rural medical students are still lost to the big
cities each year, UNMC is now trying to hook them at an even
earlier stage, in high school, where information about a career in
medicine is now included in the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   As Roxanna Lynn Jokela, coordinator of the UNMC program, puts
it, ``If you're from a community without a physician, or if you
don't know what a medical technologist does, how can you become
interested in them?'' &QL;

<P>
   PRATT, KANSAS AND BROKEN BOW, NEBRASKA _ These may be boom times
in America, but some people feel the hoopla has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In Pratt County, Kan., a farming area that lies about an hour by
road from Wichita, one of the consuming worries is what to do when
you need a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt County's population is growing older: not just because of
the normal passage of time, but because the young folk tend to
leave to find work in the cities and their suburbs. Yet there are
few doctors around _ 14 of them, seven general practitioners and
seven specialists, for 9,000 people _ and few hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to driving long distances to see a doctor used
to be a home visit, with medical tests performed then and there
and, if the patient qualified, the chance of a home-health aide to
give a little extra help with meals and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   But home visits have fallen victim, since 1997, to general cuts
in federal health-care spending.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, four companies that provided home-health
services in Pratt County have gone out of business. In turn, those
closures have pushed county-financed programs to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   With home visits disappearing, patients are increasingly using
the medical system only when they become seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this change is that patients either are not
receiving services, are being readmitted to hospitals much more
often, or are being admitted to nursing homes,'' says Susan Page,
president of the Pratt Regional Medical Center, a private,
nonprofit hospital in Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   The first option increases suffering; the other two are
potentially much more expensive. Rural hospitals are anyway in
difficulties. With few people to serve, it is hard for a hospital
to earn back its original capital outlay and keep pace with new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Page says her hospital is doing fine, mainly because federal
officials have deemed it a ``sole community provider'' in isolated
Pratt County. This means it gets better rates of reimbursement from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the hospital's billings are paid by federal
programs, either Medicare (for the elderly) or Medicaid (for the
poor). And several other programs have helped to cushion the effect
of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical access hospital'' can get financial incentives to
focus on primary care and emergency-room services rather than the
more expensive (but also potentially more lucrative) longer-term
acute care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital judged ``Medicare-dependent'' _ in other words, with
a lot of elderly patients _ can earn higher reimbursements than

Stewart's zest-filled life remembered
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ You remember the oddest things at times like
this. Moments that made the man. Things you took for granted or
thought were long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   On display Friday morning inside the huge sanctuary at First
Baptist Church of Orlando was a collection of the stuff that was
William Payne Stewart. A picture of him hugging the U.S. Open
trophy he won in June. Gold-framed paintings of his family. A
collage of newspaper and magazine clippings about his career. A
note from his two kids, daughter Chelsea and son Aaron, saying:
``We love you dad. We will miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   And there, tucked amid the mementos and his favorite harmonica,
a bottle of Rogaine was left by his kids, because Payne Stewart was
no different than any other middle-aged man. He worried about those
skid marks his hairline was leaving on its race from forehead to
scalp. And because apples never fall far from trees, his kids would
give him grief about it. Stewart certainly wouldn't think twice
about needling Tom Lehman, Paul Azinger or anybody else who was
follicely challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne Stewart was just a regular guy,'' said Pastor J.B.
Collingsworth, ``who happened to be a great golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what made his life worth honoring. And the people who
lived, laughed, cried with and loved Payne Stewart for his entire
42 years gathered Friday to do it all again during the service
celebrating the PGA Tour player who died Monday in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the party in heaven begin,'' said Tracey Stewart, Payne's
wife who spoke bravely and tearfully for nearly 10 minutes during
the most touching part of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stewart's zest for life was what his friends will
remember, even more than his syrupy-smooth golf swing. Stewart's
fun-loving lifestyle, his devotion to family and faith, his
affinity for good wine and good song, and his flair for doing
everything with a certain style were remembered during the two-hour
ceremony at the church where he was a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you celebrate the life of the greatest celebrator of
life?'' said Austin's Chuck Cook, who was Stewart's close friend
and coach. ``I can just imagine how much louder heaven is going to
be now.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people tapped deep into the emotional vault, led by
Stewart's widow, who not only found strength to speak Friday but
also to attend the funeral Thursday for Robert Fraley, the agent
and close friend of Stewart who was also on the doomed plane along
with four other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw Payne was at a cocktail party at the
Malaysian Open in 1980,'' Tracey said. ``I saw him, and he was the
most beautiful man I had ever seen. It really was love at first
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after 18 years of marriage, he's still the most beautiful
man I know. Not because of the way he looks on the outside. But
because of the way I know he looks on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to 100 PGA Tour players attended the service, including
most of the 29 golfers participating in the Tour Championship at
Champions Golf Club. The tournament will resume today with 27
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups in the service that was open to the public and
drew a crowd of 3,000 in the 6,000-seat church was the Pop Warner
football team on which Aaron Stewart, 10, plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much to my despair that Aaron wanted to play
football,'' Tracey said. ``But little did I know how much joy would
come from it for Payne and Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught three passes, all of them for touchdowns. The last
one was on Saturday (last week), and Payne was there to cheer
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Tracey Stewart and Cook, Paul Azinger was one of the
featured speakers during the tribute. Azinger, who survived a
battle with cancer in 1993, put the large audience in a Payne frame
of mind when he approached the podium and pulled a tam-o'-shanter
out of his jacket pocket and put it on his head.
</P>
<P>
   He then pulled the pant legs of his suit up and tucked them into
argyle socks, giving him a Stewart-looking pair of makeshift
knickers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded. Then Azinger opened his heart about
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to accept the magnitude of this tragedy is the most
difficult thing I've ever had to do,'' he said. ``Payne Stewart has
finished the race. He has kept the faith, and now the crown of
righteousness is his.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger, who also was represented by Fraley, said the same
phrase for Fraley and Van Ardan during his 20 minutes at the podium
that was half monologue and half tear-jerking storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne wasn't the most mechanically inclined person,'' Azinger
said. ``I remember he got an endorsement for a weed whacker a few
years ago. And when I got to his house the other day, the yard was
looking so good I thought about the weed-whacker deal. We all knew
full well that Payne didn't know how to even start that weed
whacker.''
</P>
<P>
   The wonderfully done ceremony also featured a recorded musical
tribute from country music star Vince Gill, who wrote Hey God _ A
Tribute to Payne this week in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   During the past couple of years, Stewart could never be found
without having a modest bracelet on his wrist made out of fabric
imprinted with the initials W.W.J.D. _ What Would Jesus Do? Friday,
similar bracelets were given to everyone in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gift from Aaron,'' said Pastor Jim Henry. ``And it
came to represent how Payne wanted to live his life. He told me
after he won the U.S. Open that he wanted to do what Jesus would do
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf can stand for different things. It can stand for Go Out,
Lost Forever. Or, it can stand for God Offers Love, Forgiveness.
God's going to call us all home someday. And Payne had opened up
his heart to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Other musical tributes and a video of Stewart highlights and
insights ensured dry eyes were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   During the video, an interview with Stewart summed up perfectly
his devotion to God and family that had become so strong in the
past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about dreams is that sometimes you can live them
out,'' Stewart said. ``If something happened tomorrow, and I
couldn't play golf anymore, my life is complete, because I have a
wonderful family, and I am so happy about being a good father and
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the pulpit, a framed Bible passage from the 40th chapter of
Isaiah was displayed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and
fall. But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow
weary. They will walk and not be faint.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, underneath the inscription, read: Payne soared with eagles
and awakened in the arms of God.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the ceremony was a time for a complete
outpouring of support to Tracey Stewart and the two children who
will have to build a lifetime of memories about their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an interview with Payne a couple days ago, and he was
asked what he thought his legacy would be,'' Tracey said. ``He
said, `I didn't even know I had a legacy.' But those two kids will
be his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they wanted to shoot hoops or play softball or throw
the football, he was right there to do it with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Aaron and Chelsea are gifted with their father's athletic
abilities. And I know he'll be there on the front row shouting
encouragement to them for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, the PGA Tour players attending gave
one final tribute, lining the center aisle of the church and
offering personal greetings to the families of Stewart, Fraley and
Ardan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service was just beautiful,'' Lehman said. ``The messages
were very heartfelt. Obviously, Payne has about a zillion great
fans and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus attended, but Arnold Palmer did not. Palmer's wife
has been ill for some time, and he has limited his public
appearances of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to remember the rhythm of Payne's swing and
his love of life,'' Nicklaus said. ``Payne was all about having
fun. He had a lot of fun in life and in golf. He even knew how to
have fun when he was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger was among Stewart's closest friends on tour. And while
everybody will search for ways to cope with Stewart's loss, Azinger
tried to offer some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the land of the living who are going to the land
of the dying,'' Azinger said. ``We're in the land of the dying who
are going to the land of the living.''

Champions' stillness serves as tribute
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JAYNE CUSTRED
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The bleachers next to the No. 1 tee at Champions Golf Club were
empty Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Silence echoed down the first fairway, broken only by the hum of
maintenance carts as they hurried down the pathways, or the steady
beat of the flags at half-staff and flapping in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The clock standing between No. 1 and No. 10 tees ticked off the
minutes as the second day of the 1999 Tour Championship came and
went without a stroke of golf played.
</P>
<P>
   Champions was saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,000 miles away, in a church in Orlando, Fla., those who
knew and loved Payne Stewart best, were remembering the man whose
life was taken so suddenly in Monday's plane crash. There were
emotional speeches and fitting tributes, tears and laughter and
music.
</P>
<P>
   But in Houston, where Stewart had planned to spend this week,
there was only silence. And that, perhaps, was the greatest tribute
of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to shut a big tournament like this down in
midstream,'' said Frank Watson, a parking lot security guard at
Champions who spent most of Friday not guarding much of anything.
``But Payne Stewart was a much-loved man. This was out of a deep
respect for him. And every one of us are feeling real bad about why
we're having this day off today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here like this is very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The course was ready, perfectly groomed, meticulously tended,
but squirrels ran where fans should have walked, and nothing landed
on the greens except an occasional bird.
</P>
<P>
   The ropes that are such a necessary part of a tournament of this
magnitude stretched endlessly down the fairways as usual, but
looked strangely out of place on a deserted tract.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate tents, normally rowdy and loud by Friday
afternoon, were dark and empty. The faint roar of cars traveling in
the distance replaced the usual din of laughter, raised voices and
spiritedings under thul eyes of diehard fans. Instead, there was
the sound of a mower cutting an already perfect fairway on an
already perfect course.
</P>
<P>
   And missing was the spirit of the game. The camaraderie, the
sportsmanship, the essence of what makes golf so different and
unique. Instead, there was a void, and the hollow, empty feeling
that comes with having just 29 players to fill a 30-man field.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the Champions clubhouse is the bronze statue of a young
boy swinging a golf club, clad in Stewart-like knickers, his eyes
looking off to the distance. The much-beloved statue, which is
surrounded by the brightest of flowers, is called ``Tomorrow's
Child,'' and depicts a young golfer with a bright future and
endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few yards away, also covered in flowers, was the empty
parking spot bearing the name of Payne Stewart, the U.S. Open
champion who brought laughter, then silence, to the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the rest of the golfers will return to Champions. The
stands will fill up once more, fans will spill out of the corporate
tents to watch the best in the game, and the tournament will go on.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, in the most fitting way possible, Champions said
goodbye.

<P>
   PRATT, KANSAS AND BROKEN BOW, NEBRASKA _ These may be boom times
in America, but some people feel the hoopla has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In Pratt County, Kan., a farming area that lies about an hour by
road from Wichita, one of the consuming worries is what to do when
you need a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt County's population is growing older: not just because of
the normal passage of time, but because the young folk tend to
leave to find work in the cities and their suburbs. Yet there are
few doctors around _ 14 of them, seven general practitioners and
seven specialists, for 9,000 people _ and few hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to driving long distances to see a doctor used
to be a home visit, with medical tests performed then and there
and, if the patient qualified, the chance of a home-health aide to
give a little extra help with meals and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   But home visits have fallen victim, since 1997, to general cuts
in federal health-care spending.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, four companies that provided home-health
services in Pratt County have gone out of business. In turn, those
closures have pushed county-financed programs to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   With home visits disappearing, patients are increasingly using
the medical system only when they become seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this change is that patients either are not
receiving services, are being readmitted to hospitals much more
often, or are being admitted to nursing homes,'' says Susan Page,
president of the Pratt Regional Medical Center, a private,
nonprofit hospital in Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   The first option increases suffering; the other two are
potentially much more expensive. Rural hospitals are anyway in
difficulties. With few people to serve, it is hard for a hospital
to earn back its original capital outlay and keep pace with new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Page says her hospital is doing fine, mainly because federal
officials have deemed it a ``sole community provider'' in isolated
Pratt County. This means it gets better rates of reimbursement from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the hospital's billings are paid by federal
programs, either Medicare (for the elderly) or Medicaid (for the
poor). And several other programs have helped to cushion the effect
of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical access hospital'' can get financial incentives to
focus on primary care and emergency-room services rather than the
more expensive (but also potentially more lucrative) longer-term
acute care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital judged ``Medicare-dependent'' _ in other words, with
a lot of elderly patients _ can earn higher reimbursements than
usual. Others get more money because, though most of their patients
are country people, the hospital itself is close enough to a city
to be affected by inflated prices and wages.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hospitals in Kansas fall into one or
other of these categories. On the whole, though, federal
reimbursements to rural hospitals are lower than those made to
urban hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this makes sense; the countryside is a cheaper
place to live. Yet expensive hospital equipment is no cheaper to
buy, and in states such as Nebraska _ which has one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the country _ a shortage of medical
technicians has led to severe salary inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional increases in the reimbursements, rural health
officials say, have not solved the problem. ``These jobs require up
to two years of training, and nursing programs take three to four
years of training, so we're really competing with the higher-paying
urban areas for the same people,'' says Michael Steckler, the
president of the Jennie Melham Medical Center in Broken Bow, Neb.
(population 3,800).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steckler's hospital, which is an hour away from the nearest
equivalent medical center, is dependent on federal payments for
about three-quarters of its billings.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of doctors. For a highly trained
professional coming out of medical school with a big debt to pay,
rural postings are not the most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are lower, culture markedly scarcer and jobs for
educated spouses nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Rural doctors also have to be a cross between a missionary and a
cowboy. They are on call more often, because the duties cannot
easily be spread among colleagues; and without the backup of
medical specialists they must themselves become specialists in many
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because rural communities are so small, doctors must often cope
with the strain of getting involved in all aspects of their
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   They must even be prepared to accept odd forms of payment. Paul
Paulman, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC) in Omaha, recalls once receiving a pig for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rural regions have some selling points, including a
calmer pace of life and low crime rates; and some doctors like the
idea of being generalists. But this is not enough to keep rural
areas supplied with medical talent.
</P>
<P>
   So Nebraska, for one, has been trying a different tack. For 50
years, UNMC has been sending its medical students out to rural
areas for short-term appointments.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, it added some new ideas. One is a rural
residency program, in which students spend the last two years of
their training in a country district, first in a very small
community medical clinic, then in a somewhat larger town with a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another program offers undergraduates early guarantees of a
place in medical school if they are willing to practice in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   These measures have been quite successful. Of the 19 students
who enrolled in the rural residency program, 17 have stayed on as
country doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But because rural medical students are still lost to the big
cities each year, UNMC is now trying to hook them at an even
earlier stage, in high school, where information about a career in
medicine is now included in the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   As Roxanna Lynn Jokela, coordinator of the UNMC program, puts
it, ``If you're from a community without a physician, or if you
don't know what a medical technologist does, how can you become
interested in them?'' &QL;

CONSUMER ISSUES FACE FUNERAL HOME DIRECTORS AT KC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
 HOME INDUSTRY 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Around 6,000 U.S. funeral home directors will
be in Kansas City next week for their annual convention and trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day event begins on Halloween, but the nation's
undertakers are already plenty frightened by industry critics who
have been after them all year. And the worst may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in fear'' of the Federal Trade Commission's Funeral
Rule, which can bring six-figure fines, said Ronald E. Troyer, a
Minnesota funeral home manager and one of six national spokesmen
for the 14,000-member National Funeral Directors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Though its provisions are many, the heart of the 15-year-old
Funeral Rule is its requirement that anyone who asks must be
provided a written copy of a funeral home's general price list. The
rule has helped an increasing percentage of Americans who now
comparison-shop funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   And, Troyer said, the FTC rule may be cinched even tighter in
response to critics who say funeral customers often are misled and
manipulated in their time of grief, and pressured into buying
services that are overpriced or that they don't need or don't want.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the FTC has heard hundreds of hours of testimony
and next year plans to rewrite and reissue its consumer rights
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on Aging, is promising congressional hearings
next year after what he called ``disturbing questions'' raised in a
General Accounting Office audit released last week.
</P>
<P>
   That report, performed at Republican Grassley's request, found
FTC oversight of the funeral industry to be spotty and weak.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC disputed the findings and said compliance with consumer
protection rules had improved.
</P>
<P>
   But FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky also said: ``Our experience has
demonstrated that we are able to accomplish a good deal by working
with industry groups...by cultivating harmonious rather than
acrimonious relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the industry, he said, have developed ``a remedial
rather than a punitive law enforcement program that is more
effective in stimulating compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley suggests that might not be good enough: ``We want to
know how the FTC can assure consumers of fair treatment when they
walk into a funeral home. When consumers shell out thousands of
dollars for a service, they should get what they pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Troyer and Kelly Smith, another association spokesman, say
consumers not only get their money's worth but are getting more for
their money today than a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals have evolved, said Troyer, from mostly straightforward,
faith-based memorial services to celebrations of the deceased's
life. And funeral directors who genuinely care about their
customers are the ones who make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals, he said, have become ``a theater experience'' that aid
in the healing process for the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   Troyer recounted a recent funeral he performed for a truck
driver who was known for the unique belt buckle he always wore.
</P>
<P>
   He said long _ and cathartic _ talks with the family gave him
enough material for a 20-minute eulogy that played off that belt
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   But Troyer wasn't done. He then turned to his funeral home's
library of stereophonic sound effects to close the service with the
throaty rumble of a diesel engine firing up.
</P>
<P>
   And then, mimicking an up-and-down pulling motion, he said, ``We
sounded the air horn. Whoo, whoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a dry eye in the house, because that was a
wonderful memory for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, too, have their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Carlson, executive director of the consumer-based Funeral
and Memorial Societies of America and one of the industry's most
persistent watchdogs, was among 150 people who testified on the FTC
Funeral Rule earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   She recounted tales of families charged $200 to fax obituary
information to the local newspaper, and funeral homes charging $600
or more to handle the donation of bodies to medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrywide practices are contrary to the letter and spirit
of the Funeral Rule,'' she said, and ``continue to impose
unwarranted and anti-competitive costs on funeral consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two issues dominate the Funeral Rule controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The first is whether to expand the rule to cover cemeteries,
monument dealers, retail coffin outlets and other product and
service providers. On that issue, consumers and the funeral homes
agree that the playing field should be level for all.

MAHAFFEY, JACOBS LEAD PACIFIC BELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It has been a time for mourning and remembrance
this week in golf. But Friday at the Wilshire Country Club, it was
time to play.
</P>
<P>
   John Jacobs and John Mahaffey each shot 6-under-par 65s to share
the first-round lead in the $1.2 million Pacific Bell Senior
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   It was an especially difficult day for Mahaffey. He was a close
friend to Payne Stewart, who perished in a plane crash in Mina,
S.D. earlier this week and was honored in the form of black ribbons
on the hats and shirts of the field Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey, like most of his fellow competitors, watched the
Orlando, Fla., memorial service for Stewart early Friday.
Afterward, the 51-year-old barely had the strength to tee it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely difficult to play golf today,'' he said.
``Especially when you're watching the service, and a lot of grown
men are crying. You lose one of your own like that, it really,
really hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't sound jovial today ... I'm happy with the round,
but really saddened by the loss of a great friend and great
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   On the demanding par-71, 6,575-yard layout, Mahaffey played the
back nine in 5-under 31 to forge a tie with the long-hitting
Jacobs, who finished moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey loves the course, particularly its fast greens. Jacobs
said he is fearful of Wilshire because it doesn't suit his game.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who leads the tour in driving distance at just less than
290 yards, hit only three drivers Friday in his no-bogey round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to stay away from it,'' Jacobs said with a grin. ``It's
not my kind of course because it's narrow. A friend of mine would
say, `Hey, let's go play Wilshire.' I'd say, `I'll catch up to you
on a different course.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot a 65 ... maybe I'm getting smarter in my old age.''
</P>
<P>
   He's getting healthier, too. The 54-year-old recently underwent
a couple of minor operations to remove scar tissue from his right
elbow and wrist. He said he had been playing ``terrible'' golf for
the past eight weeks _ until his second-round 63 in last week's
Kaanapali Classic in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he still feels pain, but he has learned to put up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only really hurts to hit a wedge or 9-iron,'' he said. ``It
doesn't hurt to hit a driver. `But that's no big deal. Everybody
hurts in some way out here.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot behind the leaders was Bruce Summerhays at 5-under 66,
followed by Jim Thorpe, Gary Player (who turns 64 on Monday), Lee
Trevino and Dave Stockton at 67.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Joe Inman was in a large group at 3-under 68
that also included leading seven-time winner Bruce Fleisher, Hale
Irwin and Gil Morgan. Chi Chi Rodriguez and Jim Colbert were in a
group at 69.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire CC layout has been reworked this year, to where
this year's 18th hole, a 162-yard par three, was last year's No.
10. This year's holes 10-through-17 were last year's 11-through-18.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the par-three finale promises to cause plenty of
drama, according to Summerhays.
</P>
<P>
   It provided plenty for the 55-year-old father of eight, who left
what he thought was a perfect nine-iron tee shot buried in the
front bunker. He blasted out to 20 feet and made the putt for a
par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy to get it out to 20 feet,'' he said. ``That
little par three will take its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerhays had, perhaps, an even more critical hole on the
par-4, 321-yard 14th hole. He left his tee shot in the trees and,
instead of playing it safe in the fairway and taking his chances
for par, he negotiated his approach through a small opening to
within 12 feet. He made the putt and played his final five holes in
three-under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everything that could go right for me did go
right,'' Summerhays said. ``It was a pleasant day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ How did George Ryan, the avuncular governor of
Illinois, get on in Cuba? The answer is that, as the first American
governor to go there in 40 years, he did rather well.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan believes the American embargo has failed; as he put it,
``Isolating Cuba is not in the best interests of Illinois or in the
best interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he certainly does not believe in
mollycoddling Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader, or in concealing his own
democratic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Ryan arrived at his Havana hotel than he stepped
out of his Ford Grand Marquis (impressively newfangled, for Cuba)
and waded into the crowd of onlookers to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told the story to the president of the National
Assembly, explaining that his natural impulse was to treat the
crowd like voters. He then added, ``Maybe they can be voters
someday, Mr. President'' _ at which point all members of the press
were rapidly ushered out of the room by anxious Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with a small group of dissidents, Ryan
told Cuban and American journalists that ``basically... the problem
with Cuba is Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a Cuban about the criticism he may endure at home
for speaking out against the American embargo, the governor shot
back, ``It's a free country. I can say whatever I want.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his Cuban hosts after a tour of a children's hospital
that the hospital would be shut down if it were in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's jabs at the regime did not disqualify him and selected
members of his delegation from a seven-hour audience with Castro,
in which he, and occasionally they, ranged over everything from
baseball to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The governor managed to get one concession from the president _
or, more surprisingly, Senator Jesse Helms managed to extract one.
At Helms's request, a seven-year-old Cuban boy was allowed to fly
back to the United States with the delegation to receive treatment
for liver disease in North Carolina, where he has relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was also filled with talk of potential trade between
Cuba and Illinois. That was the point of it.
</P>
<P>
   The small but influential anti-Cuba lobby, based primarily in
Miami, at last has a counterweight in the shape of Midwest farmers
(and related agribusinesses) who have been hit by low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The private groups represented in the governor's delegation tell
the story: John Deere, Caterpillar, Archer Daniels Midland, the
Illinois Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois House of Representatives was the first state
legislature to pass a unanimous resolution calling for Congress to
lift the ban on the delivery of food and medicine to Cuba, a
country that imports roughly $800 million a year in food products,
some from as far away as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers, closer and more efficient, reckon they could
quickly gain much of that market. Farmers have long complained that
they carry a disproportionate share of the cost of America's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department reckons that food embargoes around
the globe cost them $1.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is not alone. Earlier this autumn, the Senate voted 70-28
to tack an amendment on to the annual agricultural appropriations
bill that would have ended all prohibitions on the sale of food and
medicine and required congressional approval for any such sanctions
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by John Ashcroft, a Republican from
Missouri, and supported by a bipartisan coalition of other
farm-belt senators, ran into anti-Castro fury in the House and was
left out of the final farm bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the same senators hoped to pass it as a separate measure at
the end of October and to try to persuade the House again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   These actions suggest ``a silent seismic shift'' in thinking
towards Cuba, says Philip Peters, vice-president of the Lexington
Institute and a former State Department official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in the embargo will have to come from Washington. But
the trip has done Ryan no harm in Illinois. Local farmers feel they
are being listened to, and local Latinos mostly seem to have
approved of the trip (the complaints came from Florida).
</P>
<P>
   There is still some doubt as to how Cuba would ever pay for all
those imports from Illinois, if they appeared; the regime is as
desperate for hard currency as ever. But Illinois is at least
standing ready, at the head of the line, for the day when the gates
open. &QL;

   HAVANA _ How did George Ryan, the avuncular governor of
Illinois, get on in Cuba? The answer is that, as the first American
governor to go there in 40 years, he did rather well.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan believes the American embargo has failed; as he put it,
``Isolating Cuba is not in the best interests of Illinois or in the
best interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he certainly does not believe in
mollycoddling Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader, or in concealing his own
democratic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Ryan arrived at his Havana hotel than he stepped
out of his Ford Grand Marquis (impressively newfangled, for Cuba)
and waded into the crowd of onlookers to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told the story to the president of the National
Assembly, explaining that his natural impulse was to treat the
crowd like voters. He then added, ``Maybe they can be voters
someday, Mr. President'' _ at which point all members of the press
were rapidly ushered out of the room by anxious Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with a small group of dissidents, Ryan
told Cuban and American journalists that ``basically... the problem
with Cuba is Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a Cuban about the criticism he may endure at home
for speaking out against the American embargo, the governor shot
back, ``It's a free country. I can say whatever I want.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his Cuban hosts after a tour of a children's hospital
that the hospital would be shut down if it were in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's jabs at the regime did not disqualify him and selected
members of his delegation from a seven-hour audience with Castro,
in which he, and occasionally they, ranged over everything from
baseball to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The governor managed to get one concession from the president _
or, more surprisingly, Senator Jesse Helms managed to extract one.
At Helms's request, a seven-year-old Cuban boy was allowed to fly
back to the United States with the delegation to receive treatment
for liver disease in North Carolina, where he has relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was also filled with talk of potential trade between
Cuba and Illinois. That was the point of it.
</P>
<P>
   The small but influential anti-Cuba lobby, based primarily in
Miami, at last has a counterweight in the shape of Midwest farmers
(and related agribusinesses) who have been hit by low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The private groups represented in the governor's delegation tell
the story: John Deere, Caterpillar, Archer Daniels Midland, the
Illinois Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois House of Representatives was the first state
legislature to pass a unanimous resolution calling for Congress to
lift the ban on the delivery of food and medicine to Cuba, a
country that imports roughly $800 million a year in food products,
some from as far away as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers, closer and more efficient, reckon they could
quickly gain much of that market. Farmers have long complained that
they carry a disproportionate share of the cost of America's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department reckons that food embargoes around
the globe cost them $1.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is not alone. Earlier this autumn, the Senate voted 70-28
to tack an amendment on to the annual agricultural appropriations
bill that would have ended all prohibitions on the sale of food and
medicine and required congressional approval for any such sanctions
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by John Ashcroft, a Republican from
Missouri, and supported by a bipartisan coalition of other
farm-belt senators, ran into anti-Castro fury in the House and was
left out of the final farm bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the same senators hoped to pass it as a separate measure at
the end of October and to try to persuade the House again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   These actions suggest ``a silent seismic shift'' in thinking
towards Cuba, says Philip Peters, vice-president of the Lexington
Institute and a former State Department official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in the embargo will have to come from Washington. But
the trip has done Ryan no harm in Illinois. Local farmers feel they
are being listened to, and local Latinos mostly seem to have
approved of the trip (the complaints came from Florida).
</P>
<P>
   There is still some doubt as to how Cuba would ever pay for all
those imports from Illinois, if they appeared; the regime is as
desperate for hard currency as ever. But Illinois is at least
standing ready, at the head of the line, for the day when the gates
open. &QL;

SOME IN KC THINK COW EXHIBIT LIKE CHICAGO'S WOULD BE UDDERLY
GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
 COWS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowrazy.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the climate in Chicago for the past five months, and
now there are those in Kansas City who are hoping for our own form
of mad-for-cows disease next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone missed the madness, Chicago has been gripped with
cow mania since June, when a herd of 320 acrylic Brown Swiss
bovines began grazing and lounging inside the city's famed Loop.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cows were decorated by artists _ some wildly
whimsical, others conspicuously commercial. Most have names,
including some that make you want to groan, or perhaps giggle _
such as Udder Gold, PiCowso and On the Moooooove. Starting Monday
most of them will be auctioned off for charity.
</P>
<P>
   The attention the cows have brought to Chicago has been
astounding.
</P>
<P>
   The officially named Cows on Parade has been covered by everyone
from the Jakarta Post to the Wisconsin State Farmer, brought more
publicity to Chicago than the 1996 Democratic National Convention
and generated up to $200 million in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been overwhelming but phenomenally successful,''
said Kimberly Costello of the Chicago Department of Cultural
Affairs, which brought the exhibit to Chicago. ``We never in a
million years dreamed it would turn into something this big.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Kansas City has such a grand plan for this area, but
in the minds of many, there's no reason why this city can't head up
a more modest cattle drive.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Holland, who's involved in area arts organizations, is one
of those blazing the trail for the local effort.
</P>
<P>
   Like many area residents who have seen or heard about the
exhibit, Holland wondered why Kansas City couldn't do something
similar. Given the city's heritage, it seems natural.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Louis says it's the gateway to the West, many
historians think the tag is more fitting for Kansas City. In the
later part of the 1800s, Kansas City is where civilization ended,
with many of the trails to the great West beckoning just beyond the
city's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kansas City was home to the second-largest livestock
industry in the nation, behind only Chicago. The stench emanating
from the stockyards was often referred to as the smell of money.
Indeed, in the early 1900s livestock accounted for 90 percent of
the value of everything produced in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kansas City is home to the Hereford Association; the
Dairy Farmers of America Inc., the country's largest dairy
cooperative; and Farmland Industries, the country's largest
agricultural cooperative, just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And what icon _ until perhaps the Bartle Hall baubles _ has been
more associated with Kansas City than the big plastic Hereford bull
lording over the city from downtown?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the American Royal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year will be the 101st American Royal,'' Holland said.
``I think it would be neat to have a tie-in with the 100 cows _ the
next 100 years of the American Royal.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland envisions the cows being placed throughout Kansas City
next summer, ranging from perhaps the River Market to the Plaza.
Then, in the fall, they could be rounded up to ride in the American
Royal Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could buy one of the Chicago cows, and it could be
carrying a suitcase with Chicago stickers, sort of the cows coming
home to Kansas City, to where they belong,'' Holland said. ``And
then maybe we could even get Kansas City Southern to bring them in
by train.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland is just brimming with ideas, and she isn't at all
worried that people will cringe at the perpetuation of Kansas
City's cow-town heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a cow town,'' Holland said. ``Not an ordinary cow town,
but a cow town nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chappell, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau
of Greater Kansas City, loves the idea of the exhibit but is less
comfortable with promoting Kansas City as a cow town.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he has a problem with the heritage. After all, his
organization touts the area's birthright to potential visitors all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   His problem is one of being misleading. And besides, he said,
when he thinks of cow town, he thinks of slow and backward, a
definition supported by most dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no horses tied to the side of buildings, and there
are no cows in the street _ except when Mike Murphy does his cattle
drive,'' Chappell said. ``We don't even have a lot of people who
wear cowboy hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a lot of Kansas City-area residents have a fear of what
writer Calvin Trillin, a Kansas City native, calls rubophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Wilson, director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, agrees
with Trillin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some here who are afraid people outside of Kansas
City will think they're rubes if they're associated with cows and
horses and things like that,'' he said. ``So they leave to others
their fright of being thought of as unsophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County hasn't let fear of rubophobia stop it from
using cows to tout its attractions. Everywhere _ on billboards,
golf balls, license plates and coffee cups _ are spotted cows
sporting sunglasses, touting the area as ``Not Your Ordinary
Cowtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schenkein, president and chief executive officer of the
Kansas City Kansas Area Chamber of Commerce, said he's not worried
about being tagged with a cow-town image because of the way the
campaign is set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow is the messenger, not the message,'' Schenkein said.
``We're proud to use a cow to bring the good news of what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas City does end up roping its own cow exhibit, it would
have Zurich to thank _ not Chicago. It was Zurich where 800-plus
Brown Swiss cows were first rounded up and exhibited in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A businessman saw the exhibit and brought the idea home to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in that city has been moooved by the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune's art critic, Alan G. Artner, wrote a piece
earlier this year titled: ``Here's the Beef: `Cows on Parade' Draws
Too Fine a Line Between Advertising and Art.''
</P>
<P>
   The critique began: ``Most everything I've heard and read about
`Cows on Parade,' the public art project that has taken over
Chicago in the last week, has been bull.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carol Becker, dean of the faculty at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago, finds the exhibit sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a big coloring book, you know, like
fill-in-the-blank cow,'' Becker said. ``It's not that interesting
of a project for artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mike Eggly, an investment banker who moved to
Chicago from New York just as the exhibit was beginning last
summer. Recently, in his own neighborhood, he saw a woman in a cow
outfit videotaping the cows. Eggly was astounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the attraction of the cow exhibit,''
Eggly said. ``I'm not anti-Chicago _ I'm anti cows.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many in Kansas City who think a stampede of
artistically painted and decorated cows would be a big boost for
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows spunk and confidence,'' said Wilson of the
Nelson-Atkins. ``We could use both.''

GARY BAUER: THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S JESSE JACKSON?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever you think of Gary Bauer's politics, you have to admit
that the man has pluck.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is slight and short _ five-foot-six to be exact _ in a
party that shops at Big and Tall. He is also a proletarian in a
party that is increasingly dominated by monied dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this son of an alcoholic caretaker is still in the race, and
on Oct. 28 he happily did battle in New Hampshire with the heir to
a publishing fortune, his natural debating skills honed by years of
defending what he regards as simple truths against the ridicule of
sophisticates on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is proof of the continuing influence of the religious
right on American politics. His campaign shares an office building
with a clutch of high-tech companies; he talks intelligently about
the way that interest groups are corrupting politics.
</P>
<P>
   But you only have to walk through his office door (which has had
a glass panel inserted into it so that he can be observed whenever
he has dealings with his female aides) or shake hands with his
campaign workers (who have the irritating cheerfulness that comes
with being born-again) to realize that he occupies a different
world from regular politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here as a presidential candidate,'' he likes to
declare on the campaign trail. ``I'm here as a sinner, at the foot
of the cross, saved only by the blood of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of talk was enough to give Bauer both a national
profile and a national organization. (The Family Research Council,
which he took over in 1988, built up a mailing list of 400,000 and
an annual income of $14 million.) It was also enough to give him a
respectable fourth place in the Iowa straw poll in August.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's fortunes should have enjoyed yet another boost on Oct.
25 when Pat Buchanan, a rival for the affections of social
conservatives, left the Republicans for the Reform Party. But it
was hard to talk to him the next day without suspecting that being
a champion of the religious right can be a prison as well as a
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered in his office, Bauer is keener to talk about the
virtues of the flat tax and the evils of China than he is about
bathing in the blood of Christ; and he mentions Ronald Reagan, a
president remembered more for his economic than his moral agenda,
so frequently that you get the impression that the Gipper has
agreed to accept a post as his running-mate.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates need to broaden their appeal, of course. But
Bauer's keenness to change the subject suggests that the religious
right is not the source of intellectual and emotional energy that
it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The armies of righteousness, which once threatened to overwhelm
the Republican Party, are downcast and despondent. One paradoxical
reason for their current despondency is what might be called the
sanctification of politics.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush talks of helping the poor through churches
rather than government, and Al Gore describes himself as a ``child
of the Kingdom,'' God's true anointed lose their cachet.
</P>
<P>
   And this sea-change in public debate has been accompanied by an
improvement in key cultural indicators. The murder rate is at its
lowest since 1967. The number of AIDS cases has decreased by more
than 50 percent since 1993. The welfare rolls have been reduced by
46.5 percent since 1994. There are now 243,000 fewer abortions a
year than there were at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to get exercised about slouching towards Gomorrah
when the slouching seems to be going in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many social conservatives who worry that they have
snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. For anyone who believes
that abortion is murder, even reduced numbers are an abomination _
particularly as seven of the current Supreme Court judges were
appointed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many hard-liners are convinced that they have been used as foot
soldiers of the Republican revolution but then consigned to the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are
currently working hard to prevent conservatives from attaching
abortion restrictions to appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is divided over its relationship with
mainstream politics, reliving, in a peculiar quirk of cultural
history, the divisions that tore apart the radical student movement
in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, who did more than anyone else to turn the Christian
Coalition into a political force, is the leader of the ``long march
through the institutions'' school. He is now an influential adviser
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, is the head
of the rejectionist school. He was so disgusted by the general
reaction to the Clinton scandal that he decided the best tactic for
Christians was to retreat from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is also divided over a more immediate issue:
whether to rally behind Bauer or Steve Forbes. The battle between
the two is arguably the bloodiest thing going on in politics at the
moment, and is about to get bloodier still, as the candidates
battle it out in the socially conservative states of Louisiana and
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer accuses Forbes of being a Johnny-come-lately to social
conservatism: his 1996 campaign ignored the subject entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are also lots of rumors of dirty deeds. Bauer had to
install his glass door because his former campaign chairman,
Charles Jarvis, complained that Bauer was spending time behind an
opaque one with a female assistant. Jarvis subsequently joined
Forbes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-door affair has obviously shaken Bauer. It cannot be
easy competing with Forbes's millions and Bush's extraordinary
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bauer clearly has a fighting chance against
Forbes, if not against Bush, and he clearly likes showing the rich
kids what he's made of.
</P>
<P>
   The better he does in the next few months, the more chance he
has of influencing Bush, who has already sounded many themes that
delight social conservatives (albeit shorn of the blood-and-thunder
rhetoric that sends them into the highest ecstasies).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns transformed him from
a spokesman for an interest group into a national political figure.
In Bauer's dogged campaign, America could be witnessing the making
of a Jesse Jackson of the right. &QL;

than 50 percent since 1993. The welfare rolls have been reduced by
46.5 percent since 1994. There are now 243,000 fewer abortions a
year than there were at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to get exercised about slouching towards Gomorrah
when the slouching seems to be going in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many social conservatives who worry that they have
snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. For anyone who believes
that abortion is murder, even reduced numbers are an abomination _
particularly as seven of the current Supreme Court judges were
appointed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many hard-liners are convinced that they have been used as foot
soldiers of the Republican revolution but then consigned to the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are
currently working hard to prevent conservatives from attaching
abortion restrictions to appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is divided over its relationship with
mainstream politics, reliving, in a peculiar quirk of cultural
history, the divisions that tore apart the radical student movement
in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, who did more than anyone else to turn the Christian
Coalition into a political force, is the leader of the ``long march
through the institutions'' school. He is now an influential adviser
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, is the head
of the rejectionist school. He was so disgusted by the general
reaction to the Clinton scandal that he decided the best tactic for
Christians was to retreat from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is also divided over a more immediate issue:
whether to rally behind Bauer or Steve Forbes. The battle between
the two is arguably the bloodiest thing going on in politics at the
moment, and is about to get bloodier still, as the candidates
battle it out in the socially conservative states of Louisiana and
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer accuses Forbes of being a Johnny-come-lately to social
conservatism: his 1996 campaign ignored the subject entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are also lots of rumors of dirty deeds. Bauer had to
install his glass door because his former campaign chairman,
Charles Jarvis, complained that Bauer was spending time behind an
opaque one with a female assistant. Jarvis subsequently joined
Forbes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-door affair has obviously shaken Bauer. It cannot be
easy competing with Forbes's millions and Bush's extraordinary
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bauer clearly has a fighting chance against
Forbes, if not against Bush, and he clearly likes showing the rich
kids what he's made of.
</P>
<P>
   The better he does in the next few months, the more chance he
has of influencing Bush, who has already sounded many themes that
delight social conservatives (albeit shorn of the blood-and-thunder
rhetoric that sends them into the highest ecstasies).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns transformed him from
a spokesman for an interest group into a national political figure.
In Bauer's dogged campaign, America could be witnessing the making
of a Jesse Jackson of the right. &QL;

TESTING THE LEGEND OF UNION STATION MASSACRE'S `BULLET HOLES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day during Union Station's restoration, a group of
preservation advisers toured the station with hardhats on.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jane Fifield Flynn split off from the group,
scurried out the front doors and stood facing one block of the
facade's granite wainscoting.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, a noted Jackson County historian, rubbed a hand gently
over the smooth, gray-colored finish, back and forth, searching.
Finally, she felt an indentation, a hole. She ran a finger around
it. Then she walked around the corner of the protruding wall and
fingered another hole.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she thought, they were still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' were the long-accepted artifacts of one of the city's
most shocking crimes _ the bullet holes from the Union Station
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn had first touched them as a child. She heard about them
from her parents and passed on the tale to subsequent generations.
Most everyone who spent childhood or adulthood in Kansas City has
heard about the famous holes and perhaps even poked a finger in
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely part of the folklore of Kansas City,'' said
William Worley, director of the Kansas City Regional History
Institute at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But are they really bullet holes?
</P>
<P>
   Are they in fact remnants of that bloody morning of June 17,
1933, when five men _ four of them law-enforcement officers _ were
gunned down in broad daylight in front of the station?
</P>
<P>
   As with most everything associated with the massacre, the truth
may come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Shootout
</P>
<P>
   On that infamous Saturday morning in 1933, seven lawmen escorted
gangster and Leavenworth escapee Frank Nash to a Chevrolet parked
in Union Station's front driveway. Nash had arrived on a train
after being caught in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawmen were getting in the car, three gunmen appeared
from nearby parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, bullets whizzed in and out of the Chevrolet,
shredding Nash's head inside the car, piercing one federal agent's
head outside the car, riddling a small-town police chief in the
back seat and dropping two Kansas City detectives next to the car.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the fusillade, another federal agent outside the
Chevrolet sprang to his feet and dashed for the station's east
front doors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gunmen turned and sprayed machine-gun fire in his
direction. As the agent ducked through the doors, bullets bounced
off the front of the building _ something the federal government's
investigative file later reported.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting stopped, the legend of the holes began.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were there at the time said they saw holes in the
granite,'' said Robert Unger, an authority on the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The story soon spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were children and raised by their fathers to put
their finger in the holes have raised their children to put their
finger in the holes,'' said Unger, a professor at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of such memories was one written to The Kansas City Star
earlier this year: ``My grandfather would take me down to the
station on Saturday afternoons to watch the trains come in. He
would always take me to the outside wall...`There's the bullet
holes' as he ran his hand down the front of each one. Sure enough,
there were holes in the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as Union Station reopens next month, the Gray Line bus
service intends to start a guided tour of Kansas City's gangster
past _ with the bullet holes as a highlight.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Testing holes
</P>
<P>
   This year, at the request of The Star, the Kansas City Police
Department's crime laboratory tested the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Newhouse, a senior criminalist, stood on a wood pallet
against Union Station's granite facade, holding a white cotton
swab. The swab contained a nitric acid solution, which can extract
lead off any surface it touches.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a gunshot's impact would have left some lead
residue in the holes that years of rainwater could not remove, said
Gary Howell, the crime lab's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was there, we would find it,'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   So Newhouse dabbed his swab into the first hole, about the size
of a quarter, tapering inward about half an inch, on a south-facing
wall. Then Newhouse dabbed a second swab on the second hole, about
the size of a marble, on a wall facing east.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Newhouse stood at a black lab table with sodium
rhodizonic acid. If the station swabs contained any lead, the acid
would turn their cotton tips a bright red. He dripped droplets on
the swabs. The cotton didn't change color. Negative _ no lead
traces.
</P>
<P>
   If the lead test were the one and only uncertainty with the
holes, the bullet myth might endure as just another mystery of the
massacre. But it's not. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   - The massacre criminals used machine guns that fired bullets in
rapid succession, yet the holes on Union Station's facade are
single indentations, not part of a string or circle of marks
expected from such gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   - Those two holes aren't the only ones on the station's
exterior. Two more holes the size of half-dollars are on the west
wing. This confirms that something else poked holes in the facade,
although no one knows what it was.
</P>
<P>
   - The east hole is around a corner from where the massacre
gunmen stood. This means it could only be caused by a ricochet,
which ballistics experts doubt.
</P>
<P>
   - As for the south hole, its half-inch depth is more consistent
with a bullet ripping into pine than granite.
</P>
<P>
   To prove this last point, John Cayton, a longtime ballistics
expert with the crime lab, conducted one more test. He obtained a
slab of the same granite on Union Station, a Barre Vermont gray. He
propped the slab against a fence on his farm and shot at it with
.45-caliber, copper-jacketed bullets from a carbine similar to what
the massacre guns were thought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets bounced off, revealing small scuffs, no
indentations.
</P>
<P>
   Cayton maintains a massacre bullet ``wouldn't cause the big chip
that's there'' on Union Station's granite.
</P>
<P>
   Still, purveyors of Kansas City folklore aren't ready to let the
myth die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn all the revisionists who ruin good stories,'' said Walt
Bodine, KCUR-FM talk-show host and dean of Kansas City
broadcasters. ``I want them to be bullet holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added UMKC's Worley: ``It doesn't matter what the tests show.
People are going to believe what they want to believe. That's the
nature of myth.''

MERGER NEWS TRIPLES DIGITAL'S STOCK

Merger news triples Digital's stock 
 
 
By Jason Z. Cohen 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS _ The inadvertent effect of a well-timed merger
announcement has propelled Digital Island's stock _ and the
excitement level around a Thousand Oaks Internet startup _ to
record levels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They couldn't have timed it better if they had tried to, but
Sandpiper Networks officials said their company's merger with the
San Francisco-based Digital Island wasn't timed to coincide with
Friday's initial public offering of its competitor, Akamai
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's reaction to Sandpiper's announcement it will merge
with publicly traded Digital Island looks like what you'd expect
from a stock making its public debut. Digital Island's stock has
risen from $23 on the Friday before the merger announcement to
Friday's close of $67.50. At one point Friday, shares hit $75.125.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a merger originally priced at $630 million
now is worth $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz surrounding Akamai's IPO is being credited with driving
the climb in Digital Island's stock as well. Akamai shares more
than quintupled in the fourth-hottest initial public offering ever.
</P>
<P>
   James Linnehan, stock analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners, said
the Sandpiper-Digital Island merger grew out of discussions between
the two companies over partnering their technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm for Akamai combined with the timing of the deal
_ that's what has been propelling Digital Island,'' Linnehan said.
``It's purely a serendipitous result.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Scott Yara, Sandpiper's vice president of marketing, said
of Digital Island's growing share price: ``That certainly was not
the intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Linnehan said he believes there is more punch left in Digital
Island's stock, even though it has risen to nearly three times its
prior value in the week following the merger announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has rewarded us in the short term for the
transaction. This is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Yara said. ``It
has been a very fun week _ it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper employees stand to benefit richly from the merger,
which still must receive regulatory and shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   The company has an employee stock ownership plan, the specifics
of which are not being made public while the merger is pending,
Yara said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger agreement, each share of Sandpiper stock will
be replaced with 1.07 shares of Digital Island stock, to a total of
27.4 million shares. At last week's price, that would have been
$630.2 million. At Friday's close, that values Sandpiper's total
shares at $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper's roughly 25.6 million shares are closely held by
management and employees, but Yara said the company has received
some $28 million in financing from venture capital firms, who have
some ownership stake.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While insisting they don't want to be movie
moguls or risk tax money on the next blockbuster, the Los Angeles
City Council has taken a step to try to halt runaway production.
</P>
<P>
   The council has asked for a report on how the city could create
a special fund to provide gap financing for television and movie
producers on low-budget productions to keep them in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important about this is that we want to send the
industry a message on how much we want them to stay here,'' said
Councilman Mike Hernandez, who made the proposal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, the city would create a revolving loan fund
to make money available at low interest to producers of films with
budgets of under $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about movies-of-the-week, and those productions
that are going to Canada because the costs are cheaper,'' Hernandez
said. ``If we can make some low-interest loans to them in return
for them doing a major percentage of their work in Los Angeles, it
will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the city would not seek any share in the value of
a film, but would insist that the producers provide a bond to
guarantee repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Morrie Goldman of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
said the proposal represented a major step in showing the
importance of the industry to local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many companies would use something like
this, but it's an important tool to have available,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association
questioned why the city would get into the business of financing
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Municipalities should not be in the movie business,'' Coupal
said. ``If they want to provide incentives, they can do it by
lessening regulations, not by creating a bank for them. This is an
ill-advised use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap financing is common in the industry to allow producers to
raise money to cover their production costs until those costs are
recouped.
</P>
<P>
   A recently released study, commissioned by the Screen Actors
Guild and Directors Guild of America, found that runaway
productions accounted for $10.3 billion in lost revenues and more
than 20,000 jobs. Through the first nine months this year, filming
at locations off studio lots declined 6 percent from the same
period of 1998 in Los Angeles County.

CONSUMER ISSUES FACE FUNERAL HOME DIRECTORS AT KC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
 HOME INDUSTRY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cemetery operators and the others may have a
different point of view when the issue comes to a head next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the rule stands, only funeral homes must disclose their price
lists.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in precisely what is listed and how that
information is presented to consumers to ensure that the list is
useful for comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for embalming, cremation, hearse rental and the like are
clear-cut and generally not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlson said consumer confusion and outrage abounds over the
rule's allowance for a ``nondeclinable basic service fee'' intended
to cover a funeral home's utilities, insurance and other costs of
doing business that are not itemized.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, she said, some homes list a low basic service fee
and pad other items on the general price list to make up the
difference. Others pad their overhead charge and discount itemized
services.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson calls it ``magical math'' and said her group's review of
price lists nationwide discloses ``a clear pattern of abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of those who drafted the Funeral Rule was the
nondeclinable fee would be modest,'' she said. ``Anything that is
nondeclinable takes away consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   She urges that the basic fee be eliminated and that those
charges be spread across the cost of each itemized product or
service.
</P>
<P>
   The industry will resist, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the present system is the best system for
consumers,'' he said, because it promotes accurate prices for
itemized goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Funeral and Memorial Society of Greater Kansas City surveys
funeral homes in the metropolitan area every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Its latest findings, released last summer, found the area's 60
funeral homes charged a mandatory basic fee that ranged from $690
to $2,700.

HERNANDEZ URGES LOANS FOR MOVIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While insisting they don't want to be movie
moguls or risk tax money on the next blockbuster, the Los Angeles
City Council has taken a step to try to halt runaway production.
</P>
<P>
   The council has asked for a report on how the city could create
a special fund to provide gap financing for television and movie
producers on low-budget productions to keep them in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important about this is that we want to send the
industry a message on how much we want them to stay here,'' said
Councilman Mike Hernandez, who made the proposal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, the city would create a revolving loan fund
to make money available at low interest to producers of films with
budgets of under $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about movies-of-the-week, and those productions
that are going to Canada because the costs are cheaper,'' Hernandez
said. ``If we can make some low-interest loans to them in return
for them doing a major percentage of their work in Los Angeles, it
will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the city would not seek any share in the value of
a film, but would insist that the producers provide a bond to
guarantee repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Morrie Goldman of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
said the proposal represented a major step in showing the
importance of the industry to local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many companies would use something like
this, but it's an important tool to have available,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association
questioned why the city would get into the business of financing
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Municipalities should not be in the movie business,'' Coupal
said. ``If they want to provide incentives, they can do it by
lessening regulations, not by creating a bank for them. This is an
ill-advised use of public funds.''

LITTLE AL CAN'T WAIT TO SEE INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Al Unser Jr. is heading home next year, and
make no mistake about it, home for the Albuquerque, N.M. resident
is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Unsers are the first family of Indy, with nine titles shared
between three men. Unser Jr. owns two of those titles, while his
father Al has four. Then there's uncle Bobby, who won the race
three times.
</P>
<P>
   But those accomplishments seem distant now, and in fact, they
happened in another racing era. The last Unser title at Indy was
Unser Jr.'s victory in 1994, before the open-wheel power struggle
that led to the formation of the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 now is the marquee race for the IRL, and the IRL is
the way Unser will get himself back to Indy.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers over the past three years suggest that a
career-worst slump was the reason Unser Jr. lost his ride with Team
Penske, Unser suggested that the switch to the IRL might have been
done regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be 38 in April and so I want to get back to
Indianapolis really bad,'' Unser said. ``It's time. It's time.
Their differences are going to be being just that and quite
frankly, I feel if you ask a majority of the CART drivers where
they want to be in five years from now, they want to be in (Formula
One). Myself, I want to be at Indianapolis, so I think CART is
taking off in a different direction than I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Unser already has gone in a direction he never
intended.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time PPG Cup champion (1990, '94) last won a race at
Vancouver in 1995 and his last finish of fourth or higher in the
points standings came the following year. Since then, Unser
finished 13th in the points standings in 1997 and 11th last year.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Unser's struggles have increased. He is 22nd in the
points standings with a season-best finish of fifth at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his recent struggles, other drivers recognize Unser's
importance to racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very helpful to me when I came here by giving me
suggestions,'' said Max Papis, an Italian driver in his fourth CART
season. ``I appreciated it and told him that I hoped I could race
with him for the lead in a race. It doesn't look like that will
happen now. I know he is a champion and he wrote a lot of the
history in motor racing, so I give him respect for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said driver Richie Hearn, ``He's done a lot here, but this is
just the way things work out. He always wanted to get back to the
Speedway. He'll be all right, he's a good driver.''
</P>
<P>
   That driving talent has shown up at sporadic moments in the past
few seasons, but there is much more affecting Unser than bad racing
luck. He not only is going through divorce, his 12-year-old
daughter Cody was stricken with Transverse Myelitis which caused
paralysis from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting time in my life,'' he said. ``There is the
tragedy with my little girl, which brings new challenges to my
everyday life. But Cody, her spirits are good and thanks to the
fans across America, they've really helped her spirits. Her
condition is about the same. We just have new challenges to ahead
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's Marlboro 500 is setting up to be Unser's CART
farewell, the single-season and career record-holder for earnings
still believes that he might one day be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really consider it my last CART race,'' Unser said.
``It would be really great if CART and IRL can put their
differences aside and reunite the open-wheel series. It would
enhance all of open-wheel racing. The sooner they get that done the
better off they would be.''

 Canadian Mounties to perform at American Royal event  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED FLETCHER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famous for their red coats, wide-brimmed hats and black mounts,
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will bring their precision
routine to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Mounties will perform their 25-minute ``Musical Ride''
during the intermission of the American Royal Rodeo starting today
through Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really excited about the Mounties coming,'' said
American Royal spokeswoman Colleen Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Mounties have not been here for 20 years, this could
be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 125 years, the Mounties' performance has entertained
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever we go people enjoy it,'' said Inspector J.J.
Gaudet.``They see how difficult it is to have 32 horses moving in
unison.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaudet, a 29-year veteran with the Canadian law enforcement
agency, is the team leader.
</P>
<P>
   In one portion of the show, four lines of horses and riders
approach the center at right angles.
</P>
<P>
   As the four horses pass through the center, they come within
inches of a horse moving from right to left in front of them. The
maneuver called ``thread the needle'' is the hardest to pull off
cleanly, riders said. The horses must trust their riders and resist
their instincts to avoid the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Other maneuvers include tight formations often seen by marching
bands, but seldom, if ever, seen on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   All of the riders must have three years of service in the law
enforcement agency before they are eligible to apply to be a member
of the Musical Ride, Gaudet said. Those selected take a five-week
basic riding course.
</P>
<P>
   The best of those riders will train for seven months before
beginning a three-year stint as a member of the Musical Ride,
Gaudet said. The riders and horses will then work three to four
hours a day for 16 weeks to learn the routine set to music.
</P>
<P>
   The horses are specifically bred for duty. The youngest horse
performing is 6 years old, and the oldest are 19 years old, Gaudet
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stables will be open to visitors for two hours before and
after each performance. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police will
perform during rodeo performances today through Nov. 6, except for
matinees Monday and Thursday.

MUTUAL FUND OWNERSHIP IS ON THE RISE

<P>
   Odd lots from a bulging column portfolio: Workers of the world
unite...in your quest for financial security! You have nothing to
lose but your worries about whether Social Security will be there
when you retire!
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Company Institute estimates that 48.4 million
U.S. households, or almost half, own mutual funds this year. That's
up almost 10 percent from last year, and more than 950 percent
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that most of the growth, the Institute
says, occurred in households with under $50,000 of income in which
the person most influencing the financial decisions is under 55.
Nearly 60 percent of the households owning mutual funds have
incomes between $25,000 and $74,999.
</P>
<P>
   The number of individual investors owning mutual funds,
meanwhile, hit nearly 83 million this year, which is a 7 percent
increase over 1998. Among the types of funds owned, 31 percent of
all households own stock funds, 24 own bond or hybrid funds, and 21
percent own money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 only 4.6 million households, or just under 6 percent,
owned funds.  &LR; brkstr  &LR; tx:The American Medical Association can be
excused if it's feeling double-crossed by the administration about
now. After the AMA backed the proposed Patients Bill of Rights
legislation, which would expose the health-care system to more
lawsuits, the White House has asked Congress for laws that would
steer Medicare patients to discount doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't quite the way the request is phrased, but what the
initiative amounts to is the first big push to transform all of
Medicare into a preferred-provider system. The proposal calls for
Medicare to set up a system under which those included on the
preferred list agree to charge lower rates for procedures and
services.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the health-care providers could make up
the difference on volume by treating more patients. All of which
sounds like what irks physicians most about private-sector plans.
The deal is they work harder and longer for less money, so those
who pay the bills can enhance their bottom lines.  &LR; brkstr  &LR; tx:If
the federal government can pay down the publicly held portion of
the national debt, everything will be hunky-dory, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well...maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   A little-publicized wrinkle of less marketable debt is the
challenge it presents for the Treasury Department. The market for
Treasury securities is one of the most important debt markets in
the financial world. As such, it is critical to ensure that it
remains as liquid as possible, which means investors are assured
that they can buy and sell whenever the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   If the publicly held debt component shrinks to under $1 trillion
over the next decade, as anticipated, a Congressional Budget Office
report predicts Treasury will be under greater pressure to
concentrate debt in fewer issues.
</P>
<P>
   One of the expected benefits of reducing the national debt is
lower interest payments. If, however, Treasury cannot assure deep
and liquid markets, investors may demand a higher interest rate to
compensate for less liquid Treasury markets. That would offset much
of the expected interest savings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ No sooner was Abdurrahman Wahid chosen to be president
of Indonesia than the doubters began to voice their fears. They
fretted over the new leader's ability to deal with his country's
huge problems, over his physical frailty, over the deals he had
made to get the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To all of these worries Wahid's friends had a simple response:
you don't know Gus Dur.
</P>
<P>
   The man to whom Indonesians have given this respectfully
affectionate nickname, they said, is a clear thinker who knows a
lot about Indonesia's troubles and even more about its
troublemakers. He will find a way to free himself from burdensome
compromises, and to choose a cabinet that can cope.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24, speaking in Bali, Gus Dur himself set out to
reassure the skeptics. To become president, he admitted, he had to
make some tactful cabinet appointments. But he would make sure that
all his ministers ``follow our code...(in) honesty, frankness and,
most important, economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   The semi-blind president, referring to the slightly aloof lady
chosen to serve as his vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri,
showed a cheeringly blunt sense of humor. We make a perfect team,
he explained: ``I can't see and she can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And two days later Wahid named a pretty solid-looking cabinet.
This contains, as expected, people from most of the major parties,
as well as from the armed forces and the past governments of
Suharto and B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of exceptions, Wahid has done a good job of
balancing old and new faces, and limiting the damage done by his
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest doubts surround his new economics team. This will be
headed by Kwik Kian Gie, a Dutch-trained economist and a senior
member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, which is led
by Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Kwik has said some controversial things. He has
advocated a currency board to peg the exchange rate, and he has
taken several potshots at the IMF, which attached a set of
uncomfortably tight strings to the rescue package it helped to
organize when Indonesia's economy got into a mess in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he has calmed down lately. He now seems willing to follow
the IMF's prescriptions, and he appears to understand the
importance of cleaning up the banking industry and restructuring
corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's other economic choices have had mixed reviews. Investors
have applauded the new state-enterprise minister, but raised their
eyebrows about the new finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The team as a whole looks reasonably competent, but none of its
members has had any experience in government and some of them want
to do things with the economy that conflict with each other. The
skillful controlling hand the president's admirers claim for him
will be badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wahid's other choices are more impressive. This applies
especially to his handling of the armed forces. The new president
has brushed aside General Wiranto, who had been both the minister
of defense and the commander of the country's armed forces,
demoting him to the less influential post of minister for political
and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   General Wiranto will no longer command any armed men.
</P>
<P>
   The men chosen by the president to replace General Wiranto,
moreover, seem to be distinct improvements. The new defense
minister, Juwono Sudarsono, served as education minister under
Habibie and as environment minister under Suharto _ and, unusually,
had a clean reputation in both governments. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the first civilian defense minister for decades,
he has done a stint at Indonesia's military think-tank and seems to
understand the army's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yuwono's appointment signals the president's intention to bring
the wayward army _ responsible for many of Indonesia's tribulations
_ under firmer control. So does Wahid's choice for the leadership
of the armed forces, Admiral Widodo Adi Sutjipto.
</P>
<P>
   The new president has said several times that he wants the navy
to play a larger part in Indonesia's defense structure. Not only
does a country with so vast and tangled a coastline need an
efficient navy to protect it from invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia also suffers from rampant piracy, smuggling and
environmental vandalism around its shores. And, let it be quietly
added, demonstrators are less likely to get shot by patrol boats
than by politically guided infantrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Along with General Wiranto, the army's territorial commander,
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has also been moved to a political job.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of this is that he has been given charge of
mining and energy, which puts an inexperienced minister in charge
of a huge export-earning sector. But that may be a price worth
paying to have a reliable ally in Yudhoyono's previous job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, the political influence of the armed forces has been
much diminished. The new president's 35-member cabinet contains
only six serving or retired generals, the fewest ever in Indonesia.
This should make it easier for the new attorney-general, Marzuki
Darusman, to investigate the army's past activities.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Marzuki, a member of the once-dominant Golkar
party, is another compromise. He is, in fact, an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Although he belongs to the same party as the departing
president, Habibie, the new attorney-general was one of Habibie's
fiercest critics. He is also a former head of Indonesia's
human-rights commission.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki will dig into the army's misdeeds, including the trouble
it caused in the recently liberated province of East Timor. On Oct.
27, he said he would reopen investigations into Suharto's wealth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new president's wider aims should also be made easier to
achieve by the people he has gathered around him. Wahid wants to
win more influence for Indonesia in the Muslim world, and he is
anxious to find a way of holding Indonesia together.
</P>
<P>
   The new foreign minister, Alwi Shihab, is a moderate Muslim from
the president's National Awakening Party. He was educated in Cairo
and Philadelphia, and recently taught at Harvard University's
divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   The president has consistently supported a brand of Islam that
is both democratic and tolerant, and hopes to forge ties with
Muslims in other countries who think in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
   He has already said that he would like better relations with
Israel. His trip to a forthcoming conference on religious tolerance
in Jordan will be worth watching. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There remains the president's choice of Megawati to ease the
central government's strained relations with disaffected parts of
Indonesia such as the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya, and areas
like Ambon that are rent by religious and ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati has the credentials to preach unity: her father was
Indonesia's founding president, and her own campaign for the
presidency was rich in nationalist symbolism. Who knows, her new
task may be just what the vice-president needs to bring her out of
her shell.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's standoffish timidity helped to deny her the
presidency. But, under a frail president who has suffered two
strokes, she may yet inherit the job. If she does, she will take
over a strong cabinet. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ No sooner was Abdurrahman Wahid chosen to be president
of Indonesia than the doubters began to voice their fears. They
fretted over the new leader's ability to deal with his country's
huge problems, over his physical frailty, over the deals he had
made to get the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To all of these worries Wahid's friends had a simple response:
you don't know Gus Dur.
</P>
<P>
   The man to whom Indonesians have given this respectfully
affectionate nickname, they said, is a clear thinker who knows a
lot about Indonesia's troubles and even more about its
troublemakers. He will find a way to free himself from burdensome
compromises, and to choose a cabinet that can cope.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24, speaking in Bali, Gus Dur himself set out to
reassure the skeptics. To become president, he admitted, he had to
make some tactful cabinet appointments. But he would make sure that
all his ministers ``follow our code...(in) honesty, frankness and,
most important, economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   The semi-blind president, referring to the slightly aloof lady
chosen to serve as his vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri,
showed a cheeringly blunt sense of humor. We make a perfect team,
he explained: ``I can't see and she can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And two days later Wahid named a pretty solid-looking cabinet.
This contains, as expected, people from most of the major parties,
as well as from the armed forces and the past governments of
Suharto and B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of exceptions, Wahid has done a good job of
balancing old and new faces, and limiting the damage done by his
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest doubts surround his new economics team. This will be
headed by Kwik Kian Gie, a Dutch-trained economist and a senior
member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, which is led
by Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Kwik has said some controversial things. He has
advocated a currency board to peg the exchange rate, and he has
taken several potshots at the IMF, which attached a set of
uncomfortably tight strings to the rescue package it helped to
organize when Indonesia's economy got into a mess in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he has calmed down lately. He now seems willing to follow
the IMF's prescriptions, and he appears to understand the
importance of cleaning up the banking industry and restructuring
corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's other economic choices have had mixed reviews. Investors
have applauded the new state-enterprise minister, but raised their
eyebrows about the new finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The team as a whole looks reasonably competent, but none of its
members has had any experience in government and some of them want
to do things with the economy that conflict with each other. The
skillful controlling hand the president's admirers claim for him
will be badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wahid's other choices are more impressive. This applies
especially to his handling of the armed forces. The new president
has brushed aside General Wiranto, who had been both the minister
of defense and the commander of the country's armed forces,
demoting him to the less influential post of minister for political
and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   General Wiranto will no longer command any armed men.
</P>
<P>
   The men chosen by the president to replace General Wiranto,
moreover, seem to be distinct improvements. The new defense
minister, Juwono Sudarsono, served as education minister under
Habibie and as environment minister under Suharto _ and, unusually,
had a clean reputation in both governments. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the first civilian defense minister for decades,
he has done a stint at Indonesia's military think-tank and seems to
understand the army's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yuwono's appointment signals the president's intention to bring
the wayward army _ responsible for many of Indonesia's tribulations
_ under firmer control. So does Wahid's choice for the leadership
of the armed forces, Admiral Widodo Adi Sutjipto.
</P>
<P>
   The new president has said several times that he wants the navy
to play a larger part in Indonesia's defense structure. Not only
does a country with so vast and tangled a coastline need an
efficient navy to protect it from invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia also suffers from rampant piracy, smuggling and
environmental vandalism around its shores. And, let it be quietly
added, demonstrators are less likely to get shot by patrol boats
than by politically guided infantrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Along with General Wiranto, the army's territorial commander,
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has also been moved to a political job.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of this is that he has been given charge of
mining and energy, which puts an inexperienced minister in charge
of a huge export-earning sector. But that may be a price worth
paying to have a reliable ally in Yudhoyono's previous job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, the political influence of the armed forces has been
much diminished. The new president's 35-member cabinet contains
only six serving or retired generals, the fewest ever in Indonesia.
This should make it easier for the new attorney-general, Marzuki
Darusman, to investigate the army's past activities.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Marzuki, a member of the once-dominant Golkar
party, is another compromise. He is, in fact, an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Although he belongs to the same party as the departing
president, Habibie, the new attorney-general was one of Habibie's
fiercest critics. He is also a former head of Indonesia's
human-rights commission.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki will dig into the army's misdeeds, including the trouble
it caused in the recently liberated province of East Timor. On Oct.
27, he said he would reopen investigations into Suharto's wealth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new president's wider aims should also be made easier to
achieve by the people he has gathered around him. Wahid wants to
win more influence for Indonesia in the Muslim world, and he is
anxious to find a way of holding Indonesia together.
</P>
<P>
   The new foreign minister, Alwi Shihab, is a moderate Muslim from
the president's National Awakening Party. He was educated in Cairo
and Philadelphia, and recently taught at Harvard University's
divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   The president has consistently supported a brand of Islam that
is both democratic and tolerant, and hopes to forge ties with
Muslims in other countries who think in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
   He has already said that he would like better relations with
Israel. His trip to a forthcoming conference on religious tolerance
in Jordan will be worth watching. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There remains the president's choice of Megawati to ease the
central government's strained relations with disaffected parts of
Indonesia such as the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya, and areas
like Ambon that are rent by religious and ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati has the credentials to preach unity: her father was
Indonesia's founding president, and her own campaign for the
presidency was rich in nationalist symbolism. Who knows, her new
task may be just what the vice-president needs to bring her out of
her shell.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's standoffish timidity helped to deny her the
presidency. But, under a frail president who has suffered two
strokes, she may yet inherit the job. If she does, she will take
over a strong cabinet. &QL;

SMALL CHEMICAL COMPANIES DON'T HAVE Y2K SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one in seven ``mom-and-pop'' chemical firms is prepared for
Y2K in an industry that lacks proper safeguards and the incentive
to fix its own computer problems, a study showed this month.
</P>
<P>
   Of firms surveyed in Kansas, Texas, California and New Jersey,
only 13.5 percent have completed their Y2K preparations, the Texas
A&AMP;M University survey found.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 85 percent had failed to coordinate emergency
plans with local officials, according to Sam Mannan, professor of
chemical engineering and director of the Mary Kay O'Connor Process
Center at College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked firms with 200 or fewer employees to name the
worst thing that could happen: 4.1 percent said a ``catastrophic
event,'' 47 percent said ``no problem'' and 30 percent cited
``economic disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   But what emerges from the study goes beyond Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Small- and medium-sized chemical handlers, Mannan found, are
removed from technology advances, basic information and know-how,
and they have few financial and technical resources to make safety
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those findings, the Washington-based nonprofit Center
for Y2K &AMP; Society recommends that most chemical plants be required
to take a ``safety holiday'' immediately before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But John Koskinen, the president's Y2K point man, said that
requiring chemical firms to go through shutdowns and power ups
would create extra dangers. Instead, he recommends that each firm
study the pros and cons and make its own decision.
</P>
<P>
   Larger firms such as Monsanto, DuPont and Ashland Chemical have
said in recent weeks they will temporarily suspend operations at
some plants over the New Year's transition rather than run the risk
of a midnight power failure triggering a toxic release.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Air Products, another one of the nation's large
chemical producers with 82 employees southwest of Wichita, is
shutting down all 17 of its U.S. plants during the New Year's
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Although some plant officials say they are closing as a safety
precaution, others have said the step is being taken as a safeguard
against potential economic loss. Small variations in electric
wattage normally do not affect the average consumer, but small
surges, industry officials say, can ruin batches of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 85 million Americans live within five miles of one
of the 66,000 facilities nationwide that handle highly hazardous
wastes.
</P>
<P>
   We get e-mail
</P>
<P>
   NBC Vice President for Broadcasting Rosalyn Weinman complained
to us last week that aside from a few media inquiries about the
network's ``Y2K'' movie (including ours), no ``real people'' have
raised concerns about the decision to air the suspense thriller.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren Bone, a Y2K consultant in Nashville, considers
himself a ``real person.'' And after reading of the network's plans
to air the movie Nov. 21, Bone fired off a letter to NBC's
programming department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know as well as I do that the `average' TV viewer has a
pretty low education level (is it still at the eighth-grade
level?), and these viewers are going to believe that these events
could really play out,'' Bone said in his e-mail letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NBC does air this movie, I am sure you will win the ratings
sweeps. But I am afraid you are going to make a very bad situation
much worse. Once 2000 gets here and things really do start
happening...the world is going to be thinking about your movie and
will not deal with these events in a rational way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader, Richard Markland of Covington, Ohio, caught our
column on the Internet and summed up his feelings this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that the Y2K problem will be our biggest
enemy. I now have come to the conclusion that we, as the public,
will be the biggest obstacle. Reaction is still mixed and yet the
group mentality of unpreparedness will no doubt creep in and people
will mentally hyperventilate as the weeks progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says the federal government's Koskinen. He's heard about
the upcoming NBC movie and says the American people are smart
enough to separate fact from fiction.
Mood swing Maybe it was the increased publicity, but the fourth
Mid-America Regional Council Y2K community forum had the best
turnout to date.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 persons attended the Blue River Community College
gathering last Tuesday in Independence to hear key infrastructure
experts discuss their efforts to battle the Y2K bug. That nearly
doubles the turnout at the kickoff session in Johnson County on
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The next public forum will be held from Tuesday.

<P>
   VANCOUVER _ Back in the 1920s, when the United States had
Prohibition, quite a few Canadians grew rich running booze over the
border to intoxicate their neighbors. Now they are trying their
luck with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, British Columbia has earned a reputation
for growing the most potent marijuana in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is said to be the province's most lucrative export
crop, worth an estimated C$2 billion ($1.4 billion) a year.
</P>
<P>
   Given British Columbia's cool soggy climate, this may seem odd:
the strongest cannabis generally comes from tropical countries,
such as Jamaica. No longer. The sophisticated growers of British
Columbia use plant genetics and ``active indoor hydroponic
technology,'' some of it computer-controlled, to achieve higher
yields and potency.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Jamaica's strongest ganja contains 12 percent
tetrahydrocannabinol, the compound that produces a ``high,'' the
new stuff from British Columbia has, on average, 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This has made ``BC bud'' America's pot of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to export is great. A pound of pot can fetch about
$6,000 in California, up to twice what it fetches in Canada. So
British Columbia's cannabis farmers find ingenious ways to smuggle
south most of the estimated 800 tons they grow each year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States border patrol reckons that dope-smuggling has
soared tenfold in the past two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for this booming export business, grumble the
Canadian and American police, is the leniency of British Columbia's
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people are prosecuted: the police laid 2,329 charges
for growing and trafficking marijuana in 1997, and have stepped up
their efforts since. But, according to the Vancouver Sun, only one
in five of those convicted of growing marijuana in Vancouver over
the past three years received a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   One in four served no time in jail, and paid no fine; and 58
percent received a fine that averaged less than C$2,700.
</P>
<P>
   The average pot grower, who pockets C$150,000-250,000 per crop,
treats such light fines, complains one Canadian policeman, ``simply
as the cost of doing business _ a business license.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do locals seem much bothered. Many British Columbians smoke
pot regularly, or have at least tried it. In a recent poll, no less
than 63 percent thought possession of marijuana should be
decriminalized, more than in any other Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is still considered by many to be a relatively
harmless drug grown by aging hippies with beards and beads. In
fact, the industry has become big, sophisticated and nasty, and is
increasingly run by organized criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs use specialized technicians to grow hundreds of cannabis
plants at a time; clandestine ``dial-a-harvest'' teams pick the
crops, and a network of brokers market the product in America _ and
bring back guns and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs are not shy of protecting their interests; 15 people
in the dope business have been killed in Canada in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is spreading. Recently, a member of Parliament from
Quebec, Yvan Loubier, was given 24-hour police protection after he
had exposed a racket in his constituency. He claimed that gangs of
pot growers were forcing local farmers to let them hide plantations
in the middle of their sprawling fields of corn, sometimes by
threatening the lives of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Loubier said that, on a recent flight, he could see a dozen
patches of pot not far from Montreal, each with between 40 and
2,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United States was angry about Canadian
whiskey-smugglers 80 years ago, it is increasingly edgy about
cannabis today.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the State Department took the unprecedented step of
considering placing Canada on its narcotics blacklist _ alongside
Myanmar _ for not doing enough to combat the drugs trade. Nothing
came of it after Canada protested. But, as one Mountie says, ``It's
embarrassing that we get a wake-up call from the U.S. to say that
we have a serious problem.'' &QL;

we have a serious problem.'' &QL;

FOUR EX-UNION OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLEMENT

LOS ANGELES _ Federal authorities unveiled embezzlement charges
against former top officers of four different Southern California
unions Friday, including a Canyon Country man accused of
misappropriating over $14,000 in funds from the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney has charged the officials with converting over
$37,000 in union money for personal use in four unrelated cases.
</P>
<P>
   Among those charged was David Arnold Coupe, 37, of Canyon
Country, a former financial secretary of UFCW Local 47C in
Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Coupe and two other former union officials made their initial
appearance on the charges Tuesday; a judge issued an arrest warrant
for the fourth, Covina resident Kenny Lambey, who failed to respond
to a summons.
</P>
<P>
   Embezzlement usually occurs at smaller unions with disinterested
members, said Jeffrey Gitomer, district director of the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Labor Management Standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apathetic membership leads to this kind of thing,'' Gitomer
said. ``That's why we encourage members to take an active part in
their unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former officials facing embezzlement charges include:
</P>
<P>
   Brian V. Carter, 41, former secretary-treasurer of the Paper,
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Local 307 in
Bell, accused of embezzling $5,968.
</P>
<P>
   Herminio Louis Garcia Sr., 48, former president of the Utility
Workers Union Local 522 in Moreno Valley, accused of embezzling
$7,768.
</P>
<P>
   Lambey, 42, former secretary-treasurer of the United Plant Guard
Workers Union Local 155 in Corona, accused of embezzling $9,189.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing for Carter, Coupe and Garcia is scheduled
for Nov. 15. Each faces up to six years in prison.

ZACARIAS SUPPORTERS ADMIT DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ One day after Superintendent Ruben Zacarias lost an
angry showdown with the Los Angeles school board, some of his most
vocal supporters conceded defeat Friday but pledged to fight for a
say in picking his successor.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although furious at the school board majority that voted
Thursday to buy out Zacarias' contract, several key members of the
city's Latino community acknowledged they could now do little to
keep him in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's never been about salvaging Ruben's job,'' said
Theresa Fay-Bustillos, vice president of legal affairs for the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unfortunately become the poster child for a process that
ignored open decision making and community input. And there's got
to be some kind of community input.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF and other groups withheld the right to take legal action
against the board over its handling of Zacarias' ouster. And they
continued calling Friday for the board to rescind its selection of
real estate lawyer Howard Miller as the district's new chief
operating officer, whose appointment touched off the board's
dispute with Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   But many acknowledged the fight to protect Zacarias was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, our goal was to keep Zacarias in his position, and
at this point, obviously that's not going to happen,'' said Gerardo
Guzman, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mexican
American Political Association. ``Now, the goal is to get someone
in there who has what it takes to give us quality education. And
Mr. Miller doesn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   California Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles,
said the city needed to put the divisive fight over Zacarias behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on,'' he said. ``We need to get behind an
interim superintendent and develop a public process whereby we
select a permanent superintendent who understands the diverse needs
of an urban school district.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias, who spent the day in his office, referred all calls to
his attorney, Joseph Coyne, who was out of town. Both said on
Thursday night after the board vote that they would challenge
Miller's appointment next week in court. No action had been filed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Julie Korenstein, who backed Zacarias, said
the board should welcome community input when searching for his
permanent replacement. But she doubted parents or community groups
would have a hand in picking an interim superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Cortines, former head of Pasadena and New York City
schools, was the leading candidate. He is scheduled to be
interviewed for Tuesday, and Korenstein said there might not be any
room for community suggestions on alternate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been room up to now. I don't know that that will
change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Valerie Fields, who voted to buy out Zacarias'
contract, said she welcomed community suggestions on who should
become the interim superintendent. But any nominations must be made
immediately. The board hopes to pick an interim schools chief soon,
possibly as early as Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have anyone they want to put forward, they should do
that rapidly,'' Fields said. ``I don't want anyone from inside. We
need to have someone from outside to effect the changes we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry Zacarias supporters also talked again of breaking up the
nation's second-largest school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gathering information and looking at maps and data so we
can talk to people intelligently about the need to break up the
district and determine how it should be broken up,'' said Allan
Clayton, regional chairman of the Los Angeles City/County Latino
Redistricting Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to create districts that are so small as to
render them without any clout in Sacramento or Washington, D.C.,
where you get the majority of your funding. But we don't want them
so large like the current district with the problems they have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clayton has vocally opposed any breakup. In fact,
he helped the school board divide up the constituency divisions
during the last redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an opponent of this up until a month ago. Things have
changed. There is more discussion of this issue in the Latino
community than I have ever seen before,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   THE BREAKUP ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Several state legislators, even those not sold on the idea of
splitting the district, said the idea was worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself am not convinced that breakup is the way to go,''
said Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, ``although from my
investigations into L.A. Unified, I'm convinced it really needs
dramatic reform, and maybe in the end, breakup would be the only
way.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for state Senator Richard Polanco said breakup was
gaining momentum following the board's vote on Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fundamental thing,'' said Bill Mabie. ``If parents
don't believe that they're being respected by the board, they say,
OK, we're going to leave.''

WINDS GUST UP TO 50 MPH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _  Santa Ana winds scorched the Southland on Friday
with gusts as high as 50 mph, but this latest round of devil winds
was expected to die down by Halloween, forecasters said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the breeze picked up Friday morning, strong gusts knocked a
prefabricated house off a truck near Newhall, blocking traffic for
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hair stylists spent the day repairing wind-blown bouffants.
Surfers took advantage of 4-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   And firefighters remained on alert, staffing extra crews
deployed throughout the San Fernando Valley, in case the wind
whipped any sparks into full-blown brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't fool Mother Nature. We've learned our lesson on
that,'' said Los Angeles city Fire Capt. Steve Ruda.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts were expected to reach 20 mph to 30 mph in the Valley
overnight and continue through Saturday morning, said weather
specialist Stuart Seto of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the canyons, gusts could reach 40 mph but were expected to
die down by this evening, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anas are the result of a high-pressure system
squeezing hot desert air into Los Angeles, Seto said.
</P>
<P>
   After moist, foggy weather cooled the region Thursday, a
high-pressure system moved over Nevada and Utah, he said. That
aligned with a low-pressure system in the desert below, in effect
creating a meteorological ramp, sending the Santa Ana winds rolling
into the Southland.
</P>
<P>
   The wind temperature increased 5 degrees for every 1,000-foot
drop in altitude, creating the hot gusts, he said. Today's forecast
high is in the mid-80s to low 90s, but that will plunge to a low
tonight from the high 40s to 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The hot air boosted Friday's temperatures from the day before,
pushing the mercury to 82 degrees in Northridge, compared to 77 on
Thursday, and rising from 71 to 82 in Burbank. No records were set,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the Santa Ana winds, that obviously makes fighting
fires in the brush much more difficult,'' said Los Angeles County
fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela. High winds cut the effectiveness of
water-dropping helicopters and planes, because ``it makes it
difficult to hit the target and fly at low altitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the county department sent extra wildfire crews
to Malibu and Santa Clarita, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles city Fire Department is also on red-flag alert,
deploying units from other areas of the city to vulnerable spots in
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Five extra engine companies have gone to stations in Porter
Ranch, Woodland Hills, Sunland-Tujunga, Canoga Park and on
Mulholland Drive. And a ``tactical task force'' of three more
engine companies was waiting in Sherman Oaks, ready to assist other
stations in attacking a blaze anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is, if we can get to the brush fire and contain
it in its incipient stages, we can control it rapidly,'' Ruda said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Newhall area, where winds gusted to 50 mph Friday
morning, the California Highway Patrol released a wind advisory at
9:51 a.m., suggesting that drivers of trailers, campers and
oversize loads use caution.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late, however, for a trucker hauling a prefabricated
house on the transition road from the southbound 5 to the eastbound
210 freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver looked in his mirror and saw the wind push the
trailer up and throw it on its side,'' said CHP spokesman Doug
Sweeney. ``Every time it gets like this, normally we get at least
one traffic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to CHP officers and tow truck operators, the winds
create brisk business for some hair stylists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it blows out one day, they'll come in tomorrow for redos,''
said Josie Cavalluzzi, owner of Michelangelo Creations beauty salon
in Woodland Hills. ``They get frustrated because they have to spend
double. But the day after the wind it's so clear, they don't talk
about their hair, they talk about no smog.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anas coming out of the northwest are also helping out
surfers, said lifeguard specialist Craig Mattox, stationed at Zuma
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   When those breezes hit the 2- to 4-foot waves coming in from the
west, they hold them up a little longer _ an effect about 35
surfers were taking advantage of early Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those waves are nothing like the 16- to 18-foot swells found
on the California coast north of Point Conception, just above Santa
Barbara. The south-facing beaches in Southern California are
protected from those walls of water because those waves are being
generated by a massive storm off Vancouver Island, Mattox said.
Beaches farther north are more west-facing, open to the full brunt
of the storm, he said.!end! &QL;

DESPITE START, KINGS KNOW IT'S A LONG ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There was a time _ like a month ago _ when many
thought the Los Angeles Kings would be battling the Chicago
Blackhawks for the final playoff spot rather than tied with San
Jose atop the NHL's Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But new coach Andy Murray said he knows how quickly things can
change. After opening last year 2-1-1, the Kings lost goalies
Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr to injuries within seven minutes of
each other. It was only the fourth game of the season, but they won
just two of the next 16 and never were heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have put ourselves in a better position to be
successful,'' Murray said. ``But you can never sit back when things
go well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we play the 'Hawks I'll tell the coaches, `This is the
most important game of the year' because it is. And they'll say,
`Didn't you say that about the last game?' They all are so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings have won three straight heading into
tonight's game against the Blackhawks (1-4-4), they are not without
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Steve McKenna and Marko Tuomainen, who
both have missed playing time with eye injuries, the Kings have
been very healthy. But captain Rob Blake, who has missed big chucks
of seasons to injuries during in his career, logged a whopping 29
minutes on defense in Thursday's 5-3 victory over the Pittsburgh
Penguins. His busy nights include a prominent role on the power
play, which has gone 0 for 9 in the last two games to drop behind
the Sharks as the league's No.1 unit.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's game, the Kings were 13 for 50 with the man
advantage (22 percent). Last season, the Mighty Ducks led the
league with the same conversion rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not possible to continue at the pace we were going,''
Murray said. ``We have to work on a few things, but overall the
power play has gone well.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray also is trying to remain calm over a rough stretch by
young defenseman Aki Berg, whose mistakes have led to goals the
past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Berg made a poor decision to pass up ice late in Sunday's game
against San Jose. It became worse when he fanned on the puck and
turned it over to the Sharks, who scored.
</P>
<P>
   Against Washington, a puck hopped over his stick and right to
Peter Bondra, who scored the game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first minute of Thursday's game, Berg was manhandled
by Penguins star Jaromir Jagr, who muscled past the Kings'
strongest defenseman for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what a great player Jagr is,'' Murray said.
``But Aki has to make that play. This is not meant to be a
criticism, but this is the NHL and he has to be able to make those
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg's defensemate Sean O'Donnell, who scored a rare goal
Thursday, said the 22-year-old Fin is improving. Berg is back after
a year playing in his native country and is still making
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you have to remember that he is still
young,'' O'Donnell said. ``He has tremendous talent, but sometimes
he falters.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray disagrees. ``We cannot allow ourselves excuses,'' he
said. ``When you allow that to creep into your game, it will come
back to haunt you.''

DALY FACES QUITE A DODGER MESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's blue-splattered edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to have someone who understands Dodgers blue blood
tradition, new CEO Bob Daly, in charge of the franchise. But let's
not fool ourselves into thinking this is all it will take to get
the franchise into the black, financially and in the National
League standings.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's plate will be full once he settles into his office.
</P>
<P>
   He has a general manager and a manager who do not agree very
often. G.M. Kevin Malone was hired by the departed (but possibly
returning) Bob Graziano. Davey Johnson was hired by the departing
Fox hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The manager isn't fond of his current roster, but it's
impossible to force change when it involves players with little
value and too many years left on their contracts (Devon White, Eric
Young, Raul Mondesi).
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if I agree with all of Johnson's assessments on his
roster, either. He tried to force-feed a ill-fitting leadership
role on Gary Sheffield, has something against Eric Karros, and had
his own bungling role in the Raul Mondesi saga.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get the organization moving forward together
by giving Johnson the opportunity to entertain offers from other
clubs and then moving in another direction, toward former Dodgers
like Kevin Kennedy or Davey Lopes. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know Tommy Lasorda and Daly are good friends. But
name me someone who isn't Lasorda's friend? Here's hoping Lasorda's
influence is limited to that of an long-range adviser, and that
Daly tunes him out when he starts talking about megalomaniac Bobby
Valentine. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would be very smart to pursue former pitching coach
Dave Wallace, who may be looking to move on after two years with
the Mets. Wallace, originally hired by the Mets as a special
assistant, became pitching at mid-season and did not get along with
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the only person I know of who does get along with
Valentine is Lasorda. ...
</P>
<P>
   Would now be a good time to remind everyone that the Angels once
employed three-time World Series champ Joe Torre as an announcer?
...
</P>
<P>
   Torre's biggest accomplishment as Yankees manager may be the way
he ended the annual clubhouse circus that George Steinbrenner
operated. ...
</P>
<P>
   Is it me, or has the World Series lost some of its sheen since
the expansion of the playoffs? The last three World Series were
dogs, making me think the series has become the equivalent of the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL playoffs routinely are crisp until the Super Bowl, when
the strength of one team becomes apparent or the other finds itself
just pleased to be there. ...
</P>
<P>
   Through seven weeks of the season, 45 different quarterbacks
have started NFL games, more proof that the second-most important
position in football is backup quarterback. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL's quarterback woes seem bad now, after five
quarterbacks were drafted in the first round, think what it will be
like next year.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of NFL-caliber college quarterbacks for the '00 draft
is considered thin. Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton is a fave and
ex-Los Al star Kevin Feterik of BYU has big numbers, but both fall
short physically: Hamilton is 5-10, and Feterik reed-thin at 6-0
and 190.
</P>
<P>
   The top college quarterbacks who meet the NFL's usual physical
standards are Tennessee's Tee Martin and three fellows who have
playing at lower-rung Division I-A schools, Marshall's Chad
Pennington, Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay and Louisville's Chris
Redman. Florida State's Chris Weinke is considered slow. If there's
a sleeper out there, it's former St. John Bosco star Todd Husak of
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The best college quarterbacks, according to one scout, are all
underclassmen Purdue junior Drew Brees, USC's injured Carson
Palmer, Texas sophomore Major Applewhite, and Virginia Tech
redshirt freshman Michael Vick, who is the rarest of rares, a
strong-armed left-hander. ...
</P>
<P>
   The question is when, not if, Jeff George will break hearts in
Minnesota, as he has in Indianapolis, Atlanta and Oakland. ...
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the demise of UCLA is how fortunate they were to claim
their lone Pac-10 win, against an injured Oregon team that saw the
game end on the UCLA one-yard line. ...
</P>
<P>
   Things I'd like to see: Penn State and Florida State lose twice,
all one-loss teams lose one more game, and the BCS try to sell
Marshall-Virginia Tech as the national title game.
</P>
<P>
   Or, even better, deny those two unbeatens the title game, and
try to pass off a game between two one-loss teams as the
championship. ...
</P>
<P>
   The new BCS ranking system has neutered the computer ratings by
increasing the number of computers involved and throwing out the
lowest possible score. But this was a predictable move after the
Sagarin ratings had Kansas State No.1 after its Big XII title game
loss. ...
</P>
<P>
   Based on what I've seen of the Lakers during the preseason, they
need the Triangle Defense more than the Triangle Offense. This is
one of those questions no one thought to ask when hiring Phil
Jackson. His offense is swell, but can he make Shaquille O'Neal and
Glen Rice better defenders? ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: Knicks offer Latrell Sprewell a five-year, $61.9
million contract. Reaction: Who do I have to choke to get that kind
of contract? ...
</P>
<P>
   I say we get O.J. Simpson and Jim Gray together and see what
develops.

THORPE LEARNS HOW TO HANDLE TRAGEDIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jim Thorpe, like many of his golfing peers, is
struggling to come to grips with the death of Payne Stewart, killed
in a plane crash in Mina, S.D., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Thorpe, however, feels more pain than most. Just
as Stewart's death is difficult to comprehend, he also grieves over
recently losing a 13-year-old nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' said Thorpe, two shots out of the lead
after the first round of the $1.2 million Pacific Bell Senior
Classic at Wilshire Country Club. ``He's up and gone, and you
wonder who's next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like my nephew, who was 13 years old. One day, he just
didn't feel well, he laid his head down and never woke up. You just
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe said he didn't talk about the subject earlier because it
was difficult. But he said Friday that discussing his grief
provided him some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean any harm when I wouldn't talk to reporters,'' he
said. ``It just hit so hard at that time. Now, I realize you have
to face it ... you can't change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to talk about it. This week, I had plans for my
nephew to walk around the golf course. I looked around at times.
Sometimes, I even thought about Ben Hogan, who has been gone a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Payne would have wanted us to go ahead and play today.
I believe it was the right decision to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Others to mourn: John Jacobs, who shares the lead with John
Mahaffey, said people are forgetting the five others who died along
with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they'd say something about them,'' he said.
``Everything I see and read is just Payne, Payne, Payne. Come on,
the others have families, too.''

FRANCHITTI FLIES ON FAST TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Dario Franchitti is 500 miles from achieving a
lifelong dream, on the verge of stamping the phrase champion on his
racing resume and collecting a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``How important is it to me?'' said the 26-year-old native of
Edinburgh, Scotland, repeating the question before a pause to
choose his words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime of memories undoubtedly ran through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the major championships to win,'' said
Franchitti as he prepared for Sunday's Marlboro 500 at California
Speedway. ``When you've put 16 years into something, pretty much
every day for that slice of time, it means everything. It means a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With a nine-point lead over Juan Montoya, Franchitti can claim
the 1999 CART FedEx Championship Series title with a top-three
finish.
</P>
<P>
   A six-time winner in the series, Franchitti is just now emerging
as a national figure, probably just as much for his relationship
with actress Ashley Judd, from whose residence he reportedly chased
a stalker last month.
</P>
<P>
   On the track, his rise has been quick. It's taken him just two
years to climb to the top of the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave up,'' he said. ``We're not doing anything
different. There was no pressure. But after two DNFs (did not
finish), we felt it was time to get to the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Two races ago, Montoya was in control. After an eighth-place
finish at Laguna Seca where Franchitti was 25th, Montoya had a
28-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But two unforced errors erased the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya crashed, on a yellow flag, with Helio Castro-Nieves in
Houston and then hit a tire barrier in Surfer's Paradise,
Australia, in the last race. Franchitti was second in Houston and
won in Australia to take over the points lead.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third-closest finish in CART history since the
points system was revised in 1983. Al Unser Sr. had a three-point
lead over son Al Jr. in 1984, and Bobby Rahal had a similar edge
over Michael Andretti a year later. Both leaders finished with
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly had a good bit of luck earlier this year at
certain points,'' Franchitti said of his closest competitor. ``All
of a sudden, he's had bad luck. I don't know that anything's
changed but at this point, we have our act together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck has not turned my way so much as it's gone against
Montoya. Those things that happened to me before are happening to
him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti has been a model of consistency in his third year in
the CART series. He's finished in the points 15 of 19 races,
including three victories. More importantly, he's been on the
podium for a top-three finish 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a turning point this year, it would be a wreck in
Vancouver, B.C. Franchitti, pressing Montoya in the rain from his
second-place position, went in too hot on a turn and ended his day,
and Montoya extended his points lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't lay awake at night thinking about it, but in
a season of not making mistakes, that one shines because it was a
mistake,'' Franchitti said. ``At Laguna (another crash), I don't
think I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is now on both teams to perform in the season's
second 500-mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick to being successful when there is pressure to do the
same job you always have done,'' said Franchitti. ``I'm confident
the team can cope with the pressure. They've been there with
Jacques (Villeneuve) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen, and so far it has,'' said Franchitti, who
won his first driving title in go-karts in 1984 at the age of 11.
``It's not a done deal, it's a long weekend and a long race. You
can't take anything for granted. You have to work pretty hard to
make sure it happens.''

UCLA'S FOSTER FROZEN SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA tailback DeShaun Foster always runs best when
it counts most. Two Decembers ago, he rushed for 377 yards and six
touchdowns in the Southern Section Div. V title game. Last
November, he scored four touchdowns in UCLA's victory over USC.
</P>
<P>
   But for Foster to produce another scintillating finish _ and for
UCLA to salvage a bowl bid from this arduous season _ he must
overcome a nagging ankle injury and the accompanying frustration.
As sophomore seasons go, this has been one to rest, ice and
elevate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like hell,'' Foster said. ``I can't play. We're not
winning. I can't even be there at road games to motivate Keith
(Brown) and Jermaine (Lewis). I haven't felt like I'm part of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That should end tonight when Foster returns after a two-game
absence. He won't play more than 10 or 15 snaps, and he won't be in
top form. But his presence alone should energize a sagging running
game that totaled 166 yards against Cal and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks pretty good,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``I
don't know if he'll be his old self, but this is the best I've seen
him since the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster set a UCLA freshman record with 673 yards last year
despite averaging just 11.5 carries per game. He knew flashy stats
weren't possible this year, not with UCLA's three-man tailback
rotation. But everywhere he turned, friends and fans talked of a
sensational season to come. He'd lead the league in rushing. He'd
break the school record. He'd lead the Bruins to their
third-consecutive conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's been a dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to be satisfied with whatever happened, but I
didn't want to let other people down,'' he said. ``That's made it
harder to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's best game was his undoing. He rushed for 100 yards and
scored two touchdowns Sept. 25 at Stanford and didn't think much of
the mild sprain he suffered in the first half. But the next
morning, he woke up and saw a softball where his right ankle was
supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in the training room, receiver Danny Farmer, who
had suffered the same injury a month earlier, took one look and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to run,'' Farmer cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Foster tried to play at Arizona State, but the ankle was weak
and he gave up after two plays. A week later, he aggravated the
ankle on his only carry of the Oregon game. He didn't play against
Cal or Oregon State, UCLA's worst performances in years.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve frustration, Foster turned to his NCAA 2000
PlayStation. He always chose UCLA, and he'd run plays for his
computerized image time and again. It was the only place he knew
he'd never get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my hand and missed the last six games of my freshman
season (in high school), but that was nothing like this,'' he said.
``It's been one of the hardest things I've been through in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over yet. He has three games to ease the pain _ and
help UCLA save its season.

FOR HACKETT, CAL BRINGS BACK FOND MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ USC coach Paul Hackett hasn't been to Cal's Memorial
Stadium in 20 years, but there are plenty of fond memories for the
school he almost attended.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, whose father was a professor at Cal, grew up in nearby
Orinda and attended his first college football game at Memorial
Stadium in 1963 when he was a sophomore at Miramonte High.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really my beginning of college football,'' Hackett
said. ``I worked as an usher. People would stand outside the
coaches room and yell `We want Willsey. We want Willsey.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to then-Cal coach Ray Willsey, whom Hackett
almost decided to play for when he graduated from Miramonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there or (UC) Davis,'' Hackett said. ``If I went there,
I had to walk on and would never get to play. But at Davis, they
told me I would be a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett eventually became an assistant coach at Cal from
1972-75, but says ``I haven't been in that stadium in a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett last coached a game in Berkeley in 1979, when he was an
assistant at USC. The Trojans won 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really remember us going up there,'' Hackett said.
``But I imagine it will be noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down review: Cornerback Kris Richard said that Sunday
film sessions have become an eye-opening experience for the Trojans
recently as they get a chance to see how they blew two 21-point
leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch the film and see why we make mistakes and why they
happen,'' Richard said. ``And you're in a daze watching it. Your
mouth is just open because you don't understand how we could make
these mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailo out: Offensive guard Faasea Mailo, who badly bruised his
left shin against Stanford, did not make the trip. Donta Kendrick
will start at left guard again, now that he has recovered from a
sprained ankle, with Trevor Roberts the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Boller update: Cal quarterback Kyle Boller of Hart High has
averaged only 124 yards passing per game with eight interceptions
and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Cal coach Tom Holmoe is being patient with the true
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle wants to do it now,'' Holmoe said. ``But he doesn't get
down. Still, he is very hard on himself. He would say he is the
reason we aren't tearing it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want him to understand that the things he does are
very, very good. We're going to win with him, there is no doubt
about it in my mind. He's got a ton of hope and he's got a
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: In games decided by seven points or less, the
Trojans are 1-6 under Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Going for the sweep: Cal may be 3-4, but the Bears are going for
their second sweep of the Los Angeles schools since 1958. The last
time Cal defeated USC and UCLA in the same season was 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this game as a dogfight,'' Holmoe said. ``This is a
USC team that's ticked off and wanting to get back into the win
column.''

USC NEEDS ONE THING: A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ With a sigh more than a bang, USC wrapped up practice
this week and embarked for the Bay Area. There's no motivational
speech, T-shirts or gimmicks that could shake the Trojans out of
their current malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing will cure USC from the anguish associated with
losing 21-point leads on back-to-back weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a lingering plague around here until we win,'' free
safety David Gibson said. ``Practice went as well as it could have
gone. But it won't be great around here until we win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost three games in a row. I've kind of forgotten
what a win feels like.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game against California (3-4, 2-2) might be the perfect
answer to the Trojans' ailments. The Golden Bears are the model of
inconsistency that has characterized the Pacific-10 Conference.
They have the conference's top-rated defense, but also feature the
worst-ranked offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe we have the superior team and more talent,''
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one important intangible that makes this game
another stressful outing for the Trojans (3-4, 1-3): They had to
get on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much been a death knell as far as victory is
concerned this season. USC has developed a reputation as road kill,
with a 1-3 record away from the Coliseum and 3-7 on the road
overall the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're in town, it's a big event,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``This is a big hurdle for us. Struggling on the road is the
theme this year. We need to get a win big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Cal is so inconsistent, and features true freshmen at
quarterback (Kyle Boller) and tailback (Joe Igber), Hackett
believes USC needs to get off to a quick start to shatter the
Bears' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that shouldn't be a problem. USC led Notre Dame 24-3 and
Stanford 21-0 before losing both games the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the second half that the Trojans have deteriorated.
Hackett joked early in the week that his halftime speeches must be
awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything at halftime this week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the players believe the problem is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's trying to do everybody else's job,'' linebacker
Markus Steele said. ``You just forget about where you're at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, it's mental,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno added.
``There's nothing wrong physically. The only thing preventing us
from being in the right spots on plays is mental mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   USC can ill afford any more miscues. The Trojans have to win
four of their final five games just to become bowl eligible. How
they fare against Cal could determine the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the Golden Bears revives confidence heading into
November, when three of the four games are at the Coliseum. A loss
could cause the Trojans to collapse the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum, it's tough to get that back,'' Hackett said. ``No
one's interested in how close you've come (to winning). Now we have
to focus on one thing _ beating Cal.''

CLIPPERS' ODOM STARTS WITH PROMISE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You hear it all the time. He's going to be the
next Larry Bird. So and so's the next Kareem. That guy's the next
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hear what a Los Angeles Clippers player has to say
about Lamar Odom, the team's first-round pick and fourth overall in
the June draft, it's hard not to do a double-take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already dubbed him Magic Johnson with more athletic
ability,'' says Eric Murdock, a veteran of eight NBA seasons.
``He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson with more athletic ability?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' says teammate Maurice Taylor. ``I love him. I
keep him around me 24 (hours), 7 (days a week). He's a special kind
of player.''
</P>
<P>
   Living up to that comparison is tricky, especially considering
the 6-foot-10 Odom's past.
</P>
<P>
   He played just one year of college basketball after first
deciding to go to Nevada Las Vegas then opting for Rhode Island.
Academic problems sidelined him for one year before he finally
played for the Rams last season. Odom average 17 points and nine
rebounds in leading Rhode Island to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring for the NBA Draft, Odom decided to return to
school. But because he had already signed with an agent, he was
forced to go pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard comparison to live up to,'' says Odom, who has
attempted to integrate the court awareness of Johnson and Bird into
his game. ``If that's what people see, then I'm flattered. I don't
consciously go out and try to play like him, but it's really an
honor to be even mentioned with Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he certainly jumps higher and jets around the court
quicker than the ex-Lakers great.
</P>
<P>
   Dribbling? Forget it. Magic was functional, textbook; Odom has
those next-millennium, schoolyard handles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense? Odom, while still guilty of system mistakes, has the
length, quickness and desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to learn to play defense and offense in our
system,'' says coach Chris Ford, who's paid to keep us grounded.
``Rookies don't just come into this league and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Odom's shooting needs work, but Johnson, who lacked
Odom's ability to square and shoot off the dribble, wasn't a
sharp-shooter when he arrived in L.A. 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a feel for the game you don't see very often,'' Lakers
vice president Jerry West said. ``He could be the steal of the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, Odom seeks and delivers the spectacular pass, but
an ability to match this boyhood idol for wisdom in his play-making
decisions and the knack for overpowering adversity will determine
if he can carry the weight of yet another ``next Magic''
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Magic came in,'' said Derek Anderson, another new
Clipper, ``the Lakers already had Kareem, Jamal Wilkes, Norm Nixon
... ''
</P>
<P>
   What Anderson was emphasizing is the modest caliber of teammates
Odom has joined. While Anderson, Taylor and center Michael
Olowokandi are good prospects, they don't provide the caliber of
comfort zone, the margin for error, the aforementioned Lakers gave
Johnson. In return, Johnson helped give the Lakers five
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls weren't very good when Jordan got there,'' Odom
says. ``Every team has to start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that if I don't do well I'll be criticized because
of my past. But I think I can handle that because the pressure I
put on myself is so much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   That self-imposed challenge includes clearing a path for the
next phenom whose youthful uncertainty grows a field of red flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that all the time,'' Odom says. ``You know, if I
do well, it might be easier for the next guy. It might be someone
from my own neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest assist may come in passing the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day,'' said former Clipper Scott Brooks, ``we're going to
be comparing guys to Lamar.''

NORTHCUTT WILL POSE PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every challenge is massive for the UCLA football
team's beleaguered secondary, and this week's comes in a 5-foot-11,
180-pound package named Dennis Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona receiver might be the best player in the Pacific-10.
He's at least as good as Stanford receiver Troy Walters, who burned
the Bruins for 278 receiving yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do the same kind of thing,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``There's no question, Northcutt's one of the best. He's
explosive, and they put him all over the field, so it's hard to
(double-cover) him.''
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt, a Dorsey High graduate, leads the conference in
receptions per game (7.13) and all-purpose yards (193), and he's
second in receiving yards (121 per game). He also averages 19 yards
per run (ie: reverse) and plays cornerback. Add his highly charged
personal situation _ this is his last game in his hometown _ and
UCLA should expect Northcutt's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the yards he's generating, and he's done a phenomenal
job,'' Wildcats coach Dick Tomey said. ``He's been the brightest
light for us. There isn't anybody helping their team more than he's
helping us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for the best: Despite their talent, the Wildcats might be
an easier matchup for UCLA's young defensive backs than Oregon
State, which played an unconventional spread offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't faced anyone that passes like Oregon State,''
Bruins cornerback Ryan Roques said. ``I don't think we'll have
those problems against another team.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble spot: Each week seems to produce another ignominious
statistic from UCLA's secondary, and today's is no different: Five
players have started at strong safety in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Stephens, Julius Williams, Roques, Eric Whitfield and
Lovell Houston (today's starter) have lined up alongside free
safety Joey Strycula, a former walk-on who leads the team in
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Punt of no return: Northcutt is averaging 19.4 yards a return
(second in the nation) and has scored one touchdown. Meanwhile, the
Bruins have the lowest punt-return average in the league, 6.6
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, UCLA's longest return (16 yards) is less than
Northcutt's average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one thing that's happened to us,'' Toledo said. ``But
we have faced a couple great punters.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: While most of his teammates played their worst
game of the season at Oregon State, outside linebacker Ryan Nece
played his best, with a team-high 10 tackles and his first sack of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous games, I wasn't playing up to my expectations or
the coaches' expectations,'' said Nece, a freshman All-American
last season. ``I was struggling. But I managed to get rid of the
distractions. Confidence was a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So was motivation: The Bruins let true freshman Marcus Reese
compete for Nece's starting job, but Nece repelled the rookie's
challenge.

FRONT-END ALIGNMENT PAYING OFF FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this case, five was better than four.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge football team has moved from dead last
in total defense to sixth in the Big Sky Conference since the
Matadors went from a four-man defensive line to a five-man front.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (4-3, 3-2) also leads the conference in sacks as it enters
today's 3:05 p.m. game against Weber State at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't having success with (the four-man front),''
defensive coordinator Foster Andersen said. ``We devoted all spring
and two-a-days to playing that defense. Finally we came to the
conclusion that it wasn't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was laid out pretty clearly when the Matadors gave up 1,225
yards in back-to-back games _ a 71-14 loss at Kansas and a 48-41
loss at Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN was hammered at Montana 48-27, Andersen and the other
defensive coaches decided to change their philosophy, and one of
the foremost differences came on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Gardner (240 pounds) was added to the starting lineup,
which became smaller and quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickness outweighed size,'' Andersen said, somewhat
ironically. ``I had every coach write down his best player and then
I asked, `Are they all out on the field?' The answer was no.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has given up a combined 35 points during its current
two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids realized they could stop good (teams),'' Andersen
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's elemental: The wind was blowing hard during practice Friday
afternoon, reminding backup quarterback Josh Fiske of the Matadors'
windy game two years ago at North Campus Stadium _ against Weber
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Weber State) had a real hard time in the first quarter,''
Fiske said. ``We had the wind (to our backs).''
</P>
<P>
   If the Santa Ana winds don't calm down today, CSUN could be
forced out of its passing offense for half the game, depending on
the direction in which the Matadors are headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus (Brady) has two quarters and I have two quarters,''
running back Jaumal Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the white shirt: Reserve linebacker Robert Porter
switched to tight end this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Porter) is a really good blocker,'' interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``He may have a future there.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing in: With 449 completions and 5,247 yards in his first 18
college games, Brady has a chance to become Division I-AA's
all-time best quarterback, at least statistically.
</P>
<P>
   Brady needs 70 completions to pass former Northern Arizona
quarterback Greg Wyatt's mark of 518 as a freshman and sophomore.
Travis Brown, the Lumberjacks' current quarterback, had a record
6,793 yards his first two seasons and Brady needs to average 386
yards in the final four games to pass Brown.

KARIYA, SELANNE LIFT DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Anaheim Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei was back
from his 10-game exile. Former Ducks coach Ron Wilson was making
his third trip to the Pond as coach of the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, the headliners wound up being Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   The two Anaheim superstars combined for three goals and eight
points Friday night as the Ducks defeated the struggling Capitals
5-2 before 13,586.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Salei, who has become NHL's latest villain, was
relatively uneventful. He was cheered when he stepped on the ice
for his first shift, did not draw any penalties, nor was he
involved in any questionable plays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wilson's third visit to Orange County since being
fired by Anaheim resulted in a third loss. It was also his second
loss to the Ducks in 10 days. Anaheim defeated the Capitals 7-1 on
Oct. 19. Wilson is 2-4 against the Ducks since becoming
Washington's coach.
</P>
<P>
   For 1{ years, Wilson had the pleasure of having Kariya and
Selanne on his side, but Friday night they needed only one period
to put his team in a hole it would never climb out of.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim stars, with the able assistance of Matt Cullen and
Oleg Tverdovsky, were on the ice for three first-period goals, all
scored against Washington's top line of Peter Bondra, Adam Oates
and James Black.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya capped his night with a third-period goal giving the
Ducks' No.1 line six goals and 18 points in the two games versus
the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't playing the way we're capable, but we're getting
better,'' Kariya said. ``I myself struggled with my conditioning
the first five, six games, and it's been tough to get going. We're
far from 100 percent, but we're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kariya and Selanne finished with four points _ a first
since they began playing together in 1996. It was 23rd time Selanne
has recorded four or more points in a game, while Kariya has
reached that level 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' sixth win in October is a team record for the opening
month of the season and moved them within two points of the Western
Conference- and Pacific Division-leading Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya started the first-period blitz with a nifty
behind-the-back move to keep the puck in the Capitals' zone. His
effort was rewarded when he one-timed a pass by Tverdovksy past
Washington goalie Olaf Kolzig at 5:24.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of three points that Kariya recorded in the
opening 20 minutes. He picked up assists on Selanne's goal at 12:21
and Tverdovsky's at 19:26.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne extended his point-scoring streak to six games when he
took a nice pass from Cullen and leaned into a one-timer that beat
Kolzig high on the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky made it 3-0 in the final minute when he scored his
fourth goal of the year on 60-footer from the right point that went
through a maze of bodies in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks weren't nearly as dynamic in the second period. They
gave up a power-play goal to Bondra at 1:21 and then failed to
generate even one shot of their own after Sergei Gonchar was
assessed a double-minor for high sticking Steve Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, Kariya, Rucchin and Tverdovsky worked a
beautiful three-way passing play, but Selanne missed a wide-open
net.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ducks (Fredrik Olausson at 3:25) and Caps (Steve
Konowalchuk at 7:19) traded goals in third period, Kariya picked up
his second of the night, shoving home a rebound of Cullen's shot at
8:59.

DESPITE PSYCHIC'S EFFORTS, RACES RUN TRUE TO FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ When it comes to picking horses, extra sensory
perception doesn't work as well as reading a Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   That was the conclusion resulting from a publicity stunt for
local television stations at Santa Anita Park on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunt that was essentially a promotion for today's
California Cup races, the track had a psychic match wits with a
professional handicapper. Each picked likely winners in Races 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, Bill Downes, a handicapper and announcer employed
by Santa Anita, came out on top with three winners. Linda Salvin,
the psychic, had none.
</P>
<P>
   Because bets were placed across the board on horses chosen by
Downes and Salvin, each won some money. Downes final tally after a
$30 investment was $30.90; Salvin's was $22.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this proves is that coming to the races is fun, whether
you are a professional handicapper or just playing a hunch,'' said
Stuart Zanville, Santa Anita's head of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The event was videotaped by a local public relations firm and
copies were hand-delivered to several area television stations for
inclusion in Friday evening newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to choosing, Downes employed a more traditional
method of picking horses, based upon their published past
performances. Salvin, on the other hand, took into account
vibrations, heat and colors given off by the horse's names in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just get a certain feeling,'' she said. ``It's a feeling
inside me that I can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes, who was nervous after a slow start, relished his
come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I won the competition, but it was by a very slim
margin,'' he said. ``I was just using horses that I thought had a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting of today's Cal Cup races is the
$150,000 Distaff on the hillside turf course.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's interesting because there's 15 horses entered,
making for a 15-1 mutuel field.
</P>
<P>
   There's some pretty good horses available there, too. Among them
is Sweetcakesandshakes, the horse that gave Eddie Delahoussaye his
6,000th career victory. Also in the field are Pert Laura and Dusty
Heather. But there's no reason to count out Iza Bon Bon and rider
Joy Scott.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Distaff, Iza Bon Bon finished third. This year, the
6-year-old mare has earned more than $115,000, and both Scott and
trainer Lewis Cenicola are encouraged by recent works.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mare has been amazing for us,'' Cenicola said. ``She won
her first race for us and has just kept giving and giving all these
years.''

   INTERNATIONAL
</P>

   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-TIMOR (Dili, East Timor) _ Ending a failed 24-year
occupation that culminated in a rampage of destruction, the last
900 Indonesian soldiers left on this island territory pulled down
their red-and-white flag Saturday and began heading home. Their
officers were seen off at the airport by the people who took their
place: the U.N. representative, the Australian general who heads an
international peacekeeping force and the guerrilla chief who led a
separatist war against them. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade) _ Special Report: Slobodan Milosevic _
gray and remote, internationally isolated and politically
unpopular, indicted for war crimes, his army restive and reservists
outraged, his economy ruined, his refineries and electricity system
smashed and his sources of fuel unclear, his roads and railways
holed and his bridges collapsed _ has not only survived the loss of
Kosovo, but he has gained a second wind. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-BOSNIA-REPORT (Washington) _ Four years after the fighting
stopped in Bosnia, an international study group has concluded that
Western efforts have failed to realize the driving principle of the
Dayton accords: a single, multi-ethnic country. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CULT-LAW (Beijing) _ After a week of secret deliberations,
China's top legislative body Saturday issued a stringent new
``anti-cult'' law designed to aid the government's crackdown on the
Falun Gong spiritual movement. Press accounts suggested that the
law will be used _ apparently retroactively _ in prosecuting
organizers of the banned movement. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-CONSCRIPTION (Taverny, France) _ Europe's armies are
abandoning the draft. France now requires its 18-year-old males
only to spend a day watching movies about the armed forces in hopes
of tempting them into services; Italy and Spain are following suit,
leaving Germany as the only major NATO power with conscription. By
Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ISOLATIONISM-DEBATE (Washington) _ Ostrichism and nativism will
always be found in American politics. But the current foreign
policy debate roiling Washington, many experts say, is about what
form of internationalism makes sense for an unchallenged
superpower. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>

GETTING SICK ON THE HIGH SEAS: A QUESTION OF ACCOUNTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (A Special Report) 
(lh) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight last Feb. 25, James Curtis, a 59-year-old
retired businessman from Maryland, was found unconscious in a
public restroom aboard the Sensation, one of the 14 ships of
Carnival Cruise Lines. He was revived by the ship's nurse and taken
to the infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six hours, Curtis drifted in and out of
consciousness, all the time complaining about worsening stomach
pains. The nurse and a doctor hooked him to an IV and gave him a
breathing tube. But they missed that an abdominal rupture was
causing him to bleed to death. Such ruptures are often fatal. But
even had they recognized the blood loss, they had no equipment to
give him a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like watching an avalanche coming at me and not being
able to stop it,'' his wife, Irma Curtis, said as she recalled
watching helplessly as he finally died at 6:50 that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Medical emergencies are terrifying anywhere. But when something
goes seriously wrong on a cruise ship hundreds of miles out at sea,
passengers are on their own more than they might imagine. Even on
the largest ships _ floating towns with as many as 3,100 passengers
and 1,500 crew members _ those aboard must rely on infirmaries that
are better equipped for sunburn and seasickness than for heart
attacks. And they are often staffed by doctors not qualified to
work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to medical care, the cruise ships to which
millions of Americans flock every year are free of any U.S.
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Though more than 90 percent of the passengers are Americans, the
ships are governed by the laws of the countries where they are
flagged, mainly Panama, Liberia and the Bahamas. The $12 billion
industry pays virtually no U.S. corporate taxes and can ignore many
U.S. laws governing labor standards, the environment and security.
</P>
<P>
   There is no international oversight of medical care because
maritime law does not require cruise ships to provide any for
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the fast-growing industry has been left to
establish its own guidelines, which are voluntary. In response to
pressure from the medical establishment, the care has improved
lately. But the quality of doctors and the sophistication of
equipment vary significantly from company to company.
</P>
<P>
   The major cruise lines have doctors, nurses and infirmaries on
their ships. But the medical personnel are independent contractors,
not employees, and courts have ruled that the lines are not liable
for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Many shipboard doctors have degrees from foreign medical schools
and lack the minimum training to practice in American hospitals.
Hiring practices can be slipshod. Doctors can be on call 24 hours
but are often paid substantially less than doctors in the United
States. Most cruise lines lack formal processes for reviewing a
doctor's work.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than 5 million people will take cruises out of
U.S. ports on ships sailing under foreign flags, a record. And the
average age of passengers has been declining, to 50, reflecting the
greater popularity of cruise vacations among families.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the passengers will ever think about medical care on the
ships, and the overwhelming majority of those who do will not
suffer serious injury or illness. But hundreds of passengers each
year do experience medical emergencies, and 20 or so die, according
to medical experts and statistics from the cruise lines and the
medical examiner's office in Miami, the nation's busiest cruise
port.
</P>
<P>
   In most emergencies, passengers recover, some to write glowing
letters of praise to the ship's staff for quick and effective care.
But an examination by The New York Times, including a survey of all
major cruise companies, a review of court cases and interviews with
current and former employees of cruise lines, shows that in other
cases the results are injuries, death and striking accusations of
negligence and malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret DiBari, a 47-year-old nursing home inspector from
Queens, complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing on her
dream cruise, and the ship's doctors said she had acute bronchitis.
The day after the ship returned to New York, however, doctors at
Lenox Hill Hospital discovered she had had a heart attack, most
likely on the ship. Admitted to intensive care, she had a second
attack and died.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Elizabeth Carlisle, a 14-year-old from Michigan,
said she sustained lifelong health problems because a ship's doctor
failed for three days to recognize that her appendix had ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Hatch, a diabetic on her honeymoon, lapsed into
unconsciousness and convulsions after a ship's nurse apparently
gave her the wrong medication.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharon Lum, a California kindergarten teacher, said she
returned to a ship's infirmary five minutes after a nurse said her
husband was improving after severe vomiting and diarrhea, to find
him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are drawn from interviews and pending lawsuits,
and the cruise lines dispute the accusations of negligence in each
case. A review of lawsuits filed over three years against cruise
lines in Miami, where most cruise tickets stipulate that actions
against the companies must be filed, found that most cases were
settled, with the terms kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the cruise companies say cases are settled to save
legal costs and for other business reasons. Lawyers for passengers
say the companies resolve claims to avoid appeals that would
challenge their exemption from liability for their doctors' actions
on board ships.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care is not perfect on land, and suits are filed
regularly against leading hospitals, too. But the quality of care
at sea has become a more pressing issue as the cruise industry has
doubled in size over the last decade and its ships have also grown.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the American Medical Association brought
pressure on the industry to improve care after a study by two
Florida doctors, Bradley S. Feuer and Richard S. Prager, found
glaring inadequacies in staff qualifications and equipment on
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 11 cruise lines, the doctors found that 27
percent of doctors and nurses did not have advanced training in
treating victims of heart attacks, the leading killer on ships, and
54 percent of doctors and 72 percent of nurses lacked advanced
training for dealing with traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of shipboard doctors _ 45 percent _ had board
certification, an important credential that is granted after three
to seven years of residency and a written examination in a
specialty, or its equivalent. There are 24 specialty board
certifications recognized by the American Medical Association and
the American Board of Medical Specialties. Ideally, ship doctors
would have certification or an international equivalent in
emergency medicine, family practice or internal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   As for equipment, the survey found that 63 percent of the ships
did not have equipment for blood tests for diagnosing heart
attacks, and 45 percent did not have mechanical ventilators or
external pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was that the quality of maritime medical care
was less than adequate, from the medical facilities to nurse and
physician credentials,'' said Prager, a critical-care physician at
Baptist Hospital in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association passed a resolution in 1996
calling for federal legislation or an international treaty to
establish minimum medical standards on all cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the association, Robert J. Mills, said
establishing standards remained a legislative priority. But
Congress has not acted and the issue was not raised at
congressional hearings on safety in the industry earlier in
October.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The absence of medical standards is one of several examples of
the lack of regulation over the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   In part to head off federal government controls, the cruise
companies and their increasingly influential Washington trade
association, the International Council of Cruise Lines, have turned
to voluntary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   After articles in The Times about shipboard assaults and efforts
to cover up incidents, the industry association said in July that
its members would report all suspected crimes to the proper
authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And after Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty to criminal
pollution charges and paid $27 million in fines in the last 18
months, the industry said in October that it would take voluntary
steps to improve environmental controls.
</P>
<P>
   The industry responded in similar voluntary fashion to the
medical establishment in 1996, adopting guidelines for staffing and
equipment that were written with help from the American College of
Emergency Physicians, whose members sometimes serve on ships. The
industry emphasizes that its guidelines are suggestions, not
standards, but people within the industry and some outsiders credit
them with improving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically there has been a range of capabilities and
facilities,'' said Dr. Carter Hill, medical director for Holland
America Line. ``A lot of that was because there were no guidelines.
I really feel the industry has responded in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines adopted by the industry in 1996 say doctors
should have a medical license and competency in advanced life
support or cardiac care, though certification is not required. They
say doctors should have experience in general practice and also in
emergency or critical care, but board certification or equivalent
international certification is not required.
</P>
<P>
   The industry suggests that ships carry two cardiac monitors, two
portable defibrillators, an electrocardiograph, an external
pacemaker, respiratory support equipment and, on new ships, X-ray
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ships generally have one or two doctors and two or three nurses,
depending on the number of passengers. The cruise lines serving
U.S. ports, including Carnival, Royal Caribbean International and
Princess Cruises, meet the industry guidelines, according to
responses to a survey sent out by the Times.
</P>
<P>
   But not all ships meet the higher standards outlined in the 1996
study that prompted the American Medical Association's resolution,
according to the survey responses from 10 of the 16 foreign-owned
cruise lines operating out of U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Carnival, the world's biggest cruise line, said 56
percent of the doctors on its 14 ships had board certification or
equivalent credentials. Royal Caribbean, the second-largest line,
said 85 percent of its doctors were board certified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major lines, only Princess Cruises and Holland America
Line said all of their ships carried blood-transfusion equipment,
according to their responses to the Times survey.
</P>
<P>
   Princess and Holland America, a division of Carnival Corp.,
received high marks from outside medical experts, and both exceeded
the industry guidelines. Princess Cruises, for example, employs
only full-time physicians licensed in Britain, which has
requirements similar to those of the United States; its doctors
have at least three years of postgraduate training and
certification in advanced trauma life support. The line pays them
$120,000 a year, more than twice the salary at most other cruise
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try and pay the amount of money required to attract
well-qualified individuals,'' said Dr. Alastair Smith, the medical
officer of Princess Cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 2,600-passenger Grand Princess has the industry's
first telemedicine system, which allows specialists at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles to connect to the ship via satellite
to assist the on-board doctors. All nine Princess ships carry
thrombolytic drugs, the so-called clot-busting superdrugs that
increase survival chances in many heart attack patients. Few other
lines carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most sophisticated cruise ship is not a floating
hospital. The goal in the most serious emergencies is to stabilize
patients until they can be transported to hospitals on land (at
passengers' expense). Industry experts say the quality of care is
comparable to what travelers would expect in any resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ship is a small town, and people should expect to find the
same medical care there that they would in any other small town of
a couple thousand people,'' said Dr. Theodore E. Harrison,
president of a company that recruits doctors for cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   But other doctors and critics of the lines challenge that
comparison. Qualifications for small-town doctors in the United
States are more stringent than those for doctors on most cruise
ships. And transporting a critically ill patient from a rural
clinic or hospital to a more sophisticated one is far easier than
evacuating someone from a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel S. Cronin, who spent 10 years as a surgeon before
becoming a maritime lawyer, said: ``It may be fair to say care on a
ship is like a small town, except for one thing. In the small town,
they can call an ambulance and get you to a big city. It's a lot
easier, and a lot cheaper, too.''

   Last Christmas, Dr. Marie Gade, a New York City radiologist, was
on a cruise with her family on Cunard's flagship Queen Elizabeth 2
when she was struck by a van during an excursion on the island of
St. Thomas. Her pelvis was fractured in several places, and she and
her husband, Dr. Ronald Gade, decided to avoid the island's
hospital in favor of the care offered on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   But when the couple arrived at the infirmary, they discovered
that there was no equipment to transfuse blood, which would have
been needed if Marie Gade had had internal bleeding, and that other
basic equipment was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than remain on the ship, Marie Gade was taken to an
airport on a nearby island and flown on a medical jet back to New
York, she and her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of needing shipboard medical care are slim, but the
American College of Emergency Physicians estimates that 4 percent
to 5 percent of passengers will succumb to anything from a sprained
ankle to food poisoning. That means a minimum of 200,000 medical
cases this year. The group estimates that 500 of those passengers
will require removal to a hospital on shore.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do face emergencies on cruise ships, the primary
cause of death is heart attacks. An analysis by The Times of the 60
reported natural deaths aboard cruise ships sailing out of Miami
from 1996 through mid-September of this year found that more than
90 percent were caused by heart attacks or heart-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were elderly or had a history of heart disease or
both, but some were younger and had shown no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret DiBari had no history of heart problems when she
boarded Celebrity's Zenith for a cruise from New York to Bermuda on
June 28, 1997. Two days later, she went to the infirmary
complaining of difficulty breathing and chest pain. One doctor,
German Leon, took a chest X-ray and diagnosed an upper respiratory
tract infection and acute bronchitis, according to deposition
testimony in the suit brought by her mother against Celebrity
Cruises and two doctors in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, Ms. DiBari's condition did not
improve, and she returned regularly to the infirmary, where she was
treated by Leon and a colleague, Dr. Juan Sarmiento, both natives
of Colombia and graduates of medical schools there. Her condition
did not improve. The day after the ship returned to New York, she
was hospitalized, and she died in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard P. Friedlander, a cardiologist hired by Ms. DiBari's
mother, wrote in a report prepared for her lawyer, Alan L.
Fuchsberg, that the shipboard doctors had failed to detect evidence
of a heart problem on the X-ray. He wrote that the failure to treat
Ms. DiBari properly and to refer her urgently to a hospital ``more
likely than not'' increased the risk of her second, fatal heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Sarmiento said he had not looked at the X-ray
as part of his examination of Ms. DiBari. While examining the X-ray
during questioning, he said that it could indicate a heart ailment,
but that it was also consistent with other problems. Lawyers for
the cruise line and the two doctors maintained in court filings
that Ms. DiBari was treated properly and that her death was not
related to what occurred on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   A Celebrity spokeswoman said the company would not comment, and
lawyers for Leon and Sarmiento did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento's deposition and documents produced in the court case
shed light on the hiring and pay practices at Celebrity Cruises,
which is part of Royal Caribbean. Neither doctor was licensed to
practice in the United States or had advanced training in cardiac
care. They were paid $2,300 a month in cash by the ship's purser.
In addition, they received 9 percent of the fees charged passengers
for treatment, and free accommodations. Neither carried malpractice
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Gonzalez, a former ship's doctor, is a medical
consultant to Celebrity responsible for evaluating doctors applying
to work on ships. In a deposition, he said most applicants were not
board certified, but he said that did not mean they were
unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors trained in some developing countries, Gonzalez said, use
the shipboard jobs ``as a step to coming into the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he had interviewed Sarmiento after a former
colleague introduced them, but he said he had no recollection of
contacting any of his references. According to court records, the
resume submitted by Sarmiento did not list references.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to the Times survey, Celebrity declined to say
what percentage of its doctors were licensed in the United States.
It said only that its shipboard doctors held valid medical licenses
in their respective countries, which is consistent with the
industry's guidelines. Half of its doctors hold board
certifications or an international equivalent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor who was not licensed in the United States also saw
Elizabeth Carlisle when she became ill on Carnival's
2,000-passenger Ecstasy in March 1997. Shortly before boarding the
ship with her parents, the teen-ager felt mildly ill. Her mother,
Darcy Carlisle, telephoned Elizabeth's pediatrician at home in Ann
Arbor, Mich. He suggested they check with the ship's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Not far out of Miami, her parents took Elizabeth to the
infirmary, where Dr. Mauro Neri saw her. Without examining her, he
said her symptoms sounded like flu and prescribed an antibiotic,
according to the complaint filed by the family against Carnival in
Dade County Circuit Court in Miami. The next day, nauseated and in
pain, she returned to the infirmary and Neri prescribed a different
antibiotic, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, the symptoms had grown worse, and the
Carlisles faxed the details to her pediatrician. He urged them to
return home immediately. Before the Ecstasy docked in Cozumel,
Mexico, Mrs. Carlisle took Elizabeth back to Neri. At Mrs.
Carlisle's insistence, he examined her physically for the first
time, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him point blank if this could be appendicitis,'' Mrs.
Carlisle said in an interview. ``He said, `No, no, it's not. I'm
not sure what it is. I'm sorry your vacation has been ruined.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, doctors discovered that Elizabeth's appendix had
ruptured and she had a massive infection. She underwent two
operations and has what are expected to be lifelong health
problems, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint accuses Carnival of employing doctors who were
poorly educated, not licensed in the United States and not skilled
in handling emergencies. It also accuses the company of false
advertising for saying there was a competent doctor on board.
</P>
<P>
   Charles R. Lipcon, the Miami lawyer who filed the suit, said,
``In every suit I file against cruise companies, I claim bad
medical care because invariably there is bad medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers said the company was not responsible for the
care provided by Neri. ``It is well settled that a cruise ship
operator cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence of
its ship's medical staff in the care and treatment of passengers,''
they said in a court filing, citing several cases in which judges
ruled in cruise lines' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival and other cruise lines say they are not responsible for
the doctors and nurses on their ships because they are independent
contractors, not employees. They also say that maritime law
requires them to provide medical care only for the crew, not
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for passengers counter that the doctors are agents of
the ship's owner because they wear an officer's uniform, have their
office on the ship and are paid by the ship. Passengers, they say,
are essentially captives unable to seek other medical care. The
courts, however, have sided with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Neri has not responded to the Carlisle suit, and efforts to
locate him were unsuccessful. According to court records, Neri
finished medical school in his native Italy in 1981 and had nine
medical jobs in Italy, Africa and England before he was hired by
Carnival in 1996 for $1,057 a month. His last job had been at a
hospital in Middlesex, England.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Diskin, chairman of the emergency department at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, is Carnival's medical hiring
consultant. He said he had relied on Neri's resume in recommending
hiring him and made no independent effort at verification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the British system, I would have relied a lot upon his
most recent employment being in Britain,'' he said in a deposition
in the family's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors applying to a small-town hospital, by contrast, usually
have their license and medical-school record examined by a
credentials committee. Representatives of the committee also talk
directly to those named as a doctor's references, and the applicant
must appear for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of foreign medical schools must pass a series of tests
to apply for a license in this country. New York City's public
hospitals rely heavily on foreign-trained doctors, but their
minimum standards require that the doctor complete a residency and
pass a foreign medical exam and the state licensing exam.
</P>
<P>
   The point, said Dr. Jane Zimmerman of the city's Health and
Hospitals Corp., is not that foreign-trained doctors are not as
good as their American counterparts but that they must meet the
same basic qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival officials declined a request for an interview. In
response to written questions, the company said the credentials and
references of its doctors and nurses were verified by telephone or
in writing. The company also said that its medical staff and
infirmaries met the industry's guidelines and that its doctors had
malpractice insurance.
</P>
<P>
   People rarely consider medical care when planning a cruise. They
are more likely to think about the size of their cabin, the quality
of the food and the ports of call. Often, ship's doctors said,
passengers even forget to bring their medications.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Curtis, a real estate agent from Cockeysville, Md., did not
want to leave anything to chance when she and her husband, James,
headed off on a weeklong cruise last February aboard Carnival's
Sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Jimmy had had heart surgery a year earlier, I insisted
that he get a complete physical before we went,'' she said in an
interview. ``I wanted to make sure we weren't going to be in the
middle of nowhere and have something happen. The doctors said he
was absolutely fine, 100 percent fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days after setting sail from Tampa, Fla., after an
afternoon on a Mexican beach and a relaxing night with friends,
Curtis lay dying in the Sensation's infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Curtis slowly and painfully bled to death through a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,'' according to the complaint
filed by his wife against Carnival Corp., Dr. James R. Otworth and
Constance Jackson, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said that Otworth and Ms. Jackson had failed to
diagnose Curtis' condition and had not provided proper treatment,
including a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blood, Curtis was given so much intravenous solution
that his corpse was bloated, his wife said in an interview. Sitting
in her house outside Baltimore, surrounded by mementos of 30 years
of marriage, she said she did not sue Carnival just for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is money now?'' she said. ``I want to make an issue
of the substandard care aboard cruise ships.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that different care could have saved Curtis. His
wife's lawyer, Michael A. Mullen, said medical experts were
reviewing the case. A Carnival lawyer, Jeffrey B. Maltzman, said
the rupture that killed Curtis was extremely difficult to diagnose
and required immediate surgery at a major trauma center. He said
the condition was usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Maltzman said that the captain had begun to divert the ship and
had notified the Coast Guard but that Curtis died before arriving
in port. He also said Otworth was an American physician who was
board certified in internal medicine as well as in advanced cardiac
and trauma care.
</P>
<P>
   Otworth and Ms. Jackson have not responded in court, and efforts
to reach them were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson also provided care for Janice Hatch aboard the
Sensation in 1997. Mrs. Hatch, a diabetic from Flint, Mich., and
her husband, Craig, were on their honeymoon when she felt flushed
on a walk in port and went to the infirmary upon returning to the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ms. Jackson and Dr. Leon Rand, a semiretired physician
from New Jersey, checked Mrs. Hatch's blood sugar with a glucose
meter. According to the couple's lawsuit, filed against Carnival in
Dade County Circuit Court, Ms. Jackson said the blood sugar was
extremely high and administered fast-acting insulin to bring it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of getting better, she got worse and worse,'' Hatch
said in an interview. ``She was totally unconscious and went into a
diabetic coma and was wringing wet. I called for the nurse, and she
said she'd come around. I waited and she started jerking real
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he raced to the couple's cabin to grab his wife's
glucose meter and returned to the infirmary. When he measured her
blood sugar, he discovered that it was not too high but too low.
Ms. Jackson administered glucose, and Mrs. Hatch regained
consciousness after about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by doctors hired by the Hatches in the court files
indicate that brain damage and other injuries from the episode have
left Mrs. Hatch disoriented and unable to return to her job as a
millwright for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers have challenged the suit on several grounds,
including that cruise lines are not required to provide medical
care. They said that the ship's glucose meter had been checked for
accuracy the day before the incident and that infirmary records
showed only that Mrs. Hatch received both insulin and glucose and
left the ship without complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident of our position and believe the final
outcome will vindicate Carnival from any wrongdoing,'' a statement
from the cruise line said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said in the interview that they had been too frightened to
seek further care. ``I wouldn't have asked them for an aspirin,''
he said. ``Why would I? I'm the one that saved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rand and Ms. Jackson were named in a separate suit, and their
lawyer, Christopher E. Knight, said neither he nor his clients had
any comment. But Knight, who often represents doctors and nurses
from the cruise industry, said shipboard treatment met the basic
standard for care.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a passenger should expect and will find is reasonable
emergency medical care,'' he said. ``What a cruise ship does not
have is a full medical staff like a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government does not monitor medical care on
cruise ships, it does inspect them for sanitation, and there is
evidence that the regulation helps. Government officials said food
and water sanitation had improved significantly in recent years,
and large outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness have declined.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Vessel Sanitation Program inspects cruise ships that use U.S.
ports. Inspectors with a 42-item checklist examine sanitation and
general cleanliness. Vessels that fail to score at least 86 out of
100 are inspected again within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   If a ship fails a second time, the agency can recommend that it
not sail, a step taken only once in the last three years with a
large cruise ship. In the most serious instances, the Centers for
Disease Control can ask the Coast Guard to invoke quarantine laws
and detain a ship. Officials said that had never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that the commitment to sanitation by the cruise lines
is very strong,'' said David L. Forney, acting director of the
sanitation program, ``because they realize the consequences of
having an outbreak on a ship and because they realize the power of
our scores from a public-relations standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ship's scores, called green sheets, are posted on the
agency's Internet site (www.cdc.gov/travel) within a week and are
distributed regularly to about 6,000 travel agents and frequent
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported outbreaks of illness affecting 3 percent
or more of passengers or crew members has declined to 10 in 1997
and nine in 1998 from an average of 15 a year a decade ago,
according to the agency. There has been one so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forney said the program held cruise ships to a higher standard
of cleanliness than restaurants on land because an outbreak at sea
was potentially so serious. ``The consequences of something
happening, you don't even want to think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, at least 270 people became ill with vomiting and
diarrhea from gastroenteritis on Princess Cruises' Regal Princess
over three consecutive cruises. The previous year, 354 passengers
and crew members became ill in an outbreak of gastroenteritis
aboard the Royal Odyssey, a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak aboard Carnival's Jubilee in June 1996 was smaller,
but deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers on that cruise were Russell Lum, 52, an
aircraft mechanic from Berkeley, Calif.; his wife, Sharon; their
daughter, Courtney, and a niece, Robin Tom. They had boarded the
Jubilee on Father's Day in San Pedro, Calif., for a weeklong cruise
along the coast of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint in a wrongful-death suit filed by
Mrs. Lum against Carnival in U.S. District Court in Miami, on the
second night Lum complained that he was not feeling well. He
vomited and spent the next day resting in the cabin. His wife,
meanwhile, heard other passengers discussing people falling ill
with diarrhea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:30 a.m. on the third day, Mrs. Lum said in an interview,
she woke when her husband collapsed outside the cabin's bathroom.
She said she called the ship's infirmary but the nurse tried to
discourage her from bringing him there because it was so late. Mrs.
Lum said she insisted, and her husband was put on an intravenous
solution to avoid dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, the nurse took Lum's blood pressure and said he
was improving and could return to his cabin. Tired but relieved,
Mrs. Lum hurried to the cabin to get towels and a change of
clothes, because her husband had soiled his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and niece were awake, and I told them he was fine
and would be coming back,'' Mrs. Lum said. ``I was gone about five
minutes, and when I got back to the infirmary the doctor and nurse
asked me to wait in the waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing briefly, Mrs. Lum said she waited for several minutes,
wondering what was going on. Then the doctor and nurse returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back and told me that he had taken a turn for the
worse and he had died,'' she said. ``I asked them how that was
possible, and they said there was nothing they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum was the only person to die among the 52 passengers and 16
crew members who came down with viral gastroenteritis on the
cruise. His death was caused by extensive blood loss from a tear in
his esophagus caused by vomiting, according to the family's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lum died of retching to death,'' said Erik Peterson, the
family's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis J. Mase, a lawyer for Carnival, said in court papers that
the company was not responsible, contending that the death was an
act of God and that Lum had failed to seek timely or appropriate
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Lum's own negligence contributed to his death and
injuries,'' Mase said.

</P>
<P>
   Hard as Hollywood tries to get it right, it often falls back on
the old cliches. The latest offering in this genre is ``Music of
the Heart,'' with Meryl Streep playing the real-life Roberta
Guaspari. Abandoned by her Navy officer husband, she moved her two
small sons and a crate of violins to New York's East Harlem and
talked her way into a job at Central Park East school. Threatened
by budget cuts, Ms. Guaspari conducted her best violin students in
a triumphal concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Central Park East is one of the most acclaimed
public schools in the country, a harmonious blend of races and
classes in a rough neighborhood; even middle-class parents beg for
their children to be admitted. In the movie, it becomes a
stereotypical ghetto school with lazy tenured teachers, racial
discord and routine violence, where one stern but courageous
teacher saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   While lauding Ms. Guaspari, Deborah Meier, the founder of
Central Park East, complains that the movie turned a chance to tell
a complex story of a good school nurturing a fellow risk-taker into
a simple tale of good guys versus bad guys.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton found another way to mix business and

   A Mysterious Flight to Death
</P>
<P>
   Something, possibly something quite small, went wrong on a
Learjet chartered in Orlando, Fla., on Monday by pro golfer Payne
Stewart. It was evidently big enough to disable or kill the two
pilots, but not big enough to stop the airplane from flying 1,400
miles, presumably on autopilot, to a pasture in South Dakota, where
it crashed when one of its engines ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders usually provide clues in crashes, but in
this case the tape was a 30-minute loop, and the plane flew for
about 4 hours without human intervention. It had no flight data
recorder. But investigators still hope for clues from the wreckage,
and from interviews with maintenance workers and fighter pilots who
were scrambled to see what was going on.

   After 10 years of the flamboyant rule of President Carlos Saul
Menem, Argentines gave a landslide presidential election victory to
the unabashedly uncharismatic mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la
Rua, and his center-left Alianza coalition. De la Rua is not
expected to take Argentina in a direction very different from the
policies of Menem, but his victory broke a decade of dominance by
the Justicialist party founded half a century ago by Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron. More than anything else, the vote for De la Rua
appeared to reflect a popular rejection of the extravagance and
perceived tolerance of corruption by Menem and other Peronist
leaders.

   Assassination in Armenia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian had just finished answering
questions from members of Armenia's Parliament when five men in
trench coats, some toting Kalashnikov automatic rifles, rushed in.
One emptied his weapon into Sarkisian while others turned on the
audience, firing into the front row where government dignitaries
sat.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended some 17 hours later, eight men were dead,
including the prime minister and the speaker of the Parliament, and
about 40 hostages had spent a terrifying night under siege by
police and a special anti-terrorist team sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Why remains somewhat foggy. The five gunmen, led by an Armenian
ex-journalist and ultra-nationalist named Nairi Unanian,
surrendered and released their hostages Thursday morning after
being allowed to broadcast a statement on national television. In
it, they accused Sarkisian and other leaders of destroying the
economy and allowing corruption to rot the government.

   From the governor of the state to the people in the street,

the state's first-in-the-nation law permitting physician-assisted
suicide for the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Death with Dignity Act was approved by the
narrowest of margins in 1994 but then, facing a legal challenge,
was reaffirmed by a 60 percent to 40 percent vote three years
later. And however fiercely they debated the issue among
themselves, many Oregonians were clearly perturbed after Congress
acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Congress really saying that our vote doesn't count, it
doesn't matter?'' explained one man _ even though he voted against
the act both times. State officials, saying the matter was a
states' rights issue, said they were considering a way to get a
challenge before the Supreme Court.

LAST INDONESIAN TROOPS LEAVE EAST TIMOR, ENDING 24-YEAR
OCCUPATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Ending a failed 24-year occupation that
culminated in a rampage of destruction, the last 900 Indonesian
soldiers remaining on this island territory pulled down their
red-and-white flag Saturday and began heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Their officers were seen off at the airport by the people who
took their place: the U.N. representative, the Australian general
who heads an international peacekeeping force and Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, the guerrilla chief who led a separatist war against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sensational,'' said Gusmao with a delighted grin after
sharing polite smiles and handshakes with the departing officers.
Freed from seven years in detention in Indonesia, he is now the
effective leader of an emerging new East Timorese nation. He and
his countrymen had battled the Indonesians since they invaded in
1975, occupying the vacuum left when Portugal abandoned this land,
its former colony, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, beginning today, there is no more Indonesia here,'' said
Lt. Col. J.D. Sembiring, one of the departing officers, who said he
thought the East Timorese had erred in voting for independence, but
wished them well. ``Now we want to leave this area because in the
struggle so many people have died,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 East Timorese have been slain or died of
disease and starvation since Indonesia invaded and annexed this
land as its 27th province. Tens of thousands of Indonesian soldiers
have also lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun sank, young men danced around a small fire on the
beach, singing a song of freedom and shouting, ``Yeehah! Viva East
Timor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughingly, we celebrate our freedom,'' said one, Santos
Kosme. ``Today is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the last of the Indonesian soldiers filed aboard
their transport ship, each with his bag on his shoulder, in a
silence broken only by their low murmuring.
</P>
<P>
   In the last action of their long years here, a small guard unit
crouched behind a perimeter fence at the port with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The troop departure was the final step in a painful separation
that began with a referendum on Aug. 30 in which 78.5 percent of
those voting chose to break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was followed by a rampage of terror and destruction by
militias backed by the Indonesian military that destroyed or
damaged an estimated 70 percent of East Timor's buildings and
forced most of its 800,000 people to become refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an international peacekeeping force of 7,500 troops
was deployed here on Sept. 20. The Indonesian Parliament voted this
month to accept East Timor's vote for independence. Four days ago,
the United Nations voted to set up an interim administration here
for two to three years, including the deployment of 9,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of East Timor and the presence of foreign troops here
have humiliated Indonesia and aroused a defensive wave of
nationalism. But these were only side issues in an intense
political upheaval that ended Oct. 20 with the parliamentary
election of Abdurrahman Wahid, a Muslim cleric, as the new
president of the world's fourth-largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of conciliation, Wahid said he would greet Gusmao
at the airport if he traveled to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Gusmao said Saturday that he planned to accept the invitation and
also to talk with Indonesian military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost whispering as he spoke to reporters in a light rain,
sometimes opening his eyes wide, sometimes breaking into a bright,
happy smile, Gusmao said he hoped Indonesia and East Timor could be
good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in a position to look at the future and we hope
that the two countries can develop friendly and cooperative
relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As if he did not want the moment to end, Gusmao chatted at
length in the airport departure lounge with the Indonesian
officers. Most of them managed to continue smiling as long as he
did.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall was a newly painted advertisement for beer that
read, ``Welcome to the Nation of Lorosae,'' the local name for East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the day's emotion was the port, where a ferryload
of 1,400 returning refugees docked Saturday morning, just 300 yards
from the gray transport ship where soldiers were preparing to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Because of previous incidents of rock-throwing, the peacekeepers
had erected a huge burlap shield along the perimeter fence to block
the departing soldiers from view. The troops were escorted through
the streets by Australian armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For days now, crowds of men have gathered outside the port to
jeer as they watch the departing remnants of an Indonesian force
that once numbered as many as 24,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad they are going because now we are free from
intimidation, free from terror, and now we can develop our own
country,'' said Jose Barros, 34, who worked until the recent wave
of violence as an official in a local government office. ``I
respect what they built for us here, but what is more important for
us than roads and houses and schools is our right to determine
ourselves for independence.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During its quarter-century of occupation, Indonesia poured an
estimated $100 million a year into the small territory _ much of it
spent in trying to subdue the small but stubborn guerrilla
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of blood spilled over the decades in keeping
their empire together,'' said Eric Chamberlain, a former Australian
military attache in Indonesia who now works for a relief
organization here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they spent a fortune trying to make it a showplace,'' he
said. ``They used to tell me a lot of soldiers were angry about how
much more money was being poured in here than into their own towns.
So they made it a showplace and now they've trashed it, and they
did it with such a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those military officers who coordinated and took part in
it, he said, the campaign of destruction was clearly meant to send
a message _ a message sprayed in graffiti on the side of one of the
burned buildings in Dili's commercial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of making the wrong choice,'' it said, in a
reference to the vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Dili remains in ruins, but is swarming with life as refugees
return from the hills or on boats and aircraft from camps in
Indonesian West Timor, where they fled or were forced to go by the
rampaging militias. People are moving back into their burned-out
homes, though many must use blue tarpaulins issued by aid agencies
as roofs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Indonesian troops have departed over recent weeks, they
have carried off whatever furniture or other loot they could. Even
the nets were gone from the tennis courts they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The returnees who will now take their places as masters of East
Timor begin with almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get the basics of life,'' said Luciano Calestini, an
official of the aid agency World Vision, who was handing out
supplies Saturday morning. ``The basics of life is a plastic sheet,
a blanket, a couple of bars of soap, a jerrycan for water and five
kilograms of rice.''

</P>
<P>
   Hard as Hollywood tries to get it right, it often falls back on
the old cliches. The latest offering in this genre is ``Music of
the Heart,'' with Meryl Streep playing the real-life Roberta
Guaspari. Abandoned by her Navy officer husband, she moved her two
small sons and a crate of violins to New York's East Harlem and
talked her way into a job at Central Park East school. Threatened
by budget cuts, Ms. Guaspari conducted her best violin students in
a triumphal concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Central Park East is one of the most acclaimed
public schools in the country, a harmonious blend of races and
classes in a rough neighborhood; even middle-class parents beg for
their children to be admitted. In the movie, it becomes a
stereotypical ghetto school with lazy tenured teachers, racial
discord and routine violence, where one stern but courageous
teacher saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   While lauding Ms. Guaspari, Deborah Meier, the founder of
Central Park East, complains that the movie turned a chance to tell
a complex story of a good school nurturing a fellow risk-taker into
a simple tale of good guys versus bad guys.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton found another way to mix business and
pleasure, using the occasion of her 52nd birthday to hold a
fundraiser in New York to finance her expected campaign for the
U.S. Senate. An array of Broadway stars, from Joel Grey to Rosie
O'Donnell, presented a night of songs, skits paying tribute to Mrs.
Clinton, and insults directed at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
Mrs. Clinton's presumed opponent in the contest for the Senate seat
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The night raised $1 million for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory

</P>

   A Mysterious Flight to Death
</P>
<P>
   Something, possibly something quite small, went wrong on a
Learjet chartered in Orlando, Fla., on Monday by pro golfer Payne
Stewart. It was evidently big enough to disable or kill the two
pilots, but not big enough to stop the airplane from flying 1,400
miles, presumably on autopilot, to a pasture in South Dakota, where
it crashed when one of its engines ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders usually provide clues in crashes, but in
this case the tape was a 30-minute loop, and the plane flew for
about 4 hours without human intervention. It had no flight data
recorder. But investigators still hope for clues from the wreckage,
and from interviews with maintenance workers and fighter pilots who
were scrambled to see what was going on.

the unabashedly uncharismatic mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la

expected to take Argentina in a direction very different from the
policies of Menem, but his victory broke a decade of dominance by
the Justicialist party founded half a century ago by Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron. More than anything else, the vote for De la Rua
appeared to reflect a popular rejection of the extravagance and
perceived tolerance of corruption by Menem and other Peronist
leaders.

editor-in-chief Robert Wallace resigned, saying he did not want to
be associated with such books and had had no control over
publication of this one.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ acquired for a modest $25,000 advance _ was written
by J.H. Hatfield, who the publisher belatedly discovered was a

   Assassination in Armenia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian had just finished answering
questions from members of Armenia's Parliament when five men in
trench coats, some toting Kalashnikov automatic rifles, rushed in.
One emptied his weapon into Sarkisian while others turned on the
audience, firing into the front row where government dignitaries
sat.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended some 17 hours later, eight men were dead,
including the prime minister and the speaker of the Parliament, and
about 40 hostages had spent a terrifying night under siege by
police and a special anti-terrorist team sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Why remains somewhat foggy. The five gunmen, led by an Armenian
ex-journalist and ultra-nationalist named Nairi Unanian,
surrendered and released their hostages Thursday morning after
being allowed to broadcast a statement on national television. In
it, they accused Sarkisian and other leaders of destroying the
economy and allowing corruption to rot the government.

   By week's end, Unanian and two others had been charged with
terrorism, potentially punishable by death.

the state's first-in-the-nation law permitting physician-assisted
suicide for the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Death with Dignity Act was approved by the
narrowest of margins in 1994 but then, facing a legal challenge,
was reaffirmed by a 60 percent to 40 percent vote three years
later. And however fiercely they debated the issue among
themselves, many Oregonians were clearly perturbed after Congress
acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Congress really saying that our vote doesn't count, it
doesn't matter?'' explained one man _ even though he voted against
the act both times. State officials, saying the matter was a
states' rights issue, said they were considering a way to get a
challenge before the Supreme Court.

   The chief House sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said doctors
should never be permitted to ``put down the stethoscope and pick up

   NEW YORK _ It once seemed so easy. Toward the end of every
mayoral campaign in New York City, candidates would head to the
Lower East Side where, crowded in by cameras, they would eat a
knish or a pastrami sandwich and talk about how much they loved
Israel. Or toward the finish of a presidential campaign, the
candidates would turn up in the Polish section of Chicago for some
kielbasa, a pro forma denunciation of Soviet domination of Eastern
Europe and more photographs. This was ethnic politics in its most
primal form, an unstated calculation that the most elementary of
gestures _ a visit, a picture, a noncontroversial proclamation or
two _ would produce a payback in the form of the ``Jewish vote'' or
the ``Polish vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are suddenly looking very far away. Ethnic politics,
which was never really as simple as some politicians believed, has
reached a level of complexity that is suddenly confounding
politicians across the nation. That has become especially apparent
these days in what is arguably the first cauldron of ethnic
politics in the United States _ New York _ with its race for the
Senate between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a contest that seems to be providing an intricate road
map of where ethnic politics in America is heading.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, winning the Jewish vote in New York was never just a
matter of eating a Kosher dill, just as capturing the Hispanic vote
in Texas or California required more than the ability to spout a
few lines in Spanish. But these days, candidates are forced to take
positions on all kinds of complicated issues, pitting the perceived
interests of one ethnic group against the sentiment of the larger
population, or dividing members of purportedly solid constituencies
by generation, ideology and economic class.
</P>
<P>
   And these pressures are coming at a time when groups that once
existed at the margins of electoral politics _ most of all,
Hispanic voters, whose clout nearly rivals blacks in some parts of
the country _ have become powerful forces, large in number,
knowledgeable about issues and savvy in working the system. The
idea of such constituencies as single-minded voting blocs,
concerned only with parochial issues and subject to easy
manipulation, is as much of a relic as Tammany Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do tokenism anymore,'' said Lynn Cutler, a long-time
Democratic operative who is now a White House adviser to Vice
President Al Gore. ``I think that maybe in all honesty the way we
did it in the past wasn't respectful. It was like, `I checked that
box. I ate the knish.' There's less single-issue voting based on
ethnic differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat and the ranking Puerto Rican
member in the House, said: ``There was a time when all you had to
do was get up and say a few Spanish words or eat the right Spanish
food and you were an amigo. Now, the issues are much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sophisticated, new environment, it is no longer enough
to take off, for example, on the three-I travel itinerary of
Israel, Italy and Ireland in preparation for a New York campaign.
Not long ago, Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton were forced to choose
between what the Defense Department described as the nation's
security over Puerto Rico and the concerns of local leaders about
the island's safety when the Pentagon said it wanted to continue
bombing practice there. (Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton chose Puerto
Rico.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mrs. Clinton is now pressed to take a position on an
application before President Clinton to grant clemency to Jonathan
Jay Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst serving a life
sentence for spying on the United States. Giuliani has demanded
that Clinton free Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   The most unsettling episode, at least for Mrs. Clinton, came
over the summer after Clinton offered executive clemency to 16
jailed members of the FALN, a Puerto Rican separatist group that
has engaged in terrorism. When he first made the offer, she tepidly
endorsed it, and Republicans charged that the president had acted
to curry support for his wife with Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   As an uproar erupted, Mrs. Clinton withdrew her support for
clemency, and found herself besieged both by Puerto Rican leaders
on one side and Republican critics on the other. For Mrs. Clinton,
it was an unhappy introduction to New York ethnic politics.
</P>
<P>
   What most mystified Mrs. Clinton's Puerto Rican supporters was
why she said anything at all. Once upon a time, it might have made
sense to reflexively adopt a position that many Republicans _ as
well as a few independent political commentators _ argued was the
obvious stance a Democratic candidate should take to capture this
important constituency.

gestures _ a visit, a picture, a noncontroversial proclamation or
two _ would produce a payback in the form of the ``Jewish vote'' or
the ``Polish vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are suddenly looking very far away. Ethnic politics,
which was never really as simple as some politicians believed, has
reached a level of complexity that is suddenly confounding
politicians across the nation. That has become especially apparent
these days in what is arguably the first cauldron of ethnic
politics in the United States _ New York _ with its race for the
Senate between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a contest that seems to be providing an intricate road
map of where ethnic politics in America is heading.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, winning the Jewish vote in New York was never just a
matter of eating a Kosher dill, just as capturing the Hispanic vote
in Texas or California required more than the ability to spout a
few lines in Spanish. But these days, candidates are forced to take
positions on all kinds of complicated issues, pitting the perceived
interests of one ethnic group against the sentiment of the larger
population, or dividing members of purportedly solid constituencies
by generation, ideology and economic class.
</P>
<P>
   And these pressures are coming at a time when groups that once
existed at the margins of electoral politics _ most of all,
Hispanic voters, whose clout nearly rivals blacks in some parts of
the country _ have become powerful forces, large in number,
knowledgeable about issues and savvy in working the system. The
idea of such constituencies as single-minded voting blocs,
concerned only with parochial issues and subject to easy
manipulation, is as much of a relic as Tammany Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do tokenism anymore,'' said Lynn Cutler, a long-time
Democratic operative who is now a White House adviser to Vice
President Al Gore. ``I think that maybe in all honesty the way we
did it in the past wasn't respectful. It was like, `I checked that
box. I ate the knish.' There's less single-issue voting based on
ethnic differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat and the ranking Puerto Rican
member in the House, said: ``There was a time when all you had to
do was get up and say a few Spanish words or eat the right Spanish
food and you were an amigo. Now, the issues are much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sophisticated, new environment, it is no longer enough
to take off, for example, on the three-I travel itinerary of
Israel, Italy and Ireland in preparation for a New York campaign.
Not long ago, Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton were forced to choose
between what the Defense Department described as the nation's
security over Puerto Rico and the concerns of local leaders about
the island's safety when the Pentagon said it wanted to continue
bombing practice there. (Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton chose Puerto
Rico.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mrs. Clinton is now pressed to take a position on an
application before President Clinton to grant clemency to Jonathan
Jay Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst serving a life
sentence for spying on the United States. Giuliani has demanded
that Clinton free Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   The most unsettling episode, at least for Mrs. Clinton, came
over the summer after Clinton offered executive clemency to 16
jailed members of the FALN, a Puerto Rican separatist group that
has engaged in terrorism. When he first made the offer, she tepidly
endorsed it, and Republicans charged that the president had acted
to curry support for his wife with Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   As an uproar erupted, Mrs. Clinton withdrew her support for
clemency, and found herself besieged both by Puerto Rican leaders
on one side and Republican critics on the other. For Mrs. Clinton,
it was an unhappy introduction to New York ethnic politics.
</P>
<P>
   What most mystified Mrs. Clinton's Puerto Rican supporters was
why she said anything at all. Once upon a time, it might have made
sense to reflexively adopt a position that many Republicans _ as
well as a few independent political commentators _ argued was the
obvious stance a Democratic candidate should take to capture this
important constituency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Puerto Ricans living in the United States are divided
over whether the island should be independent. The FALN has not
been in the news for years, and many young Puerto Rican Americans
know little about it. And even among those who know of the group,
and support its goal of Puerto Rican independence, there is no
evidence of widespread support for its tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated,'' said Joseph Wiscovitch, a political
consultant who has worked on Hispanic issues for Democratic and
Republican candidates, including Giuliani. ``Some Latinos feel, why
is all this energy being spent on FALN? Why not spend it on
education. You're talking about the silent majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Serrano said he believes there was not much electoral
benefit in his advocating clemency: ``I don't know if that will get
you a lot of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Hispanics have attracted the most attention of the
nation's politicians. This group of voters is at the leading edge
of the changing dynamics of ethnic politics, outpacing blacks as a
segment of the population, even if they remain, to date, a smaller
part of the electorate, because of citizenship requirements and
age, said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban
Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
Nationally, Hispanics made up 5 percent of the vote last year, up
from 3 percent in 1992. In New York City, they made up 20 percent
of the vote in the 1997 mayoral race, compared to 13 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as a group, Hispanics are increasingly large and diverse, in
terms of country of origin, ideology and economic class. If there
ever was such a thing as a ``Hispanic vote,'' it doesn't exist now.
Hispanic voters, like many ethnic groups, are better informed than
before. There are Spanish-language television networks, radio
stations and newspapers. ``We now have 24 hours a day the ability
to get information in Spanish if we're not conversant in English
yet,'' Serrano said. ``There was a time that you couldn't get to
know the issues because no one was covering them in the language
that we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Generational differences in the views of ethnic groups are also
emerging. The single burning issue of one generation of immigrants,
which made them vulnerable to easy appeals by politicians, has
become merely one of many concerns for their American children and
grandchildren. In Florida, older Cuban-Americans are as passionate
in their opposition to Fidel Castro as ever; but that bitterness
has not necessarily passed down to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   It was once unthinkable for a candidate in New York to support
the creation of a Palestinian state, and Mrs. Clinton came under
much criticism when she did. But Ms. Cutler, who is Jewish, said
she has found that her own children, while extremely concerned
about Israel, are not at all perturbed by the notion of a
Palestinian state. ``It is subtle, but that is the difference,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a politician respond to this changing dynamic? A
clue can be found in the presidential campaigns, where, not
surprisingly, it can be hard to pass a campaign day without hearing
an Anglo candidate speaking Spanish. At an appearance at a Hispanic
banquet in Washington the other day, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who
has considerable experience in appealing for the votes of
Mexican-Americans, boasted how he did not have to tailor his speech
for this audience, because they already shared his values. He would
not, he said, say anything special to appeal to Hispanics. And
then, without a skipping a beat, Bush recounted how he can't go
anywhere without someone asking him if he is going after the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Por su puesto!'' Bush said, using the Spanish for ``of
course.''

<P>
   It certainly is easy to get fat in America. Take the room
service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md. If you
order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels,
orange juice, a banana and strawberries _ a meal with at least
1,000 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of
the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average
number of calories year by year. And the percentage of adults who
claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991
to 1998, at about 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a
predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year. More
than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more
than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official
medical measure of fatness. (Overweight is defined as a body mass
index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30. Your body mass
index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of
your height in feet.)
</P>
<P>
   And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with
poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed
to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose
fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust. In a preliminary
study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little
or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually
gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future
could hold more bad news. Others say there may in fact be a magic
bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular
biology. And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective
obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that
has proved so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an
obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating. Every time it
seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more
weight. These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population
gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors
to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise. It also called for
a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths. If the nation can
mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for
obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity
prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and
environmental components analogous to those already in place for
tobacco use,'' the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a
new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat
people lose interest in eating to excess. Perhaps the drugs should
be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some
researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat
people who cannot control their weight.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of
leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as
part of a natural weight control system. As such, it has revealed
molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely
targeted weight loss drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my prediction,'' said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, who is
deputy director of the obesity research center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent
leptin study. ``We are going to be able to turn off appetite
completely _ eventually. The therapeutics will be sophisticated
enough to stop people from eating.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while there are certainly social and environmental
influences on body weight _ people who live in Southern states tend
to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter _ eventually obesity
will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels. Those who
cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a
pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this
lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of
willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people
were overweight,'' Heymsfield said. ``Seven or eight years ago, the
first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very
important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one
or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People
were shocked.'' That discovery came when scientists reported that
leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin. The
next year, the hormone was found in people.
</P>
<P>
   At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to
be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat
people and they will get thin. But it turned out that overweight
people make plenty of leptin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a
half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
These people eat voraciously _ one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000
calories at a sitting. When several of these people were treated
with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal
the brain that there is fat on the body.

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Animals and people who lack the hormone get no such signal and
they eat continuously.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that leptin would
serve to signal the brain that there is fat on the body rather than
signal the body to get rid of fat, said Dr. Jeffrey Flier, the
chief of endocrinology at the Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution would favor people who could get obese when they
have an opportunity to eat,'' he said. ``Starvation is so much more
of a threat to survival than obesity that it is reasonable to
propose that the role of leptin is as a switch to tell the brain
that you are in danger from food restriction or that you are
okay.''
</P>
<P>
   But leptin is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of leptin has propelled obesity research from a
backwater of scientific activity into one of the major growth areas
in biomedicine,'' said Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of
metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England.
``Once leptin goes to the brain, the next switches in that circuit
really are likely to lead to advances in obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Greenberg, an author with Heymsfield of the new
leptin paper and the director of the program in human obesity at
the the Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center at
Tufts University, cautioned that the research has hardly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are in obesity is where people were in cholesterol
research 15 years ago,'' Greenberg said. ``They were just beginning
to define the mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heymsfield said the leptin discovery has allowed him to
envision a pharmacological end to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it, `` he said, ``as the dawn of the molecular era in
obesity therapeutics.''

have an opportunity to eat,'' he said. ``Starvation is so much more
of a threat to survival than obesity that it is reasonable to
propose that the role of leptin is as a switch to tell the brain
that you are in danger from food restriction or that you are
okay.''
</P>
<P>
   But leptin is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of leptin has propelled obesity research from a
backwater of scientific activity into one of the major growth areas
in biomedicine,'' said Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of
metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England.
``Once leptin goes to the brain, the next switches in that circuit
really are likely to lead to advances in obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Greenberg, an author with Heymsfield of the new
leptin paper and the director of the program in human obesity at
the the Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center at
Tufts University, cautioned that the research has hardly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are in obesity is where people were in cholesterol
research 15 years ago,'' Greenberg said. ``They were just beginning
to define the mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heymsfield said the leptin discovery has allowed him to
envision a pharmacological end to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it, `` he said, ``as the dawn of the molecular era in
obesity therapeutics.''

   What is the right age for children to start school?
</P>
<P>
   Americans quickly say 5 or 6, but it has only been that way in
the United States for a couple of generations. In France, Belgium
and elsewhere in Europe, 3- and 4-year-olds must attend class. With
new research finding that evidence of early education has a lasting
impact, along with the continued push of women into the work force,
movement for universal preschool is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, superintendent of public instruction in
California, says preschool is ``the next big idea,'' and that by
the end of the next decade, school will be a hybrid of day care and
kindergarten and begin at age 3. Vice President Al Gore has made
the concept a staple of his presidential platform; his rival for
the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley, proposes doubling funds
for Head Start, the government's 35-year-old preschool program for
poor children. The Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, has a $235 million pre-kindergarten program for poor children
in his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody interested in education has got to be interested in
getting there early,'' said Edward Zigler, a child psychologist at
Yale University and a founder of the Head Start program. ``Why is
it that in the first five years of life, which we all know to be
the foundation years, that every family is out for themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 55 percent of American children, from 3 to 5, are in some
form of preschool, with 79 percent in families earning over $75,000
a year and 43 percent in those making under $10,000. The choices
range from costly new programs like Creme de la Creme, which offers
French and tennis to toddlers, to Montessori method and to day-care
centers where television forms the core of a ``curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on pre-kindergarten has more than doubled to
$1.7 billion last year from $700 million in 1991; public enrollment
has risen to 725,000 from less than 300,000. The cost of reaching
every 3- and 4-year-old would be an estimated $30 billion or $5,000
per child.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 42 states have preschool programs, although they serve
only poor children. Georgia, which uses funds from its lottery, is
the only state offering preschool to every child; New York, which
promised universal preschool in 1997, so far has only 30,000
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a tour of France's ``ecole maternelle,'' where
3-year-olds bake pies in science lab and learn to count and read, a
group of educators met in Washington last week to extol the
benefits of preschool for everyone. A recent study by researchers
in North Carolina found that poor black children who received
high-quality day-care from infancy to 5 outperformed their peers
all the way into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would benefit children, it would benefit parents,'' said
Dr. Barry Zuckerman, a Boston University professor of pediatrics,
referring to universal preschool, ``and it's probably an
appropriate societal response to these demographic changes that
we've had. It's literally an evolutionary process.''
</P>
<P>
   Issuing a cautionary note, the Cato Institute, a conservative
research organization in Washington, said the public schools should
not be allowed to expand, since they are increasingly icons of
failure. The benefits of Head Start fade over time, said Darcy Ann
Olsen, an expert on child care for the institute, and the
advantages of nursery school for the middle class have yet to be
proved. She also cited a 1991 federal study showing that 96 percent
of parents were satisfied with their current child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to, who do you trust?'' Ms. Olsen said.
``The advocates trust themselves to make these policies for
millions and millions of children. I think this is a responsibility
for parents. They know their children best.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rector, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said parents would prefer a tax credit, which might
allow them to stay home with their children, rather than a new
government program. Many parents feel guilty about working, he
said, and the movement toward preschool is ``a justification rather
than what's in the best interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some proponents of preschool worry that if government
subsidizes education for toddlers, the market will respond by
paying even less attention to day care for babies.
</P>
<P>
   Kindergarten was controversial, too. Once the province of the
rich when it was introduced in the 1850s from Germany, it expanded
in this century amid worries about immigration and acculturation.
Still, kindergarten has no federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Bettye Caldwell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences, advocates a preschool concept she
calls ``educare,'' in which children would learn letters and
numbers, and social skills like sharing. A well-trained, nurturing
staff would earn salaries equal to schoolteachers (day-care aides'
pay is comparable to that of gas-station attendants).``We can't
think of them as just warehousing or baby-sitting,'' Dr. Caldwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates imagine an extension downward of the
public-school system; others envision a grant those students can
use at private and public colleges. Zuckerman has a more radical
proposal: Why not start school at 3 and end it at 16, enabling
graduates to work or do community service until college?
</P>
<P>
   As Zigler noted, ``There's nothing magic about starting school
at age 5.''

MILOSEVIC IGNORES HIS SCARS AND STUBBORNLY PRESSES ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Slobodan Milosevic _ gray and remote,
internationally isolated and politically unpopular, charged with
war crimes, his army restive and its reservists outraged, his
economy ruined and his factories bombed, his refineries and
electricity system smashed and his sources of fuel unclear, his
roads and railways holed and his bridges collapsed _ has not only
survived the loss of Kosovo, but gained a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   How he has managed to do so over the last five months is a
testament to his grit, preparation and peculiar world view, as well
as to his strict control over the levers of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Through the police, the army and the official news media, he has
sown fear and uncertainty and belittled any pretenders to his
throne, while deepening the divisions among his opposition. The
possibility of a violent explosion is always here in this bruised,
sometimes desperate nation. But with less need than ever to please
the West, Milosevic has shown a tougher, combative, intimidating
side and intensified the sense of threat in the society, being more
willing, even avid, to beat protesters, shut down newspapers and
send people to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic era may be coming to an end, but it will not
happen quickly. He has made clear that he will not be forced from
his office as Yugoslavia's president without a fight for which his
opponents lack the courage and the troops, and he has managed to
extend a degree of confidence to the rest of his regime.
</P>
<P>
   He has also benefited from the manifold mistakes of his divided
enemies, both foreign and domestic, to become a sort of European
Saddam Hussein _ isolated, unpopular but apparently unmovable.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, sensing the panic in his regime after the loss
of Kosovo and a sizable opposition rally in Belgrade, Milosevic
summoned the leaders of his party to stop the rot.
</P>
<P>
   According to some who were there, he said the main task was to
get through the winter, week by week, month by month. While
opposition figures try to finish NATO's job and pull him down, he
said, the government and the party must concentrate on the
reconstruction of the country and patriotic activities of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   They must rebuild the bridges and the power and heating plants,
and insure that every person whose house or apartment was destroyed
by a NATO bomb had a new dwelling for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies must provide and help,'' he said, implying that
it was time for those who had made money from their coziness with
the Milosevic clan to stump up, for their own preservation. ``We
need full mobilization of every segment in order to achieve the
maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   The world would change, he said. President Clinton would go. The
Russians would elect a new president, more nationalist, closer to
Serbia. The world was tired of U.S. hypocrisy and hegemony, he
said. The Europeans understood that the region needs Serbia. Just
hang on. He would outlast them all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his peculiarities, Milosevic is described by everyone
who meets him as possessing a strong will and an aura of
confidence, and he rarely shows fear or unease. During the war, as
one air-raid siren sounded 10 seconds after the others, he turned
to a visitor with a genuine grin, saying, ``That one's always
late.''
</P>
<P>
   He is fond of indulging in the Serbian pastime of vulgar speech
in private, over whisky and cigars, as a way of establishing
intimacy, and he draws others out, leading them on to judge their
loyalty, while keeping his real feelings to himself.
</P>
<P>
   He listens but makes his own decisions in private, usually after
consulting his wife, Mirjana Markovic, whom he met at 17 and with
whom he shares an extremely close and obsessional relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He tends to stay out of the limelight, though he is making a few
more public appearances these days, to show his vitality. Still, as
is habit when he appears on the state television news, an announcer
summarizes his comments, and his voice is rarely heard. He is a
distant patriarch, generally floating above the swamp of daily
politics and squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   In what one Serbian analyst calls a ``Slobocentric universe,''
created over the last 10 years of international isolation, he sits,
like a gnomic sultan, high above a ruined landscape where he
remains the arbiter of what few benefits are still to be had.
Alexander Tijanic, Milosevic's former spokesman, calls him ``an
element in the Serbian periodic table.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He cultivates and drops allies with political acumen, using
influence, money and pressure. Currently, he favors the
ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, a tough politician who has
brandished a gun outside Parliament and punched opponents, to
protect his right wing and to threaten his foes.
</P>
<P>
   In a group, according to those who know him, Milosevic, 58, is a
stiff, self-conscious and rather clumsy man, with the fake air of a
Roman senator, and he carries himself with a kind of artificial
dignity, despising flattery and imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a meeting of his Socialist Party of Serbia's ``glavni
odbor,'' or main committee, Milosevic was both steely and soothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone feels tired, he may feel free to withdraw,'' he said
calmly. ``I will understand this. I have nothing against this.''
Then he paused. ``We are still a rasadnik for cadres,'' he said,
using the Serbian word for tree nursery. ``We have so many cadres
that we could make 20 more governments as good as the one we have
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such an invitation, despite the West's ban on foreign
travel for more than 300 Milosevic associates, and despite the most
fervent hopes of the Clinton administration and the divided Serbian
opposition, no one of any consequence has left the Milosevic
government. There has been no significant split, not even any large
cracks.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   His indictment on charges of war crimes weakened him, but the
simultaneous indictment of four top aides _ including his most
plausible internal successor, the Serbian president, Milan
Milutinovic _ was an additional inducement for Milosevic's elite to
stick together.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He has maneuvered within narrow boundaries and with few
resources to underline his control over the country and the fate of
its people, especially those who fear losing what little they have
left. His government and his crony capitalists have gone into high
gear to fix the war damage, covered lavishly on state television,
which he has controlled throughout his 12-year rule, and they have
secured contracts somehow for Russian natural gas, so people do not
freeze this winter.
</P>
<P>
   He has made sure that the police get paid, that his nationalist
right wing is covered, and that his opposition is excoriated for
its weakness and divisions, while painting those opponents as
agents of the very countries that bombed Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   He has been greatly aided in making those charges by his control
over the state news media, especially broadcasting. But he is able
to make them so plausibly only because of two developments that the
West should have been able to control, officials close to him say.
</P>
<P>
   First, the chaos in Kosovo, where NATO has not prevented the
flight of Serbs in the face of organized Albanian revenge and the
destruction of treasured Serbian monasteries and churches. A
democratic, multiethnic Kosovo would have hurt Milosevic badly,
making Serbs wonder what the war was all about. There is in the
population considerable knowledge and some shame over the deaths of
at least 10,000 Kosovo Albanians, by Western estimates, and the
expulsion of some 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the current state of Kosovo and the mistreatment of even
innocent Serbs let the regime argue that Washington forced the war
on Belgrade, which could not win. The inability of the West to
bring order to Kosovo or to control Albanian crime underlines the
message sent by most Serbian news media that Milosevic had no
option but to fight the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, even if the
war was fought with all the atrocities that Bosnia made so
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the sense of paranoia and victimization on which
Milosevic survives are the perceptions of many Serbs about the
West's attitudes toward them: its embrace of collective guilt and
its lip service toward Belgrade's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the United States and the West made an open embrace of
opposition figures like Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party and
his rival, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, urging
them to overthrow Milosevic in a popular uprising, without a
democratic process. By meeting them in Montenegro, in public, and
providing them with money, however late or limited, Western
diplomats made it easy for Milosevic and his news media to portray
the opposition as paid agents of NATO, continuing its war against
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, who rarely see themselves as the world does, do not
need much prodding to feel that they are the victims of a U.S.
vendetta against one man in a highly personalized battle,
antithetical to America's democratic values, to save the
reputations of Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are perceived as promoting revolution against a
despised but elected leader. That revolution is supposed to be
assisted by the U.S.-promoted deprivation of the Serbian people, by
their lack of heat, gasoline and food, while Washington tries to
veto European efforts to provide such assistance even to
opposition-run towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``With enemies like NATO and the Serbian opposition,'' says
Aleksa Djilas, a political scientist who has followed Milosevic's
career, ``Milosevic doesn't need many friends.'' He thrives on an
atmosphere in which Serbs feel the world is being biased and
unfair, an autism only aided by 10 years of Washington-driven
isolation of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like any incumbent, Milosevic benefits from this atmosphere of
emergency and threat, hardly exaggerated when Washington makes his
overthrow the explicit price of any aid or reintegration for the
Serbs. Even Serbs who agonize over the killings and expulsions of
Kosovo's Albanians find this blackmail hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   After all, argues Milan Milosevic, a veteran analyst at the
independent magazine Vreme who is no relation to the president,
Milosevic was the supreme commander in a war for the fatherland
against an enemy 60 times stronger. Given that ``his head is one of
the declared war aims, it's not entirely cynical for him to argue
that the war continues by other means and to justify wartime
measures,'' Milan Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic himself, says Djilas, has an extraordinary
stamina that derives from his own calculation of interests. ``In
politics, as in war, defeat is often when you think you're
defeated,'' he said. ``If you don't recognize defeat, or you don't
show it, you can last a great deal longer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By any objective terms, Milosevic should be finished. He wanted
to be a Serbian Tito. But Yugoslavia continues to unravel, and
Serbia has lost its fourth war in nine years: Slovenia, Croatia,
Bosnia and now Kosovo, which was an integral part of Serbia itself.
With Montenegro restive and aiming for independence, the orbit of
Serbian control has shrunk to its smallest this century.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is home to some 700,000 refugees and internally displaced
people _ an estimated 200,000 from Kosovo alone. That represents
nearly a tenth of the Serbs in the Balkans. As Djindjic has said,
``Four times the Serbs have gone forth on tanks, and four times
they have come back on tractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Real unemployment is widespread, the Serbian economy is a third
its size in 1989, and average wages are now below 80 German marks a
month, or about $45.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic is in a good mood nonetheless, says a man who has
seen him regularly, having constructed his own peculiar notion of
how the world now works. Yet for a man who fancies himself a
worldly figure and likes nothing better than visits from American
crisis solvers like Richard C. Holbrooke, the isolation in which
Milosevic now lives is exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic once worked as a banker in New York, and he talks
about America all the time, the man said. He seems not to
understand that while he was indispensable to the United States for
regional security after the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the
Bosnian war, he now has little left to offer. He still believes
that the Americans will understand the importance of Serbia to the
region, as the Europeans do. He fails to see that Serbian
atrocities in Kosovo, which he regards as an internal matter and
less severe than in Bosnia, have altered views in America and made
him an untouchable pariah.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic regards the Clinton administration as having gone mad,
this visitor said. ``He can't believe that the American leadership
has been hoodwinked into supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army and
`the narco-traffickers, black marketeers and mafiosos' of
Albania,'' the man said, using Milosevic's own terms. ``He says the
only survival is internal, that we've got to save ourselves until
sanity befalls them. He says: `I've got to run my country and
rebuild. While they were bombing, we were planting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who does not always get a balanced view from cowed
and relatively unsophisticated aides, regards the current anathema
aimed at him as wholly personal, because he would not play to the
American script and give up Kosovo after a few days of bombing, the
man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he'll be there after they're gone and writing their
memoirs, and that someone else will come along, George Bush Jr.,
with less passion about him and more sensible answers. He feels
like he's defending his country and fought a bloody civil war, and
he's not making nuclear weapons and selling them to anybody with
cash or threatening anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   While he has failed as a Serbian Tito, he sees himself as
leading a new nonaligned movement of countries like Russia, China,
India and Belarus that reject Washington's hegemony. Yet much of
this is wishful thinking, and his heart still appears to lie in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see him frequently say he is beginning to believe that
fresh elections, much as Draskovic has called for, not only can be
won but will be an answer to Serbia's postwar isolation. If the
current ruling coalition of his Socialists, his wife's Yugoslav
United Left party, and Seselj's ultranationalist Radicals, running
a single slate of candidates, can win the next Serbian elections,
there will be new legitimacy, his officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they do not win a majority, as is more likely, given his
political weakness and the fatigue of 12 years of government, they
believe that the opposition will not win a majority either. They
believe that some part of the opposition _ in particular Draskovic,
who was a deputy prime minister when the war started _ will be
willing to make a deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   All that may be wrong, of course. The 70 percent of Serbs who
consistently tell pollsters that they want a new government may
have the nerve to vote for one in the polling booths. And the
United States' pressure on Draskovic _ plus his own continuing
anger at what he regards as a regime-directed attempt on his life
in early October _ may be enough to keep him from again making a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But elections would leave Milosevic in his post. And the essence
of his power has never been elections so much as his ability to
create inner conflict, discredit his opposition, manage
self-created crises and rule beyond the institutions he himself has
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll of 1,500 Serbs published in NIN magazine, there
were startling figures that go a long way toward explaining the
survival of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was the first person they thought of as Serbia's
leader, 34.9 percent of the respondents answered, ``no one.''
Milosevic came second, with 18.3 percent. Third came ``undecided,''
with 16.8 percent. The top opposition figure was Draskovic, with
5.4 percent. Djindjic got 3.7 percent, and Seselj got 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an isolated, fearful universe where nearly 52 percent of the
people are unable to articulate an alternate leader for Serbia, the
man who commands a solid 20 percent of the vote can remain king.
</P>
<P>
   But the current mood of tentative confidence should not disguise
the fear that existed in early June, as Milosevic accepted NATO's
ultimatum and agreed to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The regime was in a significant panic, unsure of what to do,
acknowledged Ljubisa Ristic, the president of the vanity party that
Milosevic created for his wife and that serves as one of several
ways to funnel private money into the regime. But it was obvious
that the West's final offer, negotiated with the Russians, had to
be taken, Ristic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs could not shoot down NATO aircraft, despite propaganda
claims. It was the last moment to save the civilian population of
Belgrade from a more permanent loss of bridges, electricity and
infrastructure, Ristic said, while acknowledging that it was also
the best moment for Milosevic and the regime to save themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Close aides found the courage to tell Milosevic that he should
not reject this deal only to accept a worse one later.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an ultimatum, an imminent NATO decision to introduce
ground troops if the war continued much longer, and a threat that
Belgrade would soon lose its bridges and electrical power, the
officials said, Milosevic decided to take an offer that included
benefits he could sell at home. A peace settlement would be
sanctioned by the United Nations, as the war never was. Kosovo
would be explicitly left in Belgrade's sovereignty, with no
reference to any referendum on its future status, a form of
absurdity in a province so heavily Albanian. And Kosovo would be
administered by the United Nations, not by NATO, which would also
have to accept Russian troops as peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But the army generals were appalled, and so was Milosevic's key
coalition partner, the ultranationalist Seselj, who had sworn that
no foreign soldier would ever enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of the Third Army Corps
that controlled Kosovo as well as southern Serbia, was said to have
been shocked by the sudden news of capitulation. He turned pale and
sweaty, slumping silently in the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   But Pavkovic did not rebel, remembering Milosevic's methodical
humiliation of the army from 1992-95 as he built up the police,
giving them military equipment and military ranks and paying them
three times better. And Pavkovic, just weeks later, served
Milosevic by calming angry army reservists who wanted their combat
pay and by warning the opposition that the army would defend the
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj was a harder problem. In a late-night meeting with party
leaders after accepting the NATO-Russian offer, Milosevic asked for
Seselj's support in a parliamentary vote the next day. Milosevic
told him that if he could not vote for the deal, he should at least
abstain. Seselj said that he was not sure he could even do that.
But if the party voted against the deal, Milosevic said, Seselj
must promise not to pull down the government in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Seselj and his Radicals voted against and vowed to
leave the Serbian government out of protest. But they remained. Not
only that, but as opposition protests peaked and then began to
wane, Seselj agreed to join the federal government as well, taking
the seats vacated by Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the failure of Djindjic to bring large numbers of
protesters into the streets was a happy surprise. There had been
serious talk earlier in the summer about a deal with Draskovic that
would have made him Serbian prime minister of a transitional
government, with Milosevic stepping back toward a more
constitutional role as Yugoslav president, officials say. Some
businessmen in or close to the government, like Bogoljub Karic and
Milan Beko, found themselves on the list of 300 or so Milosevic
associates barred from travel or tending their assets abroad and
approached Draskovic to hedge their bets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the United States objected fiercely to the idea that
Milosevic would remain in office at all and threatened Draskovic
himself with indictment on war crimes charges stemming from the
activities of his short-lived Serbian Guard in the Croatian war in
1991. To try to push Draskovic closer to the rest of the
opposition, Washington also put him on the visa watch list, meaning
that he could not travel to America.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much Milosevic himself, who usually uses
go-betweens, was involved in these discussions with Draskovic. But
they fell apart, the opposition wasted the summer, and Milosevic
gained confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare speech Oct. 11 in Leskovac, where some of the first
postwar unrest appeared, Milosevic acknowledged that life is hard
for most people in Serbia. ``It does not take CNN or Deutsche Welle
to tell the citizens of this country that _ I, your president, am
telling you that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he challenged the opposition, saying: ``If citizens feel
that despite all those misfortunes, there are representatives of
the people who could insure a better life for a majority of the
people, let them elect them at the next elections. And that is all
I have to say on that subject.''

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ It was once a sure-fire attack strategy in
presidential debates: Candidates turn to their rivals and scold
them for espousing policies that are fanciful, shallow and even
risky. ``Where's the beef?'' asked Walter Mondale, memorably
needling Gary Hart during the Democratic primary campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   No one's asking now. The 2000 campaign has been marked by an
extraordinary (if not mind-numbing) degree of substance. Candidates
have issued more meaty 10- and 12-point plans, earlier in the
season, than ever before in presidential politics. The question is,
will it pay off? Or are the voters more attuned to that elusive and
much-trumpeted concept, character?
</P>
<P>
   The dueling over policy pronouncements by Vice President Al Gore
and Bill Bradley was on display last week at the first televised
debate here at Dartmouth College. They eagerly plunged into a
discussion of the intricacies of more funding for special
education, health insurance for children and protections for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
issued stacks of position papers (his recent education plan was 12
single-spaced pages) to fend off critiques that he is, in the
parlance of his state of Texas, more hat than horse. But he doesn't
talk about them as much, preferring to project a Reaganesque
geniality and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the candidates' handling of issues reveals their
own approaches and personalities. Gore and Bradley built their
Senate careers on mastery of daunting matters like the environment
and tax system overhauls. ``He's equal part dreamer and policy
wonk,'' Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, partly because he prides himself on not sweating the
details, speaks more about grand themes that have served him well
as governor. He is, no doubt, mindful of polls showing that while
most people are not paying much attention to the presidential
contest, those who do seem more interested in the candidates'
personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by being substantive, candidates can achieve other goals.
``There's an implicit presidential aura to presenting six-point
programs,'' said Anthony Dolan, a former speechwriter for Ronald
Reagan. ``There's a subliminal message you send to voters: `I have
the will to govern.''' Some candidates use detailed policies to
prove their bona fides with a narrow group of partisans and
interest groups whose support is crucial in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is another practical explanation for so much substance so
early: Because the primary schedule next year is the most
compressed in history, the entire process is accelerated.
Candidates who wait until January to issue proposals may be
dismissed as too slow _ or imitating their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past, candidates did not have to be so specific
because the parties often set the agenda. During the Cold War, the
prescriptions for dealing with the Soviet Union were starkly
different in both parties. Now that there are fewer differences _
and no overriding, burning issues _ candidates face greater
pressure to define themselves through their distinct plans.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for politicians is they can get tripped up in the
minutiae. Gore, relying on his vast experience in the White House
and in Congress, has emphasized his command of the issues. But
early this year he put out such a blizzard of issue papers that the
Bradley camp ridiculed him for being bogged down in small-bore
matters. He has tried to remedy that recently by mixing the policy
with the personal.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates complain that if they dwell on issues, the media
ignores them and focuses on personality and the horse race anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also learned the down side of serving up too much
detail. Refuting accusations that his proposals lacked heft, he
boasted that he was going further than most politicians in setting
a price tag _ $65 billion a year _ for his plan to make health care
available to virtually all uninsured Americans. But in doing so, he
gave Gore an opening that the vice president happily seized upon
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a big idea.'' Gore said, ``but it's not a good
idea.'' Should Bradley makes it to the Democratic nomination, that
line may well turn up in the Republicans' attack commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers, as well as Bradley's, have urged their
candidates not to be prodded into appearing like policy mavens.
``Yes, a tax plan is important and, yes, an education proposal is
important,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
``But the specific percentage of a proposed tax cut is probably
less important to the average voter than, `Do I agree with this
candidate's overall philosophy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes he can undermine Bradley in the same way President
Gerald R. Ford poked holes in a plan issued by Reagan during the
campaign for the 1976 Republican nomination that called for
stripping $90 billion from the federal budget. The proposal created
a firestorm, with the Ford campaign warning that it would cause
massive cuts in federal programs. The Ford camp issued detailed
breakdowns of how the plan would damage New Hampshire, which holds
the first primary. Reagan was so unnerved by the criticism that he
backed away from it, saying he ``didn't pay attention'' when aides
listed the $90 billion in cuts _ and that he meant his proposal to
be taken only figuratively.

   Besides worrying how their opponents will respond, candidates
have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy
proposals at face value. When Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in
1996, issued the economic and political foundation of his campaign
_ a 15 percent income tax cut and a halving of the capital gains
tax _ polls showed that voters did not view it too seriously.
That's because the Dole campaign publicly tinkered with several
alternatives. It did not help that President Clinton's campaign
distributed quotations to reporters in which Dole had belittled the
supply-side economics that was central to his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy emphasis on substance was first notable during the 1992
Democratic presidential run by then-Gov. Bill Clinton, former Sen.
Paul Tsongas and Sen. Bob Kerrey. All sought to demonstrate their
seriousness of purpose. Substance, indeed, was a way for Clinton to
deflect questions about his personal conduct and assure voters that
he knew how to fix the economy. One of his strategists, George
Stephanopoulos, went as far as to say that ``specificity is the
character issue of '92.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, never escaped questions about his integrity.
In the current campaign, politicians who want to succeed him are
again trying to use substance to prove their own character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Clinton was perceived to be a smooth operator, there's
an extra motivation for candidates this year to show that that's
not them,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director for Sen. John
McCain, who is seeking the Republican nomination. ``The way you do
that is by flashing the policy credential. Bob Dole stood up and
said, `I have character.' That's not good enough. Policy is the
prism through which voters judge character.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on substance may seem like a public service. But
the bad news is that the more candidates propose, the more they
overpromise. Clinton had ambitious plans for his national service
program that were scaled back after his election. Chances are, most
of the heady dreams of Campaign 2000 will never be more than
dreams.

   NEW YORK _ East Side, West Side, all around the town,
early-morning television is taking to the sidewalks of New York as
never before _ sidewalks that have become, in effect, sound stages
where cameras can capture the exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans
waving, shouting and reveling in their 15 seconds of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Picture-window studios have become a New York phenomenon.
Network executives say stations in other cities cannot afford to
spend millions on studios the way the networks can, and besides,
New York is the people-watching capital of the world, and the
networks know it. Every aunt or grandmother who tunes in, hoping
for a glimpse of a relative in the background behind Matt and Katie
or Charlie and Diane or, starting Monday, Bryant and Jane, adds to
a show's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks every rule in TV 101,'' said Robert Thompson, a
professor of film and television at Syracuse University. ``You're
not supposed to take the attention off the business at hand, but
when the business at hand needs a little push, the audience
provides a vast and sometimes amusing unpaid cast.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ABC and CBS are trying to catch up to the ``Today'' show
on NBC, which moved to a first-floor studio in Rockefeller Center
in 1994. Ever since, ``Today'' has been showing off its
standing-room-only sidewalk space _ and bragging about displacing
``Good Morning America'' for the lead in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the surest form of television; ABC moved ``Good
Morning America'' into a glass-walled studio in Times Square in
September. ``Today'' remains No. 1, but since ``Good Morning
America'' began showing crowds on the lower level of its two-story
studio and inviting a lucky few upstairs for consumer-affairs
segments, its ratings have risen somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Nov. 1, CBS moves its newly renamed ``Early Show'' to
Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, with world-famous hotels in the
background. CBS is betting that its new studio will help make the
network competitive in the morning for the first time since
``Captain Kangaroo'' went off the air a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the hotels are looking forward to the arrival of
Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayton and their fans. The
Sherry-Netherland Hotel went to court to block CBS' plans,
complaining that the show would lead to overcrowded sidewalks and
noise that could wake late sleepers at the hotel. ``People will be
waving and shouting and creating that fake Beatlemania-like
sensation,'' the hotel said in court papers. A CBS spokesman would
say only that the matter remains unresolved, but that the two sides
have been talking.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have spent heavily to show their viewers New York
up close. NBC spent $15 million; CBS is said to have spent $30
million. MTV also broadcasts from studios with floor-to-ceiling
windows. Its home, across Broadway from the new ``Good Morning
America'' quarters, draws neck-craning fans hoping for a glimpse of
their favorite veejay or, better, their favorite rock star. (The
neck-craning is a must. Unlike the ``Today'' and ``Early Show''
studios, MTV's base of operations is on the second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the success of the `Today' show woke other
television people up,'' said Steve Friedman, who was the executive
producer of ``Today'' when it moved and now has the same job at its
new CBS competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that woke up the networks' decision-makers was
New York's surging popularity as a tourist destination. ``New York
is hot again,'' Thompson said. ```Seinfeld' did this, `Friends' did
this, and they contributed to the idea that New York is the place
to be. There was a sense a few years ago that you wanted to ignore
New York, the symbol of all kinds of collapse, the inner city, the
economy. That's all changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners find themselves peering in the morning shows'
windows because there is not much to do at 7 a.m. The Statue of
Liberty and the observatory at the Empire State Building do not
open until 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   For the folks back home, the streetscape provides an element
that producers consider increasingly important _ ``visual relief.''
Playing peekaboo with passersby gives viewers something more than
just another glitzy set filled with people sitting around talking.
</P>
<P>
   If two's company, Friedman's show will make an early-morning
crowd. But he said the decision to put the hosts in front of glass
was not about imitation. ``The fact is that people expect more out
of television than a studio that's supposed to look like somebody's
living room or dining room and isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart at ``Good Morning America,'' Shelly Ross, said
the new studio provides a pool of people who can go on the show and
or talk with consumer experts about why they buy what they buy or
eat what they eat. ``In the past,'' she said, ``Good Morning
America'' relied on ``handpicked friends of friends of friends''
for such interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But showing crowds on live television is not without risks.
``When you see people holding up one finger, you wonder are they
saying, `You're No. 1,''' Thompson said, ``or are they saying
something else?''

   NEW YORK _ East Side, West Side, all around the town,
early-morning television is taking to the sidewalks of New York as
never before _ sidewalks that have become, in effect, sound stages
where cameras can capture the exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans
waving, shouting and reveling in their 15 seconds of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Picture-window studios have become a New York phenomenon.
Network executives say stations in other cities cannot afford to
spend millions on studios the way the networks can, and besides,
New York is the people-watching capital of the world, and the
networks know it. Every aunt or grandmother who tunes in, hoping
for a glimpse of a relative in the background behind Matt and Katie
or Charlie and Diane or, starting Monday, Bryant and Jane, adds to
a show's ratings.

THE RIGHT DOSE OF SCARE TACTICS TO DISCOURAGE THE WRONG TYPE OF

<P>
   Be afraid. Be very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns that
hope to stop young people from unsafe sex, smoking or binge
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the products of Baby Think It Over, Inc. This company
in Eau Claire, Wis., is best known for its ``simulator'' doll,
RealCare Baby, which gives teen-agers in ``life skills'' classes
the experience of diaper changing, simulated breast or bottle
feeding and burping. RealCare Baby also has two unhealthy siblings:
``Drug Affected Baby'' features the recorded cry of an actual baby
whose mother smoked crack; ``Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Manikin'' has
physical features that mimic those of an infant whose mother drank
to excess while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The fetal alcohol syndrome doll is the latest in scare tactics
used to warn young people of the dangers of drinking, smoking and
unprotected sex. Some critics have called such approaches ``health
terrorism.'' Yet such fear appeals continue despite mixed reviews
from experts who doubt that they can change behavior in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   The war on binge drinking, in particular, has increased since
widely publicized incidents like the death in 1997 of a
Massachusetts of Institute of Technology freshman after drinking
too much at a fraternity pledge event. Last month 113 state
universities and colleges signed on to an advertising campaign
sponsored by the National Association of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges. The campaign, which will be aimed at an
estimated 3 million college students who drink specifically to get
drunk, relies heavily on fear. One proposal for an ad that was
abandoned as too graphic featured a body on a gurney, with the
caption: ``Millions of college students called home last weekend.
Others didn't get the chance.'' Instead a series of sarcastic ads
will show a bottle labeled ``Binge Beer'' with the headline
``Hitting Colleges This Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad campaign sponsored last spring by the Michigan
Department of Community Health featured the slogan, ``Binge
drinking. It can make you dead drunk.'' Many churches around the
country stage ``hell houses'' in which teen-agers play the victims
of drunk driving and unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings about such approaches have inspired more nuanced
campaigns. Some colleges like Darmouth College and Montana State
University are publicizing statistics to get across the message
that the majority of students do not routinely drink to excess,
hoping for the effects of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the proponents of programs that rely on peer
pressure suggest that fear appeals simply do not work, Professor
Lawrence Wallack, a professor of public health at the University of
California at Berkeley, says he believes a balance must be struck
when trying to frighten people into healthy behavior. Too little
fear and a message to change behavior may have no impact; too much
fear, and denial may kick in. While acknowledging that scare
tactics might be useful in the appropriate dose, Wallack says he is
still wary of heightening anxiety about health issues without
``showing a safe, easy, quick and manageable way to reduce that
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking campaigns are another area where approaches vary
wildly. The recent tobacco settlement, with its estimated yield of
$1.5 billion for anti-smoking media campaigns over the next five
years, has public health mavens puzzling over the most effective
media strategies. Should the ads rail against the evil tobacco
industry? Should they suggest that smoking is uncool or gross, ``a
tumor-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, puking habit'' _ as an
Arizona ad puts it? Or should ads warn of the greatly enhanced risk
of death or disease, even though some teen-agers may see a certain
cachet in danger and risk?
</P>
<P>
   Social and behavioral research shows that ``some kinds of
communication have some kinds of effects on some kinds of people
some of the time,'' Wallack said. Begun at the beginning of the
decade, California's anti-tobacco ad campaign is the oldest in the
country, but research on its effectiveness is still preliminary.
Dr. Gina Agostinelli, a researcher with the Prevention Research
Center in Berkeley, Calif., said, ``We know very little about the
most basic question: Is tobacco counter-advertising effective?''
</P>
<P>
   California health officials say that vilifying the tobacco
industry executives is one key to changing attitudes. Their latest
round of ads has coupled anti-industry salvos with messages
emphasizing the dangers of secondhand smoke to friends and family.
Although the ads are somewhat tamer today than nine years ago, the
state may still hold the prize for the most gruesome and fearful
anti-tobacco ad ever seen on television. In a spot entitled Voice
Box, a 50-ish woman complains that her addiction has made it
impossible to live without cigarettes; she then takes a deep drag
on her cigarette through a tracheotomy tube in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies such as increasing tobacco taxes, limiting access to
vending machines or prohibiting smoking in public spaces may have
much greater impact than advertising strategies. ``More awareness
and information is good,'' Wallack said, ``but we end up mistaking
part of the solution for the whole solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These campaigns might actually do more harm than good,'' he
said, ``by disproportionately placing the responsibilities on the
individual, neglecting broader social factors and giving people a
false sense that something substantial is being done to address the
problem.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed
as the most prominent measure of the financial health of Corporate
America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the
U.S. economy is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the keepers of the Dow _ the editors of The Wall
Street Journal _ announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable
companies and replace them with younger and better-performing
substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990s that such a thing
had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   To find any comparable rate of change one must return to the
1930s, when the Depression-era economy was suffering a very
difficult upheaval. Now, Wall Street thinks the economy is going
through an upheaval with implications every bit as great _ but much
more pleasant _ for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy, as reflected in the Dow industrials of 20 years
ago, was dominated by companies that made things _ steel, cars,
cigarettes, chemicals, oil and tires. The new Dow is dominated by
companies in far different lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow of the 1970s had three oil companies, two steel
companies, one computer company and no financial firms. The new Dow
has four computer-related companies, three financial behemoths,
just one oil company and no steel makers. It has Walt Disney,
Coca-Cola and McDonald's. But Alcoa is still on the list, and so
are General Motors and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The old
America of heavy industry is still represented, but not nearly as
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the magnitude of the change is that of the four
companies that will join the Dow on Monday, three of them _ Intel,
Microsoft and Home Depot _ can trace their corporate lineage no
further back than 1968. The fourth, SBC Communications, was spun
off by AT&AMP;T (another Dow member) back in 1984 as part of the
antitrust settlement that broke up Ma Bell. The companies they
replaced _ Chevron, Sears, Goodyear and Union Carbide _ all joined
the Dow in 1930 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to underestimate the symbolic power of the Dow. Intel
and Microsoft are emblematic of American dominance in the rapidly
growing personal computer business. That image is better than the
one created in 1985, when McDonald's joined the index, or in 1991,
when USX, the former U.S. Steel, was tossed out to make way for
Disney. Then there was talk that the new America meant hamburger
flippers going to movies.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the changes, Wall Street Journal managing editor
Paul Steiger spoke of making the Dow ``more representative of the
emerging U.S. economy.'' But he also evidently wanted to stick to
blue chips, companies that had proven themselves to be successful.
There are no pure Internet companies in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change in the Dow may reflect more than the speed of
change in the economy. After all, the economy was changing from the
1940s through the early 1980s, even though there were few changes
in the Dow during that period that were not forced by takeovers or
financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is different now is that Dow Jones &AMP; Co. makes
money from fees paid every time investors buy options, futures and
other securities based on the Dow. In recent years, the index has
not risen as fast as its prime competitor, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, which includes 500 major American stocks and has a very heavy
dose of technology stocks and a larger share of the market in stock
index securities.

   Had Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications been
part of the Dow since 1997, the index would have been the better
performer. Perhaps such superior performance would have persuaded
more investors to trade the Dow, rather than the S&AMP;P.

   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed
as the most prominent measure of the financial health of Corporate
America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the
U.S. economy is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the keepers of the Dow _ the editors of The Wall
Street Journal _ announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable
companies and replace them with younger and better-performing
substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990s that such a thing
had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   To find any comparable rate of change one must return to the
1930s, when the Depression-era economy was suffering a very
difficult upheaval. Now, Wall Street thinks the economy is going
through an upheaval with implications every bit as great _ but much
more pleasant _ for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy, as reflected in the Dow industrials of 20 years
ago, was dominated by companies that made things _ steel, cars,
cigarettes, chemicals, oil and tires. The new Dow is dominated by
companies in far different lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow of the 1970s had three oil companies, two steel
companies, one computer company and no financial firms. The new Dow
has four computer-related companies, three financial behemoths,
just one oil company and no steel makers. It has Walt Disney,
Coca-Cola and McDonald's. But Alcoa is still on the list, and so
are General Motors and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The old
America of heavy industry is still represented, but not nearly as
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the magnitude of the change is that of the four
companies that will join the Dow on Monday, three of them _ Intel,
Microsoft and Home Depot _ can trace their corporate lineage no
further back than 1968. The fourth, SBC Communications, was spun
off by AT&AMP;T (another Dow member) back in 1984 as part of the
antitrust settlement that broke up Ma Bell. The companies they
replaced _ Chevron, Sears, Goodyear and Union Carbide _ all joined
the Dow in 1930 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to underestimate the symbolic power of the Dow. Intel
and Microsoft are emblematic of American dominance in the rapidly
growing personal computer business. That image is better than the
one created in 1985, when McDonald's joined the index, or in 1991,
when USX, the former U.S. Steel, was tossed out to make way for
Disney. Then there was talk that the new America meant hamburger
flippers going to movies.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the changes, Wall Street Journal managing editor
Paul Steiger spoke of making the Dow ``more representative of the
emerging U.S. economy.'' But he also evidently wanted to stick to
blue chips, companies that had proven themselves to be successful.
There are no pure Internet companies in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change in the Dow may reflect more than the speed of
change in the economy. After all, the economy was changing from the
1940s through the early 1980s, even though there were few changes
in the Dow during that period that were not forced by takeovers or
financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is different now is that Dow Jones &AMP; Co. makes
money from fees paid every time investors buy options, futures and
other securities based on the Dow. In recent years, the index has
not risen as fast as its prime competitor, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, which includes 500 major American stocks and has a very heavy
dose of technology stocks and a larger share of the market in stock
index securities.
</P>
<P>
   Had Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications been
part of the Dow since 1997, the index would have been the better
performer. Perhaps such superior performance would have persuaded
more investors to trade the Dow, rather than the S&AMP;P.

   LEGACY-LAUSD (Los Angeles) -- The Los Angeles Unified School
District has endangered thousands of students and teachers in 11
environmentally troubled schools, allowed crucial safety systems to
fail, used ill-prepared maintenance workers to check for hazardous
gases and even covered up dangerous conditions, a Daily News review
of district and state records shows. The most troubling situation
may be Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy, a school that has
been declared a state Superfund site. The school's scenario eerily
echoes the Belmont situation -- a history of district officials so
eager to build a school on cheap land that they only acknowledged
hazards when they were made public in embarrasing headlines. By

   RAIDERS-FANS (Los Angeles) -- For three off-duty hospital
workers clad in silver and black, Oct. 24 at the Oakland Raiders
game began in a Burbank Airport terminal. In an otherwise empty
bar. At 8:45 in the morning. With the first beers of the day in
front of them and an NFL pregame show on the television set
overhead, Michael McConaghy of Eagle Rock, Frank Kleineisel of
Chatsworth and Andy Rivera of Santa Clarita summoned the
us-against-the-world bravado they would need to fit in with 45,000
fellow Raiders fans later in the day at the Oakland Coliseum. (Will

   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ In jeans and T-shirts, each carrying a
small gym bag, a group of young Gaza men drew taunts and stares as
they wandered the streets here Friday evening in a fruitless search
for work. ``They told us we were ruining Ramallah,'' said Adham
A'jour, 22, taken aback by the hostility. ``People in the West Bank
should be more understanding of our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadi Achmed, his companion, concurred: ``I felt that they hated
us the way that they were looking at us. If they come to Gaza, we
will treat them the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two 22-year-olds were among the first of several hundred
Gazans to travel a two-lane road to the rocky uplands of the West
Bank last week, an hour's drive but still an eventful journey.
Cousins embraced for the first time since Israel closed its borders
to most Gazans six years ago. Young day-trippers eyed their first
mountains. And Palestinian peace negotiators hailed the belated
fulfillment of a promise extracted from Israel by President Clinton
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``safe passage'' route for goods as well as people
holds out the promise of unifying the West Bank and Gaza into one
integrated economy, a prerequisite for building a viable
Palestinian state. But in a place like Ramallah, the bustling
administrative center of the Palestinian-governed West Bank, the
sudden appearance of Gazan visitors aroused undisguised
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Although people here welcome the theoretical prospect of
Palestinian unity, the new opening has already exposed the stark
cultural and economic contrasts between the two regions. Now the
poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans will compete for
jobs with the more settled and secular urbanites of the West Bank.
This could mean unwelcome sacrifices for the West Bank, and could
trigger resentment and envy among the Gazans.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Gaza hovers above 17 percent, double the rate in
the West Bank. And the median age in the Strip is just 14, compared
to 17 in the West Bank. In southern Gaza, the poorest and most
densely populated Palestinian region, per capita spending is $2.50
a day, far below the still-modest $6.00 average around Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In taxis and shops throughout the West Bank, people have been
whispering about the changes these newcomers might cause in the job
market,'' noted Daoud Kuttab, a political columnist in Ramallah.
``They are afraid that the Gazans will accept lower wages than are
being paid now, and that many employers will be tempted to exploit
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent economists say West Bankers are right to be worried.
Hisham Awatani of the Palestinian Center for Research and Studies
in Nablus contends West Bank wages will inevitably drop if Gaza
job-seekers can freely relocate. And with access to porous West
Bank borders, Gazan immigrants will also compete for high-paying
construction jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw what happened to Germany after unification,''
Awatani said. ``There is often an economic price to be paid for
political goals.'' That price won't be paid by economists or
government planners, however.
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic, an economic merger of a million Gazans and
nearly 2 million West Bankers requires bridging a cultural chasm.
The West Bank is worldly, secular, educated and entrepreneurial,
while the closed, ingrown economy of Gaza mirrors the insular,
religious, walled-in refugee society that fostered it. Despite
family ties and a shared Palestinian nationalism, these are two
quite different places.
</P>
<P>
   Even their legal systems remain separate and distinct. In the
West Bank, old Jordanian laws still prevail, with Ottoman and
Napoleonic underpinnings. Gaza is governed by a hybrid Egyptian and
British legal code, though a parallel Islamic court network there
is fast extending its role.
</P>
<P>
   Compounded by geographic separation, this central Palestinian
fault line is at least as profound as the much-analyzed rift
between secular and religious Israelis, with great potential for
political tension as Gaza and the West Bank become intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gulf, though, is economic. And it has steadily
widened over the past six years, as Israeli border closures and
transit restrictions caused Gaza commerce to contract by 40 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   If the regional economies merge, as safe passage theoretically
permits, Gaza's per capita income of roughly $1,200 and the West
Bank average of $1,700 would gravitate toward a common mean,
economists say. Gaza's living standard should rise more than the
West Bank's would fall, but the short-term impact on West Bankers
could still be acute.

   This transitional pain is worth the long-term gain, many
Palestinians argue. The unemployed youth of Gaza are not only the
most serious economic problem confronting the Palestinian
Authority; they are its greatest political challenge, since they
provide rank-and-file support for the Authority's militant Islamist
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The average Gaza family has six children; population growth is
an explosive 4.3 percent. Gaza desperately needs an economic safety
valve that Israel is unwilling to provide: the only day laborers
permitted into Israel are on a carefully screened list of married
men over 30. And Israel is now unexpectedly suggesting that its
restrictions on Palestinian goods and labor could be tightened
further.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Labor governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,
the vision of a peaceful, mutually advantageous relationship with
an autonomous or independent Palestinian neighbor always presumed
some kind of free trade area, with open movement of goods, labor
and capital. In 1994, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed
on a five-year customs union, lifting most hindrances to internal
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This free-market approach to peacemaking was one of the few
legacies of the Rabin era to be embraced by Benjamin Netanyahu's
right-wing administration. But now Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
has long wanted legal and physical barriers between Israelis and
Palestinians, is urging consideration of ``economic separation''
too.
</P>
<P>
   This new notion of separation appears to go well beyond tariff
walls. The Barak government said last week that it was exploring
the legalization of 100,000 or more undocumented workers from East
Asia and Central Europe. Peace negotiators had long assumed that a
final settlement would be an opportunity to replace this illegal
foreign work force with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians dismiss such talk as a bargaining ploy,
intended to remind Yasser Arafat of his would-be state's dependence
on Israeli investment and commerce. Israel is the lopsided
beneficiary of trade with the Palestinians, selling $1.5 billion
yearly but importing just $250 million, so it has no commercial
motive for protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   But even barring complete Israeli-Palestinian separation, there
are almost infinite gradations of integration. And any new Israeli
barriers will force the West Bank and Gaza even closer together.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, unification should be good for Palestinian
business. Palestinian planners have long complained that Israel's
separation of Gaza from the West Bank made their market too small
to entice serious investors or breed competitive exporters.
Integration should give a quick boost to some local companies:
Cold-pressed Palestinian olive oil could outsell Israeli varieties
in Gaza, while Gaza citrus may replace Jaffa oranges in Hebron
market stalls. But family firms in both Gaza and the West Bank will
also face pressure from more efficient rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Messrs. Barak and Arafat enter final status talks, they
must devise formulas for the further knitting together of Gaza with
Ramallah and Nablus and Hebron. The initial Palestinian experience
with safe passage will help determine how fast and far unification
will proceed _ and how eagerly it will be embraced by the
Palestinian majority on the West Bank.

   OSH, Kyrgyzstan _ The appearance of Islamic insurgents in this
remote Central Asian country in recent weeks has not only shocked
regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese neighbors. It has
also awakened the world to a troubling new phenomenon: the
existence of a floating army of religious fighters who are roaming
this part of the world in search of regimes to overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan is one of eight new nations that emerged in Central
Asia and the Caucasus following the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. The region is poor, unstable and populated mostly by Muslims.
It sparkles as a glittering prize for religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters who appeared here in mid-August, like most of the
armed bands that have emerged in Central Asia recently, have their
roots in Afghanistan. They have now apparently withdrawn back to
bases there and in neighboring Tajikistan, freeing hostages they
had seized. No one believes, however, that they will lay down their
weapons or give up their dream of bringing the whole region under
religious rule. Their zeal poses a serious threat to stability in a
vast area that stretches from Turkey's eastern border all the way
to China.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even as civil war continues in Afghanistan, religious
violence has broken out not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in three
other parts of this volatile belt. In Chechnya, which is officially
part of Russia, fundamentalists are leading a violent campaign for
independence. An apparently even more radical group is fighting in
the neighboring republic of Dagestan, which is also nominally under
Russian sovereignty. Further east, along the border that separates
India and Pakistan, the province of Kashmir is at temporary peace
following a bloody conflict this year in which Muslim radicals
played a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the religious militancy that is spreading through
Central Asia and the Caucasus may be traced back to the U.S.
campaign to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the 1980s.
During that campaign, the CIA spent hundreds of millions of dollars
training religious fighters and buying them modern weapons. Now
they are using those skills, and in some cases those weapons, to
topple what they say are godless regimes.
</P>
<P>
   These religious militants want to fight wherever they believe
they can do God's bidding. They have attracted thousands of young
people who have no strong convictions, religious or otherwise, but
who know no trade other than war and who fight for a wage. Drug
gangs, realizing the importance of controlling trade routes through
the region, also eagerly contribute fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This odd collection of warriors is sponsored by a murky network
of religious and political visionaries. The Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden, whom the United States blames for last year's attacks on
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and who now lives in
Afghanistan, is only the most visible.
</P>
<P>
   Part of these militants' strategy has been to build mosques and
pay to educate impoverished young people across the Caucasus and
Central Asia. But now they are beginning to foment little wars.
They are probing for places where they can win battles, and believe
they have found some in Chechnya, Dagestan, Kashmir and here in the
Fergana Valley, the heart of Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   These militants consider Kyrgyzstan only a secondary target, at
least for now. Their proclaimed goal is an Islamic state in
Uzbekistan next door. When they retreat, they move back to bases
not only in Afghanistan but also in Tajikistan, where warlords have
as much control as the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Osh, one of the main towns in the Fergana Valley, people
are bewildered and frightened by the idea of insurgency. Most
people here are Muslims. But their tolerant and permissive brand of
Islam has little in common with the radicalism of those who are up
in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is very dangerous for all of Central Asia,''
said Bakyt Beshimov, a former president of Osh University who now
represents this region in the Kyrgyz Parliament. ``Part of the
danger is that these militants are being supported by religious
forces and governments abroad. The other problem is the terrible
social situation in this region, which makes people ready to
support radical alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   People across this region have seen living standards plummet
since the Soviet Union disintegrated. Once they enjoyed guaranteed
jobs, education and health care for all and pensions for the
elderly. Now most are in poverty, with little prospect for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people live in terrible circumstances, the slogans of
fundamentalists are very attractive,'' Beshimov said. ``They are
telling people to fight against the political regimes that are the
source of their difficulties. They say they have the formula for a
better and fairer society. It is very tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   Western powers have been slow to focus on this isolated region,
and Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev said in an interview that he
relies on China to crack the whip. ``They have to care,'' he said.
``They have Xinjiang.''
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang is China's westernmost province. Its population is
mainly Muslim, and its people feel little loyalty to Beijing. They
are restive, and radicals among them have set off bombs that some
outsiders believe are the beginning of a separatist campaign. So
far there is no indication that militants in Xinjiang have made
contact with ``the Afghans,'' as Islamic fighters who have fought
in Afghanistan are called. But it is tempting to see the Caucasus,
Central Asia and Xinjiang as ripe targets for a nascent religious
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the feeling in the West, that all of this is
happening very far away,'' said Askar Aitmatov, an advisor to
Akayev. ``But religious fundamentalism is a big force. It is a
challenge for the entire world.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the United States gave up its colonial
ambitions and handed over the Philippines to the Filipinos in 1946,
President Harry S. Truman sent the living symbol of U.S. power in
the Pacific _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur _ to do the deed. When
President Richard M. Nixon returned Okinawa to Japan in 1969, he
dispatched a man capable of teaching even Japanese politicians a
thing or two about mixing business and politics: Vice President
Spiro Agnew.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the delicate diplomatic question of the moment for
President Clinton: Who will lead the U.S. delegation to the formal
handover of the Panama Canal in December?
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet that Vice President Al Gore can think of better
ways to occupy his time than posing for a photo-op surrendering the
canal and the huge U.S. military installations around it.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the White House have mused about sending former
President Jimmy Carter. After all, he was the president who signed
the two treaties in 1978 to hand back the canal zone after 96 years
_ and the one who assured the world that if things go bad in
Panama, the U.S. military still has the unilateral right to regain
control.
</P>
<P>
   When Panama's new president, Mireya Moscoso, visited Clinton
recently to urge him to show up himself for the ceremony, Clinton
said he was still thinking about it. (The Panamanians want to hold
the ceremony in mid-December, after belatedly realizing that on the
actual date of the transfer _ Dec. 31 _ people around the world
will be busy with other celebrations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say there's some ambivalence around here
about whether the president should go,'' one White House official
said. It's no surprise. Giving up territory is never exactly
popular; Queen Elizabeth II stayed as far away from Hong Kong as
possible during the handover to China in 1997, sending Prince
Charles instead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Panama, the pain of surrendering 364,000
acres is eased by the fact that the main argument made by opponents
of the treaty in 1978 _ that America was paving the way for
Communist naval power to be extended out from Cuba _ seems a bit
farfetched today.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is suddenly talk in the Senate of new threats
to the canal, which handles five percent of world trade. Isn't
Fidel Castro still in the neighborhood? And a host of conservative
lawmakers have complained that the Hong Kong-owned company that
runs the canal's container ports, where cargo is handled on the
Atlantic and Pacific sides, could help China seize control of the
canal. Congress just finished hearings on the issue, replete with
secret testimony from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba and China have strong economic interests in Panama, but
do not pose a threat to the security of the canal at this time,''
Gen. Charles Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, told a
Senate committee. In fact, the Pentagon doubts the Chinese have the
naval power to take Taiwan, a bit closer to its shores.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Panamanians thrilled with how the handover has worked
out? Not exactly. Some politicians in Panama were clearly hoping
that the United States would pay big money to lease back the bases,
a business strategy that didn't count on the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy negotiations, the Clinton administration said no
thanks. So that leaves Panama with a canal that is expensive to run
and a big party in December _ to which Washington has yet to send
an RSVP.

   OSH, Kyrgyzstan _ The appearance of Islamic insurgents in this
remote Central Asian country in recent weeks has not only shocked
regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese neighbors. It has
also awakened the world to a troubling new phenomenon: the
existence of a floating army of religious fighters who are roaming
this part of the world in search of regimes to overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan is one of eight new nations that emerged in Central
Asia and the Caucasus following the collapse of the Soviet Union in

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like music CDs, box office receipts and the world's richest
people, corruption has its own top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years Transparency International, a nonprofit
group based in Berlin that specializes in tracking global thievery,
has released the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking the
world's most corrupt countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the group declared Cameroon, Nigeria, Indonesia,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, Paraguay
and Kenya as the world's most graft-ridden countries, populated by
public officials who are much quicker to take bribes than their
counterparts in countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But while Transparency's work has been lauded by economists and
other analysts for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of
debates about economic development and public policy, critics say
the group's hit list unfairly tars countries that may be no more
corrupt than those ranked much lower on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, say critics, the media is so quick to latch on to top 10
lists that agencies like Transparency International have an obvious
incentive to present their information that way to score public
relations coups. All the attention generated by the Corruption
Perceptions Index, and criticism that it tended to highlight poor
countries without noting the role that industrialized countries
play in fomenting corruption abroad, led Transparency to introduce
yet another ranking last week _ the Bribe Payers Index.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worries people have had is that the ranking is very
misleading,'' Rafael di Tella, an economics professor at Harvard
Business School and one of Transparency's outside advisors, said of
the Corruption Perceptions Index. ``Transparency International has
become a slave to the success of the index and it doesn't want to
address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as di Tella and others see it, is that the data
used to analyze corruption _ surveys, for example, of business
executives' perceptions _ are so fuzzy that huge margins of error
exist when assigning a numerical yardstick to graft.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Graf Lambsdorff, a German statistician responsible for
orchestrating Transparency's numbers into a coherent whole, says
critics of the list unfairly imply that his methodology is faulty
when, in fact, the only issue is how the results of Transparency's
surveys are presented. Even so, Lambsdorff says he is comfortable
with his group's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ranking is easier to convey information to a large public,
like a football ranking,'' said Lambsdorff, a professor at
Goettingen University. ``We can clearly say that Denmark is cleaner
than Germany and Germany is cleaner than Botswana. But in between
there may be some problems _ saying that Kenya is cleaner than
Tanzania, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely the problem, say critics , pointing to
Bolivia's presidential election in 1997 as an example of the list's
far-reaching influence. The former dictator Hugo Banzer won the
presidency that year on an anti-corruption platform bolstered by
the release of Transparency's rankings shortly before the election
_ rankings showing that corruption in Bolivia was worse than in
many of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff says Transparency cannot avoid having such an impact
because elections are occurring in many countries when their
rankings are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep on stressing that these are perceptions, not hard
facts,'' said Frank Vogl, Transparency International's
vice-chairman and co-founder. ``You always have this problem of how
to present the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the list has stirred dissent within the group's own
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency's index was good when there were no other numbers
available but we need to go further now,'' said Luis Moreno Ocampo,
a prominent anti-corruption crusader in Argentina who is a member
of Transparency's advisory council. ``The issue is not which
country is worse than another, the issue is how to solve the
problem. We need to track where the money is going and who is
stealing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno has been working with the World Bank to come up with new
methods of measuring and presenting data on corruption. Daniel
Kaufmann, a senior manager with the World Bank, says grouping
countries in broad categories _ rather than ranking them _ is the
fairest way to shine a spotlight on corruption. ``The idea that
Transparency International had is brilliant and now we all want to
be more rigorous and circumspect when we analyze corruption,'' he
said.

going on for more than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed
except by a small band of energy specialists. The question now,
they say, is whether the trend can be accelerated enough to stave
off or lessen what many scientists believe is a potentially
disruptive global warming. By William K. Stevens.

   WASHINGTON _ When the United States gave up its colonial
ambitions and handed over the Philippines to the Filipinos in 1946,
President Harry S. Truman sent the living symbol of U.S. power in
the Pacific _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur _ to do the deed. When
President Richard M. Nixon returned Okinawa to Japan in 1969, he
dispatched a man capable of teaching even Japanese politicians a
thing or two about mixing business and politics: Vice President
Spiro Agnew.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the delicate diplomatic question of the moment for
President Clinton: Who will lead the U.S. delegation to the formal
handover of the Panama Canal in December?
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet that Vice President Al Gore can think of better
ways to occupy his time than posing for a photo-op surrendering the
canal and the huge U.S. military installations around it.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the White House have mused about sending former
President Jimmy Carter. After all, he was the president who signed
the two treaties in 1978 to hand back the canal zone after 96 years
_ and the one who assured the world that if things go bad in
Panama, the U.S. military still has the unilateral right to regain
control.
</P>
<P>
   When Panama's new president, Mireya Moscoso, visited Clinton
recently to urge him to show up himself for the ceremony, Clinton
said he was still thinking about it. (The Panamanians want to hold
the ceremony in mid-December, after belatedly realizing that on the
actual date of the transfer _ Dec. 31 _ people around the world
will be busy with other celebrations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say there's some ambivalence around here
about whether the president should go,'' one White House official
said. It's no surprise. Giving up territory is never exactly
popular; Queen Elizabeth II stayed as far away from Hong Kong as
possible during the handover to China in 1997, sending Prince
Charles instead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Panama, the pain of surrendering 364,000
acres is eased by the fact that the main argument made by opponents
of the treaty in 1978 _ that America was paving the way for
Communist naval power to be extended out from Cuba _ seems a bit
farfetched today.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is suddenly talk in the Senate of new threats
to the canal, which handles five percent of world trade. Isn't
Fidel Castro still in the neighborhood? And a host of conservative
lawmakers have complained that the Hong Kong-owned company that
runs the canal's container ports, where cargo is handled on the
Atlantic and Pacific sides, could help China seize control of the
canal. Congress just finished hearings on the issue, replete with
secret testimony from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba and China have strong economic interests in Panama, but
do not pose a threat to the security of the canal at this time,''
Gen. Charles Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, told a
Senate committee. In fact, the Pentagon doubts the Chinese have the
naval power to take Taiwan, a bit closer to its shores.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Panamanians thrilled with how the handover has worked
out? Not exactly. Some politicians in Panama were clearly hoping
that the United States would pay big money to lease back the bases,
a business strategy that didn't count on the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy negotiations, the Clinton administration said no
thanks. So that leaves Panama with a canal that is expensive to run
and a big party in December _ to which Washington has yet to send
an RSVP.

   REHOBOTH, Mass. _ An hour before sundown, 40 adults have formed
a circle in a small back yard, the limbs of a barren tree overhead.
Most are dressed in black, many in capes. But the occasion, a
gathering of local witches' covens, is expectant, not somber.
</P>
<P>
   In their midst, a blonde woman raises a sword above her head,
point skyward, and walks clockwise within the group. ``I would like
you to concentrate on raising a circle of energy around us, to turn
the wheel of the year,'' says Cheryl Sulyma-Masson, high priestess
of one coven, in this town near Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the circle, she adds, ``We will change the
future through tolerance, education and through love.'' All
respond, ``As a witch, I make this pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by federal court rulings recognizing witchcraft as a
legal religion, an increasing number of books related to the
subject and the continuing cultural concern for the environment,
Wicca _ as contemporary witchcraft is often called _ has been
growing in the United States and abroad. It is a major element in
an expanding ``neo-pagan'' movement whose members regard nature
itself as charged with divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Given the movement's diversity, without essential texts, no
central authorities and many solitary practitioners, estimates of
how many people fit under the pagan umbrella vary widely, from
100,000 to three or more times that number. Some have found
historical antecedents for their beliefs and work to re-create
ancient Egyptian or Greek religions; some call themselves Druids.
</P>
<P>
   Witches can be found at Pagan Pride Days in various cities and
at an October festival in Washington. An Internet site called The
Witches' Voice (www.witchvox.com) lists nearly 900 covens and other
Wiccan groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Jung, who created the site with his wife, Wren Walker,
said nearly 17,000 people had listed themselves on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who say, `I want to come out, be identified
as a witch and talk with other witches,''' Jung said.
</P>
<P>
   To wear the label can pose a social risk, given that in many
people's minds, witchcraft is associated with black magic, a result
of biblical warnings against sorcery as well as historically more
recent accusations. In 1486, two Germans wrote ``The Hammer of
Witches,'' which linked witchcraft with the demonic. It served as a
prosecutors' manual for two centuries, during which many thousands
of suspected witches were burned.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, witches today say the rituals they practice are
beneficial, in keeping with the Wiccan Rede, an ethical code that
states, ``An' it harm none, do what thou wilt,'' and the conviction
that what one does for good or ill returns to the doer three times
over.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Simmons, a professor of religious studies at Western
Illinois University who has studied contemporary witches, said that
the clothing, the rituals, the focus on nature, all may remind
people in their 30s and 40s who are seeking a spirituality of the
sort of qualities they thought religion should have when they were
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it feels familiar,'' Simmons said, ``particularly to
those of us who went through the 60s. And when you add feminism and
environmentalism, it feels like home to people.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sulyma-Masson, who is 39 and a veterinary technician, said a
common denominator among witches was belief in a dual divinity, a
goddess and a god. Behind them lies an all-pervasive energy, the
basis of all reality, which may be tapped through spells and
rituals, for healing or good fortune. Formal worship begins with
``casting the circle,'' as participants gather, and, through
chanting, drumming or singing, they concentrate on forming ``a cone
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The presiding priest or priestess, Ms. Sulyma-Masson said, then
declares the energy's ``purpose,'' that it should be directed
toward healing, financial betterment or finding love.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal rituals like the backyard gathering, which heralded the
coming of the Wiccan New Year at Samhaim (Halloween to everyone
else), ``connect us with the cycles of nature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a potluck dinner at her apartment, the witches who
participated _ computer programmers, graphic artists, store
managers and others _ spoke about how they came to believe what
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Jackson, 23, a credit analyst, began studying witchcraft
on her own in high school. Now a high priestess with her own coven,
she said she appreciated witchcraft's emphasis on nature and
goddess worship. ``It fit the empty spaces in my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While witches say they follow the ``Old Religion,'' many Wiccan
practices derive from recent sources. A landmark date is 1954,
shortly after anti-witchcraft laws were repealed in Britain, when
an Englishman named Gerald Gardner published an account of
witchcraft that he said he learned from a coven he had joined. A
Gardnerian tradition remains influential on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   For American witches, a watershed event occurred in September
1986, when a federal appeals court ruled that Wicca was a religion
protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, witchcraft's rise on the religious landscape has
disturbed many who regard it as sinister. Reports last summer that
some soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, were conducting Wiccan rituals
near the base enraged some local ministers and prompted Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., to demand why the military would allow its personnel
to engage in such rites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sulyma-Masson wrote Barr, discussing Wicca's legal status
and saying that contrary to rumor, witches do not conduct
sacrifices. She identified herself as chairwoman of the Witches
League for Public Awareness, a nonprofit group formed to challenge
stereotypes, a task that has her telling people that witches
neither worship a devil nor believe in one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the uproar illustrates a point: One need not travel to
Massachusetts to encounter Wiccans.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln, Neb., for example, Jason and Cynthia
Blodgett-McDeavitt serve as high priest and high priestess of the
Order of the Red Grail, with about 20 regular members and another
30 or 40 who attend open rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for Halloween, the group will gather on the Nebraska
Capitol steps, Blodgett-McDeavitt said, adding, ``I'm probably
going to have a sign that says, `I'm Wiccan and I vote.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such openness marks a sea change from 1983, when Ms.
Sulyma-Masson began to explore witchcraft. She had a hard time
finding books. Raised a Roman Catholic, she became interested in
Wicca after meeting a witch from a coven in Salem, Mass., whom she
credits with helping her recover from a virus that had defied
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   These days her apartment is stacked with volumes on witchcraft
and other pagan paths. The coven she founded in 1987, the Circle of
Salgion, has grown so that it has spun off five others. And she and
her associates are raising money for a church building, a geodesic
dome, on wooded land in nearby Dighton.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask, she tells them rituals revolve around the solar
and lunar calendars. The year, envisioned as a wheel, contains
eight sabbats: the solstices, equinoxes and four dates in between,
Feb. 2, May 1, Aug. 1 and Oct. 31. Her coven often advertises these
events as ``open rituals,'' which the curious may attend.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, rituals conducted on nights when the moon is full
are closed to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the basics, there is ample room for innovation, a
theological spaciousness that appeals to seekers who dislike formal
rules and structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no dogma that tells you what you have to do,'' said
Richard Cohen, 54, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Joe White, 31, a firefighter, said he wrestled with questions of
faith before deciding that no single religion could dictate what
should be in someone's heart.
</P>
<P>
   After reading a book on witchcraft, he said, ``doors started
opening up'' and he met people practicing it. ``I'm starting to
find out,'' he said, ``how big this group really is.''

<P>
   Like music CDs, box office receipts and the world's richest
people, corruption has its own top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years Transparency International, a nonprofit
group based in Berlin that specializes in tracking global thievery,
has released the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking the
world's most corrupt countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the group declared Cameroon, Nigeria, Indonesia,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, Paraguay
and Kenya as the world's most graft-ridden countries, populated by
public officials who are much quicker to take bribes than their
counterparts in countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But while Transparency's work has been lauded by economists and
other analysts for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of
debates about economic development and public policy, critics say
the group's hit list unfairly tars countries that may be no more
corrupt than those ranked much lower on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, say critics, the media is so quick to latch on to top 10
lists that agencies like Transparency International have an obvious
incentive to present their information that way to score public
relations coups. All the attention generated by the Corruption
Perceptions Index, and criticism that it tended to highlight poor
countries without noting the role that industrialized countries
play in fomenting corruption abroad, led Transparency to introduce
yet another ranking last week _ the Bribe Payers Index.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worries people have had is that the ranking is very
misleading,'' Rafael di Tella, an economics professor at Harvard
Business School and one of Transparency's outside advisors, said of
the Corruption Perceptions Index. ``Transparency International has
become a slave to the success of the index and it doesn't want to
address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as di Tella and others see it, is that the data
used to analyze corruption _ surveys, for example, of business
executives' perceptions _ are so fuzzy that huge margins of error
exist when assigning a numerical yardstick to graft.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Graf Lambsdorff, a German statistician responsible for
orchestrating Transparency's numbers into a coherent whole, says
critics of the list unfairly imply that his methodology is faulty
when, in fact, the only issue is how the results of Transparency's
surveys are presented. Even so, Lambsdorff says he is comfortable
with his group's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ranking is easier to convey information to a large public,
like a football ranking,'' said Lambsdorff, a professor at
Goettingen University. ``We can clearly say that Denmark is cleaner
than Germany and Germany is cleaner than Botswana. But in between
there may be some problems _ saying that Kenya is cleaner than
Tanzania, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely the problem, say critics , pointing to
Bolivia's presidential election in 1997 as an example of the list's
far-reaching influence. The former dictator Hugo Banzer won the
presidency that year on an anti-corruption platform bolstered by
the release of Transparency's rankings shortly before the election
_ rankings showing that corruption in Bolivia was worse than in
many of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff says Transparency cannot avoid having such an impact
because elections are occurring in many countries when their
rankings are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep on stressing that these are perceptions, not hard
facts,'' said Frank Vogl, Transparency International's
vice-chairman and co-founder. ``You always have this problem of how
to present the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the list has stirred dissent within the group's own
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency's index was good when there were no other numbers
available but we need to go further now,'' said Luis Moreno Ocampo,
a prominent anti-corruption crusader in Argentina who is a member
of Transparency's advisory council. ``The issue is not which
country is worse than another, the issue is how to solve the
problem. We need to track where the money is going and who is
stealing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno has been working with the World Bank to come up with new
methods of measuring and presenting data on corruption. Daniel
Kaufmann, a senior manager with the World Bank, says grouping
countries in broad categories _ rather than ranking them _ is the
fairest way to shine a spotlight on corruption. ``The idea that
Transparency International had is brilliant and now we all want to
be more rigorous and circumspect when we analyze corruption,'' he
said.

WORLD MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD ENERGY FREE OF CARBON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the world's expanding population and economy increase
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say
are warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily
away from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be
double those of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next
century. But they also say the levels would be much higher except
for a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for
more than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a
small band of energy specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The question now, they say, is whether the trend can be
accelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists
believe is a potentially disruptive global warming.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of
carbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less.
First wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th
century by coal, which contains less. Then oil, with a lower carbon
content still, dethroned King Coal in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may
be entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen _ providing a
fuel with no carbon at all, by definition _ may at last be about to
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today
burns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy
produced as it did in 1860. In the United States, they estimate,
the trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy
efficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of
carbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.
</P>
<P>
   But because economic growth and population growth have been so
rapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the
concentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100. Mainstream
scientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth,
on average, by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, that is
about half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last
ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. A change of this magnitude
would likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate,
weather and human life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in Bonn,
Germany, in the latest round of global talks on measures to further
reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of
industry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a
period of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to
accelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a
no-carbon one.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an
agreement forged two years ago in Kyoto, Japan, that could speed up
the trend. Their work is not expected to be finished for at least a
year, and the Kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a
sufficient number of countries after that.
</P>
<P>
   However that may turn out, ``the decarbonization of the energy
system is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20
years of analysis'' of the system, said Dr. Jesse Ausubel, an
expert on energy and climate at Rockefeller University in New York
City. He predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free
energy system by the end of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Among some recent signs of the trend are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal Energy Information Administration reported last
week that emissions of carbon dioxide by the United States had
increased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990s _ only
about half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production.
Analysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being
decoupled from carbon.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency reported this month that the same is generally true
in China, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world,
where coal production has been reported to be dropping lately.
``China has dispelled a commonly held notion that economic growth
and energy consumption are necessarily coupled,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   _ In December, Honda will introduce in the United States a
high-efficiency, low-emissions automobile powered partly by
gasoline and partly by self-generated electricity. It is said to
run at 60 miles per gallon of gasoline in town, and 71 on the
highway, and to travel 600 to 700 miles on a tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has introduced a similar ``hybrid'' automobile in Japan,
and these cars are ``literally kick-the-tires examples of the
decarbonized economy,'' said Hal Harvey, president of the Energy
Foundation, a partnership of foundations that promotes energy
efficiency and renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers are also planning hybrids, which are being
viewed as a transition, ultimately, to vehicles powered by hydrogen
fuel cells that emit no carbon. In its planning, General Motors
Corp. has ``embraced fuel cells as the technology of choice,'' but
with hybrids coming first, said John Williams, the leader of the
company's internal team on global climate issues.
</P>
<P>
   And while auto companies are looking down that track, some of
the world's biggest energy companies are looking to provide the
appropriate fuels. Hydrogen, in particular, has attracted fresh
interest. Until recently, ``the hydrogen option was seen as rather
distant,'' said Ged Davis, an executive of Shell International in
London who analyzes such questions for Royal Dutch/Shell, one of
the world's largest energy companies. ``Now it is looking closer,
perhaps over the next decade or two,'' he added. ``Most of the
energy and car companies are looking at this rather seriously.''
Shell itself has established a hydrogen subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearer term, hydrogen would be used in fuel cells for
cars, trucks and industrial plants, just as it already provides
power for orbiting spacecraft. But ultimately, hydrogen could also
provide a general carbon-free fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The world energy system will not change overnight, of course, if
it changes at all. And new products must ultimately stand the test
of the marketplace. But some analysts say that the next two decades
or so will be a time of unusual pressure for change, both for
environmental and economic reasons, in which companies will be
driven to compete for survival and dominance in some sort of
emerging new energy system.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whether companies are seriously pursuing new options or merely
preserving them for the future, experts say there seems little
doubt that the long-term trend toward decarbonization is real, and
that it will most likely continue even in the absence of any shift
to hydrogen or renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future decarbonization rate is likely to be at least as
high as the historical one'' of about three-tenths of a percent a
year, said Dr. Nebojsa Nakicenovic, an expert on energy and the
environment with the International Institute for Applied Systems
Analysis, a research group in Laxenburg, Austria. The institute was
one of the first groups to study the question.
</P>
<P>
   Oil accounts for the biggest share of global energy consumption
today, followed by coal and, closely, natural gas. In most of the
world except the United States and China, Ausubel said, coal is
either defunct or on the way out, and natural gas will increasingly
displace it.
</P>
<P>
   According to several recent analyses, Nakicenovic said,
recoverable natural gas now appears far more abundant than had been
previously thought. The burning of gas produces, on average, only
about a third of the carbon dioxide per unit of energy of coal, and
about two-thirds that of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Gas not only can fuel fixed facilities like industrial plants
and furnaces, it can also be processed to produce hydrogen for use
in carbon-free fuel cells to power automobiles and generate
electricity. In those cells, there is no combustion; instead,
hydrogen reacts chemically with oxygen to produce electricity. But
when hydrogen is extracted from gas, the residual carbon must
somehow be disposed of, possibly by pumping it back into depleted
oil and gas wells.
</P>
<P>
   Ausubel predicts that natural gas will become the dominant fuel
of the next 40 to 50 years. If so, that alone would be enough to
continue the long-term decarbonization trend.
</P>
<P>
   China, which some experts think will emerge as the biggest
carbon-dioxide emitter of the 21st century, has greatly reduced its
energy consumption per unit of economic output, has closed several
coal mines, is seeking to modernize industrial and power plants and
is moving toward natural gas, many analysts say. Not least, they
say, the Chinese are worried about the health effects of coal's air
pollution. Nevertheless, the Energy Information Administration
reported last week, China's coal demand is expected to double by
2020.
</P>
<P>
   So while the trend toward a carbon-free economy may continue,
Ausubel says, it might not move rapidly enough to assuage the fears
of those who are most concerned about global warming. He says that
if the trend continues to evolve more or less naturally, with
business as usual, it will take another century or so to
decarbonize the energy system fully.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he predicts, atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide will be around 500 parts per million, nearly double what
they were before the industrial revolution. Mainstream scientists
say that would be enough to change the earth's climate
substantially, make droughts, heat waves and floods worse and raise
the sea level to heights that would threaten many low-lying coastal
areas and islands. Some analysts say that 500 parts per million is
a best-case estimate, and that business-as-usual could cause a
tripling of pre-industrial carbon-dioxide levels.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts think that concentrations could be held
substantially below 500 parts per million if the trend toward
decarbonization were to accelerate. Harvey of the Energy Foundation
says ``prospects are excellent'' for an acceleration. And Davis
says his company's analyses suggest that if the proper incentives
were in place, new energy technologies could be adopted broadly
enough to bring about a peak in oil use and carbon-dioxide
emissions by about 2020. After that, there would be a decline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One sort of incentive might lie in the Kyoto agreement, which
calls for a group of 39 industrialized countries to reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 5 percent below 1990
levels over the period 2008 to 2012. One mechanism for doing this
is a system whereby a country that exceeds its reductions target
can earn money by selling that extra reduction to another country
that is having trouble meeting its target. A similar system,
involving company-to-company trading, has been proposed for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators struggle over the terms of such arrangements
and politicians wrangle over putting the Kyoto accord into effect,
many energy analysts seem to agree on one thing: The ultimate goal
ought to be a carbon-free economy based largely on hydrogen.
Ausubel, for one, predicts that such an economy will materialize.
Many would agree with Williams of General Motors:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm on pretty solid ground in saying the long-term
vision is hydrogen. But there's a lot of work between here and
there.''

DISTANCE NO HITCH FOR LOCAL RAIDER FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For three off-duty hospital workers clad in
silver and black, Oct. 24 at the Oakland Raiders game began in a
Burbank Airport terminal. In an otherwise empty bar. At 8:45 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the first beers of the day in front of them and an NFL
pregame show on the television set overhead, Michael McConaghy of
Eagle Rock, Frank Kleineisel of Chatsworth and Andy Rivera of Santa
Clarita summoned the us-against-the-world bravado they would need
to fit in with 45,000 fellow Raiders fans later in the day at the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refs don't like us _ You've seen that. Other (teams') fans
don't like us, so we stick together,'' said Rivera, a ``Raiders fan
from birth'' and an X-ray technician by trade. ``Raiders fans can
kick any other fans' (butts).''
</P>
<P>
   Just look, baby: The Raiders may have abandoned Los Angeles five
years ago but dozens, sometimes hundreds, of fans like these three
have remained true to the black and silver and regularly fly to
Oakland on Sundays to root for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the terminal, social worker Bill Gould and computer
graphics designer Juanita Jordan, both decked out in Raiders gear,
waited for their plane to Oakland after being bumped from a crowded
7 a.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Southwest Airlines gate nearby, Mel Smith, a Glendale
construction projects manager wearing a black Raiders jacket,
marveled at how Raiders fans seem to take over the San Fernando
Valley airport on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at all the jerseys,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Berta Crawley, a Southwest customer-service agent, said she
recognizes the Raiders fans not only by their attire but by their
unusually compact itineraries. Raiders fans fly up and back in a
day; they do not check baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Crawley estimates that among the passengers on the five
Southwest flights leaving Burbank between 7 and 10:45 a.m. on
Sundays, one-third are Raiders fans on a road trip. That would be
more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Add in untold numbers from other airlines and other Southern
California airports, and there's a sizeable Commitment to
Excellence _ and a definite Commitment to Frequent Flier Miles.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24, when the Raiders played the New York Jets, the
high-flying fans ranged in intensity from La Canada banker John
Burrows to Rancho Cucamonga construction worker Wayne Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   Burrows is a former season-ticket holder who was making a rare
trip north, lured by the chance to spend an afternoon with his son.
``I know it's unconventional for a banker to be a Raiders fan,''
said a joking Burrows, holding a gray and black sweat shirt under
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry, on the other hand, is the self-described ``ultimate
fan,'' who shows up in his sideline seat in an intimidating costume
of ``The Violator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991 I launched the character to try to _ what's the word?
_ promote more crowd participation. The players were saying the
crowd wasn't into the game,'' Mabry said.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old father of two missed only one home game when the
Raiders were in Los Angeles and hasn't missed any since they
returned to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Mabry has been driving to and from Oakland, getting
home early Monday mornings, still in his costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to get the lowest (air) fares,'' he said.
Even The Violator has to watch his pennies. ``You should see the
look I get at like 3 or 4 in the morning when I pop up in
somebody's service station.''
</P>
<P>
   For old L.A. Raiders fans who just can't let go, flying to games
can get expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending $80 for (game) tickets, $70 for the flight. Then,
hot dogs and a Coke,'' Ian Dealhoy, a London-born record-industry
consultant from Altadena, said as he read an entertainment magazine
while waiting for his flight. ``That's two bills right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the cost of the short cab ride from the Oakland airport
to the stadium _ and the obligatory souvenirs _ and the cost soars.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- and the cost soars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're spending $400 _ for one day,'' said Gary Kash, a
Tarzana television editor who wore a Charles Woodson jersey and
held a silver and black construction helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, $237.50,'' said the pony-tailed McConaghy (not
that he's counting).
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Jordan said they plan only one or two such trips this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we can afford,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealhoy said that when friends suggest he's a fanatic for flying
an hour to see the Raiders, he tells them about the New York
resident he met who flies to Oakland for every game there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little extreme,'' Dealhoy said. ``He must have had
some money. And no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever accused Raiders fans of being normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raider fans aren't the nicest people in the world,'' Vince
Colavitti, a Chatsworth recording engineer, said as we jetted up
the state on a 9:40 a.m. Southwest flight. Fortunately, the dozens
of Raiders fans on the plane couldn't hear him over the engine
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Colavitti said he and his brother Mike were going to the game
with some Jets fans and ``I hope we'll be all right.'' He
remembered seeing a Denver Broncos fan get ``pelted with mustard
and stuff'' at a Raiders game at the Los Angeles Coliseum a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Colavitti spoke, a bellowing chorus of ``Let's go Raiders!''
went up from the back of the plane. A few minutes later, a flight
attendant strolled up the aisle, offering ``peanuts for Raiders
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   If the airplane seemed like an unfriendly place for non-Raiders
fans, Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland would be thoroughly
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   There was a banner heralding one group of end-zone fans as the
``Skull Patrol,'' and another reading, ``Welcome to the Darkside.''
Fans watching their heroes warm up an hour before the game are
serenaded by hard-edged Led Zeppelin and AC/DC songs. Behind one
set of goalposts, effigies of an NFL referee and Jets star Keyshawn
Johnson were being pummeled by Raiders zealots as kickoff neared.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders management has struggled to sell the team's outlaw image
to the Bay Area's upper crust. Many of the stadium's luxury boxes
were empty Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the real down-and-dirty fans were as enthusiastic as ever.
Most wore the intimidating silver and black. The whole pre-game
scene looked like Halloween come early.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game started and things turned really ugly. The Raiders
fell behind the Jets, a disappointing team this season, by a 20-3
score late in the third quarter. The fans quit booing the Jets and
began booing Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon. A scuffle broke out
in the ``Skull Patrol'' section and a young man was led away in
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the natives were restless, imagine how the fans who came all
the way from Los Angeles felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can speak for all of 'em,'' Mabry said on
the phone the next day. ``But I got real irritated, for lack of a
better term, whether it's lack of intensity or questionable play
calling (that caused the Raiders to fall behind).''
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time the traveling fans began to ponder a solemn
trip home, the Raiders launched a stirring rally and won 24-23 when
Gannon completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to James Jett with 26
seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled that one out of the bag,'' a hoarse McConaghy said
as he sank into a chair in the Oakland airport waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Rivera appeared wiped out by the game. Or maybe by
the beer.
</P>
<P>
   The three men estimated they'd spent almost $100 on beer alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great. It was worth it. I haven't seen a Raiders game
like that in a long time,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight to Burbank was suitably boisterous. The pilot
congratulated Raiders fans on their victory. In the back of the
plane, the hospital workers' beer tab soared easily past the $100
mark.
</P>
<P>
   As wheels touched tarmac at 8:45 p.m. _ 12 hours after the first
beers of the day _ a familiar hoarse voice sang out: ``Touchdown!''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Mesropi, who went to the game with Kash and Harry
Arjabedian, fingered a plastic shopping bag full of Raiders shirts
and hats _ and a set of pompoms he bought for $5 from a Raiders
cheerleader. He said the pompoms would go nicely with his
girlfriend's Halloween costume. She's going as a Raiderette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes (the game) all the more enjoyable to make a trip out
of it,'' Mesropi said. ``We're going home penniless, but it was
worth it. We saved enough for the Burbank valet (parking) guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about Juanita Jordan, who'd said one or two such trips
would be ``all we can afford''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally worth the expense,'' she said on the way home.
``I can't wait to do it again _ next week.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- after the school opened in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The ooze flowed for 19 years as children developed rashes,
headaches, stomach aches and lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   The school was added to the Superfund list in 1987, but district
officials didn't tell parents. Tests later showed the goo was
loaded with pyrene and benzo pyrene, both carcinogenic, as well as
lead and potential carcinogens. Some samples were so caustic that
they burned like battery acid.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, interim safeguards were installed. An angry state
senator held hearings and pushed through a strict environmental law
for school sites. In August 1990, the state ordered the district to
perform extensive testing at Park Avenue to define the extent of
the contamination and determine what ultimate safeguards were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, as the furor died down, the district quietly asked
the state for more time to do the testing. The district received an
extension to 1992 and then 1993, after claiming ``budgetary
restraints.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests have not been done, and no records of environmental
monitoring have been turned over to the state as required in a
consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Panos said he had no idea that the consent decree had not been
completed. However, he said that the district has done monthly
monitoring at Park. He said records have been sent to the state,
and he does not understand why the state is unaware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said the missteps at Park Avenue should cause board
members to carefully consider whether to go forward with Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``What assurances do they have that the same thing that happened
at Park won't happen at Belmont?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and community activists _ and even the environmental
consultant working for the district at the time who mapped out the
safety plan _ never knew that the work at Park Avenue was not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   And the strict environmental law authored by former Sen. Art
Torres, a Los Angeles Democrat, was weakened the next year in
legislation the LAUSD sought to allow school construction on
hazardous sites if the local school board votes that the dangers
are not significant.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who as a state senator led hearings into concerns at
Park Avenue in 1989, said the district's failure to follow through
was ``tragic'' _ and called for the matter to be referred to the
state Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely inexcusable,'' said Torres, now chairman of
the California Democratic Party. ``I don't understand how the
district, or the state, could let this fall through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bellomo was a project manager for McLaren, an
environmental company that mapped out the interim safeguards for
Park Avenue. In an interview last week, Bellomo said he was stunned
to learn that testing had not been done and added that the
district's current safety team had not been told of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the interim measures was only to stabilize
conditions at the site,'' &UR;  &LR; Bellomo said. ``The consent decree was
allowed to sit idle for years when there should have been
follow-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Records show that the state put no pressure on the district to
fulfill its promises. The only action the agency took was a
four-year campaign to collect from the LAUSD the more than $145,000
in fees for their initial monitoring work. They ended up settling
for $49,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they had no funding. What else could we do?''
said Hamid Saebfar, the chief of Southern California cleanup
operations branch for the state's Department of Toxic Substances
Control.
</P>
<P>
   The state still wants the LAUSD to do the in-depth tests at Park
Avenue, even though the initial work done years ago appeared to
eliminate an immediate health threat, a state spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe a complete investigation of the site needs to
occur,'' DTSC spokesman Ron Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy Mayor George Perez, a parent with two children at Park
Avenue at the time of the Senate hearings, said his concern pushed
him into politics. Perez said the city was not informed that the
added safeguards were not installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling that this problem has been ignored,'' he
said. ``When I was working on this as a parent, I was convinced
that we were being taken advantage of. Now I'm in a position to see
that this gets taken care of.''

   ROME _ The first parents meeting of the year at my child's
Italian public school started off with a warning. We all hunched
anxiously over tiny first-grade desks as the teacher rose from her
chair and stated solemnly, ``I have bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' strike, typhoid and no textbooks were some of the
potential crises that rushed through my head. But what the teacher
was worried about drew a gasp of horror from the other parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children are not eating,'' she said sternly. ``Some of
them don't even touch their second course.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Italians are obsessed with food. My mother is
Italian, I spent many childhood summers in Rome and Tuscany, so I
was well acquainted, I thought, with the importance of cooking
pasta al dente, the moral imperative to throw out day-old
mozzarella, and never to go swimming less than two hours after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But even I was unprepared for how a food-centric nation handles
education. When my daughter started kindergarten last year, I was
surprised to find a huge chart posted on the door, marked with what
appeared to be grades. On closer inspection, the chart turned out
to be a scorecard of the day's lunch achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, next to each child's name, the teacher marked down
what she ate, and how well.
</P>
<P>
   EMMA: Primo (first course): Pasta con pomodoro (pasta with
tomato sauce). Tutto. Ottimo. (Ate all. Excellent.)
</P>
<P>
   Secondo (second course): Scaloppine di Vitello. (veal scallops)
Meta. Molto bene.(Half. Very good.)
</P>
<P>
   Contorno (side dish): Patate bollite e fagiolini (boiled potato
and beans.) Poco. Bene. (A little. Good.)
</P>
<P>
   Dolce (dessert): Pera cotta (stewed pear). Niente. Maggiore
impegno. (None. Needs work.)
</P>
<P>
   Fraud and corruption scams are to Italian newspapers what sex is
to British tabloids. Almost every day, somewhere in Italy there is
a scandal over rigged lotteries, sports ``doping,'' or ingenious
forms of municipal graft. But the one kind of scandal guaranteed to
make the front pages has the word ``mensa'' in it. They are not
referring to the high IQ club. Mensa, in Italian, means school
cafeteria, and any story that suggests that children are being
cheated of their culinary due unleashes mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 13 people, many of them high-ranking city
administrators, were arrested in Milan after a local catering
company was found to be providing substandard food to city-run
hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the Milan story broke, parents who had not once mentioned
the war in Kosovo gathered in angry groups outside our school,
militantly ready to storm the school kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son brought home an apple that I swear was bruised,'' one
mother said urgently. ``How do we know they are not buying
second-rate produce and pocketing the profits?''
</P>
<P>
   The school held an emergency meeting to address those concerns.
I have yet to talk to another mother about reading skills or
after-school programs. We do occasionally gather over espresso at
the cafe next to the school to debate the school cook's ability to
produce a satisfying ``suppli di riso.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is not a society preoccupied with learning disabilities,
ritalin and attention deficit disorder. Here, ADD stands only for
appetite deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Romans have a healthy contempt for all public officials, but no
city administrator is more pilloried than Fiorella Farinelli, the
supervisor of Rome's public schools (though Walter Tocci,
vice-mayor in charge of traffic, is a close second). Last year,
Mrs. Farinelli decreed a meatless day in honor of Linda McCartney,
the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney; she was a vegetarian
and animal rights activist who had just died of cancer. The
indignation from parents was so fevered I wrote an article about
it.
</P>
<P>
   When I interviewed Mrs. Farinelli, she explained that this was
nothing. Once, when she tried to introduce perch to school menus,
she was questioned in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers in Rome want their children to eat pasta with meat
sauce, meat and french fries, and ice cream,'' she said wearily.
``Only that will make them feel certain their children are
eating.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, I have been lucky enough never to get an urgent summons
from the school about a broken bone or high fever.
</P>
<P>
   But once, early on, I was on assignment in Venice when my
husband got a panicked call from Emma's kindergarten teacher,
asking him to come over right away. His Italian wasn't very fluent,
so as he raced over, he called me on my cell phone to urge me to
catch an earlier flight home. I did. The emergency was, of course,
food-related. Emma, who at the time still didn't speak Italian,
wept when the cafeteria lady sprinkled parmigiano on her pasta and
she refused to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that the school day begins with
``merenda,'' the Italian word for snack, except that it is not
considered optional. Mothers are expected to provide their children
every morning with a fresh slice of pizza bianca to tide them over
until lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the kindergarten teacher distributes apples
and slices of bread and nutella, a chocolate and hazelnut spread.
(Child obesity rates in Italy are increasing, but they are lower
than in the United States, 22.5 percent vs. 25 percent to 27
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months, I have assimilated. When I get home from work,
I never ask my child what she did in school. Like every other
Italian parent, I remove the soiled cloth napkin from her book bag
and ask, ``What did you eat for lunch today?''

CAN LAUSD BE TRUSTED TO MAINTAIN BELMONT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Unified School District has racked up
a dismal environmental record at 11 troubled schools, allowing
crucial safety systems to break down, using ill-prepared
maintenance workers to check for hazardous gases and concealing
dangers, according to a Daily News review of state and district
records.
</P>
<P>
   The problems set a chilling precedent as the Board of Education
deliberates whether to go forward with the construction of the
Belmont Learning Center, the nation's costliest high school, on a
former oil field plagued with potentially explosive and toxic gases
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Expense aside, a central issue in the ongoing debate over
Belmont is whether the district can be trusted to maintain _ or
even contract out _ a safety system that must last the life of the
school. The vote has been tentatively scheduled for Nov. 9 but
could be pushed back to as late as Nov. 23, said school board
President Genethia Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the history of problems at the 11 existing district
campuses where environmental safety systems are in place raise
great doubt about the district's ability to set up and maintain
protections anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will be responsible? Who will be in control? I have never
heard that addressed in detail,'' said Don Mullinax, the director
of the LAUSD's internal audit department who recently issued a
scathing report citing misconduct of several district employees in
the Belmont fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clear line of authority needs to be established _ and that's
something that the district has never had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Panos, the new director of the district's Environmental
Health and Safety branch, said he believes significant changes are
being made and that past problems are being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for what has happened in the past, but I can
assure you that we will fix what we find wrong immediately, as soon
as we can,'' Panos said. ``I am confident we are adding the
resources and skills needed to handle anything. If the board
approves Belmont, we can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to state and district records, the 11 campuses with
safeguards against known hazards have been plagued by myriad
problems, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- At Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley, methane gas
from a nearby landfill has filled buildings to explosive levels on
several occasions, and a crucial computer monitoring system was
inoperable for a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- A system installed to clean toxics from the soil at Jefferson
New Middle School in south Los Angeles was so poorly placed that it
spewed potentially dangerous residue over students sitting at
outdoor lunch tables and into the intake ducts of the heating and
air-conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Towne Avenue Elementary School in Carson, a school
adjacent to a landfill, upkeep of the methane monitoring system
wasn't done for years even though Los Angeles County was paying the
school district to do it. The LAUSD installed classroom sensors
improperly, potentially exposing teachers and students to explosive
gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD's past record shows that they can't maintain these
things. It scares me to death,'' said John Robertson, a former
Cudahy city councilman and petroleum engineer regarded as an expert
witness on gas migration.
</P>
<P>
   The district safety team has gone into all 11 schools this year
and conducted spot testing, finding no immediate health hazards,
although state environmental officials say those preliminary
results are inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a significant failure in the district's safety
program to ensure the protection of the schools' populations,''
said Angelo Bellomo, an environmental consultant hired by the
district, who studied all the sites as a member of the LAUSD's new
safety team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no assurances, based on my review of available
documents, that chemical exposures did not occur on those
campuses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations began after the school board learned several
schools were operating with environmental monitoring or cleanup
systems _ a revelation that surprised them.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say the most troubling situation may be Park
Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy, a campus that was put on the
state Superfund toxic cleanup list.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the Belmont scandal, the development of Park
Avenue features district officials so eager to build on cheap land
that they acknowledged hazards only when they were made public in
embarrassing headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same officials now facing disciplinary action for
their role in Belmont also were responsible for Park Avenue. Before
Park Avenue was built, the property had been used for the Cudahy
Dump, the Vloedman Dump and B.H. Steepleton Landfill _ ominous
precursors to a carcinogenic black ooze that bubbled up on the
campus playground after the school opened in 1968.

   ROME _ The first parents meeting of the year at my child's
Italian public school started off with a warning. We all hunched
anxiously over tiny first-grade desks as the teacher rose from her
chair and stated solemnly, ``I have bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' strike, typhoid and no textbooks were some of the
potential crises that rushed through my head. But what the teacher
was worried about drew a gasp of horror from the other parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children are not eating,'' she said sternly. ``Some of
them don't even touch their second course.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Italians are obsessed with food. My mother is
Italian, I spent many childhood summers in Rome and Tuscany, so I
was well acquainted, I thought, with the importance of cooking
pasta al dente, the moral imperative to throw out day-old
mozzarella, and never to go swimming less than two hours after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But even I was unprepared for how a food-centric nation handles
education. When my daughter started kindergarten last year, I was
surprised to find a huge chart posted on the door, marked with what
appeared to be grades. On closer inspection, the chart turned out
to be a scorecard of the day's lunch achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, next to each child's name, the teacher marked down
what she ate, and how well.
</P>
<P>
   EMMA: Primo (first course): Pasta con pomodoro (pasta with
tomato sauce). Tutto. Ottimo. (Ate all. Excellent.)
</P>
<P>
   Secondo (second course): Scaloppine di Vitello. (veal scallops)
Meta. Molto bene.(Half. Very good.)
</P>
<P>
   Contorno (side dish): Patate bollite e fagiolini (boiled potato
and beans.) Poco. Bene. (A little. Good.)
</P>
<P>
   Dolce (dessert): Pera cotta (stewed pear). Niente. Maggiore
impegno. (None. Needs work.)
</P>
<P>
   Fraud and corruption scams are to Italian newspapers what sex is
to British tabloids. Almost every day, somewhere in Italy there is
a scandal over rigged lotteries, sports ``doping,'' or ingenious
forms of municipal graft. But the one kind of scandal guaranteed to
make the front pages has the word ``mensa'' in it. They are not
referring to the high IQ club. Mensa, in Italian, means school
cafeteria, and any story that suggests that children are being
cheated of their culinary due unleashes mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 13 people, many of them high-ranking city
administrators, were arrested in Milan after a local catering
company was found to be providing substandard food to city-run
hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the Milan story broke, parents who had not once mentioned
the war in Kosovo gathered in angry groups outside our school,
militantly ready to storm the school kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son brought home an apple that I swear was bruised,'' one
mother said urgently. ``How do we know they are not buying
second-rate produce and pocketing the profits?''
</P>
<P>
   The school held an emergency meeting to address those concerns.
I have yet to talk to another mother about reading skills or
after-school programs. We do occasionally gather over espresso at
the cafe next to the school to debate the school cook's ability to
produce a satisfying ``suppli di riso.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is not a society preoccupied with learning disabilities,
ritalin and attention deficit disorder. Here, ADD stands only for
appetite deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Romans have a healthy contempt for all public officials, but no
city administrator is more pilloried than Fiorella Farinelli, the
supervisor of Rome's public schools (though Walter Tocci,
vice-mayor in charge of traffic, is a close second). Last year,
Mrs. Farinelli decreed a meatless day in honor of Linda McCartney,
the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney; she was a vegetarian
and animal rights activist who had just died of cancer. The
indignation from parents was so fevered I wrote an article about
it.
</P>
<P>
   When I interviewed Mrs. Farinelli, she explained that this was
nothing. Once, when she tried to introduce perch to school menus,
she was questioned in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers in Rome want their children to eat pasta with meat
sauce, meat and french fries, and ice cream,'' she said wearily.
``Only that will make them feel certain their children are
eating.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, I have been lucky enough never to get an urgent summons
from the school about a broken bone or high fever.
</P>
<P>
   But once, early on, I was on assignment in Venice when my
husband got a panicked call from Emma's kindergarten teacher,
asking him to come over right away. His Italian wasn't very fluent,
so as he raced over, he called me on my cell phone to urge me to
catch an earlier flight home. I did. The emergency was, of course,
food-related. Emma, who at the time still didn't speak Italian,
wept when the cafeteria lady sprinkled parmigiano on her pasta and
she refused to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that the school day begins with
``merenda,'' the Italian word for snack, except that it is not
considered optional. Mothers are expected to provide their children
every morning with a fresh slice of pizza bianca to tide them over
until lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the kindergarten teacher distributes apples
and slices of bread and nutella, a chocolate and hazelnut spread.
(Child obesity rates in Italy are increasing, but they are lower
than in the United States, 22.5 percent vs. 25 percent to 27
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months, I have assimilated. When I get home from work,
I never ask my child what she did in school. Like every other
Italian parent, I remove the soiled cloth napkin from her book bag
and ask, ``What did you eat for lunch today?''

WITH DEMISE OF COLD WAR HARMONY, DEBATE ON U.S. IDENTITY IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ohio, Neb.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the aftermath of the White House's acrid defeat
on a treaty banning nuclear testing, President Clinton declared
that the Republicans in Congress were now driven by a reckless
``new isolationism.'' The treasury secretary charged Congress with
``malign neglect'' of America's obligations. The national security
adviser accused Republicans in Congress of pursuing a
``survivalist'' foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But within days of delivering these broadsides, administration
officials began to backpedal. Lawrence Summers, the treasury
secretary, said in a speech that economic isolationism ``does not
spring from a single party or agenda.'' Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, said that he did not intend to label all
opponents of the weapons treaty isolationists or to tar the entire
Republican Party with the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to reduce this to Republicans vs. Democrats,''
Berger said in an interview last week. ``But there are serious
issues and we ought to talk about them. We are at the pinnacle of
our power ... Are we going to seize this opportunity to lead the
world, or are we going to pull back?''
</P>
<P>
   Ostrichism and nativism will always be found in American
politics. But the debate, many foreign policy experts say, is about
what form of internationalism makes sense for an unchallenged
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did little to advance his brand of internationalism with
his angry outburst after the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was
spiked. He alienated Republicans who believe the United States has
global obligations but question the administration's strategy for
meeting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks are both dangerous and bad judgment,'' said
Robert Zoellick, undersecretary of state in the Bush administration
and a foreign policy adviser to George W. Bush, the Texas governor
and presidential candidate. ``That pattern is to brand all
opponents as isolationists. It's not only inaccurate, it runs the
serious risk of undermining the larger case for America's
engagement in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoellick believes that the American people today favor an active
role in the world, but prefer to leave the specific terms of
engagement up to the president. He believes that Clinton has
squandered that opportunity. But Republicans are also to blame for
the current confusion, Zoellick said, because they have allowed
their distaste for Clinton to cloud their judgment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a moderate, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the national security adviser have attempted
to use the word `isolationist' as a political attack word,'' Lugar
said. Clinton has resorted to name-calling over his foreign policy
defeats rather than making a good-faith effort to narrow
``differences of opinion in how the United States should be engaged
in fulfilling its international goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are Republicans _ and former Republicans, like
Pat Buchanan _ who argue that the United States need not sully
itself in the messy conflicts of the Balkans or East Timor, nor
participate in the mushy do-goodism of international bodies. But
there are Democrats as well who opposed American military
intervention in Haiti and Bosnia and who question the value of
free-trading arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is a long tradition _ in both major political parties _ of
mistrust of foreign entanglements and lack of faith in
multinational organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the use of force in the Persian
Gulf in 1991 and voted heavily against the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1993. For decades during the Cold War,
Republicans were outspoken advocates of internationalism, proposing
robust military spending and aggressive intervention in foreign
conflicts, from Southeast Asia to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, the discussion that began with the end of the
Cold War is not about treaties or trading arrangements, but about
the American identity and national purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is a debate that preceded the formation of the republic and
that George Washington addressed in his valedictory upon leaving
the presidency in 1797, in which he warned his countrymen against
``permanent alliances'' with foreign powers. (It was Jefferson who
warned of ``entangling alliances'' in his inaugural address four
years later.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been renewed after every major conflict, from the
War of 1812 to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side believes the United States is exceptional and unique,
unique because it is isolated by the oceans and uncontaminated by
foreign influences,'' said Michael Hogan, dean of the College of
Humanities at Ohio State University. ``They believe that the more
the country enters into entangling alliances, the more likely it is
that it will be corrupted and its unique nature will be
subverted.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side argues that while the United States is singular,
Hogan continued, ``it has the mission to spread the blessings of
American liberty to people around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That tension was largely stilled during the Cold War. Congresses
and presidents, from Truman to Reagan, shared a broad consensus on
the need to pay the price of advancing liberty around the globe,
although there were deep and even violent disputes on where and
when American troops should be the instruments of that cause. That
consensus has now broken down and the debate is once again raging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much easier during that era to rally the public and the
Congress to engagement under the banner of containment,'' Berger
said. ``But with the end of the Cold War, it is tempting to some to
want to pull back, but it is equally dangerous. There is a range of
threats out there that will affect America's prosperity and
security. Our well-being is tied to the well-being of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans mostly agree. Their quarrel is with the
administration's approach to those threats. They do not want to see
American troops under U.N. command, they believe that Europeans
should take the lead in dealing with bloodshed in the Balkans, and
they think that global treaties infringe on American sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   And they resent the charge of isolationism as a substitute for
substantive debate and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, we've got a president who very few people up
here trust and, on the Republican side, very few like,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.
``He's never gone out of his way to develop any kind of relations
up here, and this is all coming home now.''

BOSNIA HAS ACHIEVED PEACE BUT NOT UNITY, A STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly four years after the fighting stopped in
Bosnia, an international study group has concluded that Western
efforts have failed to realize the driving principle of the Dayton
accords: a single, multiethnic country.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy paper released by the International Crisis Group, an
independent group consisting of former national leaders, diplomats
and analysts concerned with the Balkans, paints a bleak picture of
Bosnia as a place divided into three ethnic entities propped up
almost entirely by Western economic assistance. As aid begins to
drop, social and economic tensions will increase, threatening the
tangible success of peace, the report says, urging more robust
action by outside governments to get what they want in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The hard tasks in Bosnia _ ensuring the return of refugees,
reconstruction, building an economy _ have been largely
overshadowed in the last year as attention focused on the war in
Kosovo and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment by the group, which was formed to monitor events
in the Balkans and is chaired by former Sen. George Mitchell,
coincides with other assessments of what has happened in Bosnia,
where NATO troops have been deployed since the peace accord reached
in Dayton, Ohio, on Nov. 21, 1995, was signed in December of that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not all conclusions are as grim as those of the Crisis Group. In
the coming issue of Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Council on
Foreign Relations, two former Clinton Administration officials, Ivo
Daalder and Michael Froman, argue that Bosnia remains deeply
divided, with corruption and ethnic politics dominating society.
But Daalder and Froman give credit for the reconstruction that has
taken place in Sarajevo and elsewhere, and praise the fact that
most people in Bosnia _ the vast majority of whom live among their
own ethnic kin _ do not fear for their personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Crisis Group, Daalder and Froman state that peace is
the main accomplishment, but argue that peace in itself is probably
a sufficient achievement for the outsiders who intervened to stop
the three-and-a-half year war.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the Dayton accords, Richard C. Holbrooke, who
is now the U.S. representative to the United Nations, wrote in a
Sept. 14 Op-Ed article in The New York Times that ``many of the
forces of darkness _ separatists, racists, war criminal and crooks
_ are still there, continuing their efforts to keep the people in
the Dark Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other observers of the uncertain peace in Bosnia,
Holbrooke noted that the number of refugees returning to their
homes was only a trickle and that most of the ``minority''
returnees were primarily Serbs going back to Muslim and Croat
areas. The Serbs continue to block most Muslims trying to return
home. Even so, Holbrooke said that the wounds of war are beginning
to heal and progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House has been more upbeat. In July, the
Clinton administration said that the ``rate of refugee returns in
Bosnia is exceeding that of the past two years.'' However, only
about 8,000 people returned to areas where they are in the ethnic
minority _ 2,000 of them Croats and Serbs who went back to homes in
Sarajevo, which is dominated by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Group said that the ability of refugees to return to
homes they fled during the 1992-95 war was the key measure of
whether the accords were working. On this score, it concluded, they
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that the Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman, who
was one of the signatories to the accords, continued to oppose
refugee returns as a way of consolidating his own control over
ethnically pure territories. Croatia and Serbia, led by Slobodan
Milosevic, came under strong criticism for continuing to encourage
separatism in Bosnia and for financing the armed forces of the
Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Group report said the failure to get refugees back
home bodes poorly for Bosnia's future, predicting that the longer
the absence from home, the more likely it would become that
refugees would resort to violence against local authorities
preventing their return.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most troubling prospects was the likelihood of
reduced economic assistance from the West. ``The inability of
donors to hold out the promise of aid could cause local leaders to
be even more noncompliant than now,'' the report said. Social
unrest could increase, especially since unemployment is already
very high and pensions continue to be unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social discontent has already burst into open unrest, as
demonstrators regularly block highways and buildings,'' the report
said. ``Ominously, in the past many local politicians channeled
this unrest into nationalism.''

A CLOSER LOOK AT THE HIGH SEAS AND THE FINE PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Alaska, N.Y.)   (With CRUISES-MEDICAL-CARE)  
(lh) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to medical malpractice suits, the law, the fine
print and recent congressional action favor the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   First, maritime law governs claims. The Death on the High Seas
Act limits damages to real monetary losses, eliminating punitive
damages and payments for pain and suffering. And judges, not
juries, decide maritime cases.
</P>
<P>
   The law of the sea also specifies that a ship owner has no duty
to provide medical care and, as stipulated in the small print on
cruise tickets, is not liable for the ship's doctors and other
independent contractors. That precedent is rooted in the 19th
century, when trans-Atlantic ships gave doctors free passage in
exchange for looking after passengers informally.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise companies argue that they still need the protection today
because their expertise lies in operating vessels, not supervising
doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Miami rejected the argument in 1993, saying
that cruise ships enticed passengers aboard by advertising the
presence of a doctor and could therefore be liable for the doctor's
actions. But other courts have sided with the ship owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers have tried without success to take up the issue by
accusing ships of false advertising, because the fine print of
tickets says they provide medical care and because doctors wear the
same uniforms as other officers.
</P>
<P>
   The fine print also specifies where a passenger can file suit.
Most cruise companies choose Miami, where most have their
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   This means that a passenger who boards a cruise in California
and later decides to sue must do so in Miami, even if the passenger
never got within 2,000 miles of Miami. Lawyers for passengers say
the requirement makes suing cruise companies more expensive and
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ranni, 78, who was injured in a fall on a Royal Caribbean
ship last year, is challenging the requirement. Her lawyer, Daniel
H. Greenberg, said the print on the ticket was too small to
constitute proper legal notice in New York, where she bought her
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the industry sought congressional approval to cap the
amount passengers could collect for medical malpractice in certain
instances. Under the proposal, when an ill or injured passenger was
referred to a doctor or hospital in port, the cruise line's
liability was capped at the limit in the location where the medical
treatment occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The industry said the cap meant that the burden of paying a
malpractice award was not shifted unfairly away from the hospital
or on-shore doctor to the cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction was one of three provisions sought by the
industry and introduced with a public hearing by Rep. Don Young,
R-Alaska, who is a leading voice for the industry in Congress. The
others would have prohibited foreign crew members from suing cruise
companies in U.S. courts if they were injured and limited damages
for victims of sexual assault on ships.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation opposed all the changes,
saying they would help the cruise industry, most of whose ships
operate under foreign flags, at the expense of American travelers,
who make up more than 90 percent of cruise passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' Nancy E. McFadden, the department's general counsel,
wrote in a letter to Congress, ``the adverse impact of the
provisions falls mainly on U.S. passengers while at the same time
benefiting foreign-flag cruise operators _ operators who pay few
U.S. taxes and avoid U.S. minimum wage and fair labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisions dealing with crew lawsuits and rape were defeated
after lawyers and women's rights groups objected. The malpractice
cap was approved and enacted.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's ruling Muslim clerics Saturday began the
apostasy trial of one of the country's most popular politicians,
Abdullah Nouri, a cleric who has gone from being one of the most
trusted aides to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to taking a key
leadership role in a campaign to end the clerical dictatorship
Khomeini imposed after the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As turbaned clerics gathered in a courtroom ringed by armed
commandos, few Iranians doubted that the outcome of the trial,
before the much-feared Special Court for the Clergy, will go a long
way toward determining whether the country moves toward greater
democracy, or to a new era of clerical repression. A guilty verdict
could conceivably carry the death penalty, although a lengthy
prison term is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   For many of Iran's 65 million people, the trial has assumed the
significance Americans attached to the Scopes trial in 1927, or
people in England to the treason trial of Sir Thomas More during
the reign of Henry VIII _ a moment when a courtroom becomes a
testing ground for irreconcilable views about the future of a
society and its beliefs, with huge social, philosophical and
political stakes resting on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tehran trial, which could last weeks, reformers and
hard-liners will battle over issues that only a few years ago were
taboo, the most crucial of them over whether the right to rule
rests with the Iranian people, or with the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   But other, more tangible questions are on trial, too, including
Iran's relations with the United States. High on the list of
charges outlined in a 44-page indictment of the defendant is that
the newspaper he publishes has advocated re-establishing relations
with the United States. The prosecutor, a cleric, said that by
running an article quoting another high-ranking cleric as saying
that relations with the United States are ``now a possible, not
impossible thing,'' Nouri had betrayed the revolution and the
Islamic principles that underpinned it.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is Nouri who is on trial, the 50-year-old cleric is
widely regarded in Iran as a surrogate for the man many powerful
clerics would like to see as the defendant, President Mohammad
Khatami. But for the time being, Khatami, 53, another cleric, is
untouchable, having won a landslide victory in the presidential
election in 1997 over the hard-liners' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Nouri's trial began, Khatami landed back in Tehran
from an official visit to Paris, part of his campaign to break
Iran's isolation and open what he calls ``a dialogue of
civilizations'' with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Iranians expect Nouri to be convicted, many say the
trial could be costly for the hard-liners, underlining an
intolerance that could strengthen reformers' support. Even in the
courtroom, the sense of the hard-liners' isolation from the society
around them was reinforced by signs of the rapid changes afoot in
Iran _ in the ringing mobile phones of reporters and clerics, and
in the high-rise block of luxury condominiums rising across the
road, evidence of a new business class that has thrown its support
behind the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, dressed in a cleric's collar-less white shirt, black robe
and white turban, appeared to stun peers appointed to sit in
judgment over him _ a judge and a nine-man jury, all of them
clerics _ by taking the witness stand immediately after the
indictment was read to say that it was they, not he, who had
betrayed the revolution. More than that, he rejected their right to
judge him, saying that the clergy court itself was illegal, having
no place in the Islamic Constitution that was drawn up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its competence
to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will have no
legitimacy,'' he said, in a clear, steady voice. ``What I was
thinking as I listened to the indictment being read out was, `This
is not a court, this is a self-appointed cabal.''' He added: ``I
ask myself, what has happened to us, to our revolution, to our
faith, that it has come to this, that one group of clerics can make
allegations against another like this?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mohammed Salimi, who is in his late 30s, warned Nouri not
to insult the court. ``You say now that this court has no
legitimacy, because you are here on trial, but I don't remember you
saying that about this court when you were holding high positions
of state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Mohammed Nikounam, in his 50s, reminded Nouri,
ominously, that left-wing opponents of the ruling clerics also
contested the court's legitimacy after placing a bomb in a Tehran
building, killing 73 people, including many top clerics, in 1981.
The bombers were executed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By challenging the court's legitimacy, Nouri came close to doing
something virtually unheard of in Iran, even among reformers _
questioning the legacy of Ayatollah Khomeini, the stern-faced
cleric who became an absolute ruler in the years between the
upheaval that ousted the shah and his death in 1989. Khomeini
established the clergy court by personal decree to deal with rising
resistance to Islamic rule, but Nouri, citing the 1980
constitution, said that not even ``the leader'' _ a reference to
Khomeini _ had the right to establish courts outside the framework
of the constitution. ``Are we supposed to accept that the law
applies to everybody except the leader?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Nouri opened the key issue in the trial, and in the
wider political struggle across Iran: Whether power will be vested
in the people, through the president and Parliament they elect, or
will continue to rest, as it effectively does now, with a group of
deeply conservative clerics who take their authority from
Khomeini's successor as the country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei. Khamenei and his supporters say that their right to
rule rests in a principle known in Iran as ``velayat-i faghi,''
which means, loosely, that the country's top cleric, as ``God's
representative on earth,'' has sovereign powers.
</P>
<P>
   By holding Nouri's trial now _ and many other trials in which
newspaper editors, reporters, student protesters and clerics who
have joined the reform movement are defendants _ the clerical elite
apparently hopes to strike a blow against the reformers ahead of
parliamentary elections that are scheduled in February. The
reformers' political strategists, prominent among them Nouri, hope
that by winning a landslide victory in the elections they can move
on to constitutional reforms that will vastly reduce the clerics'
arbitrary powers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nouri is convicted, or even if his trial is not
concluded, he will automatically be disqualified from competing in
the elections, in which he has been expected to be the reformers'
biggest vote-getter. In February, after stepping down as one of
Khatami's vice presidents, he won the largest number of votes in
municipal elections that were held among the 12 million people of
Tehran. Until hard-liners in Parliament impeached him in 1998, he
was Khatami's interior minister, winning widespread popularity with
steps that curbed excesses by the police and the judiciary.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The charges Nouri faces could hardly be more serious. He is
accused of using his newspaper, Khordad, which has the biggest
circulation among dozens of daily newspapers in Tehran, to ``insult
Islam,'' its prophet, Mohammed, his descendants, and Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   But as the indictment was read out in court, it became clear
that hard-line clerics intend to use the trial to strike out
against just about everything else they dislike in the reformers'
more tolerant social philosophy. Among other things, the prosecutor
cited an article in Khordad that said that people should be allowed
to clap, whistle and cheer at concerts and political rallies _ an
Islamic taboo in Iran, even though it has been frequently ignored
in the freer atmosphere ushered in by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles the prosecutor cited as examples of
``un-Islamic'' attitudes included one in which an Italian woman
journalist criticized Iran's divorce laws, which are heavily
weighted against women, and another that argued, in a reference to
the clergy, that ``absolute power corrupts absolutely.'' Still
another questioned the Islamic legal precept of ``qisas,'' or
eye-for-an-eye justice, under which Iranian courts frequently
impose the death penalty, amputations and other harsh penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Nikounam, the prosecutor, raised his voice indignantly. ``What
you are saying, in effect, is that people should be able to do
anything they want, even to drink alcohol, no matter how offensive
that may be to our Islamic beliefs,'' he said. He stood before a
handwritten quotation from Khomeini that court officials had pasted
on the courtroom wall in which Khomeini warned followers to
``beware of false clerics and false revolutionaries who pretend to
be holy,'' but conspire to betray Islam.

CHINA ENACTS STRICT LAW AIMED AT SMASHING CULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After a week of secret deliberations, China's top
legislative body issued a stringent new ``anti-cult'' law on
Saturday designed to aid the government's crackdown on the Falun
Gong spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, reportedly passed by a vote of 114-0 with two
abstentions by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, ``calls on courts, prosecutors, police and administrative
judicial organs to be on full alert for cult activities and smash
them rigorously,'' the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts suggested that the law would be used _ apparently
retroactively _ in prosecuting organizers of the Falun Gong
movement, which was banned on July 22 and has been vilified for
months in the official news media, with thousands of its adherents
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the law allots jail terms of three to seven
years to cultists who ``disrupt public order'' or distribute
publications ``spreading malicious fallacies.'' Those found
organizing or recruiting face terms of seven years or more.
</P>
<P>
   The standing committee is led by Li Peng, a former prime
minister who played a prominent role in the crushing of the student
democracy movement in 1989, and includes the most powerful and
trusted members of the Parliament. On important issues it carries
out the secret directives of the Communist Party, led by Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement a week ago that the committee would be adopting
a new law on cults helped set off daily silent demonstrations here
by unrepentant believers. They insist that Falun Gong _ which
combines slow ritual exercises with mystical theories of health and
happiness _ is not a cult or a political danger.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown has brought on a crisis with surreal aspects for
the government, which had hoped that the popular movement would
dissolve after it was officially condemned as a fraud and key
leaders were jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, thousands of fervent believers, from graduate students
in Beijing to retired clerks and bureaucrats in provincial cities,
have refused to repudiate a practice they regard as vital to their
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, for the sixth straight day, dozens of followers
were detained in Tiananmen Square, next to the Great Hall of the
People, where the legislators met. Many came from other cities in
the naive hope of convincing officials that Falun Gong was not a
social threat. Instead, they were picked up as soon as they were
identified by the scores of plainclothes police roaming the vast
square.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong members say that thousands of desperate
practitioners, most of whom faced harassment or imprisonment in
their hometowns, have converged on Beijing, where they are now
trying to elude the vast police dragnet.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have privately said that more than 3,000 people were
detained in Beijing in the last week, most of them not in the
public setting of Tiananmen Square. Many were immediately sent to
their home provinces, where they may face further imprisonment or
other punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some local people were quickly released _ with their company
managers, university department chairmen or neighborhood government
officials ordered to help ``re-educate'' them. Some who were
identified as organizers will be held for possible serious charges.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, at least 10 of the 30 Falun Gong members who
took part in a clandestine news conference with foreign reporters
on Thursday had been arrested, an organizer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the believers who came to Beijing have described a
worsening pattern of persecution in the provinces. According to a
report Saturday from a human rights monitor in Hong Kong, for
example, a women's labor camp in the northeastern city of Changchun
now holds 50 Falun Gong believers, including 12 schoolteachers who
refused to give up the practice and who were sentenced _ without
trial _ to one year in prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Falun Gong, invented only in 1992 by a former grain clerk named
Li Hongzhi, combines ancient theories about cosmic forces in the
body with elements of Buddhism and Taoism. Practitioners do a
series of exercises that are said to ward off disease.
</P>
<P>
   Li's writings purport to offer a new spiritual path in a corrupt
world, and condemn drinking, smoking and homosexuality. They also
suggest that believers can attain supernatural powers. His
teachings spread quickly in China, attracting millions of people
who practiced in city parks until the July ban.
</P>
<P>
   Li moved to New York in 1998 but communicates with his devotees
worldwide on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In late April the Chinese government began laying plans to
destroy the group, after more than 10,000 members mounted a
surprise illegal vigil around the Communist Party leadership's
compound in Beijing demanding official recognition. At first the
official response was hesitant, perhaps because so many current and
former officials and otherwise upright citizens were involved.
</P>
<P>
   But China's Communist government tries to keep all social
institutions under its thumb and on July 22 it banned the group,
charging that it had political ambitions to subvert the state _
something Li and his followers deny.
</P>
<P>
   With the branding of the group as a cult, and new charges that
leaders stole state secrets, the new law, an intense news media
campaign to discredit the theory and its founder, and the imminent
prosecutions of key leaders, the campaign to stamp out Falun Gong
is gathering force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's official news report of the anti-cult law says it
``stresses that deceived followers and practitioners should be
differentiated from cult leaders.'' Local governments are supposed
``to educate those deceived while punishing a small number of cult
leaders and those who have committed crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the curious hidden struggle with true believers in the back
alleys of Beijing last week suggests that exterminating the
movement _ if it is possible at all _ will be far uglier than party
leaders may have anticipated, requiring harsh punishment for
thousands. Furthermore, the devotees protesting last week are not
some strange breed of democracy dissident, but colleagues and
relatives and law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations last week, many Beijing residents said they
felt that the government had overreacted to the rise of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troubles this week show how mistaken the government's
approach has been,'' said a high-ranking intellectual of the
Communist Party. ``Now, Falun Gong has been transformed into a
completely antagonistic social force.''

<P>
   ECATEPEC, Mexico Gabriel Medina says he recently got his job
peddling a bicycle taxi by agreeing to join Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has little education and few marketable skills,
Medina intends to keep that $10-a-day job by doing exactly what a
local PRI-affiliated leader tells him to do. That's why he
dutifully accepted his leader's instruction about a month ago to
put campaign bumper stickers for PRI presidential hopeful Francisco
Labastida on his cab.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, the leader told Medina and about 70 other workers,
was the best man to vote for in Mexico's historic Nov. 7
presidential primary _ the first ever held by the powerful PRI,
which has controlled Mexico's highest office for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true that Mr. Labastida will help us, I don't mind
voting for him,'' shrugged Medina, 21, who has to pay his leader $1
a week for the right to drive his bicycle taxi around this
sprawling working-class city just
</P>
<P>
   outside Mexico's capital. ``Me, I just want to work and live
without any problems. The truth is I don't think our lives will
change much no matter which of these politicians is elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's compliance _ and his party leader's pressure _
represent the street-level version of a system deeply ingrained in
Mexico's political life. It's known here by the nickname ``la
cargada.'' And it means, loosely, that PRI-affiliated state
governors down to the lowest party functionary will ``carry'' a
candidate's campaign by using subtle to extreme coercion as well as
public resources to garner votes.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of a widespread ``cargada'' in favor of Labastida
have become a flash point in the PRI's Nov. 7 primary election.
Labastida, who was most recently Mexico's interior minister, and
another candidate, Roberto Madrazo, the former Tabasco state
governor, are locked in a close race that has them fighting for the
endorsement of PRI sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the PRI has dominated Mexican politics in large part
by mustering to the polls its vast network of PRI-affiliated
unions, neighborhoods, farmers and business associations. These are
groups that have long held the keys to jobs, contracts and simple
services like water, drainage, electricity and food subsidies in
this country where half the population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, candidates for all elections here have been
selected by party leaders without primaries. For the 70 years that
the PRI has controlled the presidency, the sitting president of the
republic has always
</P>
<P>
   picked the party's nominee in an autocratic process known
jokingly as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, however, the PRI is trying to break with that
tradition and construct a more democratic image by holding a
self-supervised primary. The balloting will be open to all Mexican
voters, but PRI loyalists are expected to be the majority of those
who turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has appeared fierce among four candidates,
particularly between Labastida and Madrazo, who have been running
close in opinion polls for most of the three-month campaign.
Madrazo's television ads and his rhetoric, especially, have been
unusually bold in their attacks on Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Mexican society thought this process was a show and
would end up with a designation as things used to be done. But as
days, weeks and months passed, people realized this was for real,''
PRI primary organizer Fernando Gutierrez Barrios told foreign
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary's democratic blush has been marred by the
perception that Labastida alone is benefiting from the PRI's
traditional well-oiled political machine. Indeed, at least one
state governor _ Roberto Albores of Chiapas _ has been verbally
reprimanded by the PRI for using his position to support Labastida
in his state, acknowledged Gutierrez Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, those complaining the loudest about Labastida's
alleged advantage are Madrazo and two other contenders, Manuel
Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva. Like Labastida, all are
party insiders who in the past have advanced in their careers with
the help of the same system they are now attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But others are also casting a jaundiced eye toward campaign
methods employed during the primary, which could be a dress
rehearsal for Mexico's July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is using the same tactics it always has,'' said
Rogelio Gomez, a national representative of Civic Alliance, an
independent organization monitoring election fraud and questionable
campaign activities here. ``There is a culture of doing politics in
Mexico where people with low incomes and little education give
their votes in exchange for government services that should just be
given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, who is mounting a strong opposition campaign as the
presidential candidate for Mexico's National Action Party, or PAN,
said that ``only a blind person'' couldn't see that ``the
unconditional support of the whole state apparatus and the PRI's
party apparatus is behind Labastida.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Estudillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute for
Political Studies, said that many PRI affiliates, especially those
in very poor urban and rural areas, appear to still be locked into
the habit of waiting to be
</P>
<P>
   told for whom they should vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the principle dilemma of the PRI and of Mexico as both
try to make a transition to democracy,'' Estudillo said. ``The PRI
member is asking: Do I respond to that tradition of 70 years, which
may be serving me in some way, or do I dare to rebel? ``
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Labastida workers have reportedly been
observed handing out T-shirts, hats, shopping bags, free breakfasts
and free medical exams and legal advice at a greater pace than
Labastida's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a meeting with (Labastida) not long ago,'' recalled
Medina. ``They gave us our sandwich, a dessert and a banana. The
truth is it was fun. Our leader didn't really force us to go, but
she suggested we go to support him so he'll support us later.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as such services and gifts are not paid for by
government funds, their provision to would-be voters at campaign
rallies does not violate the PRI's internal primary rules or
Mexican law. Other parties hand
</P>
<P>
   out gifts, too, but the PRI is considered the king of such
practices after 70 years of power.
</P>
<P>
   What is strictly prohibited, however, is using public money,
services or the influence of government or high-ranking party
officials to buy votes. In the primary, the PRI has also required
that governors and other officials refrain from even expressing a
preference for a candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the party did not publicize it, Gutierrez Barrios
revealed this week that the PRI verbally sanctioned Gov. Roberto
Albores of Chiapas early in the campaign. But according to
newspaper reports here, some state congressmen in Chiapas accused
Albores of recently trying to force them into delivering votes for
Labastida. The accuracy of the charges is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has complained about other governors using their clout
on behalf of Labastida. The PRI is supposed to investigate the
complaints. So far, no other governors have been reprimanded. But
about a dozen lower-ranking PRI figures have been sanctioned for
using their positions to support certain candidates, not just
Labastida, Gutierrez Barrios said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, the mere fact that Labastida has many former
cabinet secretaries and other powerful PRI figures working in his
campaign is a sign that he has the stamp of approval of President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   And during a trip to Europe, newspapers here reported, a group
of the PRI representatives reportedly praised Labastida in a
meeting with German officials and spoke harshly about Madrazo,
characterizing him as a corrupt figure.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has tried to fight the notion that he is considered
the party elite's preferred candidate. His campaign touts his
experience as governor of Sinaloa state, agriculture minister and
interior secretary in Zedillo's cabinet. He also has the benefit of
some new polls showing that voters believe he is more honest and
more of a leader than Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   But the fuss inside the PRI over the alleged ``cargada'' has
dogged Labastida as well as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's three rivals recently implored Zedillo to speak out
against governors and other public officials taking sides during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Zedillo met with PRI functionaries and governors
last week, reiterating that he had no preferred candidate. He also
warned: ``In a democratic and open election . . . attempts at
manipulation, coercion or fraud will not only not work, they will
come back to hurt those who attempt to commit them.''
</P>
<P>
   But after decades of authoritarian politicking, the public
response to Zedillo was skeptical. The Mexican newspaper La Jornada
published a cartoon with Zedillo's finger telling him, ``You don't
have a favorite, but what about me?''

sprawling working-class city just
</P>
<P>
   outside Mexico's capital. ``Me, I just want to work and live
without any problems. The truth is I don't think our lives will
change much no matter which of these politicians is elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's compliance _ and his party leader's pressure _
represent the street-level version of a system deeply ingrained in
Mexico's political life. It's known here by the nickname ``la
cargada.'' And it means, loosely, that PRI-affiliated state
governors down to the lowest party functionary will ``carry'' a
candidate's campaign by using subtle to extreme coercion as well as
public resources to garner votes.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of a widespread ``cargada'' in favor of Labastida
have become a flash point in the PRI's Nov. 7 primary election.
Labastida, who was most recently Mexico's interior minister, and
another candidate, Roberto Madrazo, the former Tabasco state
governor, are locked in a close race that has them fighting for the
endorsement of PRI sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the PRI has dominated Mexican politics in large part
by mustering to the polls its vast network of PRI-affiliated
unions, neighborhoods, farmers and business associations. These are
groups that have long held the keys to jobs, contracts and simple
services like water, drainage, electricity and food subsidies in
this country where half the population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, candidates for all elections here have been
selected by party leaders without primaries. For the 70 years that
the PRI has controlled the presidency, the sitting president of the
republic has always
</P>
<P>
   picked the party's nominee in an autocratic process known
jokingly as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, however, the PRI is trying to break with that
tradition and construct a more democratic image by holding a
self-supervised primary. The balloting will be open to all Mexican
voters, but PRI loyalists are expected to be the majority of those
who turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has appeared fierce among four candidates,
particularly between Labastida and Madrazo, who have been running
close in opinion polls for most of the three-month campaign.
Madrazo's television ads and his rhetoric, especially, have been
unusually bold in their attacks on Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Mexican society thought this process was a show and
would end up with a designation as things used to be done. But as
days, weeks and months passed, people realized this was for real,''
PRI primary organizer Fernando Gutierrez Barrios told foreign
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary's democratic blush has been marred by the
perception that Labastida alone is benefiting from the PRI's
traditional well-oiled political machine. Indeed, at least one
state governor _ Roberto Albores of Chiapas _ has been verbally
reprimanded by the PRI for using his position to support Labastida
in his state, acknowledged Gutierrez Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, those complaining the loudest about Labastida's
alleged advantage are Madrazo and two other contenders, Manuel
Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva. Like Labastida, all are
party insiders who in the past have advanced in their careers with
the help of the same system they are now attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But others are also casting a jaundiced eye toward campaign
methods employed during the primary, which could be a dress
rehearsal for Mexico's July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is using the same tactics it always has,'' said
Rogelio Gomez, a national representative of Civic Alliance, an
independent organization monitoring election fraud and questionable
campaign activities here. ``There is a culture of doing politics in
Mexico where people with low incomes and little education give
their votes in exchange for government services that should just be
given to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, who is mounting a strong opposition campaign as the
presidential candidate for Mexico's National Action Party, or PAN,
said that ``only a blind person'' couldn't see that ``the
unconditional support of the whole state apparatus and the PRI's
party apparatus is behind Labastida.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Estudillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute for
Political Studies, said that many PRI affiliates, especially those
in very poor urban and rural areas, appear to still be locked into
the habit of waiting to be
</P>
<P>
   told for whom they should vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the principle dilemma of the PRI and of Mexico as both
try to make a transition to democracy,'' Estudillo said. ``The PRI
member is asking: Do I respond to that tradition of 70 years, which
may be serving me in some way, or do I dare to rebel? ``
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Labastida workers have reportedly been
observed handing out T-shirts, hats, shopping bags, free breakfasts
and free medical exams and legal advice at a greater pace than
Labastida's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a meeting with (Labastida) not long ago,'' recalled
Medina. ``They gave us our sandwich, a dessert and a banana. The
truth is it was fun. Our leader didn't really force us to go, but
she suggested we go to support him so he'll support us later.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as such services and gifts are not paid for by
government funds, their provision to would-be voters at campaign
rallies does not violate the PRI's internal primary rules or
Mexican law. Other parties hand
</P>
<P>
   out gifts, too, but the PRI is considered the king of such
practices after 70 years of power.
</P>
<P>
   What is strictly prohibited, however, is using public money,
services or the influence of government or high-ranking party
officials to buy votes. In the primary, the PRI has also required
that governors and other officials refrain from even expressing a
preference for a candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the party did not publicize it, Gutierrez Barrios
revealed this week that the PRI verbally sanctioned Gov. Roberto
Albores of Chiapas early in the campaign. But according to
newspaper reports here, some state congressmen in Chiapas accused
Albores of recently trying to force them into delivering votes for
Labastida. The accuracy of the charges is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has complained about other governors using their clout
on behalf of Labastida. The PRI is supposed to investigate the
complaints. So far, no other governors have been reprimanded. But
about a dozen lower-ranking PRI figures have been sanctioned for
using their positions to support certain candidates, not just
Labastida, Gutierrez Barrios said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, the mere fact that Labastida has many former
cabinet secretaries and other powerful PRI figures working in his
campaign is a sign that he has the stamp of approval of President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   And during a trip to Europe, newspapers here reported, a group
of the PRI representatives reportedly praised Labastida in a
meeting with German officials and spoke harshly about Madrazo,
characterizing him as a corrupt figure.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has tried to fight the notion that he is considered
the party elite's preferred candidate. His campaign touts his
experience as governor of Sinaloa state, agriculture minister and
interior secretary in Zedillo's cabinet. He also has the benefit of
some new polls showing that voters believe he is more honest and
more of a leader than Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   But the fuss inside the PRI over the alleged ``cargada'' has
dogged Labastida as well as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's three rivals recently implored Zedillo to speak out
against governors and other public officials taking sides during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Zedillo met with PRI functionaries and governors
last week, reiterating that he had no preferred candidate. He also
warned: ``In a democratic and open election . . . attempts at
manipulation, coercion or fraud will not only not work, they will
come back to hurt those who attempt to commit them.''
</P>
<P>
   But after decades of authoritarian politicking, the public
response to Zedillo was skeptical. The Mexican newspaper La Jornada
published a cartoon with Zedillo's finger telling him, ``You don't
have a favorite, but what about me?''

RESCUE EFFORT IN ULSTER BRINGS GAINS, NOT A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The rescue mission by George
Mitchell aimed at ending the stalemate that has stalled progress in
the Northern Ireland peace accord entered its final stages Saturday
with scant hope of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In eight weeks of talks, conducted in unusual secrecy and on
some occasions away from Belfast itself, Mitchell, the former U.S.
senator turned mediator, has developed a negotiating atmosphere in
which the feuding Ulster Unionist and Sinn Fein parties directly
addressed each other's concerns for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That is a considerable achievement in Ulster's bitterly
polarized politics and makes it likely that even if the current
salvage operation fails, the province will not return to the
systematic violence of the past. But it has not yet been enough to
break the impasse preventing the start-up of the new provincial
government planned in the peace accord signed by both sides in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute centers on the insistence of the Ulster Unionists,
the province's largest party, that the Irish Republican Army begin
disarming before its political representatives, Sinn Fein, can take
their seats on the 10-person executive that will run the new
Northern Ireland Assembly. That group will be, in effect, the
cabinet in the new administration that is supposed to take over
governing the province from London.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, who are largely Protestant, are so called because
they believe in keeping Ulster as part of the United Kingdom, while
republicans, most of whom are Catholics, want to see Northern
Ireland ultimately become part of the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The peace settlement was agreed to as a way of ending decades of
paramilitary violence between the Protestant majority and the
Catholic minority that has cost more than 3,300 lives. The
agreement, the cause of widespread euphoria at the time, created
shared political structures and demanded the disarming of guerrilla
groups by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It was approved by overwhelming margins in referendums held in
Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the 108 members of the new
legislature were elected more than a year ago. Based on that vote,
Sinn Fein gained the right to two of the 10 executive cabinet
positions.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, the mood in Ulster became more despairing
as the matter of when paramilitary groups would start disarming _
no date was set in the accord _ became first a concern and then an
insurmountable barrier to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein argues that the accord placed no disarmament condition
for entering government and that the IRA has proved its commitment
to peace by maintaining a cease-fire since 1997. The Ulster
Unionists say that the IRA commitment will become trustworthy only
with the surrender of weapons and that it would be unthinkable to
let a party into government while its paramilitary force stayed
fully armed.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15 the whole matter descended to chaos, then farce, when
the Ulster Unionists boycotted a raucous meeting of the assembly
held to name the members of the new executive. Unable to create a
cabinet with the required Protestant-Catholic mix, the legislature
had to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, the sponsors of the peace agreement, sent for
Mitchell, who had been the chairman of the original talks.
</P>
<P>
   An official who has participated in the recent weeks of talks
said that Mitchell was a ``master deal maker'' and was the only
person in public life in Northern Ireland who enjoyed the trust of
all sides. ``It also helps that he is an outsider,'' the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has spent part of each of the past eight weeks in
Northern Ireland, and he has gradually narrowed the focus of his
attention on the two parties of the eight who signed the agreement
_ Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists. He had been expected to end
his mission last weekend but extended it over signs that the frosty
relations between the long-feuding parties were thawing.
</P>
<P>
   Each party fears being identified as the one responsible for
holding up progress. There seems little doubt that their leaders
want to see the accord work but face internal demands not to
compromise. David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, is under
pressure from dissidents in his party to maintain the ``no guns, no
government'' position. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, says
he could not compel IRA disarmament even if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has hinted that he would be agreeable to creating the
crucial executive, or a shadow form of it, in advance of
disarmament, but only if Sinn Fein guaranteed that weapons
turnovers would occur shortly thereafter. Adams, while saying ``I
understand the difficulties, the challenges which this process
presents,'' was unable or unwilling to take the step that Trimble
sought.

   ATLANTIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI HEAT
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 33-17, eliminated in first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Pat Riley, 5th season with Heat, 191-105; 17th season
overall, 947-404.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Tim James (25th), Rodney Buford (53rd);
free agents _ Anthony Carter, Harold Jamison, Otis Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Terry Porter (Spurs), Terry Mills (Detroit)
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Keith Askins, P.J. Brown, Duane Causwell, Tim Hardaway,
Voshon Lenard, Dan Majerle, Jamal Mashburn, Alonzo Mourning, Mark
Strickland, Clarence Weatherspoon, Rex Walters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Riley said he kept the Heat intact because he likes
his players. The truth, however, is that he was unable to get the
shooting guard he needs because he refused to part with talent.
Playoffs will tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK KNICKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 27-23, eliminated in NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jeff Van Gundy, 5th season, 140-97.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Free agents _ Andrew Lang and John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Herb Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Rick Brunson, Marcus Camby, Chris Childs, Chris Dudley,
Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson, Latrell Sprewell, Kurt
Thomas, Charlie Ward, Herb Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Ewing's absence with Achilles woes is open-ended. The
big question is how the quick-striking Knicks adjust to him when he
returns. This team is not a major contender if it can't develop a
useful center.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY NETS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 16-34, missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Don Casey, 1st full season with Nets; 13-17 in 1998-99;
3rd season overall, 54-102.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Evan Eschmeyer (34th); trade _ Johnny
Newman; free agent _ Sherman Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Rony Seikaly, Eric Murdock (L.A. Clippers), Doug Overton
(Philadelphia).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Scott Burrell, Jamie Feick, Kendall Gill, Lucious
Harris, Kerry Kittles, Stephon Marbury, Jim McIlvaine, Eric
Murdock, Gheorghe Muresan, Elliot Perry, Keith Van Horn, Jayson
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Williams is out until January, and Kittles is slow in
his recovery from minor knee surgery. Still, the Nets are strong up
front and have firepower in Marbury and Gill. With good health,
they could get back to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA 76ers
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 28-22, eliminated in second round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Larry Brown, 3rd season with Sixers, 58-74; 16th season
overall, 682-554.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Todd MacCulloch (47th); trade _ Jumaine
Jones, Billy Owens; free agent _ Bruce Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Harvey Grant (Orlando), Anthony Parker (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Matt Geiger, Tyrone Hill, Larry Hughes, Allen Iverson,
Aaron McKie, Nazr Mohammed, Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, George Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: A dearth of perimeter shooting will slow the 76ers'
progress. With center Theo Ratliff sidelined early with an injury,
the Sixers might not be able to win 56 percent of their games again
this season.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON CELTICS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 19-31, missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Rick Pitino, 3rd year with Celtics, 55-77; 5th season
overall, 145-151.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trades -- Danny Fortson (Denver), Eric Washington
(Denver), Eric Williams (Denver); free agents -- Calbert Cheaney,
Adrian Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Popeye Jones (Denver), Ron Mercer (Denver), Dwayne
Schintzius (Denver).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Kenny Anderson, Dana Barros, Tony Battie, Pervis
Ellison, Walter McCarty, Greg Minor, Vitaly Potapenko, Antoine
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: This is a deeper and more mobile Celtics team than
the one that disappointed last season. But unless Potapenko is much
improved, it's tough to see Boston as more than a fringe playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON WIZARDS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 18-32, missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Gar Heard 1st year, 0-0; 2nd year overall, 7-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft -- Richard Hamilton (7th), Calvin Booth
(35th); trade -- Ike Austin; free agent -- Aaron Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Calbert Cheaney (Boston), Otis Thorpe (Miami), Terry
Davis (Orlando), Tim Legler.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Juwan Howard, Randell Jackson, Tracy Murray, Mitch
Richmond, Rod Strickland, Otis Thorpe, Jahidi White, Chris Whitney,
Lorenzo Williams
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Some nice additions -- Hamilton, Austin and Aaron
Williams -- will make the Wizards respectable. But Strickland and
Richmond are coming off uneven seasons. This team improves only if
they play very well.
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 33-17, eliminated in first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers, 1st season with Magic; 1st
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trade -- Tariq Abdul-Wahad, Louis Bullock, Terry
Davis, Pat Garrity, Chris Gatling, Armen Gilliam, Corey Maggette,
Anthony Parker; free agent -- Monty Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: B.J. Armstrong (Chicago), Nick Anderson (Sacramento),
Ike Austin (Washington), Horace Grant (Seattle), Penny Hardaway
(Phoenix),
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Darrell Armstrong, Michael Doleac, Matt Harpring,
Charles Outlaw, Derek Strong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Magic ripped its team apart to create maximum cap
room, and they're headed for the lottery, while eating a number of
contracts. Will that strategy attract a Tim Duncan or a Grant Hill?
Stay tuned.

 &HT;    New team, another shot
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Hawks already are a step ahead with Jim Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It's three months since he joined his fifth team in 2 1/2 years
and the Hawks haven't promised Jackson anything. That means they
haven't lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we told Jim is what we tell all our players, that we're
committed to improving our team,'' general manager Pete Babcock
related. ``We told all of them: If we can markedly improve our team
or our future by trading you, we'll do it. That's the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson understands, but entering the second year of a
three-year contract worth almost $2 million, he knows there is
opportunity here as there was in Portland last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard to earn a position, to show this team
some of the things I'm capable of doing once I get comfortable with
the system,'' he said Thursday before the Hawks staged a scrimmage
for season ticket holders in Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson has shown something. He was the team's
second-leading scorer in the exhibition season at 13.3 points per
game, shooting .469 from the field, .864 from the line, starting as
a shooting guard, playing a little point and a little more small
forward, too.
</P>
<P>
   A weapon coach Lenny Wilkens uncovered during two-a-days proved
very effective in two Hawks victories, as Wilkens teamed Jackson
and Isaiah Rider with point guard Bimbo Coles to set up scoring
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says it's a natural counter to teams that feature
high-octane offensive sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at New York with Chris Childs or Charlie Ward with
Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell in the backcourt. Similar
situation going on in Toronto with Vince Carter and Doug Christie.
In Charlotte with Eddie Jones and Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's conducive. I don't think there's a lot big three
men (small forwards) around. You've got a lot of swing players,
6-foot-5, 6-6, so it's something that really helps us in so far as
getting up and down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a natural foil for Sprewell, who almost
single-handedly destroyed the Hawks in the playoffs. Jackson
shoots, passes, rebounds, goes to the hoop. He lacks Sprewell's
startling explosiveness, but he ranks much higher on the
reliability scale and he is regaining the spontaneity that allowed
him to play the point earlier in his career and made him such a
dangerous backcourt partner for Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit down at night and think about the last three years where
I really haven't been able to grow as a player because I've been
limited to certain things. ... It takes some time to get back to
playing the kind of basketball I know how to play. But Lenny's
giving me that confidence where if you're on the court and you have
a shot, you take it or you set it up. He's puts me in situations
were I can be successful and I can only grow from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a good fit with his new coach. ``He's interesting in
that he allows you to be as professional as you should be. To come
out here and work hard and do the things that you can. You have the
freedom to go out on the court and play the kind of game you are
capable of playing. For a guy like me who hasn't had that freedom
it's a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jackson simply wants to fit in and he hopes the Hawks like
what he gives them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look around. Watching ESPN the other night I saw something
on Marshall Faulk. He had a great year in Indianapolis and he was
told he wasn't needed. He went out and played every game and did
what the organization asked and now they wanted a change. Well that
affects you. You give your sweat, your blood, your tears for an
organization where you think they have your back and they want to
help you out, that takes something away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes something away from the game because you've given of
yourself. I wanted to win and I felt that was a good situation (in
Portland), long-term for me, and I put my trust where I try not to
and it showed me what kind of business this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he goes again.

   Phil Jackson's indoctrination to Los Angeles came a few months
after he accepted the task of elevating the underachieving Lakers.
It came early one Saturday morning, totally unexpected, like an
epiphany. Only it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   As the coach rested in his bed, things around the room started
to move and bang together. No, it was not Shaquille O'Neal rumbling
down the hallway, but an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make Jackson wonder what he was doing in plush
Playa del Rey in Southern California instead of his home in the
picturesque mountains of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like this,'' Jackson said, extending his arms,
``grabbing my bed frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, including Jackson, survived the quake. But he learned
quickly that there would be more uneasy times in Los Angeles before
the good times become routine. The team he inherited from Kurt
Rambis, who took over from Del Harris, has talent. But it is
deficient in areas of the game on which Jackson is unshakable:
cohesion, discipline, unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
   So, the coach of the six-time champion Chicago Bulls, who quit
after the final title run in 1998, is rebuilding the Lakers from
within. Deep within _ their psyches.
</P>
<P>
   He nixed in an instant the notion of the Lakers acquiring the
New York Knicks' Latrell Sprewell. ``Latrell hasn't really wanted
to fit in anywhere,'' Jackson said. ``One of the things we try to
do is have people who want to be part of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Lakers seem to welcome a part in Jackson's grand
plan. The star players _ O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice _ have had
individual success of varying degrees. But their teams have
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   A residual of coaching Michael Jordan and winning a half-dozen
titles is that Jackson commanded respect when he first walked into
the locker room _ even with the Lakers, who failed to honor Harris
and essentially ignored Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   That's not happening now. O'Neal showed the respect he has for
Jackson last summer, when he was in Montana for a charity event.
Across the lake, Shaq was told, was Jackson's home. The 7-foot,
330-pound O'Neal climbed in a boat and sailed across to meet his
new coach. Jackson's wife, June, was home alone. He and June went
karaoke singing. The duet sang ``Red, Red Wine,'' ``Purple Rain''
and ``I Believe I can Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, O'Neal returned to Jackson's home, and the
coach was there. O'Neal stayed just 10 minutes, but Jackson used
that time to let his all-star center know he expected him to become
a leader and a consistent force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same thing my father tells me,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jacksonare on the correct path. Here's O'Neal: ``Before
you succeed, you must learn to fail. For me, it has been seven
years of failing. It hasn't been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is playing under Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're at a military school, and you heard about
this certain military guy,'' O'Neal said. ``There's a certain
respect when you come in. Last year or the year before, we had guys
talking and (messing) around. But with Phil, everybody knows his
resume and knows who he is. A couple of the guys had trouble with
the drills, including me. It's like basic training.''
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Jackson's scheme is the triangle offense, an
approach that emphasizes teamwork. The Bulls mastered it in
Chicago, and one of the stabilizers for the Bulls was guard Ron
Harper, whom the Lakers signed to a two-year contract near the end
of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson believes Harper's expertise and experience will go a
significant way toward the Lakers' jelling. Harper can be a
positive influence on Bryant, the immensely skilled guard whose
major shortcoming has been playing within the framework of a team.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who did not seem comfortable in the triangle offense
during practice before breaking a bone in his hand, and O'Neal did
not always get along last year. Bryant's penchant for one-on-one
play bothered O'Neal. But the two have been on the mend. Bryant
invited O'Neal to his birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teamwork is the key,'' O'Neal said. ``If there was a way for
one person to do everything by himself, I would've had five rings
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers need Bryant to provide scoring and for Rice to hit
from the perimeter. They also need to find a reliable power forward
and for the other pieces to fit snugly. But if they are to reach
the apex of Jackson's expectations, O'Neal has to be the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a prediction regarding him,'' Lakers
executive vice president Jerry West said. ``I think he's going to
be the Most Valuable Player in the league this year. I see a
tremendous enthusiasm on his part. He's as happy as I've seen him
since he has been in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have to believe an awful lot of that is that he believes
in what his coach is trying to do, and more importantly, he feels
that this system will allow him to reach his goal _ and that's to
win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Jackson's offense must be assimilated. Precision is a
necessity. ``Eventually,'' Bryant said, ``the offense will come to
the point where it's not a matter of reading one another; it's a
matter of all of us reading the defense. It's not that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``You have to find a way to figure out your own
game in it. If you're a good player and a professional, you'll be
able to do that. This is not that difficult to do. I make people
adjust to what we're doing rather than adjusting my system to who
they are. Right now, I'm just in the process of trying to bend
their will to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal will be the axis. ``Now you have a dominant-sized person
in the post where you can always throw the ball,'' Jackson said.
``We used to manipulate to get Michael to the post by taking our
post guy out and bringing Michael in to give him open spaces to
work in the post. Now it's simply, get the big guy down the court,
get the ball inside and give him operating space to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ball, O'Neal has to determinewhen to score, when to
pass. And it's not like he's been heralded as a great assist man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to drop it off to my guys for assists, I don't mind
doing that,'' O'Neal insisted. ``Because in this lifetime, in this
sport, it's all about winning. When you're winning, nothing else
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Lakers develop will be worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be very interesting,'' Harper said. ``One thing I know
is that we have the coach to get us there. We'll have to see how
these kids respond.''

 &HT;    New rule against hand, body checks tilts balance for offenses
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be unmistakable change in the East. Change in the
power structure, change in the way teams are put together and
change in the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   The old Neanderthal style has been legislated out of existence.
Thugs will no longer rule the paint. Speed and quickness and daring
will be rewarded in the new NBA, and change will be more keenly
felt in the East where the likes of Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn and
Charles Oakley once ruled through sheer intimidation and a modicum
of athletic skill.
</P>
<P>
   The league decided in June that the paying customers had had
enough and that a game that penalized skill and rewarded loutish
behavior would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The results are palpable. Coach Rick Pitino was right two years
ago when he brought a trapping, running game to Boston. Pitino
lacked the players and his system went too far, but his instincts
to speed up the game were right on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks accomplished in the playoffs, making it to the
Finals with the athletic Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus
Camby, only put the concept of speed ball over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 1/2 months after being routed by New York, the Hawks have
seven new players and junked their stilted halfcourt offense by
ejecting guards Mookie Blaylock and Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   At Detroit, they are so committed to the fast break they brought
in an assistant coach, Mo McHone, to teach it. A face from the
1980s, McHone honed his philosophy in San Antonio at the end of an
era during which Doug Moe and Stan Albeck coached a jack rabbit
running game.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando junked three-fourths of its team. Cleveland dumped coach
Mike Fratello and his chess board attack. Milwaukee will run
without a true center as anchor. The New Jersey Nets will latch on
to Stephon Marbury's flying sneakers. And we all have seen the
havoc Allen Iverson can wreak in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The rules now are about players like Iverson, their great speed
and enormous athletic skills and about something called Personal
Foul Rule 12, Section B.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it says: ``A player shall not hold, push, charge
into, or impede the progress of an opponent by extending a hand,
forearm, leg or knee or by bending the body into a position that is
not normal.... Contact that results in the re-routing of an
opponent is a foul which must be called immediately. Contact
initited by the defensive player guarding a player with the ball
is not legal. This contact includes, but is not limited to,
forearm, hands, or body check.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: You can't ride an opposing player off a pick or
push him away. You can prevent an opponent from setting a pick. You
can't bump an opponent if he's going through the lane. Hands off.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to read Rule 12 again because the few sentences
have changed the way basketball is played in the East, reformatting
the game to the Western style best implemented by the ``Showtime''
Lakers, Cotton Fitzsimmons' old Phoenix Suns and Moe's old Denver
Nuggets. They would play defense, but they wouldn't have to knock
you down to do it. And once they had the ball, they would run so
fast that shoes would smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetics of the new game appeals to Charlotte coach Paul
Silas. ``I like it very much,'' he said. ``For too long, coaches
have tried harder to stop their opponents from scoring than scoring
themselves, and that philosophy needed to change. What bothers me
is this: If you can't touch him, how can you stop Allen Iverson?''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Pitino asks, ``If you're guarding Stephon Marbury in the
open court, how are you going to stop him if you can't put your
hands on him?''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you penalize talent and quickness?'' Hawks general
manger Pete Babcock said. ``Those are qualities that should be
rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino says there is no question the advantage has shifted to
offense. ``Every coach, in their minds, thinks the new rules are
going to change the game, and what you have to do is speed it up to
take advantage. Everybody is playing racehorse basketball to get
them in the open court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to stop (scorers) is to play five on three, three on
one, but still, the heavy, heavy advantage is open-court offense.
If you're guarding Brevin Knight and you can't put your hand on
him, how do you stop him? You have to stop him with multiple
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo of the Hawks says you stop people ``by using
your feet, by making your rotations and getting help. If you're not
going to move your feet, you aren't going to stop anybody because
you can't put your hands on them. That's what coach (Lenny Wilkens)
has been preaching to us. That's what we worked on in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   But change has been painful throughout the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is getting used to no hands on defense,'' Silas
said. ``It's kind of unnatural. They're used to using the forearm,
the hand-checking, for so long.'' He said he will help his players
deal with it, that after watching film from the '70s he is
``appalled'' by the brutality he saw in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the brave, new world of the NBA.

 &HT;    Rider: `I never harm anyone'
 &HT;    'By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Isaiah ``J.R.'' Rider wants something from this town.
He wants a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't judge me until you know me, Rider says. Don't make
assumptions about me.
</P>
<P>
   Rider admits he's no angel. Trouble follows him as surely as
rain follows heavy clouds, only in Rider's case it's an annoying
drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   He has a record of misdemeanors, not felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not now, nor have I ever been, a gang-banger. I've never
committed a serious crime. I've never hurt anyone with the mistakes
I've made. The harm is self-inflicted,'' he said. ``There are
players in our league who have done more than I have, got caught
with a lot more than a half a joint of marijuana, so...
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I've made my mistakes. I would like to judge me on what
I do now.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Rider wants you to know he's never done heavy drugs, never
been arrested or DUI. He doesn't hang out in the clubs. ``I don't
have children all over the country. I'm single and I don't have
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants you to know that at 28 he is a bright young man, that
he has an intellectual curiosity. He grew up poor in Oakland and he
climbed out of poverty alongside his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is successful,'' he said. ``I have two brothers and
three sisters who are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Michelle, has a master's in economics from
Northwestern. She is in marketing with Coca-Cola and does some work
for Rider. A brother, Lamond, has a college degree. Another
brother, David, played football a year for the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Rider wants you to know he's a regular guy. ``I never turned my
back on my friends when I became successful. Is that bad? I don't
hide in a mansion up in the hills. Is that bad? I got into some
stuff young guys get into, OK. I made mistakes young guys make. I
admit that. But I feel I've grown from that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He still has a problem with punctuality, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm late a lot, but it's something I'm working on. But I never
harm anyone else. People need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Better still, Rider does good for people. If you don't know
that, it's because he has never made much of an effort to tell the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought the media cared about what I do in that
regard,'' he said. ``I never wanted it out because when I do
something it's not for the attention. It's not so people will like
me or so I can get a big basketball contract. I've got money and if
I want to spend some of it helping people, that's between me and
them. I do it because it makes me feel good. I do it from my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Rider has entered in partnership with Oakland Mayor
Jerry Brown to build and equip two recreation centers so
poverty-level youth have some place to go. He said he will coax
Portland Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft,
to donate computers for his rec centers. ``We want to set up
after-school programs, places to study.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing in Portland, Rider bought a bus and used it to
transport 30 kids to every Blazers home game, where they used
tickets he paid for. He worked out a deal with a local McDonald's
and a Mexican restaurant to feed them. Now that he's in Atlanta,
Rider said he and the Hawks are going into partnership, supplying
25 tickets each game to kids, and he hopes to have his bus shipped
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going in with the Boys (&AMP; Girls) Club or any other
organization. I want to pick the kids myself,'' he said. ``I want
to bring some happiness to poor kids, kids who have holes in their
jeans and holes in their shoes. White kids, black kids. Doesn't
matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he became unofficial big brother to young
Sheena McCullum, who had lost her mother. He helped her become a
Blazers ball girl. With pride, he notes, ``She's 16 and class
president and a good basketball player. Financially, when she needs
something, I look out for her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, balance this with the Rider who can't show up on time, who
has a record for skirmishes, and decide how the scales weigh out.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates admire Rider
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Rider teammate, or an ex-teammate, you give him more
than the benefit of doubt. You give him admiration for his skills,
loyalty for his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been knowing J.R. since we were in high school, from Nike
camp,'' former and current teammate Jim Jackson says. ``It's sad
that his mistakes are what everybody talks about because he's a
good person, bright and funny and a great player. If he's on your
team, you've got to admire him.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics guard Kenny Anderson, who playedtwo seasons with Rider,
describes him as ``a guy who really gets it done. He commands a
double team and he's a really good passer. He was great to play
with because of that. He's the ultimate `two' guard in this league,
as far as I'm concerned. He doesn't have anything to prove. He's
already up there with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond of the Wizards was a Rookie of the Year guard
with Golden State when he befriended Rider, then a high school
senior ineligible to play ball because he lost interest in his
studies. Richmond had been a star at Kansas State and he knew his
school was recruiting Rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out he was in Oakland so I tracked him down,''
Richmond said. ``We hit it off. I used to take him to a bunch of
scrimmages some of the Warriors and guys out in Oakland would have
in the summertime. He was up against some good players, guys like
Sarunas Marciulionis, and he held his own.''
</P>
<P>
   His senior year in high school, Rider loved being recruited. ``I
enjoyed it so much I stopped paying attention to classes,'' he
said. ``That's why I couldn't go right to K-State. I had to go to
junior college.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year in Kansas, averaged 31 points at Allen Community
College, and realized he didn't really want to be in the nation's
heartland, far from his friends and family. He transferred to
Antelope Community College in Southern California, averaged 33.6,
and went on to Nevada-Las Vegas. As a senior, he averaged 29.1.
Minnesota grabbed him with the fifth pick of the 1993 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't ready for me,'' Rider said. Nor was he ready for
them. The stormy relationship ran three years. The team was losing
and Rider was wandering into trouble off the court while playing
well for a terrible team. The Wolves swapped him to Portland. ``I
don't have to put up with this'' anymore, said an exasperated Kevin
McHale, the Wolves' general manager, after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rider's record of off-court contretemps continued, but this time
he was part of a winning organization and last season the Blazers
went to the Western Conference finals before San Antonio demolished
them in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Success triggered Rider's best instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was a guy who needed to be with a winner,'' he
said. ``Scoring 25 points a game didn't matter to me. I didn't need
that. I needed winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Loved playing in Portland
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noted the change. ``We both realized that if we
sacrificed, we would be successful,'' he said. ``When that happens,
you learn a lot. You learn how to carry yourself and how to be
professional and how to win basketball games. Deep down inside,
J.R. realized that was his ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider wanted so much to remain in Portland that he refused to
exercise his option for free agency, accepting the seventh year of
his contract at $5.4 million. The Blazers seized on that chance to
move him at minimal risk to the buyer, and Rider and Jackson became
Hawks in exchange for Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The trade weighed heavily on Rider. He says he was two days late
coming to training camp because of his doubts about the Hawks,
their commitment to winning and their ability to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of that. I had sacrificed my game to win in
Portland,'' he said. ``I had become part of a winning team and,
look, I know all about how this is a business. But for me it got
very personal. And now, I wasn't part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He still isn't sure this will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we have enough scorers to go with me and J.J.
I know don't know if Coach (Lenny Wilkens) is willing to play us
together like I want him to because that's our best team. So,
there's a lot we have to find out about, see how it works. But,
yeah, I feel a lot better about it than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And he looks forward to the challenge of being in the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing against (Latrell) Sprewell. I've had some of my
biggest games against him. And against Mitch because he's my
mentor. He's a friend of mine. Allan Houston, Vince Carter coming
into his own, Reggie Miller. I want to show the East Coast what a
West Coast guy has.''

Kemp diet? Can Wittman coach? If those and other questions are
answered in the affirmative, the Cavs have a chance to be the
surprise of the East.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA HAWKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 31-19, eliminated in second round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Lenny Wilkens, seventh season with Hawks, 282-178; 27th
season overall, 1,151-927.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft -- Jason Terry (10th), Cal Bowdler (17th),
Dion Glover (20th); trade -- Bimbo Coles, Jim Jackson, Isaiah
Rider, Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Tyrone Corbin (Sacramento), Grant Long (Vancouver),
Mookie Blaylock (Golden St.), Ed Gray (Portland), Steve Smith
(Portland).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Chris Crawford LaPhonso Ellis, Alan Henderson, Anthony
Johnson, Roshown McLeod, Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Unsettled at the point, unable to sustain a
half-court offense in the preseason, the Hawks could struggle early
and then come on with a rush in the second half of the season -- if
they come on at all.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 28-22, eliminated in first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: George Karl, 2nd season with Bucks, 28-22; 13th season
overall, 531-348.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trade -- Dale Ellis, Danny Manning; free agent --
Darvin Ham, J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Dell Curry (Toronto), Michael Curry (Detroit), Chris
Gatling (Orlando), Armen Gilliam (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Vinny Del Negro, Ervin Johnson,
Glenn Robinson, Tim Thomas, Robert Traylor, Scott Williams,
Haywoode Workman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Bucks remain very soft in the middle. Typical of
a George Karl team, they have perimeter offense and a knack for
running, but they have to be tougher inside defensively. Still a
fringe playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO RAPTORS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 23-27, missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Butch Carter, second full season with Raptors, 28-55.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft -- Alek Radojevic (12th); trade -- Antonio
Davis; free agent -- Dell Curry, Muggsy Bogues
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Paul Rogers, Micheal Williams, John Wallace (New York)
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Dee Brown, Vince Carter, Doug Christie, Sean Marks,
Tracy McGrady, Charles Oakley, Michael Stewart, John Thomas, Alvin
Williams, Kevin Willis
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Raptors aren't going to take a great leap without
a very good guard. Unless Radojevic is ready, the depth at power
forward -- Willis, Oakley, Stewart, Davis -- will spill into the
middle. A real playoff chance, however.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT PISTONS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 29-21, eliminated in first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Alvin Gentry, 2nd full season with Pistons, 45-42; 4th
season overall, 60-63.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: free agents -- Michael Curry, Terry Mills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Bison Dele, Joe Dumars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Jud Buechler, Bison Dele, Grant Hill, Lindsey Hunter,
Christian Laettner, Eric Montross, Don Reid, Jerry Stackhouse, Loy
Vaught, Jerome Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Two starters retired, and the Pistons are learning
how to run. It's hard to see them as much better than last season's
No. 5 finish in the East. The forwards can rebound, but can the
guards shoot?
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO BULLS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 13-37, missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tim Floyd, 2nd season with Bulls, 13-37; 2nd season
overall, 13-37.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft -- Elton Brand (1st), Ron Artest (16th),
Michael Ruffin (32nd), Lari Ketner (49th); trade -- James Cotton,
Hersey Hawkins, Chris Anstey; free agent -- B.J. Armstrong, Fred
Hoiberg, Will Perdue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Ron Harper, Keith Booth, Mark Bryant (Cleveland), Bill
Wennington (Sacramento), Brent Barry (Seattle), Andrew Lang (New
York).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Corey Benjamin, Randy Brown, Kornel David, Toni Kukoc,
Rusty LaRue, Dickey Simpkins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Bulls have gone to ruin, and the fans, locked in
on season tickets and suites, are growing restless. Bringing back
Armstrong and Perdue won't make a significant difference in the
standings.

 &HT;    NBA CAPSULES
 &HT;    MIDWEST DIVISION
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO SPURS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 37-13, won NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Gregg Popovich, fourth year with the Spurs, 110-86.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Free agents _ Terry Porter, Samaki Walker, Felton
Spencer, Chucky Brown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Will Perdue (Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Antonio Daniels, Tim Duncan, Mario Elie, Sean Elliott,
Jaren Jackson, Avery Johnson, Steve Kerr, Jerome Kersey, David
Robinson, Malik Rose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Duncan was so good as the Spurs won their first title
that they were able to disguise a very ordinary backcourt. Porter
helps a little, but it will take another magnificent year from
Duncan to get close to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 37-13, eliminated in second round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jerry Sloan, 12th year with the Jazz, 582-271, 15th
year overall, 676-392.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Quincy Lewis (19th), Scott Padgett (28th);
free agents _ Olden Polynice, Pete Chilcutt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Shandon Anderson (Houston), Greg Foster (Seattle), Todd
Fuller (Charlotte).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Howard Eisley, Adam Keefe, Karl Malone, Jeff Hornacek,
John Stockton, Greg Ostertag, Bryon Russell, Jacque Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The bell may have tolled for this bunch, but they
will make one more magnificent run at it. However, this is probably
the end for the Jazz. Rebuilding will be a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON ROCKETS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 31-19, eliminated in first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Rudy Tomjanovich, ninth year with the Rockets, 353-219.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Kenny Thomas (22nd); trade _ Steve Francis,
Don MacLean, Tony Massenberg, Carlos Rogers, Walt Williams, Kelvin
Cato; free agent _ Shandon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Scottie Pippin (Portland), Antoine Carr (Vancouver),
Michael Dickerson (Vancouver), Othella Harrington (Vancouver),
Brent Price (Vancouver), Sam Mack, Pig Miller.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Charles Barkley, Matt Bullard, Bryce Drew, Eddie
Johnson, Matt Maloney, Cuttino Mobley, Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: This latest reincarnation of the Rockets presents yet
another last chance for Barkley to get a title. They're going to
join the new NBA roadrunner club. Anderson, Francis, Williams and
Cato will help.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 25-25, eliminated in first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Flip Sanders, fifth year with the Timberwolves,
130-146.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Wally Szczerbiak (6th), William Avery
(14th).
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Dennis Scott (Vancouver), James Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Terrell Brandon, Kevin Garnett, Dean Garrett, Tom
Hammonds, Bobby Jackson, Sam Mitchell, Radoslav Nesterovic, Andrae
Patterson, Anthony Peeler, Malik Sealy, Joe Smith.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Wolves can't advance unless they get stronger in
the middle, and center Dean Garrett will miss part of the season
with injury. Szcerbiak and Avery make this a very deep team on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER NUGGETS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 14-36, missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dan Issel, fourth year with the Nuggets, 96-102.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ James Posey (18th), Chris Herren (33rd);
trade _ Popeye Jones, Ron Mercer, Dwayne Schintzius; free agents _
George McCloud.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Trade, Danny Fortson (Boston), Eric Washington (Boston),
Eric Williams (Boston).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Cory Alexander, Chauncey Billups, Keon Clark, Raef
LaFrentz, Antonio McDyess, Bryant Stith, Johnny Taylor, Nick Van
Exel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: This is an interesting team, as Issel retakes the
coaching reins. With Mercer joining Van Exel, the Nuggets have
undeniable fire power. If they can keep a steady course, they'll
challenge for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER GRIZZLIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-42, missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Brian Hill, third year with the Grizzlies, 27-105;
seventh year overall, 218-209.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Obinna Ekezie (37th); trade _ Antoine Carr,
Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Brent Price; free agents _
Grant Long, Dennis Scott, Robert Werdann.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Steve Francis (Houston), Tony Massenburg (Houston), Lee
Mayberry (Orlando), Makhtar Ndiaye (Orlando), Rodrick Rhodes
(Orlando), Michael Smith (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Mike Bibby, Felipe Lopez, Cherokee
Parks, Bryant Reeves, Doug West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: They have improved, but not enough to make a
significant difference in their standing in the West.
Realistically, the Grizzlies will meet you in St. Louis long before
you see them in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS MAVERICKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 19-31, missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Don Nelson, third season with Mavericks, 35-81; 22nd
season overall, 886-710.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trade _ Leon Smith, Sean Rooks; free agents _ Greg
Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Samaki Walker (San Antonio), A.C. Green (Los Angeles),
Chris Anstey (Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Shawn Bradley, Cedric Ceballos, Hubert Davis, Michael
Finley, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Robert Pack, Erick Strickland,
Bruno Sundov, Gary Trent, John Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: In his final year as coach, Nelson wants them quick
and lean. Sounds good, but the Mavericks have a very weak front
line, and it will prevent them from winning more than 40 percent of
their games.

   PACIFIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES LAKERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 31-19, eliminated in second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Phil Jackson, first season with the Lakers, 545-193
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Devean George (23rd), John Celestand
(30th); trade _ A.C. Green; free agents _ Ron Harper, John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Ruben Patterson (Seattle), J.R. Reid (Milwaukee), Sean
Rooks (Dallas), Derek Harper (Detroit).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Sam
Jacobson, Travis Knight, Tyronn Lue, Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Can they figure out the triple-post offense? Will it
work without Michael Jordan? Stay tuned. There's enough talent here
to win the whole thing, with savvy Jackson goading O'Neal to have
his finest season.
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 35-15, eliminated in third round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Mike Dunleavy, third year with the Blazers, 81-51;
eighth year overall, 289-345.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trade _ Roberto Bergersen, Scottie Pippen, Steve
Smith; free agents _ Joe Kleine, Detlef Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Jim Jackson (Atlanta), Isaiah Rider (Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Greg Anthony, Brian Grant, Gary Grant, Jermaine O'Neal,
Arvydas Sabonis, Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, Bonzi Wells,
Stacey Augmon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: If it looks too good to be true: Smith's knees,
Pippen's refusal to step up without M.J. and the problems of
keeping so many talented guys happy are real obstacles as the
Blazers try to make it to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO KINGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 27-23, eliminated in first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Rick Adelman, second season with the Kings, 27-23; 10th
year overall, 384-275.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Ryan Robertson (45th); trade _ Nick
Anderson; free agents _ Tyrone Corbin, Tony Delk, Darrick Martin,
Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Vernon Maxwell (Seattle), Oliver Miller (Phoenix), Tariq
Abdul-Wahad (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Jon Barry, Vlade Divac, Lawrence Funderburke, Scot
Pollard, Predrag Stojakovic, Chris Webber, Jason Williams; Corliss
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Kings are the new darlings of the NBA. TNT and
NBC love exciting young point guard Williams. Adelman expertly
guided them to a rare playoff berth. The hard part is doing it
again and improving.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX SUNS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 27-23, eliminated in first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Danny Ainge, third season as coach of the Suns, 122-83.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Shawn Marion, (9th) overall); trade _
Anfernee Hardaway; free agents _ Oliver Miller, Rodney Rogers,
Corie Blount.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Pat Garrity (Orlando), Danny Manning (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Toby Bailey, Gerald Brown, Rex Chapman, Tom Gugliotta,
Jason Kidd, Randy Livingston, Luc Longley, Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Suns traditionally are soft in the middle and
that always limits their chances. This is a team that can score,
but Penny Hardaway's fading skills and unwillingness to take over
will tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 21-29, missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: P.J. Carlesimo, third season with the Warriors, 40-92;
sixth season overall, 177-201.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Tim Young (56th); trade _ Mookie Blaylock,
Vonteego Cummings; free agent _ Tim Legler.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Tony Delk (Sacramento), Muggsy Bogues (Toronto), Felton
Spencer (San Antonio); Bimbo Coles (Atlanta), Duane Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Jason Caffey, Terry Cummings, Erick Dampier, Adonal
Foyle, Antawn Jamison, Donyell Marshall, Chris Mills, John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Warriors figure they can run now that they have
Blaylock at the point. It is a serious miscalculation for a team
that is on the fringe of the playoff hunt. It could cost Carlesimo
his job.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE SUPERSONICS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 25-25, did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Paul Westphal, second season with the Sonics, 25-25;
sixth season overall, 216-113.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Trade _ Horace Grant, Brent Barry; free agents _
Emanual Davis, Greg Foster, Vernon Maxwell, Ruben Patterson, Fred
Vinson, Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Drew Barry, John Crotty, Olden Polynice (Utah), Detlef
Schrempf (Portland), Aaron Williams (Washington), James Cotton
(Chicago), Hersey Hawkins (Chicago), Don MacLean (Orlando), Dale
Ellis (Orlando), Billy Owens (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Vin Baker, Rashard Lewis, Jelani McCoy, Gary Payton,
Vladimir Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Sonics virtually turned over the roster, but
could not move Payton, whose poor practice habits damage morale.
Somehow, they managed to make over this team and remain on the
playoff fringe. Time's up.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 9-41, missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Chris Ford, second season with the Clippers, 9-41;
ninth year overall, 300-324.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newcomers: Draft _ Lamar Odom (4th); trade _ Derek Anderson,
Eric Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone: Stojko Vrankovic, Pooh Richardson (Detroit), Darrick
Martin (Sacramento), Rodney Rogers (Phoenix), Johnny Newman (New
Jersey Nets), Sherman Douglas (Nets), Lamond Murray (Cleveland),
Lorenzen Wright (Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   _ Back: Keith Closs, Troy Hudson, Tyrone Nesby, Michael
Olowokandi, Eric Piatkowski, Brian Skinner, Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Accept this basic fact: Owner Don Sterling doesn't
care about winning. That's why eight players left his team over the
summer and why Taylor will depart as soon as this season ends. This
team is doomed.

ANALYSIS: AFTER A GALLOP, MIDEAST LEADERS FEAR THE TALKS HAVE
STALLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak steamrolled into office
with grand plans of forging a permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement by next September. Stopwatches were set at the blow of
his whistle. And then, after an uplifting summit meeting early this
fall, almost two months yawned by without a single official
negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   For a peace effort interrupted so many times by spasms of
violence, a little lull might not seem cause for concern. So much
is happening so quickly on the ground: Israel's transfer of land,
release of prisoners and opening of a safe-passage route between
the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, U.S. officials, and even
some Israelis have begun worrying that peacemaking momentum is
slowing from a gallop to a saunter. Barak's ambitious aspiration to
reach a framework agreement for a final status by February _
resolving huge discrepancies on sensitive issues ranging from
settlements to Jerusalem _ may soon appear foolhardy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, even though Barak's Jerusalem office and Arafat's
Ramallah office lie 10 miles apart, the two Middle East leaders are
jetting off to Oslo to meet President Clinton for a chat by the
fjords on Monday and Tuesday. Clinton is once again being handed a
catalytic role in the peace process, through a tacit agreement
between three parties whose motivations are all different.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants to secure a legacy as the arbiter of a final
Israeli-Palestinian peace. Barak, despite his desire to convert the
trilateral relationship to a bilateral one, wants the United States
to feel central so that a reluctant Congress will release $1.2
billion in promised aid. And Arafat, whose ties with the United
States were profitably strengthened under Barak's right-wing
predecessor, does not see an advantage to being alone at the table
with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no real negotiations in Oslo, no possibility
of a new agreement and little likelihood of a crisis. Instead, the
meeting will serve as one more confidence-building session between
the parties, resonantly synchronized with a memorial service on
Tuesday for Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated
four years ago by a right-wing Jewish extremist.
</P>
<P>
   With transparent symbolism, it will also be a return to Oslo,
where the original peace accord was forged and where Rabin, Arafat
and Shimon Peres, now the minister of regional development,
received the Nobel Peace Prize five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, although he is happy to ``exchange views,'' did not
initiate the meeting and does not consider it essential to the
process, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton can be very helpful, but let's remember the
basic facts,'' Gadi Baltiansky, the spokesman, said. ``The dates
were set by Barak. He decided. He doesn't need anyone to push him.
On the contrary, people criticize him because he is running too
fast, pushing others too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, by contrast, speak about the need to
``revive'' a broken-down peace effort once more. In fact, they have
dropped their public expression of good will toward Barak, which
reached a peak with the signing of a new deal in Egypt in early
September. While Barak has fulfilled some of his obligations, they
say, he has also ``spit in our faces,'' as one official said, by
authorizing new construction at many settlements in the West Bank
and legitimizing some new outposts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything possible to restore our partnership and our
trust,'' Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said on Friday
night, his voice exuding irritation. ``And not only have the peace
talks not begun, but we are witnessing an unprecedented escalation
of settlements and land confiscation activity that makes such talks
meaningless anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the very scheduling of the three-way meeting seemed to
spur action, if not reconciliation. This week began poorly.
Tensions flared over sovereignty in Jerusalem as Israeli security
officers, who were denied access to a British-Palestinian
diplomatic meeting, ringed the American Colony Hotel in the Arab
part of the city. A three-day battle between Palestinian youths and
Israeli soldiers raged in Bethlehem, beaming worldwide the old
images of renewed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Barak, with the deadline of Oslo upon
him, finally appointed a chief negotiator, Oded Eran, the
ambassador to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, whom the Israelis
consider incendiary, scoffed at Eran's appointment as ``not
serious.'' But by Friday, the two were ensconced in a suite at the
King David Hotel in Jerusalem, from which they emerged to announce
that a first formal negotiating session would be held on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In the routine damping of expectations that precedes summit
meetings, most officials are saying that just such a result might
ensue after Oslo too: the scheduling of yet another meeting date,
this one at Camp David early next year. Additionally, a road map or
timetable might be established for the months ahead. But the real
purpose of the gathering, they say, is to work, once again, on the
intangibles, the trust between the parties that is essential to
transverse chasms on so many issues.

   The situation is complex. Barak, a former general who operates
with military precision, does little unintentionally, and many find
it difficult to believe that he delayed the start of final status
negotiations unwittingly. Rather, he is marching with deliberation
to his own rhythm, tuning out Palestinian anxieties with the
certainty that they will understand his good intentions in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did spend _ ``waste,'' one of his ministers said _ a good
deal of time trying unsuccessfully to arrange legal grounds to
appoint a private attorney, Gilad Scher, to head the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But his lack of haste reflected a tactic, too. Barak chose to
negotiate with Israel first, his advisers say. He sought to avoid
the traps that snared Rabin, his mentor. He wanted to move more
cautiously and moderately toward the same goal: the ``peace with
security'' of a general turned peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   On the settlements, for instance, he secured the unprecedented
cooperation of the settlers themselves to dismantle 12 illegal
hilltop outposts. In exchange, he agreed to legalize 30 others. He
considers it the price of building a constituency to support a
final peace agreement that will involve concessions many Israelis
consider wrenching. But the Palestinians, outraged, see it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging in settlements means deepening the occupation at the
very time we are negotiating on the basis of exchanging land for
peace,'' said Nabil Shaath, the planning minister. ``I believe
Barak is a serious person and totally different from his
predecessor. So far the implementation has gone on schedule, if a
bit late. But on this we don't see eye to eye. I call it a
bittersweet situation, whereas it was all bitter before.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In four meetings with his ministers in the last two weeks, Barak
has led a volatile philosophical discussion on the future
relationship between Israel and the Palestinian entity. The
ministers have debated what they call a final separation from the
Palestinians, a concept that worries both the Americans and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose advisers now routinely quote him quoting Robert
Frost, repeatedly says that ``good fences make good neighbors.'' He
wants to build security zones, with literal fences, between Israeli
and Palestinian populated areas. This would be to protect Israel
from both terrorism and ordinary crime like car thefts. Barak also
thinks the Palestinian territories should be connected by a complex
series of bypass roads, with an elevated highway linking the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Barak supports what sounds like a Palestinian state, with its
own currency and its own trade relationships with other countries.
There could be a free trade zone with Israel, he says, and a goal
to reduce the number of Palestinian laborers in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The debates about separation are laying the groundwork for
Israel's positions in the final status talk. The Palestinians are
not publicly preparing any working papers on the issues, which
their public understands as fixed positions that have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Barak repeatedly stresses, the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is 100 years old, and each party's positions are well
established and well known to the other. To reach a framework
agreement, he says, essentially takes some cold-blooded
decision-making by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need months for that,'' Baltiansky said. ``You need
courage.''

 AS THE BATTLEGROUNDS SHIFT, THE DRAFT FADES IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAVERNY, France _ Nicolas Dombroski, an 18-year-old mathematics
student, was not happy at having to spend his whole Saturday at the
French air force base here learning about what soldiers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time,'' he said of the movies and lectures
that filled the morning and the afternoon. ``I didn't even
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Dombroski did not have to pay attention was the
fortunate timing of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   As Europe strives to build nimbler, lighter armies, France is
among the nations that have dropped conscription. Dombroski and the
40 other young men at the air force base had only to be informed
about the army before departing again, with hair still long and, in
some cases, body jewelry still attached.
</P>
<P>
   French men born after Jan. 1, 1980, no longer face an obligatory
10 months in the army. Like Britain and the United States before
it, France plans to have an all-volunteer armed force by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred first by post-Cold War cuts in defense spending and more
recently by superior U.S. technological and logistical performance
in the NATO air war over Kosovo last spring, Europe wants more
agile, better equipped armed forces. Conscription-based armies,
heavy with tanks and artillery designed to defend against invasion,
are becoming a thing of the past, with Spain and perhaps Italy set
to follow the French example. Soon, among the big Western European
countries in NATO, only Germany will continue the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the German militarism that caused two world wars this
century, Germany still views conscription as an instrument of
democratic civilian control over the military _ as the Americans
and, for two centuries, the French did before it. But now many
European military planners and commanders see the draft as an
obstacle to the slimmed-down, technologically advanced, rapidly
deployable forces that the allies are trying to build to deal with
trouble spots far from home _ the main mission that NATO is
planning for in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century mission was territorial defense. But the last
threat of outside invasion vanished with the Soviet Union, and that
has changed everything for allied armies.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne, the French version of Uncle Sam, still wants you all
right, but only for a day. And military recruiters hope you
remember the day fondly enough to come back as a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have a diploma, I'd think of volunteering,'' said
Louis Gautron, a 19-year-old economics student who got his
baccalaureat last year, entitling him to go to a university. ``I
had no idea how many job skills you could learn in the army.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   He spoke midway through the ``call for defense preparation day''
that was held here and at 247 other sites around the country on
Oct. 9. There have been 58 of these days since the first one a year
ago. Not all are on weekends, and none are held in the vacation
months of July and August. Starting next April, young French women
will also be required to come spend a day learning at least a
little about the military.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, 514,664 young men heard what the army had to
say in these sessions, which also involve a test of reading
comprehension. Roughly a third of them, according to French
military surveys, would be interested in coming back at least once
to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Military recruiters hope these sessions will make it easier to
fill their volunteer quotas. The slimmed-down French armed forces
of 2002 will still need 357,183 people in uniform _ 259,299 if the
members of the gendarmerie, a national police force under the
Ministry of Defense, are not counted. There were 500,000 people in
the French military in early 1996, when President Jacques Chirac
announced the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reducing by roughly 30,000 draftees a year,''
Defense Minister Alain Richard, a member of the Socialist
government that inherited the plan in 1997 from Chirac's Gaullists,
told local elected officials at Taverny. The air base, at the edge
of a suburb northwest of Paris, has no airplanes but a large
underground command center in a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The local mayor had a question for Richard familiar to any U.S.
secretary of defense: ``Is the base at Taverny going to be kept
open after the transition?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard smiled. ``I don't know what my successor 20 years from
now will do,'' he answered, ``but for the foreseeable future, I
want to keep all large installations near big cities open, because
we'd need them if we had to build our forces up again some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States believe that their all-volunteer
forces contain units that are more easily mobilized and sent on
expeditions like the NATO-led peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and
Kosovo. The reliance on conscripts meant that some continental
European countries took far too long to get their forces on the
move for Kosovo, French military officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British and the French are the only countries in Europe
that have readily deployable forces,'' Richard said. With changes
in the structure of its armed forces, Germany, too, might have them
in 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some countries took two months to send troops to Kosovo,''
he added, referring to some smaller NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   European defense ministries were shocked by their own slow and
cumbersome reaction and by technological gaps with the United
States that the war over Kosovo revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard explained, in answer to a question from one of the
youths called up for the day, that U.S. planes had flown most of
the bombing missions because the United States could get its
aircraft there faster than most of the Europeans could.
Reorganizing European defenses, he and other officials said, will
shorten reaction times, and volunteer professional soldiers and
reservists will be easier to move on short notice than draftees.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the French plan would create a 50,000-strong reserve to
reinforce the regular army, as National Guard units do in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also designed a reserve flexibility into its system when
it moved to all-volunteer forces in the early 1960s, with a
Territorial Army of 40,000. A strategic defense review last year,
aimed at reorganizing and redesigning British armed forces to make
them more rapidly and easily deployable to places like Bosnia,
Kosovo and now East Timor, allowed for an increase in the planned
size of the army in 2005, to 114,000 soldiers from 109,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving from conscription to volunteer forces, you find that
for the same amount of money, you can get a much more effective and
easily deployable fighting force,'' said Lord Gilbert, until this
summer a minister of the British Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, like Britain and now France, plans to abolish the draft
by the end of 2002, and to reduce its armed forces to about 168,000
by 2003, from 175,000 now. But Spanish Defense Ministry officials
said that, with about three-quarters of the 300,000 Spanish men who
come of draft age every year never actually spending a day in
uniform, there were discussions about ending conscription even
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, where 40 percent to 45 percent of the young men called
choose alternative civilian service as firemen, paramedics,
orderlies and the like, is the only major Western European country
still committed to maintaining the draft. Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping has repeatedly supported conscription, which was adopted,
along with ways of teaching soldiers when it is correct to disobey
orders, when Germany's allies allowed the country to rearm in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for keeping the draft, some officials say, is that
Germany's social services and hospitals may have to shut down if
they suddenly have to do without all those volunteers doing
alternative service.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Parliament is considering a bill to reduce the size of
the armed forces over three years. Now numbering 280,000 men, of
whom 136,000 are draftees, the armed forces would drop to 200,000
volunteers _ including, for the first time, some women.

ARGENTINES GET A PEEK AT GOVERNMENT-TO-BE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ As a candidate, President-elect
Fernando de la Rua refused to debate and kept his speeches vague.
But as his administration begins to take shape a week after his
election, he is preparing Argentina for sharp cuts in public
spending and revealing an open style of governing, full of trial
balloons and freewheeling public debate among his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   From their headquarters in a downtown hotel, de la Rua and his
aides are sending out suggestions that the government's fiscal
health is in more serious jeopardy than they had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Machinea, who is poised to become economy minister,
has publicly disputed the departing government's estimated 1999
federal deficit of $5.1 billion, saying it will be more like $5.7
billion and could balloon to $10 billion next year unless harsh
measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
   But even as de la Rua appears to be preparing the country for
economic policies that are sure to disappoint the left wing of his
coalition, he is shifting moderately left in foreign affairs,
moving somewhat from President Carlos Saul Menem's close alignment
with the United States toward a more isolationist posture closer to
that of traditionally nonaligned Latin American countries like
Brazil and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a knack for symbolism in foreign affairs, de la Rua
chose election night to announce that the first country he would
visit as president-elect was Brazil, in order to begin easing trade
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he publicly advised Paraguay's former army chief,
Gen. Lino Oviedo, who took political asylum here after charges that
he masterminded the assassination of his country's vice president
last March, to find a new home outside Argentina. His presence here
has caused tensions between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview with the Mexican newspaper Reforma, de la
Rua said Argentina would no longer contribute troops to
multinational peacekeeping operations. Should he hold to this view,
it would be a break with Menem's commitment of troops for
peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, Haiti and the Balkans and a
return to Argentina's traditional policy of neutrality and
nonintervention.
</P>
<P>
   But de la Rua has made it clear that he has no intention of
breaking with the United States. After receiving a telephone call
from President Clinton, de la Rua said on Friday, ``I told
President Clinton we would work together for peace and against drug
trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, who is currently mayor of Buenos Aires, has until his
inauguration on Dec. 10 to organize his administration, and he is
not expected to announce his Cabinet for several weeks. But by
taking several foreign policy stands and appointing several
planning teams immediately after his election, he has partly
dispelled the popular impression that he is plodding and
indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very orderly transition so far,'' said Rosendo Fraga, a
historian and political analyst. ``It looks like this will be the
first time since 1916 that one president passed power to another of
an opposition party without a crisis.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hints are emerging about the style of the de la Rua government,
which promises to be a sharp break from the glitzy and mercurial
ways of the Menem administration. While Menem made snap decisions
that sometimes surprised his Cabinet ministers, de la Rua appears
to be consulting with a wide range of political groups to reach
consensus before making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems to be returning to a traditional tool of Argentine
governance abandoned by Menem: the use of the trial balloon to test
the waters on controversial matters or subtly bury policies
supported by some of his backers.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, de la Rua publicly instructed his economic team
to study imposing a one-time windfall profits tax on companies
privatized under Menem. The proposal brought down the stock prices
of utilities for a couple of days, but it was cheered by the
Frepaso Party, a social democratic group that is the junior partner
in de la Rua's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But only a day later Machinea, the economy minister in waiting,
shot down the idea. Analysts noted that the seeming flip-flop
served a useful purpose. Because of his social democratic
credentials, Machinea was in the best position to disappoint the
left wing of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his action perhaps improved his standing with
foreign investors who are still wary of Machinea because as the
central bank president in the late 1980s he presided over a
devastating currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In still another break with Menem, who preferred his two vice
presidents to be seen but not heard, de la Rua has allowed his vice
president-elect, Carlos Chacho Alvarez, to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, a Frepaso leader, publicly pressed de la Rua to appoint
the losing Frepaso candidate for governor of Buenos Aires to a
Cabinet position. De la Rua did not respond to the pressure, but he
let Alvarez continue to speak out on a variety of issues with no
apparent repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to a more subtle style of Argentine
politics,'' noted Felipe Noguera, a leading political consultant.

CLERIC'S TRIAL BECOMES FLASH POINT OF IRAN'S POLITICAL FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct date of Scopes trial in 3rd graf.)  (lh) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's ruling Muslim clerics Saturday began the
apostasy trial of one of the country's most popular politicians,
Abdullah Nouri, a cleric who has gone from being one of the most
trusted aides to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to taking a key
leadership role in a campaign to end the clerical dictatorship
Khomeini imposed after the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As turbaned clerics gathered in a courtroom ringed by armed
commandos, few Iranians doubted that the outcome of the trial,
before the much-feared Special Court for the Clergy, will go a long
way toward determining whether the country moves toward greater
democracy, or to a new era of clerical repression. A guilty verdict
could conceivably carry the death penalty, although a lengthy
prison term is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   For many of Iran's 65 million people, the trial has assumed the
significance Americans attached to the Scopes trial in 1925, or
people in England to the treason trial of Sir Thomas More during
the reign of Henry VIII _ a moment when a courtroom becomes a
testing ground for irreconcilable views about the future of a
society and its beliefs, with huge social, philosophical and
political stakes resting on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tehran trial, which could last weeks, reformers and
hard-liners will battle over issues that only a few years ago were
taboo, the most crucial of them over whether the right to rule
rests with the Iranian people, or with the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   But other, more tangible questions are on trial, too, including
Iran's relations with the United States. High on the list of
charges outlined in a 44-page indictment of the defendant is that
the newspaper he publishes has advocated re-establishing relations
with the United States. The prosecutor, a cleric, said that by
running an article quoting another high-ranking cleric as saying
that relations with the United States are ``now a possible, not
impossible thing,'' Nouri had betrayed the revolution and the
Islamic principles that underpinned it.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is Nouri who is on trial, the 50-year-old cleric is
widely regarded in Iran as a surrogate for the man many powerful
clerics would like to see as the defendant, President Mohammad
Khatami. But for the time being, Khatami, 53, another cleric, is
untouchable, having won a landslide victory in the presidential
election in 1997 over the hard-liners' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Nouri's trial began, Khatami landed back in Tehran
from an official visit to Paris, part of his campaign to break
Iran's isolation and open what he calls ``a dialogue of
civilizations'' with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Iranians expect Nouri to be convicted, many say the
trial could be costly for the hard-liners, underlining an
intolerance that could strengthen reformers' support. Even in the
courtroom, the sense of the hard-liners' isolation from the society
around them was reinforced by signs of the rapid changes afoot in
Iran _ in the ringing mobile phones of reporters and clerics, and
in the high-rise block of luxury condominiums rising across the
road, evidence of a new business class that has thrown its support
behind the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, dressed in a cleric's collar-less white shirt, black robe
and white turban, appeared to stun peers appointed to sit in
judgment over him _ a judge and a nine-man jury, all of them
clerics _ by taking the witness stand immediately after the
indictment was read to say that it was they, not he, who had
betrayed the revolution. More than that, he rejected their right to
judge him, saying that the clergy court itself was illegal, having
no place in the Islamic Constitution that was drawn up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its competence
to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will have no
legitimacy,'' he said, in a clear, steady voice. ``What I was
thinking as I listened to the indictment being read out was, `This
is not a court, this is a self-appointed cabal.''' He added: ``I
ask myself, what has happened to us, to our revolution, to our
faith, that it has come to this, that one group of clerics can make
allegations against another like this?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mohammed Salimi, who is in his late 30s, warned Nouri not
to insult the court. ``You say now that this court has no
legitimacy, because you are here on trial, but I don't remember you
saying that about this court when you were holding high positions
of state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Mohammed Nikounam, in his 50s, reminded Nouri,
ominously, that left-wing opponents of the ruling clerics also
contested the court's legitimacy after placing a bomb in a Tehran
building, killing 73 people, including many top clerics, in 1981.
The bombers were executed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By challenging the court's legitimacy, Nouri came close to doing
something virtually unheard of in Iran, even among reformers _
questioning the legacy of Ayatollah Khomeini, the stern-faced
cleric who became an absolute ruler in the years between the
upheaval that ousted the shah and his death in 1989. Khomeini
established the clergy court by personal decree to deal with rising
resistance to Islamic rule, but Nouri, citing the 1980
constitution, said that not even ``the leader'' _ a reference to
Khomeini _ had the right to establish courts outside the framework
of the constitution. ``Are we supposed to accept that the law
applies to everybody except the leader?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Nouri opened the key issue in the trial, and in the
wider political struggle across Iran: Whether power will be vested
in the people, through the president and Parliament they elect, or
will continue to rest, as it effectively does now, with a group of
deeply conservative clerics who take their authority from
Khomeini's successor as the country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei. Khamenei and his supporters say that their right to
rule rests in a principle known in Iran as ``velayat-i faghi,''
which means, loosely, that the country's top cleric, as ``God's
representative on earth,'' has sovereign powers.
</P>
<P>
   By holding Nouri's trial now _ and many other trials in which
newspaper editors, reporters, student protesters and clerics who
have joined the reform movement are defendants _ the clerical elite
apparently hopes to strike a blow against the reformers ahead of
parliamentary elections that are scheduled in February. The
reformers' political strategists, prominent among them Nouri, hope
that by winning a landslide victory in the elections they can move
on to constitutional reforms that will vastly reduce the clerics'
arbitrary powers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nouri is convicted, or even if his trial is not
concluded, he will automatically be disqualified from competing in
the elections, in which he has been expected to be the reformers'
biggest vote-getter. In February, after stepping down as one of
Khatami's vice presidents, he won the largest number of votes in
municipal elections that were held among the 12 million people of
Tehran. Until hard-liners in Parliament impeached him in 1998, he
was Khatami's interior minister, winning widespread popularity with
steps that curbed excesses by the police and the judiciary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The charges Nouri faces could hardly be more serious. He is
accused of using his newspaper, Khordad, which has the biggest
circulation among dozens of daily newspapers in Tehran, to ``insult
Islam,'' its prophet, Mohammed, his descendants, and Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   But as the indictment was read out in court, it became clear
that hard-line clerics intend to use the trial to strike out
against just about everything else they dislike in the reformers'
more tolerant social philosophy. Among other things, the prosecutor
cited an article in Khordad that said that people should be allowed
to clap, whistle and cheer at concerts and political rallies _ an
Islamic taboo in Iran, even though it has been frequently ignored
in the freer atmosphere ushered in by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles the prosecutor cited as examples of
``un-Islamic'' attitudes included one in which an Italian woman
journalist criticized Iran's divorce laws, which are heavily
weighted against women, and another that argued, in a reference to
the clergy, that ``absolute power corrupts absolutely.'' Still
another questioned the Islamic legal precept of ``qisas,'' or
eye-for-an-eye justice, under which Iranian courts frequently
impose the death penalty, amputations and other harsh penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Nikounam, the prosecutor, raised his voice indignantly. ``What
you are saying, in effect, is that people should be able to do
anything they want, even to drink alcohol, no matter how offensive
that may be to our Islamic beliefs,'' he said. He stood before a
handwritten quotation from Khomeini that court officials had pasted
on the courtroom wall in which Khomeini warned followers to
``beware of false clerics and false revolutionaries who pretend to

WORLD COURT'S AMERICAN CHIEF FAULTS U.S. ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The American judge who now serves as president
of the World Court said in an interview last week that there was
``no question'' that the United States was legally obliged to pay
the past assessments it owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Justice Stephen M. Schwebel, a former professor of
international law at Johns Hopkins University, also said that the
United States should think twice about demanding lower assessments
in the future, which could lead to a reduction in U.S. influence
and the loss of important positions in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration are unable to reconcile
budget bills covering U.S. payments to the United Nations and other
international organizations and operations, and the United States
faces the real prospect of losing its vote in the General Assembly
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, neither Congress nor the administration accepts the
U.N. figure of about $1.7 billion in unpaid bills for both regular
budget and peacekeeping activities. Assessments are set by a
committee of nations, and paying dues is a treaty obligation. ``It
is hard to see a rational basis for U.S. actions,'' Schwebel said.
``Other governments are baffled at such a self-destructive
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, he added, it was the United States that took the lead
in seeking a ruling by the World Court _ its formal name is the
International Court of Justice _ on whether bills for contributions
to peacekeeping operations were legally binding. The court ruled
that they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1962 to 1964, the United States exerted great diplomatic
effort in support of payments as an obligation,'' he said. ``Now
the U.S. is the leading financial delinquent.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwebel, a graduate of Harvard, Yale and Cambridge
universities, has been a justice on the World Court since 1981.
Born in New York, he became interested in the United Nations as a
teen-ager, he said on a visit to U.N. headquarters, where he spoke
to the General Assembly on current activities and trends in the
court and in international law.
</P>
<P>
   As a World Court justice, he said, he has a record for voting
against his home country _ 11 times _ when he believed the evidence
demanded it. The court, part of the U.N. system, deals exclusively
with disputes between nations. Schwebel, who was a legal adviser to
the late Adlai Stevenson when he was U.S. representative at the
United Nations in the early 1960s, is the first American to serve
as the World Court's president in 40 years.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From his bench in The Hague, where the court and the separate
Balkans war crimes tribunal are based, he has watched a new body
and practice of international law evolve. He supports the formation
of a permanent International Criminal Court, which was approved by
treaty last year to try individuals accused of being responsible
for war crimes and genocide. The Clinton administration, wary of
congressional hostility, has refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law has developed very markedly in the last 50
years,'' Schwebel said, citing treaties and conventions covering a
wide range of topics from the conduct of war to the regulation of
uses of the sea and outer space. He pointed to the growing body of
human rights law.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law is bound up with the increasing integration
of international life,'' he said.

PRO-BUSINESS SENATOR TO HEAD VITAL ENVIRONMENTAL PANEL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., N.H., Okla., Mont., N.Y., N.D., Vt., W.Va.)  (rk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since Congress began passing
landmark environmental laws three decades ago, the critically
important Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is about to
be headed by someone who wants to make those laws more friendly to
business.
</P>
<P>
   There are two candidates for the chairmanship to replace Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., who died last Sunday. But whether Republicans
choose Bob Smith of New Hampshire or James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma,
they will break the environmental mold filled by Chafee, and before
him by Max Baucus, D-Mont., Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt. and Jennings
Randolph, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The change is another measure of how the Senate's Republicans
have evolved over the years. The original conservation movement was
a Republican concept early in the century, and over the last three
decades Republican support was central to a bipartisan committee.
Today the environmental movement considers none of the remaining
nine committee Republicans an ally.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and Smith and Inhofe declined to discuss the
committee or their environmental views last week, saying it would
be inappropriate before Chafee's funeral on Saturday. But policy
statements made available by the pair's staffs clearly describe
them, and their records are well known.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, for example, has strongly supported a revision of the
Superfund law that would shift the responsibility for paying for
cleanups away from polluters. And he has said that while the
``environmental movement of the '70s served a purpose,'' the
challenge of the future ``will be how to encourage the protection
of our environment without jeopardizing economic growth and
overburdening taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has been a frequent antagonist of the Environmental
Protection Agency over the regulations of the Clean Air Act and the
quality of the science behind its views. And he accused the agency
of ``turning jobs into endangered species,'' especially in the coal
industry, through its efforts to limit particulates in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences in tone and voting record from Chafee are
deep. The League of Conservation Voters, which gave the Rhode
Island senator a lifetime achievement award earlier this month,
rated his votes as correct 70 percent of the time over his career.
For Smith, the rating was 36 percent and for Inhofe, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary circumstances, there would be no question about
who would succeed Chafee. Smith joined the committee when he was
elected to the Senate in 1991, Inhofe when he arrived four years
later. And seniority governs chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith has been out of the Republican Party since July 13,
when he announced he was converting his hapless presidential bid
into an independent candidacy and said ``the Republican Party is
more interested in winning elections than in supporting the
principles of the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now seeking to rejoin the party and will probably be taken
back in. But Republicans may hold his three months in the wasteland
against him when it comes to a valuable chairmanship, though they
left him in the thankless position as chairman of the Ethics
Committee all summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, even when Chafee did not have the votes in his
committee or confidence about a bill's prospects on the Senate
floor, he had a chairman's prerogative of simply pigeonholing it,
as he did with the House's 1995 effort to rewrite the Clean Water
Act. Neither potential successor is likely to do that.
</P>
<P>
   One business lobbyist said on Friday of Smith and Inhofe, ``They
would probably be more supportive'' than Chafee. She added, ``They
have been very big supporters, especially Inhofe, of making sure
regulations are based on sound science and weigh costs and
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   From an opposite perspective, Deb Callahan, president of the
League of Conservation Voters, said: ``John Chafee was an architect
of most of our environmental laws. The next person is going to use
more of a wrecking ball approach.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, would not predict the next chairman's course. But she said
it was time for Congress to reauthorize and modernize laws like the
Clean Water Act, last overhauled in 1987, and Superfund.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders have different styles. Inhofe is a satisfied
veteran of the partisan wars of the House. Smith, said one
Democratic senator, ``is probably easier to work with, but also
very stubborn if he gets a bee in his bonnet.'' The senator
described Inhofe as brighter.
</P>
<P>
   One environmental lobbyist here, Dan Weiss of the Sierra Club,
said, ``It wouldn't be surprising to see an environmental feeding
frenzy launched by Smith, or especially Inhofe,'' whom he dismissed
as a ``spokesman for the oil industry.'' Smith, he said, at least
came from a state that was ``on the receiving end of pollution''
and had constituents who were concerned about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Although environmentalists worked hard to defeat Smith when he
ran in 1996, they would plainly prefer him to Inhofe. When Smith
served in the House from 1985 to 1990, he actually voted with the
League of Conservation Voters two-thirds of the time, like most New
England Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something there we could hopefully build on,'' Ms.
Callahan said. Moreover, the environment is an issue for New
England voters, and if Smith runs again in 2002, he is likely to
face strong Democratic opposition, something Inhofe need not worry
about.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of Utica, N.Y., an environmental leader
among House Republicans, said it was clear that ``either one would
be dramatically different in approach to environmental issues as
compared to Chafee.'' But he said the change might not make as much
difference as it would have a few years ago, because House
Republicans had become much less eager to take the political risks
of changing environmental laws than they were at the height of the
Gingrich revolution of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said it was becoming clear on all sides that the
``American people want us to protect the air they breathe, the
water they drink, the food they eat.''

MURDER TRIAL OF 13-YEAR-OLD SPOTLIGHTS MICHIGAN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Two years to the day after an 11-year-old boy
fatally shot a stranger walking out of a convenience store, opening
statements were made Friday in his trial on a charge of
first-degree murder, in a case that is drawing attention to
Michigan's tough 3-year-old juvenile justice law.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Nathaniel Abraham, who is now 13, is being tried as an
adult here in this northern suburb of Detroit. Prosecutors say that
he has a surprisingly long history of encounters with the police
and had talked about shooting someone.
</P>
<P>
   But court-appointed psychologists say that Nathaniel has
below-average intelligence and emotional difficulties, notably in
controlling anger.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's lawyers contend that the shooting was an accident.
In any case, they say, the boy was not mature enough to understand
the seriousness of shooting someone, much less plan a killing.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, a slim boy of about 5 feet, sat quietly in Oakland
County Circuit Court during opening statements, wearing a green and
white checked shirt and dark trousers.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison without
parole, although prosecutors have expressed a willingness to seek a
lesser sentence in which he would be confined in a juvenile
detention center until the age of 21 and then resentenced if he
showed inadequate signs of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements in the family division of the court,
prosecutors portrayed Nathaniel as a calculating criminal who told
a girl at school that he would kill someone and then did so.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, who has been held in a juvenile detention center
since the shooting, is also being tried on a charge of assault with
intent to murder. Prosecutors say he fired a borrowed .22-caliber
rifle at a neighbor four hours before going out on a steep hillside
with the rifle and fatally shooting the stranger, Ronnie Greene
Jr., who was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel appears to be the youngest child ever charged as an
adult with murder in Michigan, and one of the youngest ever in the
United States, although children as young as 7 were tried as adults
in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's case is also one of the most unusual to reach a
courtroom since Republican lawmakers in Michigan adopted one of the
toughest juvenile justice laws in the nation in 1996. The law
allows prosecutors to seek judges' permission to try any juvenile
as an adult, no matter how young. Prosecutors sought and received
this permission in Nathaniel's case.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 law, Michigan had required that juveniles be at
least 14 before being tried as adults with a judge's permission.
The state has long required that youths of 17 or older be tried
automatically as adults, unlike many states or the federal
government, which set 18 as the age for automatic consideration as
an adult in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Republicans had not expected a child as young as
Nathaniel to be tried as an adult for murder when the law was
enacted, said Thomas Ginster, the criminal-justice policy
coordinator for Gov. John Engler, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing the research,'' Ginster said, ``we found a
few scattered 13-year-olds committing capital crimes, but I don't
think we ever saw an 11-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, Nathaniel's lawyer, said Friday in court that
the boy had been shooting at trees in the fatal shooting as well as
when the neighbor came under fire. Though Fieger acknowledged that
Nathaniel had fired the shot that killed Greene, he contended that
the distance of the shot, at least 200 feet, was too far for
accuracy with the battered, low-caliber weapon missing its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger also contends that the prosecution may be partly
motivated by race, an accusation denied by prosecutors. Nathaniel
is black, as was Greene. A 14-year-old white boy is said to have
been shooting with Nathaniel when bullets flew past the neighbor,
but was not with Nathaniel at the time of the fatal shooting and
has not been charged with any crime. The boy is expected to testify
for the prosecution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jury selection took nearly two weeks, partly because a
prospective juror in the first pool of 75 said he recalled a
``run-in'' with Nathaniel. The pool was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac police records show that by age 11, Nathaniel had been a
suspect in nearly two dozen crimes, including two beatings with
metal pipes, an arson incident and a burglary, and had twice been
placed in special programs after using guns to threaten other
elementary school students.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to ask the judge in the case, Judge
Eugene Moore, to instruct the jurors that they can find Nathaniel
guilty of lesser offenses than first-degree murder. But Fieger said
in an interview Friday that he would ask that the jury not be given
that option, adding that he expected all charges to be dismissed.

   COELHO _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore bragged about the
``higher standards'' of his campaign finance apparatus in his first
nationally televised appearance with challenger Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire last week. But at the top of Gore's campaign
organizational pyramid sits Tony Coelho, an former California
congressman who some critics say helped usher in the era of ``big
money'' in politics that Gore vowed to ``fight my heart out'' to
end if elected president. (Shepard and Malone 1100&AMP;add.)

   COXNET FOCUS 1030: HOSTAGE CRISIS ANNIVERSARY _ For Iranians,
the takeover of the U.S. Embassy 20 years ago this week is their
Bunker Hill; their Boston Tea Party. It galvanized their
revolutionary fervor as they took on the ``Den of Spies'' that had
helped install and support the brutal, dictatorial Shah. Today in
Iran, the takeover highlights the country's identity crisis.

   IRAN _ TEHRAN, Iran _ For Iranians, the takeover of the U.S.
Embassy 20 years ago this week (Nov. 4) is their Bunker Hill; their
Boston Tea Party. It galvanized their revolutionary fervor as they
took on the ``Den of Spies'' that had helped install and support
the brutal, dictatorial Shah. The takeover symbolized a revolution
that changed the atmosphere of the Middle East and helped create
now-familiar buzzwords like ``Islamic fundamentalism'' and
``Hezbollah.'' And, it shocked the West into realizing that
religion was still a force in world politics. (Just a year before
the revolution, Jimmy Carter called Iran ``an island of
stability.'') Today in Iran, the takeover highlights the country's
identity crisis. Any criticism of the takeover is still
controversial. But the radical fervor has long been cast aside as
most Iranians who seek a new pragmatism and freedom. (Kaplow, Cox

CASINO IS A HIGH-RISK ENTERPRISE FOR NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Nev., N.J., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The first of the nightly Mardi Gras parades wound
its way through a vast new windowless casino on Thursday night, its
costumed stilt walkers dancing past the carefully re-created French
Quarter and Garden District, past Pete Fountain and his clarinet
and buffet tables heaped with jambalaya, but hundreds of people
never even looked up.
</P>
<P>
   If it was merriment they wanted, the old playground of the real
French Quarter was only steps away, outside the building. But in
their high-stakes games of baccarat and blackjack, they had found a
new, more absorbing form of adult entertainment in New Orleans, and
the city is fervently hoping that they bet again and again, 24
hours a day, every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi, watch out!'' cried Mayor Marc Morial in a
ribbon-cutting warning to the nation's other casino homelands, just
before the new Harrah's casino opened its doors to the public late
Thursday. ``Las Vegas, watch out! Atlantic City, watch out!
Harrah's New Orleans is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-scale gambling, in the city's first permanent land-based
casino, has indeed come to New Orleans, wedged perfectly into a
large downtown lot between the French Quarter and the Mississippi
River, a few blocks from the convention center. But the mayor's
need to make an audacious declaration of permanence underscored
just how difficult it has been to get those doors open, and how
much of a risk has been taken by the city and the casino's owner.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows if the 11 million tourists who visit New
Orleans each year will want to gamble, or if the extravagant
evocation of the city's flamboyance inside the walls of the $345
million Harrah's will distinguish it from the growing glut of
riverboat casinos, Indian casinos and resort casinos around the
country. No one knows whether it will settle into the city's
business landscape as a major employer and attraction, or whether
it will in some way alter the delicate character that has drawn
visitors to New Orleans for ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling's recent history in the city has raised some doubts
about its future. The state Legislature first approved a single
land-based casino in New Orleans in 1992, a few years after it
allowed riverboat casinos, video poker machines and a state
lottery. While Harrah's began building its permanent structure in
1995, it opened a temporary casino in the city's Municipal
Auditorium, to great fanfare. Before seven months were out, the
owners realized that revenues were only a third of the necessary
$33 million a month. In a humiliating bankruptcy, the temporary
casino closed in November 1995, and work on the new building
halted.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's now says the failure was the result of the auditorium's
out-of-the-way location, next to a public housing project, and says
the new casino's premier site and opulent interior will improve its
fortunes. But three riverboat casinos that were moored near
downtown have also failed, raising the question of whether New
Orleans can ever be a wholehearted gambling town.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't come here to gamble,'' said Raphael Cassimere, a
history professor at the University of New Orleans who is an expert
on the city's past. ``They come here for a convention, or to go to
the restaurants and the French Quarter. The big gamblers go where
there are lots of casinos, like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. I think
it's far from settled whether this casino will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the reorganization of the local holding company that owns
the casino, of which Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is a 43 percent
shareholder, several large casinos opened on the gulf coast of
Mississippi, drawing heavily from nearby New Orleans. Those
casinos, as well as casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City, N.J., have
something the local Harrah's does not: luxurious attached hotels,
restaurants and nightclubs that add a sense of entertainment to
gambling. To get past the objections of New Orleans' powerful
restaurateurs and hoteliers, the Louisiana Legislature required
Harrah's to build a stand-alone casino, with no attached rooms and
limited food service. (A nightclub may eventually open in the
building's second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   It also required $100 million in state tax payments every year
and more than $10 million in annual rent to the city. Gambling
analysts say the casino will have to make about $260 million a year
to pay its taxes and its 2,800 employees, which translates to
14,000 patrons a day losing an average of $50 each. That revenue
projection is about half of what a major casino like the MGM Grand
in Las Vegas takes in every year, but 14,000 gamblers a day would
equal fully half of New Orleans' daily tourist population.
</P>
<P>
   The economic burden is heavy, and Harrah's officials, who will
manage the casino, acknowledge feeling handicapped by the taxes and
rules, compared with the relatively free hand they have at other
casinos. But they are nonetheless convinced their investment will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have an attached hotel, but we have something the
others don't: New Orleans,'' said Gary Loveman, chief operating
officer of Harrah's Entertainment. ``We're a virtual monopoly here,
and we're the only casino between the East Coast and Nevada with
facilities for our high-end customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the casino's three elaborate Mardi Gras floats, wrought
iron balconies and hand-painted murals are lush private rooms for
gamblers willing to spend $10,000 or more a day on card games,
craps or $500 slot machines. The 100,000-square-foot casino is
already adjacent to the city's most expensive hotels _ whose rooms
will be reduced in price for high rollers _ and nationally known
restaurants are not far away.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the hope for the casino is a general sense that New
Orleans, with its bars, jazz clubs and loose-limbed spirit, already
attracts people who might be prone to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it _ New Orleans is not Orlando,'' said Warren
Reuther, who owns several paddle-wheel tour boats and other tourist
enterprises downtown. ``It's already perceived as an adult city, a
let your hair down and have a good time place. It won't be easy for
them to make money, but I think New Orleans is their biggest
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a third of the casino's revenues are expected to come
from local residents, Loveman said, meaning the casino will have to
entice millions of the conventioneers and other visitors who come
to the city for other reasons. Some of the tourists gawking at the
starlit purple ceilings on Friday said that they might very well
spend a few hours playing some of the casino's 2,900 slot machines,
which, as in most casinos, dominate the floor. Thousands of
visitors, in fact, crowded into the building on its opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' asked Dr. Morton Weyler of Westbrook, Conn., who
was in town with his wife on a group tour. ``It's all part of the
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics fear that the city is sacrificing a slice of its
authenticity to pay for government services without raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of people enjoying the real sights of New Orleans,
they're asking people to go inside a closed building and look at a
fake New Orleans,'' said C.B. Forgotston Jr., a lawyer who has been
an outspoken opponent of the casino and who predicts it will
eventually beg the state to reduce its tax burden. ``Why would
anyone do that? And if they did, they would just take money away
from existing small businesses. It's no way to run a government.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore uprooted his campaign
headquarters from K Street and moved to Nashville, Tenn., the
change was intended to distance the campaign from the city's famous
avenue of influence where many of the vice president's advisers
have earned millions of dollars in lobbying fees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself was worried that the campaign was perceived as
being too closely connected to several highly paid lobbyists _
lobbyists whose success appeared to be inextricably linked to the
vice president's political fortunes, several senior Gore advisers
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the symbolism of this month's move off K Street,
Gore's closest confidants _ the lobbyists Tom Downey, Peter Knight
and Roy Neel _ have continued to play central roles in his 2000
presidential campaign, even while they have continued to
aggressively lobby members of the administration and, in some
cases, Gore himself, on behalf of their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   His close relations with lobbyists are part of a deeper
political problem that the vice president faces in his campaign, as
the Democratic challenger, Bill Bradley, continues to portray
himself as a Washington outsider and champion of campaign finance
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a son of a senator who lived in a hotel on Massachusetts
Avenue, and a candidate who is still trying to dispel criticism
about his 1996 fund raising, has been portrayed as a consummate
Washington insider who symbolizes the capital's tolerance for
influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many of the Gore campaign's leaders, and the vice
president's senior advisers, are connected to K Street and the
capital's culture of money, power and influence has made it hard
for the vice president to shake that image.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a friend of Gore for nearly 25 years, was investigated
repeatedly by congressional Republicans for his lobbying
activities, including an accusation that he used his influence to
persuade the Federal Communications Commission to move its
headquarters to an office complex owned by one of his clients.
Knight was never charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting the campaign headquarters on K Street was just plain
dumb,'' said a senior Gore adviser who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``You cannot pick a worse place to put the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's senior advisers said that the ``K Street problem'' had
become obvious in recent months, mostly because Gore's campaign
headquarters was within walking distance of the lobbyists' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, known as the vice president's ``first friend'' since
they served together in the House of Representatives, tried more
than once to lobby Gore personally on issues that are important to
his corporate clients, a roster that includes Microsoft and Merck &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been there when Downey has come up to the vice
president to lobby him on some issue,'' recalled another senior
Gore adviser. ``And the vice president had to literally put up his
hand and say, `Tom, I don't want to hear it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Downey did not return several phone calls to his office last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, the press secretary for the campaign, said: ``Tom
has served with Al Gore in the Congress, and he is one of his close
friends. He has on occasion raised specific issues with the vice
president. But the vice president has not taken action as a result
of their conversations that he would not have otherwise taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that the move to Nashville was more than symbolic.
``It was a real move that represented a real change in direction
for this campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the change of address and direction, Gore's coterie of K
Street friends is still playing an influential, though quiet, role
in his campaign. Many of them raise money for his election effort.
At the same time, they are hired by corporations seeking advice on
how to navigate the legal and regulatory battles they are waging
with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But they are sensitive to the criticism that their private
dealings raise conflicts of interest, and two of the lobbyists have
made arrangements to limit or end their lobbying activities next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the first Democratic debate, in
Hanover, N.H., on Wednesday night, Downey helped prepare the vice
president for the showdown with Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey. In debate rehearsals, Downey played the role of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, another close friend of Gore, is overseeing the
campaign's fund-raising activities while he continues to represent
an array of corporate clients, including Bell Atlantic, Lockheed
Martin and Leap Wireless. But in an interview, he said that he
planned to disband his lobbying firm at the end of the year to
allow him to assist Gore's campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been his friend for 23 years,'' Knight said. ``So
putting myself in a position to help out in any way that I can is
the least I can do to help him become president.''
</P>
<P>
   A former chief of staff to Gore, Neel is the president of the
U.S. Telephone Association, where he lobbies the White House on
behalf of the Baby Bells. At the same time, Neel advises Gore and
his staff on telecommunications policy. But Neel said he would also
devote most of his time next year to assisting the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends of Al Gore, and we are not manipulators,'' said
Neel, who makes $500,000 annually as the president of the telephone
association. ``I think I can speak for the entire group. Our
careers, our day-to-day jobs, are important to us, but I don't
think anyone in this group would work on anything that would put Al
Gore at risk, or put him in a bad situation, or do anything that
would reflect poorly on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the potential for conflict of interest is clear, although
Knight and Neel say they are careful not to mix their clients'
interests with their work as campaign volunteers for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's other two leaders also have some continuing
private business ties. Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman, has
severed his ties with most of his corporate clients, campaign
officials said. Questions had been raised about Coelho's management
of the United States' participation in the 1998 World Exposition in
Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   And Carter Eskew, the campaign's media consultant, has a
continuing role at a public relations firm, though he recently
severed his ties with a controversial client, Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gore was assisted by two political
consultants who had continued to represent corporate clients _
Robert Squier, an adviser, and Mark Penn, a pollster. But both have
left the campaign since Gore's move to Nashville.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Democrats, including a former White House
adviser, Paul Begala, have urged Gore to demand that his aides
curtail their private dealings and lobbying because of the
appearance that private interests were seeking to influence the
vice president through his kitchen cabinet of lobbyists. Most of
these Democrats applauded the Gore campaign's move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gore's lobbyist-friends have clients interested in
issues that have also interested the vice president, like
technology, health care and environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of their lobbying reports shows that Knight, Neel
and Downey often do get what they ask for _ from the
administration, the Federal Communications Commission and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's firm, which represents Lockheed Martin, has lobbied the
administration to continue its $1 billion deal with Lockheed to
help Russia launch commercial rockets. The White House has said
that it is considering terminating the deal to discourage Russia
from selling ballistic-missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Knight, who worked for Gore for 13 years in
the House and Senate and was the manager of the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, said that most of his firm's lobbying, on behalf of
Lockheed and other companies, had been handled by his partners. And
Knight said he had been careful not to discuss his clients'
interests with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight's critics contend that clients hire him because of
his insider's knowledge of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Peter Knight calls an agency for help, it's almost as if
the vice president or his staff calls,'' said an investigator for a
Republican House member. ``He might as well be Al Gore.''

   Downey lives not far from Gore, and they often play basketball
together on weekends. After Downey, a Democrat from Long Island,
N.Y., was defeated for re-election to the House in 1992, he founded
a lobbying firm with former Rep. Rod Chandler, a Republican from
Washington, and the firm has been very successful. According to a
study by Legal Times, Downey Chandler earned $1.7 million in fees
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On his lobbying reports, Downey acknowledges that he has
directly lobbied the office of the vice president on behalf of most
of his clients, a list that includes Boeing, Merck &AMP; Co. and Fuji
Film Co.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Gore denied that Downey had won most of his
fights, saying that Gore excoriated the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry at a recent campaign appearance in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the extreme price differentials between the
Canadian and U.S. markets, Gore used a 60-tablet package of Zocar,
a medication used to control cholesterol that is manufactured by
Merck &AMP; Co., a Downey client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hammered Merck,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House officials are barred by law from lobbying
other senior administration officials for one year. And the Clinton
administration's own ethics rules bar former administration members
from lobbying the White House for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, who was the vice president's first chief of staff until he
left the administration in late 1993, waited until this past winter
before he began lobbying members of the administration about
telecommunications policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That five-year prohibition ended last winter, and I have had
discussions with the vice president in general terms on
telecommunications policy and telecommunications politics,'' Neel
said. ``But I do not lobby him on any single issue related to our
industry.''

 MISSISSIPPI RACE CENTERS ON FAMILY VALUES _ OR LACK OF THEM  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Only three states had governors' races scheduled
this year: Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana contest last Saturday turned out to be a bit of a
political yawner when Gov. Mike Foster, a Republican, easily
brushed aside 10 challengers to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kentucky contest, on Tuesday, looks like another yawner,
because about the only thing in doubt is by how much Gov. Paul
Patton, a Democrat, will win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Mississippi contest, also on Tuesday. This one
is different.
</P>
<P>
   It looks to be close, with final polls showing the two top
candidates, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, and former U.S.
Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican, running neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the issues.
</P>
<P>
   For years, candidates for governor in Mississippi have been
debating what to do about the state's persistently low-ranking
schools and its persistently low-paying jobs. Musgrove and Parker
are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest issue may be the phantom issue: Kirk Fordice,
Mississippi's current governor.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove and Parker are not running against just each other.
They are also running against Fordice, using him as a foil, without
mentioning him directly, for competing campaign pitches and
feel-good television commercials that focus on family values, one
of the hottest political issues of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no issue is hotter in conservative, Bible-belt
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Fordice, a Republican who is not eligible to
run for a third term under state law, has been making headlines
with his efforts to divorce Pat Fordice, his wife of 44 years, so
he can marry an old high school flame he has been publicly
courting. He wants Mrs. Fordice to decamp the Executive Mansion
(she refuses to go), and he has had a number of loud and unpleasant
exchanges with reporters assigned to cover him.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mississippians, Republicans as well as Democrats, say they
are fed up with the story of marital infidelity in the Executive
Mansion, coming as it has on the heels of the story of marital
infidelity in the White House (Fordice called frequently for
President Clinton's resignation). They say they are embarrassed for
their state.
</P>
<P>
   John Grisham, the Mississippi lawyer turned best-selling
novelist, is a Musgrove supporter. But he said the other day that
``after eight years of Kirk Fordice'' just about any ``decent
person'' of whatever political ilk would do as a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Grisham said, ``Jesse Ventura would look good, or
Hulk Hogan, or anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Musgrove and Parker are trying to outdo each other over
how much more money to pour into Mississippi's schools and what
bait to use to lure more high-paying industries to the state, so
they also are trying to outdo each other when it comes to their
commitment to family values.
</P>
<P>
   When Fordice showed up the other day for a Parker fund-raiser,
at which Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was the headline speaker, he
was given a seat in the back row, as good a measure as any of how
much distance Parker is trying to put between himself and the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   When Musgrove and Parker are out on the campaign trail, their
wives often accompany them, standing prominently on the podium.
Both candidates are running television commercials featuring family
members.
</P>
<P>
   One of Musgrove's advertisements shows his son, Jordan, in a
classroom, raising his hand to ask a question. Another has Musgrove
chatting warmly with his wife, Melanie, and their daughter, Carmen
Rae.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign speeches, Musgrove talks of ``tax relief for
families'' and of how better schools make for stronger families.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Parker's advertisements show him fishing and hunting
with his children and talking to his mother about dirty campaign
tactics. In another, he tells of courting his wife, Rosemary, and
at the end he gives her a loving hug and says:
</P>
<P>
   ``She's smarter than I am and I'm smart enough to know that. I
think she'd make a great first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Musgrove, who is 42, and Parker, 50, sound in their
speeches and commercials as if they are delivering each other's
campaign spiels, perhaps no great surprise given that Mississippi
is one of those Deep South states in which Democrats are coming
more and more to resemble Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised debate here on Monday night, Musgrove said, ``We
have to improve our schools and upgrade our economic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker countered, ``What Mississippians want is good education
and good-paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two men have their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove accuses Parker of voting to cut health and Social
Security benefits while in Congress. Parker, who did not run for a
sixth term last year, counters that he voted only to balance the
budget and calls Musgrove's accusations ``disingenuous''
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Parker has been hitting the family-values issue harder
than Musgrove, particularly in his television commercials. Any
discernible results?
</P>
<P>
   When Parker started his campaign early last summer, he trailed
Musgrove by a dozen or so points in the polls. Since then, he has
steadily closed the gap and in the most recent survey was several
points ahead of Musgrove, although the race was still essentially a
dead heat.

COMMENTARY: THE VULTURE CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So I was watching the Marilyn auction with my
sister.
</P>
<P>
   She observed that it was sort of creepy, since the star did not
know all her stuff would be sold, or even know the seller _ Anna
Strasberg, the second wife of Lee, Marilyn's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed obscene that Mrs. Strasberg hauled in a good portion
of the $13.4 million netted from the auction of Marilyn's most
intimate things: her bustiers and baby-doll nighties and oven mitt
and makeup and pots and pans and snapshots of her dog, Maf, and
those sad little notes to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if my plane went down,'' my sister wondered, ``and people
came into my home and pawed through everything? I wouldn't want
them forming an opinion of me by a pair of shoes or jeans or some
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Di and Jackie and Elvis and J.D. Salinger and the duke and
duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich and Garbo and Marilyn _
celebrity detritus is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Christie's and Sotheby's run out of the flotsam and
jetsam of the rich and famous? What if they start rooting around in
the drawers and closets of the indebted and anonymous?
</P>
<P>
   I decided I had better prepare myself for the inevitable
reductio ad absurdum of the vulture culture. Why not enjoy the
profit of my own remains? If one Marilyn wooden hanger could fetch
$4,370, the possibilities seemed limitless for my Hammacher
Schlemmer clothes steamer. So I began busily drafting the auction
catalog for my many priceless effects.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 5: A pair of gray sweat pants worn while watching ``Some
Like It Hot.'' Estimate: $4 to $9.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 7: Three volumes of the Starr Report, with annotations,
written in blue ink, e.g., ``Wow!'' ``No way!'' Estimate: $40
million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 8: Pair of brown suede stilettos, with a Ferragamo label,
worn when it suddenly hit me in 1992 that Ross Perot was a complete
nutcake. Estimate: $250.

   Lot 10: One box of Biore pore strips, used before the Gridiron
dinner in 1998. Estimate: $1 to $2.

   Lot 12: Collection of frothing letters from American Express.
Best of lot, sent on Oct. 15, 1999, reads: ``If you do not send
$3,567.80 immediately, we will take steps that will amaze you.''
Estimate: $3,567.80.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 25: Vintage fur-trimmed sweater worn in 1994 to an Easter
Mass at Blessed Sacrament, where I gave the ``handshake of peace''
to Pat Buchanan. Estimate: $8,000 to $10,000. Sold to benefit World
Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 44: Letter from Kato Kaelin complaining about the way I
wrote about him in a column. Letter reads, in part, ``I must say,
in regards to the `shaggy blond pool boy-moocher' (are you sure
it's not, smoocher?), if I was any smarter, I'd be insulted!''
Estimate: $2 to $3. Proceeds to Literacy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 91: A Strom Thurmond letter opener given to me by Strom
Thurmond when he was only 91. Estimate: $91.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 100: Fork with sticky curry residue from the Bombay Club,
nervously clutched as self-defense weapon when Monica Lewinsky
confronted me at the restaurant to ask why I wrote such tart
columns about her. Estimate: $25.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 110: Books sent to me by friends who are writers. Spines
uncracked. Estimate: $2.

ABC's ``Nightline,'' critiquing President Bush's first State of the
Union address. The performance was singled out in a book on Ted
Koppel as the worst show in ``Nightline'' history. Estimate upon
request.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 125: A Marilyn Quayle key chain. Estimate: $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 150: Pink phone message that reads ``Warren Beatty is
holding.'' Estimate: $20.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 173: Printouts of encouraging e-mails from readers calling

COMMENTARY: THE LAST 100 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know how Al Gore will do in the upcoming race. I think
he's got a lot more substance than the press has given him credit
for. But if Gore's candidacy does go down early, it could have one
interesting side effect. It might actually free up the Clinton
administration to govern in its final months without worrying about
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Having missed out on its first 100 days _ due to a variety of
scandals and mishaps _ the Clinton administration could be the
first in history to be known for its last 100 days. Imagine if the
president, unconstrained by any campaign, actually felt free to do
only the right things in foreign policy with his last 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the speech Clinton would give:
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, I intend to use these last 100 days to
make up for some of the mistakes in the previous 2,820. The first
thing I will do is something I never did in foreign policy _ set
some clear priorities. My last 100 days are going to focus on the
two biggest relationships we have _ Russia and China _ because
unless we manage those right, the rest won't matter. With Russia I
did the wrong thing and with China I failed to do the right thing.
Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's start with Russia. We never had it in our power to
determine how the democratic experiment in Russia would come out.
We did have it in our power, though, to make Russia a less
dangerous place and a less angry and isolated place _ no matter how
its experiment evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, driven by a need to win Polish votes in the
Midwest, I opted to do just the opposite. We expanded NATO, which,
in one fell swoop, alienated the Russian elites, undermined our
moderate, pro-Western allies inside Russia, and so angered the
Russian Duma that it refused to ratify the Start II treaty, which
would have cut Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal in half.
Madeleine and Strobe kept telling me we could expand NATO and get
START II. But it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics of arms control say: `No problem. We don't need
Start II. Our strength will protect us.' What these guys don't
grasp is that it's not Russia's strength that threatens us. It's
Russia's weakness. I'm not worried about Russia using a nuke. I'm
afraid of it losing a nuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is not that a strong Russia will launch a missile
at us, but that in a weak Russia one will fall off the back of a
truck and end up in Iraq. And the way to reduce that threat is by
making Start II and Russian integration in the West our top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, on this eve of Russian presidential elections, I am
announcing the following: The United States will support bringing
Russia into NATO and the EU by 2010, provided Russia meets a
specific set of democratic, legal, arms-control and economic
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the top politicians in Russia today are just corrupt
old Bolsheviks, but by the next election in 2004, you are going to
have a new generation running that gets it. I want to empower these
young Russians in their internal fights with Russia's old guard by
laying out a clear, strategic pathway for them. I want these young
Russians to know, and to be able to say, that if they make the
right choices, Russia will get what it wants and what we should
want _ that it become part of a free and undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for China, we don't have the power to transform China. But
we do have the power to make it a more open, rules-based society.
We have a great tool for doing that _ bringing China into the World
Trade Organization, which would force upon it a set of legal norms,
and a degree of openness, that would be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a WTO deal, U.S. Internet firms would be much freer to
invest in China and the Chinese would have many more ways to
interact with the world _ without having to go through their
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a huge mistake last April when I let John Podesta, Gene
Sperling and Bob Rubin talk me out of finishing the WTO deal with
Zhu Rongji when he was here. We could have had it. But after all
the support we had gotten from House Democrats on the Monica thing,
my aides didn't want to rile up the Dems and the unions by pushing
through WTO for China. So I let the deal go. I regret that, and I'm
going to fight to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, every time I did the politically hard thing _
Kosovo, NAFTA, the Middle East _ I made history. And every time I
did the politically expedient thing, I made trouble. I'm going to
use these last 100 days to fix both China and Russia. And while I
am at it, I'm going to lift the embargo on Cuba too. I never did
like Florida anyway.''

CENSUS FIGHT IS PUT ON HOLD UNTIL COUNT IS COMPLETED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three years of partisan wrangling,
legislative brinkmanship and legal suits, a strange new mood has
enveloped the battle over the 2000 census: peace.
</P>
<P>
   With neither side able to impose its will on the other,
Republicans and Democrats have halted their fight over whether the
Census Bureau can use a method called statistical sampling to
supplement the next census.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lawmakers have decided to wait until after the census
is completed next year to resume their fight. At that point they
will battle over whether population figures derived from sampling
can be used to draw boundaries for congressional and state
legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been in a war zone for the last three
years,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who has led the fight
in the House for sampling. ``Right now, what we've got is a
truce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to have the Census Bureau
produce two official sets of population figures. First, the bureau
will count as many people as it can by using conventional methods:
sending out mail-back forms and then dispatching census takers to
those households that failed to return the forms. Then the bureau
will use sampling techniques _ interviewing residents from a sample
of 300,000 households _ and use that information to adjust the
original count.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians say sampling is much more accurate than
traditional means. But because it will probably result in an
increase in the number of people, mainly immigrants and inner-city
black and Hispanic residents, in historically Democratic areas,
both parties view sampling as benefiting Democrats and hurting
Republicans when legislative lines are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the next president must give the states official
population counts for redistricting by April 1, 2001, less than
three months after being inaugurated. Last year, in cases brought
by House Republicans and conservative groups, the Supreme Court
ruled that the use of sampling for reapportionment, the
determination of each state's allocation of seats in the House,
violated federal law. But the justices did not rule on whether
sampling could be used for redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the battle over which set of figures a state will
use in redistricting will be fought out first in state legislatures
and then ultimately in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides predict that there will be a flurry of lawsuits _
perhaps at least one in every state, from political parties, civil
rights groups, conservative legal foundations, cities and suburban
counties _ to either compel or prohibit states from redistricting
based on population counts that have been adjusted through
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with little prospect of winning a fight in Congress
over sampling and eager not to be seen as harming the conduct of
the census, both parties have halted their battle and, with tightly
clenched smiles, begun cooperating to a degree that even they find
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have stopped suggesting that Republicans are racist
for opposing sampling. And Republicans have toned down their
anti-sampling statements for now because they are betting that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas will win the White House next year and
that, for redistricting purposes, a Bush administration will
provide only population figures reached through conventional
census-taking methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an era of peace and harmony,'' a Republican House
staff member said. ``The battle-hardened side of me is sort of
shocked and wondering what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who had threatened to withhold money from the Census
Bureau if it insisted on using sampling are now throwing
unprecedented amounts into the census, even offering to quadruple
the record $100 million that the bureau is planning to spend on
advertising to promote the census.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Republican opponents of sampling and Democratic
proponents of sampling have held joint news conferences to praise
the bureau's plans and to encourage House members of both parties
to form partnerships with the census offices in their home
districts to help promote greater participation by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further battling on the big issue of sampling doesn't gain us
anything, since we know it's going to be decided in the courts,''
the Republican House staff member said. ``Also, there is a feeling
that as we run up to the census, it's best to try to assist the
bureau rather than blast it. We want to build participation, and
not bring down participation.''

A PAIR OF PAIRS INSPIRE EACH OTHER AT SKATE AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NANCY GAVILANES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ The reigning world pairs champions,
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, were the heavy favorites
going into this weekend's Skate America competition, but after
Friday night's short program the Russians were a surprising fourth.
Not that they were worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be skating our whole life without some problems,
without some mistakes, it's not possible,'' said Sikharulidze after
Berezhnaya fell on the pair's side-by-side triple toe loop and
stepped out of the throw triple loop. ``Tomorrow, we will keep our
attention, and we'll try to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That positive attitude is something the pair has absorbed from
their coach, the legendary Tamara Moskvina. She is a firm believer
that skaters can sometimes learn more after skating a rough program
than a clean one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make it a tragedy,'' Moskvina said Friday night,
``we'll gain something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskvina isn't worried about the team's less-than-flawless start
because Skate America is, after all, their first competition of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sikharulidze, the mistakes in the program will just
motivate them to skate better and guard against complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're leader, it's very difficult to go forward every
time,'' he said, ``and you just want to just keep what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the pair will get motivation not only at competitions
but also in their own backyard, Ice House in Hackensack, N.J.,
where they share the practice rink with Kyoko Ina and John
Zimmerman of the United States. Also in Moskvina's all-star lineup
at Ice House are Artur Dmitriev and Natalya Mishkeutonok, the 1992
Olympic pairs champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good atmosphere,'' said Moskvina who coaches all
three pairs with her husband. ``They support each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation inspires Ina, who with Zimmerman, stands fifth in
the Skate America pairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get much better than training with world and Olympic
champions every day,'' said Ina. ``It's also like we're traveling
with our teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only Ina and Zimmerman's second season together, and
their inexperience may have contributed to their mistake on a lift
at the end of their short program Friday night. According to
Zimmerman, the timing was off on their footwork entering the lift.
Instead of putting Ina at risk of a dangerous fall, he opted to set
her down early.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the Americans skated a clean program that
included solid side by side triple toes, a double twist and a throw
triple salchow. Still, Ina and Zimmerman have more modest goals for
Skate America than Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no expectations,'' said Ina, who won two U.S. titles
with her former partner, Jason Dunjen, and finished fourth at the
Nagano Olympics in 1998. ``We're just going to start the program
and hopefully finish on a high note.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Moskvina has higher hopes for the Americans, who
finished second at last year's nationals. ``He's a very handsome
boy and she's very tough cookie,'' she said. ``Together, they'll go
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my best to have them become the best couple in the
States and one of the best couples in the world,'' said Moskvina,
who coached Dmitriev and Mishkeutonok to Olympic gold in 1992 and
Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova to gold in 1998. ``That is not our
dream,'' Moskvina said, referring to Ina and Zimmerman, ``it is our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leaders after Skate America's short program,
which counts for 33 percent of the total score, were Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier of Canada. The Canadian team nailed their throw
triple salchow, side-by-side triple toe jumps and their double
twist. Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Muller of Germany and Sarah Abitol
and Stephanie Bernadis of France are in second and third place.

AMID PAKISTANI POVERTY, OPULENT PALACE OF EX-PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RAIWIND, Pakistan _ The Mogul emperor Shah Jahan had the Taj
Mahal. Louis XIV had Versailles. And Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
was going to have Jati Umrah _ until the Pakistani army
unceremoniously booted him out of power this month, impounding his
palatial home.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sharif was tantalizing close to moving into the
lavish new 22-room mansion that had come to symbolize a man who
talked like a populist, but lived like a king in a land of paupers.
</P>
<P>
   The military has doubtless been sorely tempted to make the
Sharifs' sprawling estate exhibit A in its campaign to portray him
as a grasping, power-mad politician who plundered the public
treasury to build an empire _ but they have been wary of appearing
mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, an industrialist whose family made an even bigger
fortune after he went into politics, has not been seen or heard
from since the Oct. 12 coup, though the military says he is safe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, badgered by journalists hungry for a peek,
officers have shown the grounds, driving past the private zoo, down
the poplar-lined lanes and through farmland amassed by the Sharifs.
But getting inside the mansion has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an army officer, who insisted his name not be used,
said the Sharifs were unhappy about the publicity. ``The keys are
with them,'' he said. ``We can't violate their privacy. You won't
be able to see the chandeliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the heavily guarded compound, a watchman was present at
Sharif's imposing new Mediterranean-style villa, and a back door
that led into a huge and stunning kitchen was open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather difficult to comprehend for a Third World country,''
said the army officer, shaking his head in amazement as he stood in
the kitchen of stainless steel and freshly varnished wood that was
big enough to hold four mud huts of the poor. ``There's no money
like new money.''
</P>
<P>
   On display inside the house was the kind of gaudy, eye-popping,
nouveau riche opulence that would make Donald Trump smile.
</P>
<P>
   There were, it seemed, acres of floors in every hue of marble _
dusky pink and forest green and porcelain blue. There were ceilings
adorned with friezes of roses hand-painted shades of apricot and
mint. There were inlaid oak floors, walls paneled in silken fabrics
and rococo chairs laden with so much gold leaf they looked as if
they belonged in the court of Louis XIV or a bordello.
</P>
<P>
   In a central hall with a soaring, sky-lighted atrium, two
stuffed lions _ real lions _ appeared to be stalking their prey
from the small platforms where they were mounted.
</P>
<P>
   And all along the edges of a swirling marble staircase that
swept up to the second floor, where the private rooms were locked,
there were plastic bouquets of flowers in blue, red and pink
affixed as ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the magically smooth, four-lane highway _ mostly
empty _ that leads to the Sharif family compound is the Sharif
family hospital, an immaculate state-of-the-art white elephant said
to have cost $15 million and never to have had more than 50
patients in its 300 beds since it opened in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch of the family, Mian Muhammad Sharif, had 2,885
workmen labor around the clock to finish the hospital in a year. He
is widely believed to be a domineering force in the lives of his
sons _ Nawaz, the former prime minister, and Shahbaz, the former
chief minister of the state of Punjab, who are both now under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, there were only 15 patients for 40 doctors, 60
nurses and almost 300 other staff members to care for. The white
marble corridors were deserted and the rooms filled with empty,
tautly made-up beds _ this in a country where almost half the 150
million people have no access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rafique Anwar, who runs the hospital for the family,
conceded that it was a little off the beaten path here in Raiwind,
about 12 miles from Lahore. But those concerns were dismissed by
the Sharif patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman overruled everything,'' Anwar said. ``He said if
you make a quality hospital, patients will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharifs' Raiwind ventures seem to have attracted more
interest from investigative reporters and opposition politicians
than from the sick and lame.
</P>
<P>
   In June of last year, the monthly magazine Newsline and the
weekly newspaper Friday Times published articles about the Sharifs'
accumulation of hundreds of acres of valuable farmland and use of
public funds to develop their estate, named Jati Umra after their
ancestral Punjabi village.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, after the United States imposed economic
sanctions on Pakistan following its nuclear tests, the prime
minister called on the people to drink less tea and scrimp on
cooking oil _ and promised to confiscate more than a million acres
of farmland from feudal landlords for redistribution to peasants.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming hypocrisy of a man who was a self-made feudal lord
preaching sacrifice and land reform was irresistible to Sharif's
rivals, who pounced gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to live like a king,'' said Ameer-ul-Azim, spokesman
for Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's main religious political party.
``It is the family's ambitiousness. They are very much inspired by
the Moguls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was apparently outraged by the criticism, and his
government began striking out at the journalists who had dared
write and print such articles. Amir Mir, who wrote the Newsline
article, said he had been harassed by the police and subjected to
threatening phone calls from men who promised to break his legs. He
fled the country in July.
</P>
<P>
   Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times, was abducted in the wee
hours from his Lahore home by Punjab state policemen and held
incommunicado for more than a month before he was released.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions raised by Jati Umrah refused to die.
Pakistan's military rulers are now saying corruption charges may be
brought against the former prime minister. And the Sharifs' Raiwind
estate is now back exactly where they did not want it to be _ in
the news.

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Juror No. 1 was struck by how Latrell Sprewell's
fingers curled long and thin like water from a drinking fountain,
how his array of eye glasses and finely crafted braids made him
look bookish but hip, how respectful and nonthreatening he appeared
as the defendant in a civil trial almost four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   During courtroom breaks, he paced in his tailored suits, stopped
by a stroller to visit his newborn son and made eye contact with
everyone he spoke to. It was easy for some of the jurors to be
enamored of his presence _ and for most of them to be won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was cocky, but I have to say, when he's sitting
there, he's a beautiful-looking guy,'' said juror No. 1, Nancy
Hurwitz-Kors, who was against the California jury's favorable
decision toward Sprewell when it ordered him to pay $105,000 to the
two plaintiffs who were seeking close to $3 million after being
injured in a March 1998 automobile accident. ``If he had come
across differently, if the jurors had been afraid of him, it might
have been a different outcome, but they weren't afraid of him. He
probably worked at that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, finding forgiveness seems to come so easily for
Sprewell. Despite each transgression, he has not only gained
acceptance from the Madison Square Garden fans who crave his
frenetic playing style, he is also on the verge of signing a
contract extension with the New York Knicks worth tens of millions.
In delicately handling their star, members of Knicks management are
willing to look the other way on his behavior, cross their fingers
on his troubled history and bet that a team with Sprewell can find
its way to the National Basketball Association finals again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, their public relations risk paid off. Since the
Knicks made the trade for Sprewell last January, he has parlayed
his flaws into a fortune, turned his mistakes into a marketing
strategy while creating a popularity that has crossed racial and
economic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a businessman come up to me and say, `My son wants
his hair done like yours,''' Sprewell said after a recent workout.
``I'm like, what have I started here? But I think it's great that
people are open and not afraid to try a different idea, even if
it's just a hair style. For me, I'm not trying to be different or
make any kind of statement. I just don't want to be like everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   He is distinct in style, original in substance. But in many
ways, Sprewell stands before you like an inkblot, something
different to everyone. To some, he's the menacing figure on the
floor, the sinewy player in the No. 8 jersey who growls and flexes
like a cartoon action figure. To others, he is the soft-spoken star
who is refreshingly honest about his missteps. Yes, he missed
training camp for an impromptu road trip. Yes, he should have
called. But this is who he is, no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much the same way as a kid,'' Sprewell said. ``I
can remember there were things I wanted to do _ things maybe my
mother didn't want me to do _ and even if they would get me in
trouble at times, I would do them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly a behavior trait consistent with the team
concept that Coach Jeff Van Gundy emphasizes at every practice,
team meeting and film session. But Van Gundy _ who caught the
glaring stare of Sprewell as he stewed on the bench last year and
who wasn't always pleased with his star's takeover mentality _
doesn't see him as a disciplinary problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has ever shown a lack of respect for me in
that gym,'' Van Gundy said. ``He has tried to do what we wanted.
When I talk about relationships with players, that's when I know I
have a good one. He's willing to be coached and performs at a high
level. Does that mean he's going to like everything? No.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sprewell doesn't agree, he vocalizes it. It was hardly a
problem last year, when Sprewell, fresh off his league suspension,
exhibited mostly model behavior. But there is a notion that the
financial security of a contract extension will create an opening
for Sprewell to act out, ignore authority and be disruptive. Before
he was even offered a deal a week ago, he skipped training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said when he missed training camp, he was wrong,'' Van
Gundy said. ``But I don't know if you can draw from that incident
that there is going to be a pattern of not respecting authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to rationalize their lucrative contract offer to
Sprewell, the Knicks have to ignore a pattern of misbehavior
established by Sprewell. Instead, they have catered to his every
need, first making him a starter and then allowing him to design
his own contract extension. As one Knick player privately noted,
the ``special treatment'' for Sprewell has left some teammates
grumbling about a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there are two rules,'' the player said. ``Is it a
problem? Not if we win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Success fed the Sprewell frenzy last year, at least in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a local basis, he's very popular,'' said Bob Williams,
president of Burns Sports, a Chicago-based marketing firm that
matches athletes to advertisers. ``If he does not perform on the
court this year, I think you could be looking at an ugly situation.
New Yorkers are quick to get down on a player, as they have in the
past. By pushing the envelope on behavior as he does, it doesn't
leave much margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial for And 1, Sprewell sits in a chair
with his hair blown out into an Afro as a hairdresser begins the
braiding process. In a haunting tone, he decries his image as a
nightmare and declares himself the American Dream. The ad was
unique and shocking, just the qualities some fans relate to
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people like the underdog,'' Sprewell said, trying to
explain his rapport with the New York fans. ``And I've been put in
that situation basically ever since the P.J. incident.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Carlesimo was the Golden State coach who tried to rein in
the star's free spirit two years ago and ended up prying Sprewell's
fingers off his neck. Sprewell has explained the situation as
``just a bad day.'' Take away the violent aspect of the infamous
confrontation, and Sprewell almost seems to see himself as the
symbol of every employee who has longed to stand up to his boss,
but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people identify with that,'' Sprewell said.
``A lot of people go to work and have a difficult time with their
supervisors or bosses or whatever it is. Sometimes, you just want
to tell them how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this in all earnestness, with his eyes focused on yours.
Part of Sprewell's allure, he will tell you, is that he is
articulate and intelligent, a side of himself he puts emphasis on
when he wears clear-lens glasses that are more a fashion accessory
than a necessity. On the flip-side of the brazen emotion he shows
on the court is a man who once majored in social work at the
University of Alabama. Full of contradiction, Sprewell is able to
pull out a personality trait to match any occasion.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked to captivate New York fans, and it served him well
before a California jury. But a deputy sheriff who fingerprinted
Sprewell upon his reckless driving charge that led to the civil
trial had a different take on his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cordial and cooperative,'' said Deputy Sheriff Rudy
Bowers of Contra Costa County in California. ``When I worked the
jail, there was one officer for every 64 inmates, and they act as
gentlemanly as a guy next door. What changes is when they don't get
their way. As far as Latrell Sprewell, I look at him as any other
of these guys. If pushed or if he doesn't feel like he's getting
his way, he can snap at any moment. If you or I had wanted to ram
another car because it was driving slow in front of us, you would
hit the switch that says, `Don't do it.' People like Latrell
Sprewell don't have that switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell admits that he acts on every impulse. And if there is a
fine to pay, so be it. If there is a punishment that comes along,
OK. So far, all has been forgiven. So far, he has been granted New
York's unconditional love.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that's just the way Americans are,'' Sprewell said.
``They like to root for the underdog.''

ABORTION ISSUE RAISES RED FLAGS  
 CONSUMER'S GUIDE TO THE CANDIDATES 
SEEKING NEW RULES FOR A CAMPAIGN TOOL 
MAKING PEACE, MISSOURI-STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine., Mo.)  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By definition, political advertisements are one-sided.
Sometimes, if they are outrageously inaccurate or tasteless, they
may be rejected by a newspaper or broadcast station. But most news
outlets determinedly avoid censorship of political advertising,
leaving it to the aggrieved candidate to cry foul or to news
reporters to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   But things are different this fall in Maine, where on Tuesday
voters will decide whether to ban a late-term procedure that
opponents call partial-birth abortion, one of the most contentious
issues in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In four instances in recent weeks, television stations WCSH and
WMTW of Portland and WLBZ of Bangor have refused to run
commercials, both pro and con, that deal with the proposed ban or
have required that the spots be modified. The stations said the
commercials were either inaccurate or in questionable taste.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, station executives questioned the accuracy of one
advertisement that said late-term abortions were never necessary
and another that contended the issue was moot because Maine law
already prohibited late-term abortions. The executives argued that
under Maine law, exceptions were sometimes made for late-term
abortions, such as when the health of the mother was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, station executives rejected advertisements
on the grounds that they were too visually provocative for young
viewers or left the impression that abortions routinely involved
healthy late-term fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's governor, Angus King, a political independent, worries
that rejecting political ads or requiring that they be modified
interferes with ``the battle of ideas,'' especially during
campaigns in which the issues are particularly hot and both sides
are trying to compress complicated arguments into 30-second ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stations are taking unto themselves a heavy burden,'' he
declared last week after the latest rejection. ``It raises
troubling questions that they're making political decisions. I
would err on the side of open conversation.''
</P>
<P>

   Seeking New Rules For a Campaign Tool
</P>
<P>
   Few things have had more influence in recent years on the way
political campaigns are run in this country than the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the effect has been so great that the Federal Election
Commission thinks it is time to set some rules and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates, parties and political action committees have
apparently concluded that the Internet is a powerful campaign tool
with the potential to significantly influence the outcome,'' the
commission said in a statement issued on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, there are few guidelines to follow as the nation
crosses this new frontier, as the commission called the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates now raise money, spread their messages and organize
via the Internet. Just about every candidate has a Web site and
hardly a campaign manager can be found who is not pondering some
even more inventive use.
</P>
<P>
   So the commission is asking for comments on how _ and, for that
matter, whether _ it should regulate the new tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission is grappling with the new area of technology
and the application of campaign law to it,'' Scott Thomas, the
chairman, said in calling for questions, suggestions and
observations from campaign workers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be well served,'' he added, ``to get the questions
answered as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Making Peace, Missouri-Style
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri Senate race, one of the most mean-spirited
elections in the country, both candidates professed last week to
want peace.
</P>
<P>
   And then they got into an argument about what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone for months now, ever since Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
moderate Democrat who cannot seek re-election under state law,
decided to try to unseat the state's junior senator, John Ashcroft,
a Christian-right Republican up for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   In a contest that is considered a toss-up and could be among the
most pivotal in determining control of the Senate, the two men have
tangled so far over the death penalty, abortion and race, with the
last issue playing out all last week and into the weekend after
Republicans began spreading around a 1960 photo of Carnahan
participating in a blackface minstrel show.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a threat to his hold on the state's large, traditionally
Democratic black vote, Carnahan issued a speedy apology for having
taken part in ``this kind of theater'' and insisted he had
``grown'' in the intervening 39 years. But the Republicans would
not let the issue die, and a contest that was already ugly began to
grow downright nasty as charge and countercharge were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, the chairmen of the Missouri Democratic and
Republican Parties were calling for a truce, a call that quickly
degenerated into a battle of faxes and press releases. Whereupon
the governor and senator began trying to reach each other by phone
to set up some kind of peace parley.
</P>
<P>
   Or so their aides said, though one of them, Steve Hilton of the
Ashcroft staff, went a step further, and probably came closer to
the truth than anyone else, when he observed that such a highly
publicized peace effort ``inevitably has the air of, perhaps, a
gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on Friday, the senator and the governor had their
peace talks, though argument, it appears, would be a better word.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said afterward, through Hilton, that the talk had been
``even and businesslike'' and that he had made the point that there
would be no peace between him and the governor until the governor
and his fellow Missouri Democrats demonstrated good faith by ending
their practice of ``hate politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Carnahan replied, via fax:
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress will not be made if every conversation we have is
merely a new chance to level old accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Scary Halloween Masks
</P>
<P>
   This being Halloween, herewith the percentage results when Fox
News pollsters asked 705 people which of the Election 2000
presidential contenders would make ``the scariest Halloween mask:''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan 27, Gore 22, Bush 10, Forbes 10, McCain 6 and Bauer 4.
</P>
<P>
   Margin of error: Plus or minus four percentage points.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Far more than has been previously disclosed, the
``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art has been
financed by companies and individuals with a direct commercial
interest in the works of the young British artists in the show,
according to court documents and interviews with people involved in
the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with rising costs and the unwillingness of major
corporations to support the show _ whose works have provoked
furious protests in London and more recently in New York _ Arnold
L. Lehman, the museum's director, embarked this summer on an
aggressive campaign to finance ``Sensation'' by other means.
</P>
<P>
   He and his assistants raised hundreds of thousands of dollars
from those who stood to profit most from the exhibition of
contemporary art, a practice that other museum executives say was
practically unheard of and ethically problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said as much when he began a legal
campaign to close the show, accusing museum officials not only of
recklessly staging an exhibition of vulgar and sacrilegious art,
but also of conspiring with the owner of the ``Sensation''
collection, Charles Saatchi, to inflate the value of the works on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's lawyers have dropped the conspiracy issue, but the
financial arrangements behind the ``Sensation'' exhibition, which
have surfaced in the court battle between the museum and the mayor,
are highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and his assistants solicited donations of at least
$10,000 from dealers who represented many of the artists whose
works are on display. They offered Christie's special access to the
museum to entertain clients in the market for contemporary art.
They secured a pledge of $160,000 from Saatchi and then they
attempted to conceal his financial support from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, Lehman insisted that commercial
considerations had never entered his discussions with those who
donated money to the exhibition, which he estimated would cost the
museum $2 million. He said those who agreed to give money were
motivated by their enthusiasm for an important body of art, not by
any desire for profit. In any event, Lehman asserted, the
exhibition has not increased the market value of any works by the
``Sensation'' artists.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has highlighted the hidden conflicts confronted by
museum executives who struggle to finance exhibitions with
donations from corporations, foundations and wealthy individuals.
At stake is nothing less than the museum's independence and
integrity, experts in museum ethics say. Museums have a public
trust to display art on the basis of merit, and they are sure to
suffer if they are viewed as instruments for private financial
gain, those experts say.
</P>
<P>
   This is why many cultural institutions, including the Brooklyn
Museum, have rules against displaying works that are for sale. At
the same time, the line between art sponsorship and corporate
profits appears to be eroding, as some art critics noted when, for
example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held an exhibition in 1997
of Cartier jewelry from the early 20th century. The show was
sponsored by Cartier.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sensation'' exhibition, however, has blurred the line
between art and commerce to a highly unusual degree, several
current and former museum officials said in interviews last week.
Neither they nor officials at the Brooklyn Museum could cite
another exhibition that so directly linked the art on display with
the financial interests of the exhibition's major underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to a letter written by Lehman, a
representative of the museum asked Saatchi to guarantee the entire
cost of the exhibition. Saatchi, who has earned substantial profits
buying and selling contemporary art, declined but agreed to cover
the insurance for the exhibition. Art experts said such insurance
could cost tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   David Bowie, the popular rock musician, pledged a personal
donation of about $75,000 and agreed to provide the voice-over for
the exhibit audio tour without charge. Soon after, his private,
for-profit Internet company was given the right to display the
``Sensation'' exhibition on Bowie's personal Web site,
-www.davidbowie.com, which sells art, clothing and memberships to
Bowie's fan club. While Bowie's financial contribution has been
kept in confidence by museum officials, traffic on the Bowie Web
site has more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gagosian, a prominent contemporary art dealer in New York
City who is a friend of Saatchi's and who also represents several
of the artists in ``Sensation,'' said he had paid $10,000 for
tickets to a ``Sensation'' fund-raising dinner. Museum officials
solicited contributions from other major contemporary art dealers.
In a letter to an associate, Lehman wrote that the dealers'
contributions were in ``their own best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it has been known for months that Christie's
contributed $50,000 toward the exhibition, the documents reveal for
the first time the extent to which Christie's was allowed to use
its sponsorship to promote sales in its coming auction of
contemporary art. The auction will include works by some of the
``Sensation'' artists, and for its donation Christie's was given,
among other benefits, ``unlimited opportunities to entertain in the
museum during the run of the exhibition with the $5,000 rental fee
to be waived,'' according to an internal Christie's memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Museum scholars have reacted to the arrangements with dismay.
``If I was on that board, I'd either resign or have the heads of
all the staff who are involved,'' said Marie C. Malaro, who retired
last year as director of the graduate program in museum studies at
George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Ms. Malaro, a
lawyer who has written books and papers on museum ethics and
governance, described the financing of ``Sensation'' as an extreme
example of a pattern that emerged when the notion of corporate
philanthropy gave way to corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old idea of corporate philanthropy is that it's supposed
to be a gift to the public, and once you cross that line, it's no
wonder you get into situations like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, known for being adept at boosting museum attendance
through aggressive marketing tactics, defended his fund-raising as
no different from what other museum directors have done. It is
naive, he said, to think that banks, insurance companies or
utilities sponsor art exhibitions without any thought to the
business benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations are giving money for marketing purposes, for
publicity purposes, for promotional purposes, for whatever reason
that is ultimately going to support their business, and that's
nothing to be ashamed of,'' he said. ``I'm not ashamed of it,
they're not ashamed of it, and if they didn't do that, if they
didn't believe that they were going to somehow be able to put
themselves forward, whether it is to their client base or the world
at large, they wouldn't give this money.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Lehman has identified several other instances
where private collections have been exhibited in public museums. He
named the National Gallery of Art, in Washington. A spokeswoman
there, however, said the gallery forbade auction houses and dealers
from contributing money to exhibitions of private collections. ``We
are careful to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest
in dealing with or accepting financial support from the commercial
art market,'' the spokeswoman, Patricia O'Connell, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also named the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Last week,
officials for the museum, in Richmond, reviewed the last 10 years
of exhibitions there, encompassing 168 shows. ``In none of those
exhibitions,'' said Suzanne D. Hall, a spokeswoman, ``do any of the
museum staff see an occasion when we received money from a private
collector or an auctioneer or a gallery owner to help mount the
exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities on museum ethics say that potential conflicts
of interest are best handled when they are fully disclosed to the
public. While officials at the Brooklyn Museum of Art made
Christie's involvement public, they tried to conceal Saatchi's
financial support, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Trippi, vice director of the museum, was asked by a
reporter for The New York Observer last month whether Saatchi had
contributed money toward the exhibit. At the time, Saatchi had
already sent $50,000. In a memo to several museum officials,
including Lehman, Trippi described his response to the reporter.
``I said no,'' Trippi said, underlining the words for emphasis and
adding at the end of the memo, ``I hope this works for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman enthusiastically endorsed Trippi's response to the
reporter. ``Peter _ great,'' he wrote on the memo, twice
underlining the word ``great.'' In Thursday's interview, Lehman
said that museum officials concealed Saatchi's involvement not out
of discomfort about how the public might view the arrangement but
simply to honor Saatchi's wish to remain an anonymous donor.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi's ownership of the collection proved a major obstacle to
Lehman's fund-raising, documents show. Lehman described the problem
in a memo to Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the museum board.
``Almost no private individual wants to put money into Saatchi's
pocket,'' he wrote, explaining his dismal success in persuading
wealthy philanthropists to support the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by city lawyers about such statements, Lehman said,
``Their response was, `We are a private collector; he is a private
collector. Why would I give money to show his exhibition?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, impressed by the huge crowds that attended ``Sensation''
in London and Berlin, said he was determined to create the same
buzz for the often-overlooked Brooklyn Museum. He joked in the
interview that he still has scabs on his knees from begging Saatchi
for financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Saatchi's $160,000 commitment, Lehman announced
plans to mount the exhibit. Both men vehemently denied that
Saatchi's financial backing was in any way motivated by a desire to
increase the value of Saatchi's considerable investment in
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saatchi is clear that if he wanted to collect cash instead of
art, he would have spent 30 years buying Picasso and Matisse _
infinitely more prestigious, a safer and much more profitable
investment,'' Jenny L. Blyth, curator of the Saatchi Gallery in
London, said in a written statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no plans, and never have been, to sell any works in
`Sensation,' either now or in the future, through Christie's or by
any other means,'' Ms. Blyth said.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement, however, did not address the question of whether
Saatchi planned to sell other works produced by the artists in
``Sensation.'' He did just that in 1998, after ``Sensation'' had
been seen by 300,000 people at the Royal Academy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Using Christie's as his auction house, Saatchi sold 130 works
for $2.7 million. Saatchi gave a small portion of the proceeds to
finance scholarships at London art schools. But most of the money,
several London newspapers subsequently reported, was spent on
commissioning new work for Saatchi's collection.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Ms. Blyth said Saatchi ``sells art in order to
buy more art, or to finance his museum, or as in the case of the
Christie's auction last year, to create scholarships at five London
art schools and to offer commissions to artists recommended by
those art schools.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It is hoped that some of those commissioned works
will be successful, enter the collection and be exhibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's history with Saatchi has raised questions about the
company's motivations for sponsoring ``Sensation'' in Brooklyn.
Christie's also sponsored the show in London.
</P>
<P>
   Andree B. Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said the
company's $50,000 donation had nothing to do with increasing
Christie's profits. ``Our sponsorship was in support of the
Brooklyn Museum of Art,'' she said. ``They contacted us.'' And
Edward Dolman, Christie's managing director in New York, said in
court papers that the $50,000 was not a lot of money compared with
Christie's donations to other museums.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an internal Christie's memorandum, the $50,000
``represents Christie's most significant financial commitment to an
external exhibition to date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us capitalize on it as much as possible,''
Allison Whiting, director of museum services at Christie's, wrote
in the memo.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whiting proposed several ways of using Christie's
sponsorship to generate interest in Christie's annual November
auction of contemporary art, which will include works by some
``Sensation'' artists. She suggested placing an advertisement and
an essay in Christie's catalog for the November auction. She
proposed mailing exhibition invitations to some 700 of Christie's
biggest contemporary art clients in London and the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   The ``benefits of sponsorship,'' Ms. Whiting wrote, included
special acknowledgments on exhibition signs, in the museum's
monthly bulletin, on the invitations and in advertisements. At the
opening night gala at the museum, hundreds of guests were handed
Christie's bags. Inside each was a certificate good for a free
catalog to Christie's contemporary art auction next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lehman aggressively solicited Saatchi and Christie's
for financing, it was David Bowie who sought out Lehman first.
</P>
<P>
   In April, days after the museum's plans to mount the exhibit
were revealed, Bowie's business manager called Lehman. Without
identifying Bowie, the business manager, Bill Zysblat, said he had
a client who was interested in backing the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Zysblat said in an interview that Bowie offered a donation
because he liked the art and felt strongly that Americans should
see it. Bowie is also a friend of Saatchi and some of the
``Sensation'' artists. He owns some of their art, including an
early Damien Hirst painting, Zysblat said. Hirst is better known in
New York for dead animals suspended in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was delighted, and when Zysblat subsequently revealed his
client's identity, Lehman asked whether Bowie would like to do the
voice-over for the audio tour of the exhibition. Bowie agreed to do
it without charge.
</P>
<P>
   While the museum was still waiting for Bowie's donation to
arrive _ museum officials initially were hoping for $100,000 _
Zysblat began asking about the possibility of putting the
``Sensation'' exhibition and Bowie's audio tour on Bowie's web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is owned by Ultrastar Internet Services, a company
Bowie formed with Zysblat and several other associates last year.
Zysblat said Bowie wanted to use the Internet to expose more people
to the art. ``We're always looking for content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zysblat said that although Ultrastar paid nothing for the right
to put the exhibit on Bowie's Internet site, it spent about $70,000
on the technical cost of doing so. It has been a huge success for
Ultrastar. Bowie's Web site averages two million visitors a month;
in the first three weeks after ``Sensation'' opened, his site was
visited by 7.5 million users, Zysblat said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said that the museum recently received Bowie's donation,
but he would not specify the amount. He said he did not know
whether Bowie wanted the amount to be made public, but he
emphasized that there was no connection between the donation and
the decision to give Bowie's Internet company rights to
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman argues that such unorthodox intersections of art and
commerce benefit the public. Without them, he said, museums would
find it difficult to finance major exhibitions of controversial
works, particularly by new artists.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are already criticized for cashing in on blockbuster
shows by crowd-pleasing artists like Monet and Cezanne. ``What
happens is we then move into the sphere where museums get
criticized similarly for doing the safe, and the easy, and the
sure-fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's the kind of argument that is so
self-defeating.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Far more than has been previously disclosed, the
``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art has been
financed by companies and individuals with a direct commercial
interest in the works of the young British artists in the show,
according to court documents and interviews with people involved in
the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with rising costs and the unwillingness of major
corporations to support the show _ whose works have provoked
furious protests in London and more recently in New York _ Arnold
L. Lehman, the museum's director, embarked this summer on an
aggressive campaign to finance ``Sensation'' by other means.

   He and his assistants raised hundreds of thousands of dollars

OUTDOORS: BOOKS FOR FANS OF FLY-FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin Francis has carried his fascination with the wondrous
trout streams of the Catskills and the region's seminal role in the
development of fly-fishing in the United States to a celebratory
level with his ``Land of Little Rivers'' (The Beaverkill Press,
hardcover, 276 pages, illustrated, $100).
</P>
<P>
   A business communications consultant and an ardent
fly-fisherman, Francis is the author of ``Catskill Rivers,
Birthplace of American Fly Fishing'' (Nick Lyons Books-Winchester
Press, 1983), a title every Catskill trout-stream buff should own.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of his latest book. Immersed as he is in the
region's history and magic, Francis evidently felt _ and I hope he
will pardon me for this gratuitous excursion into his motivations _
that a traditional history, albeit often inspired, of the
Catskills' streams didn't capture their natural beauty. Hence the
birthing of ``Land of Little Rivers,'' a visually stunning
achievement. Printed in Italy by Stamperia Valdonega and
distributed by W.W. Norton &AMP; Co., most of its color photographs
were taken by Enrico Ferorelli, a contributor to National
Geographic and Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``A Story in Photos of Catskill Fly Fishing,'' this is
a big, handsome picture book with historic and literary punch, a
felicitous blend of illustrations and text. The photographs convey
the glories and mystery of the streams, and the author's graceful
text _ photographs and sparse captions can never do it all _
provides a look at the lives and contributions of key figures in
the world of fly-fishing who dwelled in the region or were drawn to
it because of their inclinations or their callings.
</P>
<P>
   To get just the book he wanted, Francis said he was also its
creative director and publisher. (The address of the Beaverkill
Press is 55 E. 76th St., New York, N.Y. 10021.) ``To be the
publisher,'' he wrote in response to my query in September, ``I had
to invest my own and other people's money _ soon to be more than
$400,000 _ before the first receipts started coming in.'' If
quality determines the economic success of his effort, he need not
worry about receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Lively, Updated History
</P>
<P>
   An updated edition of Paul Schullery's ``American Fly Fishing''
has been issued by the Lyons Press (hardcover, illustrated, 282
pages, $40). This is a carefully researched, well-crafted, lively
history _ the best of its genre and scope _ of the development of
both fresh and saltwater fly-fishing in the United States. In his
afterword, new in this edition, Schullery examines the changes in
attitudes toward fly-fishing and all recreational angling in this
country. He cites the once firmly entrenched notion that trout
waters set aside exclusively for fly-fishing give the fish, when
released, a better chance of survival than released fish caught on
spinning lures. Recent studies, he notes, have shown that this is
not so. Fly-fishing-only regulations, he adds, appear to have only
social arguments _ some might call it selfishness or snobbery on
the part of fly-fishers _ to support them.
</P>
<P>
   A Wealth of Useful Suggestions
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1994, J. Kenney Abrames' ``Striper Moon'' (Frank
Amato, paperback, illustrated, 48 pages, $15.95) deals
provocatively with fly-fishing techniques when wading and flies for
striped bass in estuaries, rivers, bays and surf. A former
charter-boat skipper and a liturgical artist, sculptor and writer,
Abrames, a Rhode Islander, is an intense observer of water,
currents, baitfish and stripers. He constantly ponders the meaning
of what he sees, striving to refine his presentation of fly to
fish. There are enough suggestions in this little book to keep an
accomplished striper fly-fisherman busy all season. It was from
reading ``Striper Moon,'' for example, that I learned that a
marvelously effective way to catch striped bass was by simply
casting my fly from the beach into the alongshore current of
Vineyard Sound off Martha's Vineyard and letting it swing about,
without retrieving it, until it straightened out below me. It
became even more productive when I understood under what conditions
it worked best: when the bass were simply stationed in the current
waiting for food to be swept to them, rather than slamming about in
all directions after schools of terrified baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   Handy Guide to Casting
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jaworowski, who studied fly-casting under the ebullient and
talented Lefty Kreh and now holds casting clinics of his own across
the country, has written a splendid little fly-casting book,
``Troubleshooting the Cast'' (Stackpole Books, paperback,
illustrated, 78 pages, $12.95). In the book, aided by drawings, he
describes 32 common casting problems and tells how to deal with
them. Although a beginner will certainly benefit from this text, it
is probably the more experienced fly-fisher who will reap the
greatest reward. You've got to have a certain degree of competence
before specific deviations consistently emerge from the welter of
ineptitude.

 NEW YORK: this money.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some authorities on museum ethics say that potential conflicts
of interest are best handled when they are fully disclosed to the
public. While officials at the Brooklyn Museum made Christie's
involvement public, they tried to conceal Saatchi's financial
support, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Trippi, vice director of the museum, was asked by a
reporter for The New York Observer last month whether Saatchi had
contributed money toward the exhibit. At the time, Saatchi had
already sent $50,000. In a memo to several museum officials,
including Lehman, Trippi described his response to the reporter.
``I said no,'' Trippi said, underlining the words for emphasis and
adding at the end of the memo, ``I hope this works for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman enthusiastically endorsed Trippi's response to the
reporter. ``Peter _ great,'' he wrote on the memo, twice
underlining the word ``great.'' In Thursday's interview, Lehman
said that museum officials concealed Saatchi's involvement not out
of discomfort about how the public might view the arrangement but
simply to honor Saatchi's wish to remain an anonymous donor.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, impressed by the huge crowds that attended ``Sensation''
in London and Berlin, said he was determined to create the same
buzz for the often-overlooked Brooklyn Museum. He joked in the
interview that he still has scabs on his knees from begging Saatchi
for financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Saatchi's $160,000 commitment, Lehman announced
plans to mount the exhibit. Both men vehemently denied that
Saatchi's financial backing was in any way motivated by a desire to
increase the value of Saatchi's considerable investment in
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saatchi is clear that if he wanted to collect cash instead of
art, he would have spent 30 years buying Picasso and Matisse _
infinitely more prestigious, a safer and much more profitable
investment,'' Jenny L. Blyth, curator of the Saatchi Gallery in
London, said in a written statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no plans, and never have been, to sell any works in
`Sensation,' either now or in the future, through Christie's or by
any other means,'' Ms. Blyth said.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement, however, did not address the question of whether
Saatchi planned to sell other works produced by the artists in
``Sensation.'' He did just that in 1998, after ``Sensation'' had
been seen by 300,000 people at the Royal Academy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Andree B. Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said the
company's $50,000 donation had nothing to do with increasing
Christie's profits. ``Our sponsorship was in support of the
Brooklyn Museum of Art,'' she said. ``They contacted us.'' And
Edward Dolman, Christie's managing director in New York, said in
court papers that the $50,000 was not a lot of money compared with
Christie's donations to other museums.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an internal Christie's memorandum, the $50,000
``represents Christie's most significant financial commitment to an
external exhibition to date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us capitalize on it as much as possible,''
Allison Whiting, director of museum services at Christie's, wrote
in the memo.

TV SPORTS: ALL-CENTURY TEAM BECAME ALL ABOUT ROSE AND GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those watching the introduction of the all-century team last
Sunday before Game 2 of the World Series surely hoped it would stir
emotions similar to those created at last July's lovefest for Ted
Williams before the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out to be a stilted ceremony consisting of the 18
living players standing up, moving across a platform and sitting
down.
</P>
<P>
   The only real excitement was the huge ovation for Pete Rose, the
career leader in hits and pariah of official baseballdom.
</P>
<P>
   The best possibility of enlivening the ceremony for those
observing it from home was to speak to the players without delaying
the game for long.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few warm and fuzzy moments _ and then it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   That was when NBC correctly went to its reporter, Jim Gray, to
ask Rose if this first step onto a major-league field since he was
banned from the game in 1989 for gambling would lead him to confess
to gambling on baseball. But Gray took on the role of hard-nosed
prosecutor, unrelentingly questioning Rose even as the former
Cincinnati Red demonstrated he would not confess to Gray on
national TV.
</P>
<P>
   The only other NBC interview of one of the 18 living members of
the all-century team, with Hank Aaron, came after a commercial
break.
</P>
<P>
   Having stretched the first pitch by five minutes to 8:10 p.m.,
neither NBC nor major-league baseball wanted to delay the World
Series game any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked NBC to do more interviews, but we felt
pressure to get the ceremony done in the given time,'' said Patrick
Courtney, a spokesman for major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and baseball, knowing how badly the Rose interview went,
should have acted quickly to delay the game another 10 minutes to
speak to Stan Musial and Willie Mays or Ken Griffey Jr. and Warren
Spahn. So the lasting memory of the all-century ceremony was Gray
vs. Rose and the ensuing backlash of phone calls, letters, e-mails
and sports radio venting by fans, leading Gray to apologize to the
aggrieved and overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   The Gray-Rose contretemps made a side issue of legitimate
questions about some players voted on and left off the all-century
team. A panel of 21 experts, whom baseball will not identify,
fashioned a list of 100 players, of whom 25 were chosen in
balloting sponsored by Mastercard International.
</P>
<P>
   Fan voting often produces uneven results in an All-Star Game,
but balloting on 100 years of history is fraught with more
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem was the ballot: It contained no statistics,
only the years of the players' careers. Fans who received their
ballots in copies of Sports Illustrated could have clipped out
accompanying supplements with statistics. Those voting at
major-league baseball's Web site were also able to access
statistics. But ballots at stadiums and Kmarts contained no
numerical aids.
</P>
<P>
   About one-half of the 2.5 million ballots returned to Mastercard
were from sources without immediate statistical references, said
Chris O'Neill, a Mastercard spokesman. How many of those voters
consulted statistical sources is unknown. But how many people carry
``Total Baseball'' to the ball park?
</P>
<P>
   You don't need statistics to vote on no-brainer choices like
Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig. But a ballot without context skews voting
toward the popular (Cal Ripken Jr. as the top shortstop over Honus
Wagner?), the contemporary (Nolan Ryan as the best pitcher?), or
the contemporary and the flat-out wrong (Roger Clemens as the
fourth-best pitcher, over Bob Gibson and Walter Johnson?!?).
</P>
<P>
   A ballot with statistics would have required more space. But,
then, less space on the ballot is given to player names than to an
order form for the all-century team book and a rebate offer for
Microsoft's ``Baseball 2000'' game.
</P>
<P>
   A ballot with statistics would have revealed that four pitchers
with a combined 1,409 victories were deemed unworthy by the fans of
being on the all-century team's six-pitcher staff. Warren Spahn,
No. 10, had 363 victories, the most of any left-hander; Christy
Mathewson, No. 14, and Grover Cleveland Alexander, No. 16, each had
373 victories, and Lefty Grove, No. 18, won 300.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Musial finished 11th in the balloting for the nine
outfielders _ behind Rose, who got the fans' nod as the ninth and
last outfielder. Musial, of course, had 3,630 hits, a .331 career
batting average and 475 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's selection meant that the fan plebiscite not only had
judged him better than Musial, but also better than Roberto
Clemente, Joe Jackson, Reggie Jackson, Tony Gwynn, Carl Yastrzemski
and Frank Robinson, whose resume includes 586 home runs, the
fourth-most in history, and 2,943 career hits.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-ribbon panel, which was empowered to name up to five
players it felt were unfairly omitted by the fans, added Musial,
Wagner, Spahn, Mathewson and Grove. But Robinson, as well as Josh
Gibson and Satchel Paige, whose Negro League statistics are
difficult to tabulate, did not get special dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   Like all lists of this kind, the debate over the all-century
team's selection process will soon be forgotten. The Gray-Rose
incident will fade, too.
</P>
<P>
   For Mastercard, the experience was quite favorable. It got a few
months of publicity, which sponsors covet dearly. ``In a bizarre
way, through all the calls and e-mails, it became like a giant
focus group,'' O'Neill said. ``Through it all, people knew
Mastercard was baseball's partner.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LESSONS OF FLEETING FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you heard that Michael Jordan's restaurant, the burger-fare
establishment on North LaSalle Street in downtown Chicago, is
reinventing itself? Soon it will become Sammy Sosa's, switching
identities in midflight, from slam dunk to grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a moral to this menu manipulation that relates,
primarily, to the transitory nature of fame, when its underlying
motive is greed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's people say it's merely a business dispute _ now in
court _ with the people to whom he sold his naming rights years
ago. The restaurateurs have dared to claim that the retired
legend's popularity has gone into decline. If ever there was
evidence that the National Basketball Association now belongs to a
new generation, there you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Magic has turned 40. Larry is already winding down as Coach
Bird. Charles Barkley says he's quitting after this season, and
might even mean it. Patrick Ewing has devolved into a set prop for
24-hour SpreeTV. Scottie Pippen's latest role is Cub Scout leader
in Portland. John Stockton and Karl Malone ceded control of the
Western Conference, wearing down last time around after 50
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, most valuable player in last June's finals, is the
best player in professional basketball. It is up to Kevin Garnett,
among others, to make the case against an opinion so widely shared.
</P>
<P>
   Step up, as the coaches say, Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Stephon
Marbury, Vince Carter, Grant Hill, Shaq and Kobe, Jason (Kidd) and
Jason (Williams). Prove us wrong. The new rules inhibiting defenses
from Rileying you to death should help.
</P>
<P>
   But the selling of the game is not just about hand-checking and
jump-shooting, and hasn't been since David Stern took over the
corner office at Olympic Tower. There is a challenge for the new
crop of NBA sneaker pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Stern's marketing miracle is clearly at a junction,
if not the crossroads. The sport may be in danger of returning to
the third-class status behind football and baseball that it
previously held, before Stern forged a scratch-my-back partnership
with the networks and shoe companies, helping his players become
endorsement and promotional tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially speaking, no one in the history of professional
sports was bigger than Jordan, and few have had the capacity, or
audacity, to so consistently live up to the hype. As much as we all
miss him, Jordan's level of fame _ achieved primarily through
performance on the playing field _ must, in the end, be ephemeral,
especially when measured by the jersey-buying, burger-consuming
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Is it coincidence that Jordan's camp began promoting the idea
for the restaurant on North LaSalle to cater more to the more
mature, well-heeled diner who wouldn't so soon forget six Bulls
championships in eight glorious years?
</P>
<P>
   Basketball isn't baseball, a sport fueled by nostalgia. Lately,
even adult Jordan-worshippers I know have begun to ask, in so many
words, how many buzzer-beaters has Michael made lately and, anyway,
what serious adult would co-star with Bugs and Tweety in commercial
and film?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's star power was always predicated on his coming through,
then cashing in. He never attached himself to a cause that might
enhance his legacy in post-playing years, in a social or political
vein. He never leveled with the public on the hot-button Nike
issue. Apart from his indomitable skill and will, what I remember
most about Jordan as I compare him to other 20th century sporting
icons was his refusal to endorse an African-American candidate,
Harvey Gantt, in a North Carolina Senate race against Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by Sam Smith in his 1995 book, ``Second Coming,''
Jordan told a friend, ``Republicans buy shoes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else could have got away with the cynical marketing ploy
_ switching from No. 23 to 45, supposedly in the name of his dead
father _ that Jordan foisted upon his public when he returned from
his sabbatical. The new jerseys happened to be on the racks that
week. I Exist, Therefore I Earn _ that was Jordan's
career-governing principle, guided brilliantly by his agent, David
Falk. This wasn't a crime; it was just who Jordan was.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be instructive to his heirs as the league moves
on and tries to reshape its image and rebuild its ratings. No
matter how popular he may be with desperate Knicks fans, a
self-absorbed, defiant personality like Latrell Sprewell will never
restore the NBA to where it was.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s stars, Magic and Larry, had the original feel-good
formula. They raised the visibility of the sport so that Jordan
could emerge to become its first boardroom ballplayer. But too many
of Jordan's peers across this decade wanted to Be Like Mike, and
couldn't, because they could never be anywhere near as good.
</P>
<P>
   The league for years existed as one man's promotional vehicle.
Everyone else came off as overpaid, overindulged. This was not
always fair, when there were players like David Robinson, who for
years in San Antonio has been a graceful, philanthropic presence.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has certainly been a great role model for Duncan. In
New Jersey, Marbury and Keith Van Horn should pay close attention
to Jayson Williams, who can't say no to a kid and just last week
donated $2.1 million to his alma mater, St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is a lot to expect of these young men, when you also
consider that the corporations they work for are no more
accountable and often more selfish. The players are packaged and
sold more as individuals, though, than as part of teams. That is
the game, the source of their wealth, and the burden that comes
along with it.
</P>
<P>
   And it is their league now, to make of it what they will.

   ATLANTIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 33-17, first in division

<P>
   Additions: F Otis Thorpe, G Anthony Carter
</P>
<P>
   Losses: G Terry Porter, F Terry Mills
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes in defense and a preseason injury to Otis
Thorpe will hurt the Heat early on. Losing Terry Porter to San
Antonio makes matters worse. But Miami still works and plays harder
than any team in the league. After undergoing knee surgery in the
off-season, Tim Hardaway hired Michael Jordan's former personal
trainer. He is in the final year of his contract and is determined
to prove he is one of the elite point guards. ``I feel this is our
year,'' Alonzo Mourning said. ``We're not old, we're experienced.''
After two straight first-round playoff exits, Miami is graying, but
still proud and poised enough to make one last run.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK KNICKS
</P>

   Last season: 27-23, fourth
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F John Wallace, F Mirsad Turkcan, C Andrew Lang
</P>
<P>
   Loss: C Herb Williams
</P>
<P>
   They have all of the components for a title, except the one that
kept them from knocking off San Antonio last June: a center they
can count on. For all the bluster about a lineup featuring Latrell
Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus Camby, Patrick Ewing needs to
return to health before the Knicks can entertain championship
thoughts. His role will be reduced, but his presence is paramount
if the Knicks plan to return to the finals in an 82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 28-22, third
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Billy Owens, G Bruce Bowen, F Jumaine Jones, C Todd
MacCulloch, C Stanley Roberts
</P>
<P>
   Loss: F Harvey Grant
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson (26.8 ppg), the smallest player ever to win the
scoring title, will again vie with Jason Williams, Kobe Bryant and
Stephon Marbury for the highlights-at-11 award. Larry Hughes is
almost as electrifying, leaving Larry Brown a few questions to
answer: Who runs the point full-time, and can two improvisational
players not only sell tickets but help the 76ers win consistently?
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY NETS
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 16-34, seventh
</P>
<P>
   Additions: C Evan Eschmeyer, F Johnny Newman, C Michael Cage, G
Sherman Douglas
</P>
<P>
   Losses: C Rony Seikaly, G Eric Murdock
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams' rehabilitation on his broken knee cap is
progressing, but he may not play until January. That leaves Stephon
Marbury and Keith Van Horn to backpack the Nets for the first two
months of the season. Kerry Kittles will play some point guard
along with Sherman Douglas. They won't start 3-17, like last
season, but with a shoddy defense and no one to stop the opposing
center, making the playoffs is going to be chore.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON CELTICS
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 31-19, fifth
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Calbert Cheaney, F Danny Fortson, F Eric Williams,
G Eric Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Losses: G-F Ron Mercer, F Popeye Jones, F Bruce Bowen
</P>
<P>
   All of Boston nearly turned on Rick Pitino last season as the
team he coached and assembled faltered badly. To find allies,
Pitino went on an archeological dig. He invited Bill Russell to
spend a week with the troops to talk about ``team agenda'' and
``team ego.'' If Antoine Walker and Kenny Anderson take Russell's
advice to heart, the Celtics have the talent to make a playoff
push. If not, the next change at the Fleet Center may involve
Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON WIZARDS
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 18-32, sixth
</P>
<P>
   Additions: G Richard Hamilton, C Isaac Austin, F Aaron Williams,
F Michael Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Losses: F Calbert Cheaney, C Ben Wallace, G Tim Legler, F Terry
Davis, G Jeff McInnis
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the backcourt of Rod Strickland and Mitch
Richmond and figure out how to contain Juwan Howard, the Wizards
are lean. A lot of their success will depend on Ike Austin and
whether he returns to his Miami form. UConn's Richard Hamilton will
help. And picking up Michael Smith off waivers was a real coup for
General Manager Wes Unseld. But if lingering chemistry problems
aren't solved, the lottery awaits.
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Last season: 33-17, second
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Pat Garrity, F Monty Williams, G Tariq Abdul-Wahad,

   Orlando's off-season was more about demolition than
refurbishment. The Magic was a part of 24 transactions involving 32
players. And that's not even counting Doc Rivers' exchanging his
gig as a TNT analyst for a job that Chuck Daly didn't want. Darrell
Armstrong will run the Magic in Anfernee Hardaway's absence.
General Manager John Gabriel has decided to stockpile salary cap
room for the free-agent blitz next summer.

   Chris Mullin is going to the bench to make room for Jalen Rose
in the starting lineup. Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson are talking
less. Like Coach Larry Bird, who has said this will be his last
year, they know the end of Indiana's annual postseason march is
near. Jonathan Bender is supposed to be the next Kevin Garnett. But
giving up the experience and toughness of Antonio Davis could hurt
in the short term. With six free agents next season, the Pacers are
about to make their last stand in the new Conseco Fieldhouse.

<P>
   As Bernie Bickerstaff once said of a disappointing Wizards team,
``Talent isn't everything.'' Paul Silas has his work cut out for
him. Yet if the Hornets' new coach can convince Derrick Coleman to
keep his weight down, stay away from trouble and contribute as a
sixth man; if he can keep Anthony Mason and Eddie Jones from
whining; if he can ease Baron Davis into the rotation without
hurting David Wesley's feelings, then Silas has the makings of a
conference finalist.

   Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady will be playing H-O-R-S-E above
the rim, Antonio Davis and Charles Oakley will take care of the
grunt work inside. The Raptors have a nice blend of old and new,
gruff and fluff; the big question is at point guard, where Doug
Christie takes over for Alvin Williams. If Muggsy Bogues is any
help, a Canadian team will join the NBA postseason for the first
time.

   Only six players are back after Atlanta General Manager Pete
Babcock cleaned house. That's what a second-round sweep against the
athletic Knicks will do. The Hawks traded character for talent when
they acquired Isaiah Rider. The acquisition of Lorenzen Wright may
be their most important off-season deal, given that Dikembe Mutombo
needed help in the post. It's a huge gamble, busting up the old
guard for Gen-X blood. But then, the formula worked for the Knicks
last season.

   Sam Cassell still shoots first and passes later, often leaving
crumbs to Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson. With no bona fide power
forward, George Karl's trapping, pressing defensive schemes will be
that much more important to Milwaukee's success. The Bucks need a
warrior inside, and J.R. Reid is not that player. First round and
out. Again.

   If Shawn Kemp is consistent _ and Zydrunas Ilgauskas can get

   If a referendum to build a new arena is shot down Nov. 2, Tim
Duncan may take his talents elsewhere next season, and the Spurs
will be just another small-market team to lose an emerging
supernova. The Spurs play for each other like no team in the
league, and now they carry the swagger of a champion instead of the
nice-guy label. There are negatives: The average age of David
Robinson, Mario Elie and Avery Johnson will be 35 at season's end,
and it is unclear whether Sean Elliott will play again after
undergoing a kidney transplant on Aug. 16. Still, the Spurs are
good enough to make one more run at the finals.

   Karl Malone, John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek have cleared the
cobwebs and committed themselves to putting the children in their
place again. But losing Shandon Anderson to Houston severely hurt
the Jazz's athleticism. Acquiring Olden Polynice was a temporary
stop-gap. How Utah plans to overcome the West's young stars is a
mystery only Jerry Sloan's stubbornness can solve. Bryon Russell

   If Tim Duncan is the best player in the league, Kevin Garnett is
right behind. Joe Smith and Terrell Brandon re-signed and stayed
with the Timberwolves, a distinct change from the disappearing act
Stephon Marbury and Tom Gugliotta played last season. William
Avery, the fourth player drafted out of Duke in the first round,
will give Brandon an occasional rest. It won't be Wally's World,
but if Szczerbiak can knock down jump shots routinely, the T'Wolves
can win a playoff series and take the next step.

   Charles Barkley is no closer to being fitted for that elusive
championship ring in what he says is his final season. At age 36,
he and Hakeem Olajuwon are nearly relics. The dynamic Dream Shake
has given way to a pondering pump fake. Steve Francis will be eye

But Houston has no depth and no shot at getting out of the second

   Nick Van Exel, Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer comprise a
frightening defensive matchup on the perimeter. Raef LaFrentz comes
back from a knee injury healthy and determined. Antonio McDyess,
who finished in the top 10 in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots
last season, will continue his ascension. The Nuggets will be a

   Shareef Addur-Rahim can't be stopped offensively and Bryant
Reeves shed nearly 40 pounds in the off-season. The Steve Francis
fiasco, in which the Grizzlies' No. 2 pick in the draft forced the
largest player transaction in league history over the summer,
resulted in depth and maturity. But the sale of the team to St.

wondering if their team is going to be around in two seasons when

   As if grasping the triangle offense is not enough, the Lakers
will have to deal with Kobe Bryant being out for perhaps a month
with a broken hand. Shaquille O'Neal has bulked up to 340 pounds
and says he is honored to play for Phil Jackson. But getting this
bunch to play together will be a large task, especially when
players such as Robert Horry have no clearly defined role and power
forward is a major question mark. The good news for the Lakers is
that Shaq and Kobe no longer have issues. Like Glen Rice, they
understand they have to grow up to win a title someday. And
Jackson's Chicago-imported staff will help them realize that
potential.

   Their starters make a combined $50 million and their total
payroll is an astronomical $70 million-plus. Like George
Steinbrenner, Blazers owner Paul Allen has given his general
manager, Bob Whitsitt, the checkbook for a championship. Folding
Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf into an already
talented mix seems almost unfair. Although the Blazers have
problems, ranging from Arvydas Sabonis' durability to Damon
Stoudamire's decision-making, they're better and more mature than
the team that got swept in the conference finals last season. On
paper, anyhow.

   The Suns haven't won a playoff series since 1995, and the notion
that they can play small-ball forever is ludicrous, especially
since most of the game's premier big men now reside in the Western
Conference. Still, picking up Penny Hardaway and Rodney Rodgers
makes Phoenix better. And after a scintillating preseason, the UNLV
rookie Shawn Marion may be the steal of the draft. If Luc Longley
can give Coach Danny Ainge a halfway-decent season, the second

   In the past 15 years, the Kings have been featured on national
television a dozen times. This season, Jason Williams, Chris Webber
and their flashy friends have 20 scheduled national TV appearances,
including nine on NBC. Nick Anderson joins the league's most
entertaining team, which no-looked its way into the postseason and
was the only team to average more than 100 points a game. As fun as
the Kings are, they're not very good defensively and will be
hard-pressed to get past the second round.

</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the trash-talking Vernon Maxwell and Greg
Foster, Gary Payton can relax his gums and concentrate on getting
his team back to the postseason. The Sonics have reacquired their

</P>
<P>
   For all the improvement the Warriors showed last season, P.J.
Carlesimo is still no closer to reaching the playoffs entering his
third year. The front line, with Antawn Jamison's development, is
improving. But the only guy able to create his own shot is
39-year-old Terry Cummings. The Warriors play hard, but they don't
have the talent.

</P>
<P>
   They're not as bad as a lot of Clipper teams. Rookie Lamar Odom
can flat-out play, and he will team with Maurice Taylor and Michael
Olowakandi to form a decent frontline. Derek Anderson was a nice
acquisition, a guy who plays with passion even when his shot is not
falling. But until frugal owner Donald Sterling begins committing
to players over the long haul, the lottery beckons.

 WASHINGTON: to Nashville.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several prominent Democrats, including a former White House
adviser, Paul Begala, have urged Gore to demand that his aides
curtail their private dealings and lobbying because of the
appearance that private interests were seeking to influence the
vice president through his kitchen cabinet of lobbyists. Most of
these Democrats applauded the Gore campaign's move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gore's lobbyist-friends have clients interested in
issues that have also interested the vice president, like
technology, health care and environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of their lobbying reports shows that Knight, Neel
and Downey often do get what they ask for _ from the
administration, the Federal Communications Commission and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's firm, which represents Lockheed Martin, has lobbied the
administration to continue its $1 billion deal with Lockheed to
help Russia launch commercial rockets. The White House has said
that it is considering terminating the deal to discourage Russia
from selling ballistic-missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Knight, who worked for Gore for 13 years in
the House and Senate and was the manager of the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, said that most of his firm's lobbying, on behalf of
Lockheed and other companies, had been handled by his partners. And
Knight said he had been careful not to discuss his clients'
interests with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight's critics contend that clients hire him because of
his insider's knowledge of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Peter Knight calls an agency for help, it's almost as if
the vice president or his staff calls,'' said an investigator for a
Republican House member. ``He might as well be Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey lives not far from Gore, and they often play basketball
together on weekends. After Downey, a Democrat from Long Island,
N.Y., was defeated for re-election to the House in 1992, he founded
a lobbying firm with former Rep. Rod Chandler, a Republican from
Washington, and the firm has been very successful. According to a
study by Legal Times, Downey Chandler earned $1.7 million in fees
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On his lobbying reports, Downey acknowledges that he has
directly lobbied the office of the vice president on behalf of most
of his clients, a list that includes Boeing, Merck &AMP; Co. and Fuji
Film Co.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Gore denied that Downey had won most of his
fights, saying that Gore excoriated the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry at a recent campaign appearance in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the extreme price differentials between the
Canadian and U.S. markets, Gore used a 60-tablet package of Zocar,
a medication used to control cholesterol that is manufactured by
Merck &AMP; Co., a Downey client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hammered Merck,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House officials are barred by law from lobbying
other senior administration officials for one year. And the Clinton
administration's own ethics rules bar former administration members
from lobbying the White House for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, who was the vice president's first chief of staff until he
left the administration in late 1993, waited until this past winter
before he began lobbying members of the administration about
telecommunications policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That five-year prohibition ended last winter, and I have had
discussions with the vice president in general terms on
telecommunications policy and telecommunications politics,'' Neel
said. ``But I do not lobby him on any single issue related to our
industry.''

 REHOBOTH, Mass.: to people.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Sulyma-Masson, who is 39 and a veterinary technician, said a
common denominator among witches was belief in a dual divinity, a
goddess and a god. Behind them lies an all-pervasive energy, the
basis of all reality, which may be tapped through spells and
rituals, for healing or good fortune. Formal worship begins with
``casting the circle,'' as participants gather, and, through
chanting, drumming or singing, they concentrate on forming ``a cone
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The presiding priest or priestess, Ms. Sulyma-Masson said, then
declares the energy's ``purpose,'' that it should be directed
toward healing, financial betterment or finding love.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal rituals like the backyard gathering, which heralded the
coming of the Wiccan New Year at Samhaim (Halloween to everyone
else), ``connect us with the cycles of nature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a potluck dinner at her apartment, the witches who
participated _ computer programmers, graphic artists, store
managers and others _ spoke about how they came to believe what
they do.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Jackson, 23, a credit analyst, began studying witchcraft
on her own in high school. Now a high priestess with her own coven,
she said she appreciated witchcraft's emphasis on nature and
goddess worship. ``It fit the empty spaces in my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While witches say they follow the ``Old Religion,'' many Wiccan
practices derive from recent sources. A landmark date is 1954,
shortly after anti-witchcraft laws were repealed in Britain, when
an Englishman named Gerald Gardner published an account of
witchcraft that he said he learned from a coven he had joined. A
Gardnerian tradition remains influential on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   For American witches, a watershed event occurred in September
1986, when a federal appeals court ruled that Wicca was a religion
protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, witchcraft's rise on the religious landscape has
disturbed many who regard it as sinister. Reports last summer that
some soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas, were conducting Wiccan rituals
near the base enraged some local ministers and prompted Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., to demand why the military would allow its personnel
to engage in such rites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sulyma-Masson wrote Barr, discussing Wicca's legal status
and saying that contrary to rumor, witches do not conduct
sacrifices. She identified herself as chairwoman of the Witches
League for Public Awareness, a nonprofit group formed to challenge
stereotypes, a task that has her telling people that witches
neither worship a devil nor believe in one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the uproar illustrates a point: One need not travel to
Massachusetts to encounter Wiccans.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln, Neb., for example, Jason and Cynthia
Blodgett-McDeavitt serve as high priest and high priestess of the
Order of the Red Grail, with about 20 regular members and another
30 or 40 who attend open rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for Halloween, the group will gather on the Nebraska
Capitol steps, Blodgett-McDeavitt said, adding, ``I'm probably
going to have a sign that says, `I'm Wiccan and I vote.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such openness marks a sea change from 1983, when Ms.
Sulyma-Masson began to explore witchcraft. She had a hard time
finding books. Raised a Roman Catholic, she became interested in
Wicca after meeting a witch from a coven in Salem, Mass., whom she
credits with helping her recover from a virus that had defied
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   These days her apartment is stacked with volumes on witchcraft
and other pagan paths. The coven she founded in 1987, the Circle of
Salgion, has grown so that it has spun off five others. And she and
her associates are raising money for a church building, a geodesic
dome, on wooded land in nearby Dighton.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask, she tells them rituals revolve around the solar
and lunar calendars. The year, envisioned as a wheel, contains
eight sabbats: the solstices, equinoxes and four dates in between,
Feb. 2, May 1, Aug. 1 and Oct. 31. Her coven often advertises these
events as ``open rituals,'' which the curious may attend.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, rituals conducted on nights when the moon is full
are closed to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the basics, there is ample room for innovation, a
theological spaciousness that appeals to seekers who dislike formal
rules and structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no dogma that tells you what you have to do,'' said
Richard Cohen, 54, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Joe White, 31, a firefighter, said he wrestled with questions of
faith before deciding that no single religion could dictate what
should be in someone's heart.
</P>
<P>
   After reading a book on witchcraft, he said, ``doors started
opening up'' and he met people practicing it. ``I'm starting to
find out,'' he said, ``how big this group really is.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A brisk jet stream flow from west to east along the Canadian
border will continue to deliver mild air across most of the
northern tier of states Sunday. However, cold air amassing in
central Canada is destined to make inroads over the Eastern states
by midweek. Meanwhile, a slow-moving disturbance accompanied by
showers and some heavier thundershowers will drift east from the
lower Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be milder than recent days over much of New England
as breezes from the west increase ahead of a dissipating front. A
few clouds and showers will occur near the front in northern New
England. Elsewhere in the Northeast, high pressure will promote
abundant sun. Afternoon temperatures will average more than 10
degrees above seasonal averages.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will occur near low pressure as it meanders
east near the western Gulf of Mexico coast. The heaviest rain will
occur in Louisiana as steady winds from the southeast at 3,000 feet
above the ground deliver a plume of very moist air. Farther west,
clouds and lighter showers will linger in eastern and central parts
of Oklahoma and Texas. In the Southeast, warm weather will prevail
although increasingly moist breezes will foster patchy clouds and
showers near the Atlantic coast and southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will follow a front as it moves south through the
Northwestern states. The day will begin damp along portions of the
coast, but drier air will arrive in the afternoon. The Southwest
will be sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Ozone Hole
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, a gas in the stratosphere that shields the earth from
ultraviolet rays, has undergone its annual springtime depletion
over Antarctica. The so-called ``ozone hole'' has been born again.
During Southern Hemisphere winter, air currents steer ozone toward
the South Pole. Once there, it sinks into the lower stratosphere,
where chlorine, a building block of man-made chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons, lurks. As the spring sun awakens, it
photochemically frees chlorine to devour ozone. Ozone rebounds
after October as the stratosphere warms and chlorine becomes
dormant.

 TAVERNY, France: the army.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He spoke midway through the ``call for defense preparation day''
that was held here and at 247 other sites around the country on
Oct. 9. There have been 58 of these days since the first one a year
ago. Not all are on weekends, and none are held in the vacation
months of July and August. Starting next April, young French women
will also be required to come spend a day learning at least a
little about the military.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, 514,664 young men heard what the army had to
say in these sessions, which also involve a test of reading
comprehension. Roughly a third of them, according to French
military surveys, would be interested in coming back at least once
to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Military recruiters hope these sessions will make it easier to
fill their volunteer quotas. The slimmed-down French armed forces
of 2002 will still need 357,183 people in uniform _ 259,299 if the
members of the gendarmerie, a national police force under the
Ministry of Defense, are not counted. There were 500,000 people in
the French military in early 1996, when President Jacques Chirac
announced the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reducing by roughly 30,000 draftees a year,''
Defense Minister Alain Richard, a member of the Socialist
government that inherited the plan in 1997 from Chirac's Gaullists,
told local elected officials at Taverny. The air base, at the edge
of a suburb northwest of Paris, has no airplanes but a large
underground command center in a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The local mayor had a question for Richard familiar to any U.S.
secretary of defense: ``Is the base at Taverny going to be kept
open after the transition?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard smiled. ``I don't know what my successor 20 years from
now will do,'' he answered, ``but for the foreseeable future, I
want to keep all large installations near big cities open, because
we'd need them if we had to build our forces up again some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States believe that their all-volunteer
forces contain units that are more easily mobilized and sent on
expeditions like the NATO-led peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and
Kosovo. The reliance on conscripts meant that some continental
European countries took far too long to get their forces on the
move for Kosovo, French military officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British and the French are the only countries in Europe
that have readily deployable forces,'' Richard said. With changes
in the structure of its armed forces, Germany, too, might have them
in 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some countries took two months to send troops to Kosovo,''
he added, referring to some smaller NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   European defense ministries were shocked by their own slow and
cumbersome reaction and by technological gaps with the United
States that the war over Kosovo revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard explained, in answer to a question from one of the
youths called up for the day, that U.S. planes had flown most of
the bombing missions because the United States could get its
aircraft there faster than most of the Europeans could.
Reorganizing European defenses, he and other officials said, will
shorten reaction times, and volunteer professional soldiers and
reservists will be easier to move on short notice than draftees.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the French plan would create a 50,000-strong reserve to
reinforce the regular army, as National Guard units do in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also designed a reserve flexibility into its system when
it moved to all-volunteer forces in the early 1960s, with a
Territorial Army of 40,000. A strategic defense review last year,
aimed at reorganizing and redesigning British armed forces to make
them more rapidly and easily deployable to places like Bosnia,
Kosovo and now East Timor, allowed for an increase in the planned
size of the army in 2005, to 114,000 soldiers from 109,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving from conscription to volunteer forces, you find that
for the same amount of money, you can get a much more effective and
easily deployable fighting force,'' said Lord Gilbert, until this
summer a minister of the British Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, like Britain and now France, plans to abolish the draft
by the end of 2002, and to reduce its armed forces to about 168,000
by 2003, from 175,000 now. But Spanish Defense Ministry officials
said that, with about three-quarters of the 300,000 Spanish men who
come of draft age every year never actually spending a day in
uniform, there were discussions about ending conscription even
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, where 40 percent to 45 percent of the young men called
choose alternative civilian service as firemen, paramedics,
orderlies and the like, is the only major Western European country
still committed to maintaining the draft. Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping has repeatedly supported conscription, which was adopted,
along with ways of teaching soldiers when it is correct to disobey
orders, when Germany's allies allowed the country to rearm in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for keeping the draft, some officials say, is that
Germany's social services and hospitals may have to shut down if
they suddenly have to do without all those volunteers doing
alternative service.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Parliament is considering a bill to reduce the size of
the armed forces over three years. Now numbering 280,000 men, of
whom 136,000 are draftees, the armed forces would drop to 200,000
volunteers _ including, for the first time, some women.

BOEING FAILED TO DISCLOSE SAFETY DATA 16 YEARS BEFORE TWA
DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen years before TWA Flight 800 exploded with a loss of 230
lives in 1996, a Boeing study showed that the central fuel tanks of
its jumbo jets were taking in heat from air-conditioning units
directly under them, but the company failed to report the finding
to safety investigators until last summer, federal and company
officials acknowledged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1980 study, Boeing found that ``the dominant source of
heating'' in the central fuel tanks of its E-4B aircraft _ a
military version of Boeing's commercial 747 _ was the
air-conditioning equipment bay, positioned right under the fuel
tank. But the study was not given to TWA 800 investigators until
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, confirming a report on the study in The
Washington Post on Saturday, said that it was unclear whether
knowledge of the four-volume 1980 Boeing study might have
definitely aided the inquiry into the fiery end of the 747 jetliner
off New York's Long Island on July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that the relevance of the Boeing study should have
been left to federal investigators, who have generally concluded
that vapors in the central fuel tank of TWA 800 exploded, although
the source of ignition has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has expressed dismay
over Boeing's failure to report its findings to investigators until
three years after the disaster, and said in a statement that it
would consider the Boeing findings in drafting its final report
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who is the chairman of a
subcommittee that oversees airline disasters and has held hearings
on the investigation of the Trans World Airlines explosion, went
further, contending that the TWA 800 tragedy might have been
prevented if Boeing had reported its findings after the 1990
explosion of a center fuel tank on a Boeing 737 jet in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the senator said: ``The government and the
manufacturers need to have an ethic that overreporting is better
than underreporting. This was too important to fall through the
cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pounian, a lawyer on a plaintiffs' committee representing
many of the families of the victims of the TWA 800 explosion, also
criticized Boeing for not reporting its findings earlier, and said
the Boeing report would be used as evidence in lawsuits filed
against the company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Russ Young acknowledged Saturday that the
company had not reported its findings to safety investigators until
last June, but said the failure had not been intentional. He
questioned the relevance of the findings for the TWA 800
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, the whole report doesn't appear to be relevant
to the NTSB investigation of the 747,'' Young said. ``But it is
unfortunate that it was not identified earlier and provided to the
NTSB. Quite simply, the report escaped notice of the commercial
airplane employees who had been working with the accident
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said that Boeing had changed its procedures for locating
potentially relevant information in accident investigations,
particularly information about military aircraft that might be
applicable to commercial aircraft investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The study, Young said, was originally commissioned by the Air
Force, and focused on heat generated by air-conditioning equipment
under the central fuel tank in the E-4B military aircraft, which in
their operation and design are different from commercial 747s.
</P>
<P>
   The E-4B has four air-conditioning units, while the 747 has
three, he said, and the military aircraft use different types of
fuel and typically run air-conditioning for longer periods while on
the ground. He discounted the value of the report to the TWA
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But the NTSB, in a statement, said: ``We of course were dismayed
that we did not receive a copy of the report in the early weeks of
the TWA Flight 800 investigation, and we have expressed our
displeasure to Boeing about this failure to inform us about the
study and the three-year time span it took for us to receive it.
The Boeing report has now been included in our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, has been looking into the question of why the Boeing
report was not made available to the TWA inquiry until last June,
although its investigators have said there appeared to be no
intentional cover-up.

PRO FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: CUNNINGHAM'S TURNAROUND; EMULATING
STEINBRENNER; RAMS CHASE PERFECTION; FAVRE TO TIE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mo., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Last week against the San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Jeff
George, now oddly the savior of the Minnesota Vikings, threw a
rocket pass to the superstar wide receiver Randy Moss. It had been
a long time since Moss saw a football aimed for him, in game
conditions, that was flying at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Moss stood by his locker and was asked about the
difference between George's arm and that of the Vikings' previous
starter, Randall Cunningham. ``The ball,'' Moss said bluntly, ``is
carrying a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   After hooking up with Moss, George connected on an 80-yard pass
play with Matthew Hatchette, becoming the first Viking to throw a
touchdown pass of more than 50 yards in his first start. Thus the
George era, which actually started at halftime the week before in a
loss to the Lions, had officially begun. On the sideline was
Cunningham, taking notes and, for the first time in his career,
charting plays.
 &UR;  &LR;  Cunningham on the bench? Charting plays? Wasn't this the same
All-Pro quarterback who last season led the Vikings to a National
Football League-record 556 points? Cunningham, without much of a
fight, has gone from hero to bench warmer in one of the most abrupt
turnarounds for a record-breaking quarterback in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me to chart them, but I felt I would to help
George,'' Cunningham said. He added: ``It wasn't tough to sit
Sunday because the timing made it happen. When you are sitting,
there are so many things that go through your mind. All I can do is
keep praying that guys stay healthy, and that we put points on the
board and hopefully get turnovers. That's my job now. I'm a praying
man now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has handled the awkward situation with class. Still,
the question remains: What happened? The answers are not easy. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The quick-read theory. Last year, teams were afraid to
constantly blitz Cunningham because he would simply lob the ball to
Moss. Teams studied the Vikings in the off-season and figured the
best way to stop him was to force him to make quick reads. One
defensive coordinator who has planned strategy against Cunningham
this season called it ``Randall-izing the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   This season the Vikings saw a lot more zone blitzes and
switch-ups in the secondary. Cunningham was often confused.
</P>
<P>
   _ The friendly face theory. Brian Billick was the team's
offensive coordinator last year, and he had a close relationship
with Cunningham. Billick sometimes told him before the play exactly
where to throw the ball.
 &UR;  &LR;  In fact, Cunningham relied heavily on a trio of people. Besides
Billick, there was the quarterbacks coach, Chip Myers, and the
backup quarterback Brad Johnson, who constantly counseled
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Billick left to become head coach of
Baltimore, Myers died of a heart attack and Johnson became the
starting quarterback at Washington. Although Cunningham was
hesitant to characterize how important Billick was to the team,
Moss was not. When asked if the current offensive coordinator, Ray
Sherman, did a solid job in his game-planning for the 49ers, Moss
said: ``Is he a hero? No, I think if we call anybody a hero, it
would be Jeff George. He's just a coach. Our hero is gone. Our hero
is down in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The cotton candy theory. A small number of people on the
Vikings and around the league feel that Cunningham, 36, has simply
turned soft. When he was demoted from the starting position,
teammates were surprised at Cunningham's attitude, which was not
anger, but relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is sure,'' Cunningham said at the time of his
benching. ``The offense is not being run the way it should be run
with me in there, which is why Jeff should be in there. I did
everything I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that coach Dennis Green's decision to bring in
George as a backup last spring was one of the smartest personnel
moves in the league this season. Other teams, like the Jets, wish
they had a player like George now, no matter how wacky and
inconsistent he has been during his 10-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to Cunningham now? He will stay on the bench. Green
is doing a good job of keeping Cunningham's spirits up, because the
Vikings do not know when they will need him again.

<P>
   A Football Steinbrenner?
</P>
<P>
   After the Washington Redskins fell to the Dallas Cowboys last
Sunday for the second time this season, the Redskins' owner, Daniel
Snyder, dragged coach Norv Turner into the trainer's room and
scolded him for almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   That was embarrassing enough, an owner yelling at his coach,
with the players forced to treat their injuries in other parts of
the cramped locker room. But the chewing out did not stop there.
After the Redskins' plane landed at Dulles airport in Virginia,
Snyder resumed his chewing out of Turner and then began scolding
the defensive coordinator, Mike Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   It is only a matter of time before Snyder fires Nolan. It may
happen one week from now or at the end of the season. Snyder is
turning out to be one of the most aggressive owners in the league's
recent history, which is both a good and a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, along with his smart personnel guru, Vinny Cerrato, is
trying to make the Redskins winners again. Since becoming head
coach in 1994, Turner is 36-49-1.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of Snyder's taking such an aggressive, public stance,
though, is that he can undermine the head coach's position with the
players. What do players think when they hear an owner screaming at
the coach in the next room? At some point they stop listening to
the coach, thinking he won't be around long.
</P>
<P>
   A Chance to Run the Table
</P>
<P>
   Could one of the traditionally worst teams in the NFL actually
go undefeated in what is quickly becoming a watered-down league?
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams are 6-0 and have two solid tests coming up.
They face 5-1 Tennessee in Nashville on Sunday and play the Lions,
now 4-2, in the Silverdome next Sunday. The rest of the St. Louis
schedule is: home against Carolina, at San Francisco, New Orleans,
at Carolina, at New Orleans, the Giants, Chicago, and at
Philadelphia. The current combined record of these late-season
opponents is 18-34.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, if the Rams can somehow win their next two games,
they will indeed have a realistic shot at going 16-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns could become the first team in
league history to go 0-16 if they do not win what seems to be their
only winnable game, at New Orleans on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Week After Week After Week
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, when Green Bay plays host to Seattle, Brett Favre
will make his 116th consecutive start, tying him with the former
Eagle Ron Jaworski for most starts in a row by any quarterback in
NFL history. Favre, 30, will most likely play at least five more
years, so he will probably greatly extend the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I've managed to last this long is beyond me,'' Favre said
recently. ``Man, I hold nothing back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaworski's record has been more than a match for all
quarterbacks but Favre. Trent Dilfer's consecutive-game streak will
end at 70 Sunday when he is benched by Tampa Bay. Injuries have
halted streaks by Dan Marino of Miami (46) and Steve McNair of
Tennessee (34).
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart is second to Favre among
current quarterbacks with 39 straight starts.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Favre's streak is, it still pales compared with
the accomplishment of the Minnesota defensive lineman Jim Marshall,
who played in 282 consecutive games. That record, set in 1979, may
last another 20 years.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marc Brew clutches the barre with one hand, and
elegantly raises the other. Suddenly, his arm stops in midair,
frozen in space as if held there by scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to me,'' his teacher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a spasm,'' Brew replies, waits it out, and brings
his arm down to rest.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer since he was 7, Brew, now 22, is in a familiar setting:
a ballet studio, with mirrored walls, smooth shiny floors, and a
barre running the length of the room, like a spine. A paraplegic
for two years, he is in a familiar position: curled in a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   It is the marriage between the two that is brand-new.
</P>
<P>
   He twists right, then left, then right, in his chair. ``I feel
like I'm quite restricted,'' he says. ``I still feel like I want to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Brew's future seemed starry: he had just signed a
contract with the State Theater Ballet Company of South Africa. But
there, a drunken driver plowed into a car carrying him, his
girlfriend, her brother and another young man. Only Brew survived.
His ability to walk did not.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home to Australia, and languished. Then fate offered
a compensatory grace: two friends of Brew's visiting New York met
Kitty Lunn, a dancer who broke her back after slipping and falling
on ice in 1987 but who resumed dancing five years later.
</P>
<P>
   She studies classical ballet with able-bodied dancers. She
founded a dance company, Infinity Dance Theater, again with
nondisabled dancers, in which she performs in her wheelchair and on
the floor. A luminous woman with red hair, she balances other
dancers on her back. She does handstands, with help. She moves on
the floor as if she could get up and walk off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In Brew, she saw a student for her technique, a companion in her
struggle. And at 49, with her body increasingly resistant to the
demands of performing, she also saw someone who might be able to
sustain the concept she had nurtured: that a person incapable of
walking could still create beauty.
</P>
<P>
   She bought him a ticket to New York, saying she would try
training him for her company's three performances this weekend at
the Theater of the Riverside Church. She gave him room _ in a
wheelchair-accessible hotel on the Upper West Side _ and board. On
Nov. 1, he would return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that he finds out he has a life to
live, whatever that is for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as she did. Over eight years, she has tried to bend not
just her frame to her will, but also the perception that she is a
``spunky cripple,'' in her words, but not a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   To be a dancer in a paraplegic's body is to have your soul crave
movement, and your body resist it. For the next seven weeks, Brew
would struggle to build a bridge between the two.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is Sept. 15, five days after Brew got off the plane from
Australia and met Ms. Lunn for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   His e-mails to her had nearly shouted with excitement, but
today, the laborious reality is upon him. He is in ballet class for
only the third day, struggling to stay upright in his chair, to
reach his arm to the end of his knee. He has a month and a half to
prepare for his role in the ballet ``Gilchrist's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   He is extremely thin _ the accident took half his pancreas and a
fourth of his stomach _ and extremely pale, with spiky blond hair.
His upper body is a dancer's: lithe and toned, with arms that are
long and lean. His legs are a paraplegic's: limp, atrophied, and,
when a spasm hits, prone to shaking beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he will learn how far he can go. For now, he is trying
to transfer a dance regimen instilled since childhood to his upper
body. In a traditional plie, the legs contract, bending and rising.
Today, Brew must transfer that movement upward, gracefully bending
and straightening one arm while the other clutches the barre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soften at the back of the knee,'' Ms. Lunn says, gesturing at
the inside of his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correlate the body parts,'' she says. The upper arm becomes
the thighbone. The heel of the hand becomes the heel of the foot.
The attention to form and detail is taxing, but imperative. These
exercises will turn into fondus, pas de deux, frappes, all done
with the arms and a body able to bend only partly.
</P>
<P>
   Brew is breathing heavily. ``I'm getting all confused with
everything,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Lunn says ``arch your foot,'' he instinctively
bends his wrist. His muscles, he realizes, have memory.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A week later, he takes his first class with other dancers.
Seated in his chair, he is surrounded by a forest of muscled legs.
</P>
<P>
   Brew bends his head as they bend their bodies. When they turn,
he whirls his wheelchair around. His teacher, Peff Modelski,
invokes body parts that no longer have meaning for him: ``open the
thighbone, lengthen the hamstring.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he confesses his self-consciousness. ``I felt like
everybody's eyes were on me.'' But that is a small price for what
Brew says next: ``I am feeling like a dancer again.''
</P>
<P>
   For every challenge in class, there is one outside it. Ms. Lunn
moves with as much ease as a paraplegic can throughout the city,
cruising down sidewalks, mounting buses, pulling herself up stairs,
and often, when she encounters an obstacle, waging a legal battle
for access.
</P>
<P>
   Brew grew up in a small country town, Jerilderie, New South
Wales, in Australia. New York is daunting enough, let alone trying
to navigate it in a wheelchair. At first, nervousness structures
his routine: he will not go to class alone. He will not take the
bus. He will not leave Broadway, where both his hotel and the dance
studio are located. He has brought a friend, Matthew Emond from
Australia, and is never without him.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the wheelchair. ``Everyone stares at me,'' he says
as he rolls down the street. ``I wonder what they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, another young man in a wheelchair pulls up next to him
and nods. ``Let's race, man,'' the man says. Brew offers a weak
smile, but ignores the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He does not want to mix with people in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Marc, not a wheelie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also has trouble accepting himself as a wheelchair dancer.
``I look at myself in the mirror, and I think, this isn't how I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lunn is sympathetic, to a point. ``The hardest part for Marc
is to give up the image of what he looked like standing up, but I'm
not going to spend time fighting that image,'' she says.
``Self-loathing or self-pity isn't an option.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 24, she yells at him in rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I look stupid,'' he says. ``I feel foolish. I hate
this _ I hate being in this chair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' she responds. ``You're going to be in this
chair. You can either begin to make friends with it, or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lunn wonders if he is trying to dance too soon after his
accident. She wonders if he is simply too young. ``He is too young
even to have figured out things standing up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least for the time being, ain't none of us getting out of
this chair,'' Ms. Lunn says. ``Nobody says he has to like it, but
the alternative is that you become a very bitter, broken person.''
</P>
<P>
   The things she can no longer do as a dancer _ point her feet,
hold her stomach in, let alone pirouette outside a wheelchair _ are
painful to her. Not dancing, she says, is more so.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Brew is apparently reaching a similar conclusion. On Monday, he
is back in class after a weekend off, studiously avoiding looking
at the wheelchair in the mirrors that line the dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   But Oct. 11, the two-year anniversary of his accident, looms. In
the days before, Brew begins spending more and more time alone,
withdrawing. On the day itself, he relives the accident over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask questions all the time: Why?'' he says. ``There are no
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He wonders, as well, if he will ever find love again. ``Who
wants someone in a wheelchair?'' he asks. ``I'm not in a hurry, but
I do get lonely.'' Today, he says, ``I feel really, really
lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the dancer's constant quest for
improvement and perfection propels him forward. And so, gloom or
not, there is class.
</P>
<P>
   He bends to the floor, and comes back up, gripping the
wheelchair. His arm languidly flutters out, and curves. A smile
curves as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, the Australian Ballet is scheduled to arrive in
New York. Brew studied with many of the dancers, who helped raise
money for his trip here. They are friends _ but also the most vivid
reminder of what he was, and what he is.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, the dancers of the Australian Ballet leap and crouch
and climb and entwine in liquid, fluid motions. In the darkness,
Brew watches, fidgeting and shifting in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception at the Australian Consulate after the
performance, he is embraced enthusiastically. He tries to explain
what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do professional training, ballet class every day,'' he says.
``I just feel like my career is going in a different direction,
less toward the classics, more experimental. I'm doing a lot of
movement; I'm using my legs, even if I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces mingle love and pity and skepticism. ``There are no
words to describe it,'' Brew finally says, and encourages them to
see the performances, now less than two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  At another rehearsal, he pulls himself across the floor, using
only his arms. His legs seem more lead appendages than limbs. Sweat
soaks his hair, and a ghostly pallor suffuses his already pale
skin. He is playing, with eerie acumen, a wounded warrior on the
verge of death.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the floor, as dancers leap and fall around him,
he reaches up, then falls, reaches, rolls over _ carefully moving
each leg into place before he does so _ sits up virtually straight,
pointing, arches his back like a cat, then prays before collapsing,
dead.
</P>
<P>
   He is so bony, so prone to bruising, that to rehearse on the
floor, he must be padded as heavily as the Michelin Man. He can
break a bone easily because he has no feeling in his lower body.
During one rehearsal, he does not realize that he is being held up
in a handstand until he looks in a mirror and sees his legs in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   His arms, on the other hand, ache from the exertion of pulling
lifeless legs across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are just over a week away. He is exhausted, but
excited.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of humor is back. ``I would point for you,'' he says,
showing off new black ballet slippers at dress rehearsal, ``but I
can't.'' His friends from the Australian Ballet have come to see
him rehearse, and finally grasp what he is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud is the Nov. 1 return ticket. Brew wants to stay;
Ms. Lunn knows it. But he has no source of income, and no home: she
cannot continue paying for a hotel, nor can she accommodate him for
long at her and her husband's one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young people before him, he sees the city, which he
now moves about with relative comfort, as a place of infinite
opportunity, and his home in Australia as a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'm happy, but I'm busy here,'' he said
last week. For the first time, he has direction, focus _ and
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance comes from within, the feeling of expression, of
movement,'' Brew said. ``That's still there. I didn't give up
dancing _ it was taken from me without my choice, and there is the
feeling of not having finished. There's nothing else I want to do.
It's in my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Ms. Lunn agrees that Brew can stay six more weeks,
at her apartment, or somewhere else if she can find it. He will go
home for Christmas, then try to pay his way back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Brew performed before an audience for the first
time in two years. He did his crawl across the floor; he looked
strong. In concert with Ms. Lunn, he glided and pirouetted in his
chair. It looked effortless. Then he took a bow, just able to bend
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' he said he thought as he sat onstage, applause
swelling around him, ``they're actually clapping for me.''

JACKSON BRINGS A LIGHT TO THE LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest kid in the NBA jumped out of the largest freshwater
lake in North America this summer and ended up on Phil Jackson's
front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers' All-Star center, had a
rap concert to give before a crowd of some 15,000 in Montana, so he
figured the least he could do was surprise Jackson, his new coach,
with a visit to his log cabin in Kallispell.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wanted to make a good first impression on Jackson, and
drink in some of the sage's wisdom ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced on the trampoline with Jackson's children in the
front yard. He went to karaoke night with Jackson's wife, June, and
bellowed ``I Believe I Can Fly'' into a microphone. That day,
O'Neal also experienced an epiphany of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you walk through the front door, you see those big
gold balls _ all six of 'em,'' he said recently, referring to the
replicas of the championship trophies Jackson won with the Chicago
Bulls. ``The sun was hitting them. They were sparkling. You could
see right through the crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Jackson is selling clarity to the Lakers _
and to a certain big man who has shown little inclination to grow
up. As the 1999-2000 NBA season opens Tuesday night with the Lakers
in Utah, Jackson returns to the game without the world's greatest
player on his side to help him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he has learned that guiding Michael Jordan and the
Bulls to six titles was one challenge; getting showtime wannabes to
buy into the tao of the triangle is another all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they will grasp it all,'' Jackson said the
other day. ``Everything takes time and everything is instinctual. A
lot of what you do you can't emulate or copy. You can't put it back
in the same order you did it before. I may not introduce any of the
usual stuff to the team until it's the right time. And it may not
be the right time for four or five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they just need to know they've got to come to work every
day and stick their nose on the grindstone and be worked real hard.
The Chicago Bulls had hard work and motivation to begin with. It
was intense energy. So I didn't have to instill those kind of
things. This is a team that has not worked real hard. They haven't
gotten that intensity level. We have to build that first of all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 54-year-old Jackson, who took over the Lakers in June, is
experiencing a slow indoctrination to his players, they are also
curious to find out about him. After his hiring, Derek Fisher and
Rick Fox read ``Sacred Hoops,'' Jackson's first book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that stuck out in my mind had nothing to do with
religion or anything,'' Fisher said. ``During one of their
championship years before the finals, he was feeling that the team
was bogged down and they were at a standstill. He recommended to
them that they get a room at the hotel, order some pizzas and some
beer. Just have some fun, hang out, be people and be human and let
all this basketball stuff go for a night or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That struck me as odd that a coach would recommend you to go
out and have a couple of drinks and relax and be yourself for a
change _ and not worry so much about trying to be who somebody else
wants you to be. That's him. He sees where a team can be. And he
sees the steps in between, getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said: ``You can tell we have a lot more new-age stuff on the
way. But I think he's waiting for us to pick up the triangle
offense before he starts handing out gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The triple-post offense is the adopted brainchild of assistant
coach Tex Winter, who came with Jackson from the Bulls along with
the rest of Jackson's staff. The scheme revolves around movement
and the notion that any part is interchangeable. Jordan and Scottie
Pippen were its greatest practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give us a low C so far,'' O'Neal said. ``We've been
running into each other a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said: ``Right now, they're having a lot of trouble. Some
of the more conceptual people have ability to see it as a whole. A
lot of guys are just seeing it as their individual self inside of
this collective effort. So we've got a lot of concerns about people
and their ability to grasp it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Salley and Ron Harper, two 35-year-old former Bulls, were
brought back from retirement to play for the Lakers and help them
with the transition to Jackson's ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to organize 12 companies to think one way,'' Salley
said. ``We're all millionaires with our own interests and
investments, so that's what it comes down to. Phil's job is kind of
what the Rockefellers do. When I was with Detroit, we were the
black cloud hanging over Chicago. Phil removed that cloud when
everybody bought into what he was doing. They did it through the
triangle. That's how they finally beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson cannot predict the exact moment his new team might grasp
Chicago's old system. When it happens, it happens suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Fox explained: ``You have to be a visionary in a sense of
reading the defense. I don't sense that we're going to go out this
year and slice and dice somebody. It's like the chi of basketball,
taking what they give us and turning it against them. That's
exactly what this offense is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Fox, one of the more conceptual Lakers,
straddles that fine L.A. line between the visionaries and the
beautiful people. The ruggedly handsome forward married actress and
singer Vanessa Williams this summer and has appeared in several
films himself.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant and O'Neal have more
commercials, record deals and endorsement contracts than most
actors in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``To corral these guys in this very hectic town is a
challenge,'' Jackson said. ``It's fraught with distractions,
disorder, and it's a hectic life for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants the 27-year-old O'Neal to mature into the team leader.
He wants the 21-year-old Bryant, who is expected to miss the
season's first weeks with a broken right hand, to slow down and not
try to be an icon overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has given his full attention,'' Jackson said. ``He's been
wonderful to deal with. And Kobe has a Michael Jordan willful kind
of way about him, where he'll do anything to get better. He's
almost too dedicated in a way that a coach loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a child that just graduated from college. She's 22.
Rather than jumping into a career the moment she finishes her
degree, there's some latitude about you enjoying life and getting
into life. I think that's very important for kids to let their hair
down a little bit. Kobe has never had that chance. This is good for
him, in a way, to be injured. To step back and look at things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all been very receptive to buying into what we're
doing. But it'll take time. Eventually, I think they're going to
get the fever of what it takes to be a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During his yearlong sabbatical after stepping down from the
Bulls, Jackson played pickup basketball in Woodstock, N.Y., with
friends. He gave motivational speeches and worked for his former
Knicks teammate Bill Bradley, who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did some writing, caught up with his children, visited a
brother in Virginia and did everything a basketball coach is not
able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been to Hawaii,'' he said. ``That's something you
just don't get to do in the middle of the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before he was offered a five-year, $30 million deal by
the Lakers late last spring, Jackson's closest friends were
intimating that he would take another year off and return to the
NBA for the 2000-2001 season. They suggested he would be
instrumental in Bradley's campaign and stay as far removed from the
game as he could. Something changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge isn't whether I can win a championship without
Michael Jordan or whether I can get Kobe and Shaq to play together
and win,'' Jackson said. ``I wanted to bring this system and
philosophy to another team and see it work. I was paid a lot of
money to speak to people, to carry certain philosophies, carry
certain ideals in different situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He views Pat Riley's ability to succeed with three franchises as
a measuring stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that standpoint, you have to say his philosophy and his
style works,'' Jackson said of Riley. ``He's a pioneer in his
field. I'd like to be known for the same thing, that I could pick
up and take my philosophy to another system, and then it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was a consideration, but this is a team that could
be there. We're missing a little piece. We're not as talented as a
lot of people think we are. But we're going to be there because of
what we have. Can we do it down the stretch? Can we do it in the
playoffs? Are we going to be intelligent enough and can we get the
chemistry right so we can do it? That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a gradual process, this making the Lakers see beyond their
own athleticism and physical prowess. The first step is showing
them how to work and learn a new offense. Soon, Jackson will try to
tap further into their psyches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me about getting books for this team,'' he
said. ``I don't have any clue what their preferences are. I can't
go out and buy an intimate thing like a book, which I consider an
intimate gift, a door opening that says, `I know a little bit about
you and here's something you might be interested in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said: ``That was Chicago. This isn't Chicago. I'm pretty
sure we'll get some books on this team to read. Now, I don't know
if the guys on this team will enjoy reading those books. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, O'Neal has seen more of Jackson the
drill sergeant than he has of the introspective soul who
orchestrated group meditations in Chicago and espoused the
spiritual power of Native American artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blows the whistle, everyone turns around,'' O'Neal said.
``Like my father when I was a kid or Dale Brown at L.S.U. As good
as I am, I don't think people understand that I don't have a
problem with authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal knows that one of these days, Jackson will push the
envelope and try to reach his players by other means. When that
happens, he said, he will think back to the gleaming trophies in
Montana and accept whatever ``gifts of knowledge,'' as he put it,
wind up in his locker cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's time for me to step up my game, I will,'' he said.
``And if not, I'll eat live insects and dog food on national TV,
with chopsticks. I'll even let you pick the insects.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper was right. This isn't Chicago.

MAN'S EAR BITTEN OFF IN FIGHT WITH CABBY, WHO IS THEN SHOT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An off-duty security guard shot a livery-cab driver
in Brooklyn early Saturday, after the driver bit off a large
portion of the guard's ear, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard, Gary Theis, 38, had just returned from work
and was parking outside his home in East Flatbush when he heard the
livery-cab driver, Gene Leveque, 36, sounding his horn to signal a
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Theis found the honking obnoxious at 1:30 a.m., but Leveque
argued that it was perfectly appropriate, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument quickly escalated into a brawl, and during it,
Leveque bit off a large section of Theis' left ear, police said.
They said the fight ended when Theis pulled his handgun, for which
he has a license, and shot the driver once in the left torso.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found both men bleeding in front of Theis' apartment
building at 2021 E. 41st St. The combatants were taken to Kings
County Hospital Center, where they remained in stable condition
Saturday, police said, noting that Leveque, of 5515 Avenue M,
Brooklyn, and Theis both face charges of first-degree assault. &QL;

OFF-SEASON CHALLENGE: HOW TO BEAT THE YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gord Ash thought he saw a glimmer of vulnerability. ``I believe
there was a bit of a stumbling block this year,'' the Toronto Blue
Jays' general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had lost all three games to Boston in a September
series at Yankee Stadium, and now they were in Toronto, having lost
the first game, their lead over the Red Sox down to three and a
half games. In the eighth inning of the second game, the Blue Jays
led, 6-1, but then, Ash said the Yanks ``became rejuvenated.''
Bernie Williams hit a grand slam, Paul O'Neill duplicated it in the
ninth, and all was right with the Yankees again. They won that
game, 10-6, then the next three and nine of 10. They didn't stop
winning until last week, when they ran out of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   So can anyone beat the Yankees? ``It doesn't look like it,'' Ash
said. ``Not in the postseason anyway. They have so many veterans
who rise to the occasion at that point in the season. They are
tough to beat. They play very disciplined, very unselfishly. That's
a very unique and formidable combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette, whose Red Sox finished second to the Yankees in
the regular season and in the league finals, felt his team at least
narrowed the gap this year. ``They were not as terrific as they
were a year ago,'' the Boston general manager said. ``We played
them 17 times this year. We won nine, they won eight. They won the
four that counted the most. But we're closer now to challenging the
Yankees than we were a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As challengers, though, Duquette said, the Red Sox and anyone
else have to be better to supplant the Yankees. ``They're the
reigning world champions,'' he said. ``It's like a heavyweight
fight. You can't just beat them if you're the challenger; you have
to knock them out. We got close this year, and they skipped away
and beat the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was not fooling himself about the distance to be
covered. ``Whoever's going to beat the Yankees has their work cut
out for them,'' he said. ``They have three great players in the
middle of every game _ Williams, Jeter and Rivera _ and they have
some good years ahead of them. They also have a veteran team, a
stable team, good depth, good pitching depth and good depth to
their bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating the Yankees in the postseason, he said, is
the presence of a Pedro Martinez. ``If you have a top pitcher and
your top pitcher can pitch a few games in a series against them,
that could make a difference,'' he said. Unfortunately for the Red
Sox, Martinez couldn't pitch until the third game and his ensuing
victory was too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep trying,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Texas Rangers, but they have more ground to make up
than the Red Sox. In six playoff games against the Yankees the past
two seasons, the Rangers have scored a total of two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play well as a team, they really do,'' said the Rangers'
general manager, Doug Melvin, about the Yankees. ``They were great
in the postseason. They have pretty good depth with their pitching.
Whatever button Joe Torre punched, it worked. Last year he played
Shane Spencer, and he won some games for him. This year he played
Chad Curtis, and he won a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, the Houston general manager, watched the World
Series from the stands after his team failed to get past the first
round of the playoffs for the third successive season. Hunsicker
talked about what the Yankees have working for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that really stood out for me was what a good
situational hitting team they were,'' Hunsicker said. ``It was
especially impressive because that's been one of the main problems
our club has had getting out of the first round. When you get into
the postseason, you're going to face quality pitching every day.
Unless your team is willing to change its approach, it's going to
be tough to win. They do that better than any team I've seen all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin added a view of the Yankees that has rarely been heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a club you can like,'' said Melvin, a former Yankees
minor-league pitcher and front-office employee. ``Some Yankee teams
in the past you weren't fond of. You didn't want them to win. I'm
in the American League trying to beat them, but it's easy to root
for these guys because of Joe Torre, Brian Cashman, Gene Michael.
The players show a lot of class, too. It's class and
competitiveness, too. They play the game hard. They're a team you
can like even if you're competing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's impossible to talk about the Yankees' success without
talking about the money behind it. Officials of other clubs don't
begrudge the Yankees the money they have available, but they wish
they had it, and many of them know they won't be able to compete
with the Yankees unless they do have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think there are only a handful of teams that
at the start of the season have a chance to beat the Yankees,''
Gerry Hunsicker of Houston said. ``It comes down to money. Nobody
wants to talk about money. People suggest that's an excuse, but
it's a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The major-league payroll isn't all that enters into the
championship picture, Hunsicker added.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more organizations are not able to compete in
scouting and player development,'' he said. ``Not that they're not
capable, but they don't have the money and the resources. The
Yankees do a terrific job with their resources. You have to give
them credit for that because a lot of organizations have egg on
their faces because they've spent a lot of money and have little
show for it. More and more clubs are being shut out of competing
for players. Latin America is a good example.''
</P>
<P>
   Latest case in point: In an ongoing auction for the latest Cuban
defector, a 22-year-old pitcher, Danny Baez, the bidding is said to
have reached $10 million (signing bonus, three-year contract), and,
an executive of another club said, the Yankees appear to be the
front-runner, just as they were with El Duque, Orlando Hernandez,
an older Cuban defector.
</P>
<P>
   Also, earlier this year, the Yankees signed Willy Mo Pena, an
outfielder from the Dominican Republic, to a five-year, $3.7
million contract after he was declared a free agent. The Mets had
signed him for $6,000, but it was discovered that the scout who
signed him signed his father's name on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Yankees drafted Drew Henson, a high school third
baseman, and gave him a $2 million signing bonus, the most money
ever given a third-round pick, even though he planned to throw
passes for the University of Michigan football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have the money; it's another thing to be
able to make big money mistakes and just keep making them because
the additional money is there,'' Hunsicker said. ``I can't go out
and spend a million dollars on a Latin player to begin with. But if
I could, it would have a major impact. Our whole signing bonus
budget, domestic and international, last year was $3 million. It
doesn't take a genius to know if you sign one player for $1
million, you wouldn't have much left.''

ALL-CENTURY FALLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALL-CENTURY TEAM FALLOUT I
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose, 10 years later, apparently continues to labor under
misapprehensions. Just because the agreement under which he was
suspended in 1989 said he could apply for reinstatement after one
year, a provision that merely followed baseball rules, he seems to
think that meant he would be reinstated after one year. His
advisers might have led him to believe that, but Fay Vincent,
deputy commissioner then, said no such promise or suggestion was
made.
</P>
<P>
   Rose believes Commissioner Bart Giamatti double-crossed him by
saying publicly he believed Rose bet on baseball when no such
finding was included in the agreement. Rose's people, Vincent said,
had been told what Giamatti would say if he were asked what he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-CENTURY TEAM FALLOUT II
</P>
<P>
   Those who concocted the idea for the team decided to have a
maximum of 30 players (25 elected by the public, a maximum of five
added by a panel) to simulate the 30-man roster that is used for
the All-Star Game. But the All-Star Game features two 30-man
rosters. Had 50 or 60 players been selected, the honor might have
been reduced for the 30 who were named to the team, but the extra
places would have avoided the huge hurt inflicted on the Latin
American community over the absence of Roberto Clemente, not to
mention the problems with other oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the methodology was ridiculous when you're considering
the greatest players of the century,'' said Tom Reich, a player
agent and member of the board of directors of the Clemente
foundation. ``If they were voting publicly on 25, an oversight
committee properly balanced should have been empowered to name at
least another 25 people. You're talking about a 100-year span.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said the absence of Clemente, Frank Robinson, Josh Gibson,
Satchel Paige, Juan Marichal and Roy Campanella was especially
grievous. ``The five players added,'' he said, ``were eminently
qualified, but there were at least 20 or so more than absolutely
had to be named.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Reich said, was the public voting that could be
done on the Internet. How many members of the black and Hispanic
communities, he asked, go on the Internet compared with white
users? Six black players were elected. No Hispanic players made the
team either by election or selection.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig said he was ``extremely sensitive'' to
the angry reaction to Clemente's absence. ``I understand their
concern,'' he said. ``Roberto Clemente would have made my team.''

   ETHNIC-POLITICS-REVIEW (New York) _ Ethnic politics has reached
a level of complexity that is confounding politicians across the
nation. Candidates are being forced to take positions on
complicated issues, pitting the perceived interests of one ethnic
group against the sentiment of the population at large, or dividing
members of these purportedly solid constituencies by generation,
ideology and economic class. These pressures come at time when
ethnic groups that once existed at the margins of politics have
become powerful forces. The Senate race in New York may provide an
intricate roadmap for where ethnic politics in U.S. is heading. By
Adam Nagourney.

<P>
   OBESITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the upsurge in obesity and
the prospects of drugs and other treatments for dealing with it. A
hormone called leptin that was supposed to be the magic bullet for
obesity, making people effortlessly lose fat while retaining
muscle, looks like a bust. By Gina Kolata.

<P>
   PRESCHOOL-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is the appropriate age for
children to start school? Americans instinctively say 5 or 6. In
some European countries, toddlers of 2 and 3 attend government-run
classes. And with a host of new research showing lasting impact of
education in the earliest years of life, along with the continued
push of women into the workforce _ both among upper-class
professionals and former welfare recipients _ a movement for
universal preschool in the U.S. is gaining momentum. By Jodi
Wilgoren.

<P>
   SUBSTANTIVE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the grousing
about 30-second sound bites and shallow politicians, this already
has been one of the most substantive presidential campaigns in
years _ if not decades. Candidate after candidate has issued quite
detailed position papers on a host of issues, far more and far
earlier than the last few campaigns. By Richard L. Berke.

   SIDEWALK-TV-REVIEW (New York) _ Early-morning television is

   HEALTH-FEAR-ADS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Be afraid. Be very afraid.
This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns
encouraging young people to abandon unhealthy behavior like
smoking, binge drinking or unsafe sex. From billboards to public

   PALESTINIAN-ECON-REVIEW (Ramallah, West Bank) _ A new route for
goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza offers the prospect
of unifying them into one integrated economy, a prerequisite for
building a viable Palestinian state. But new opening has already
exposed the stark cultural and economic contrasts between the two
regions. Now, the poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans
will compete for jobs with the more settled and secular urbanites
of the West Bank. This could mean unwelcome sacrifices for the West
Bank, and could trigger resentment and envy among the Gazans. By
William Orme.

<P>
   CENTRAL-ASIA-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Osh, Kyrgyzstan) _ The appearance
of Islamic insurgents in this remote Central Asian country has not
only shocked regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese
neighbors. It has also awakened the world to a troubling new

who are roaming this part of the world in search of regimes to
overthrow. By Steven Kinzer.

   WORLD-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Each year, Transparency
International, a non-profit group based in Berlin that specializes

MARBURY-VAN HORN DUO MAY BE UP WITH THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Granted, they were only preseason games, but in them, Scott
Layden watched the New Jersey Nets' Stephon Marbury and Keith Van
Horn twice dominate the New York Knicks in ways that provoked
thoughts of some of basketball's most revered duos.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, the Knicks' first-year general manager, knows plenty
about outstanding twosomes, having been largely responsible for
matching John Stockton and Karl Malone in Utah. Now just a casual
car ride away from the Meadowlands, Layden fears he may have
transplanted himself into a geographic rivalry with a comparable
point guard-power forward tandem that, like the Jazz's pair of
future Hall of Famers, could stamp its imprint on an entire era of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marbury and Van Horn are so gifted and so multi-talented,''
said Layden, who worked with the Utah Jazz for 18 years before
joining the Knicks. ``I watched Keith for four years at the
University of Utah, so I'm one of his biggest fans. And Marbury
might be the best guard in the league. So you've got these two
guys, who obviously are going to play a long time together, and
they're going to do very well. If they get as good as Stockton and
Malone, that'll be something. Frankly, it's a little frightening
when you're sitting across the river from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons, some legitimate and some absurd, are always being
made in the National Basketball Association, so it is inevitable
that Marbury and Van Horn will be likened to Stockton and Malone.
Of course, the list of superstar tandems that once seemed destined
to duplicate Stockton and Malone is long and distinguished, but for
reasons ranging from personality clashes to free-agent wandering,
none have lasted.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal split after three seasons in
Orlando. Shawn Kemp, who demanded a trade, left Gary Payton in
Seattle while both were in their prime. And Marbury himself forced
his way out of Minnesota, despite forming a devastating duo with
his good friend Kevin Garnett. And in 1991, Kenny Anderson and
Derrick Coleman teamed up for the Nets amid huge expectations, only
to have their well-documented problems on and off the court keep
them from accomplishing anything significant. Eventually, both were
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The current Nets are in a different situation. Benefiting from
the league's new collective bargaining agreement, which put a cap
on the amount of money players can earn, the team signed both
Marbury and Van Horn to six-year extensions worth just over $70
million, meaning that the duo should be together at least until the
2004-05 season.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both players want to play in New Jersey. Neither
tested the free-agent market before signing a contract and both are
happy with the makeup of the club. Marbury, a Brooklyn, N.Y.,
native, seems to have a strong enough personality to endure being
close to home, and Van Horn is content living with his wife and two
children in Franklin Lakes, N.J. So the early indication is that
the two young Nets will be together for the prime of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   When Marbury and Van Horn are compared with Stockton and Malone,
it is in terms of their potential impact on the game, not their
style of play. Although Marbury, like Stockton, is excellent at
penetrating, drawing defenders and finding the open man, he shoots
and scores much more than the Jazz playmaker. Van Horn can run the
floor like Malone, but his inside game is not nearly as strong. His
outside shot, however, is better than Malone's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good parallel, not that Stephon plays exactly like
Stockton or Keith like Malone,'' said Jim Lynam, a Nets assistant
who has more than 10 years of NBA head coaching experience. ``But
in terms of being absolutely high-high-level players, I think the
Stockton-Malone parallel is right on target, because these two guys
complement one another. Each makes the other better because of
their own unique talents, and both have great competitive
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Van Horn have worked hard to harmonize their games.
Because Marbury's play is at times unorthodox, with no-look and
behind-the-back passes, Van Horn has had to study his point guard
to know when to expect a feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephon's very good at passing in the air, so when he gets up
in the air, I usually don't just stand there,'' Van Horn said. ``I
try to reactto it because I know if somebody gets in his face,
he's going to find someone quickly. A lot of times when a point
guard gets in the air, he scrambles and doesn't know what to do
with it. But Stephon always seems to find somebody at the last
minute, so I've become accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury believes he and Van Horn are ``playing on a string'' _
his term for in sync _ and that with more practice together, they
will only get better. He is not afraid to compare the two of them
to the standard by which today's point guard-power forward
combinations are judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get in a groove, we look like Stockton and Malone when
they were in their prime,'' Marbury said. ``Playing with Keith is
great because he can do so many different things. I didn't know he
was this good. When I got a chance to play with him, I was like,
`Wow, this guy is one of the best players in the NBA!'''
</P>
<P>
   With two young, high-scoring players who are used to being the
first offensive option, the possibility for conflict always exists.
The Nets hope each player's desire to win will quell any problems.
Yet already there have been signs in the preseason that shot
distribution could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has set up his teammates with numerous open looks,
Marbury has shot far too much, averaging a whopping 23.5 shots a
game. That was eight more than Van Horn averaged in the preseason
and nearly two more than Philadelphia's Allen Iverson averaged last
year. Van Horn says Marbury's gunning is not a problem, but great
duos have been destroyed over less, as Nets General Manager John
Nash noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to be the high scorer on the team?'' Nash said.
``Is it going to be Keith Van Horn or Stephon Marbury? If either
guy cares that badly, then we've got a problem. The answer is
whoever's open should get the shot, and let's win the game. Each
guy averaged 21 points and change a year ago. Who's going to score
the most points is not what this should be about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can these two be like a Stockton-Malone tandem? In time. I'm
not ready to anoint them because those two guys are Hall of Fame
plus. But there's a chance.''

IN HOUSING MARKET, INVENTORY IS DOWN AND PRICES UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By some accounts, the house on New Rochelle's Van
Meter Fenway was a mess, the sort of home that should have gone for
a relative pittance to anyone who was ready to stomach perhaps
$100,000 in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The house, according to real estate agents, needed everything: a
shoring up of its foundation, a new kitchen, new flooring, new
landscaping, a hard-core paint job on the outside and a new roof to
replace the one that had caved in over the screened-in porch.
</P>
<P>
   In a less frenzied real estate market, the house might have
taken a year or more to sell. But within a week of being listed at
$265,000 early last summer, it had more than 30 offers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the house sold for $335,000, and little wonder: In
New Rochelle, as in many communities within the New York
metropolitan area, homes for sale, many brokers say, seem to have
simply vanished.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the problem appears more severe in certain
communities and for homes within certain price ranges. And real
estate agents report that there are still houses that are taking
months to sell, usually because they are unusual properties that
have highly specialized features, or because they are seriously
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the New York metropolitan area
appears to be in the midst of an inventory drought that many real
estate professionals say they have never seen before. As a result,
they say, homes coming on the market are more often than not
spurring bidding wars that frequently leave both buyer and seller
gasping in disbelief. In New Rochelle, for example, overnight price
increases of 25 percent are no longer uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not negotiating here _ it's like an auction,'' said
Hiedi Ross, a sales agent for the local Century 21 King David
office. She said that one of her current clients, a couple who have
a mortgage commitment of $650,000, can't seem to land a house
because they are persistently outbid by at least $20,000 every time
a house comes up within their price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen the market like this,'' said Gerald Ziering,
president of the Century 21 King David office. ``In most markets
you usually have an inventory surplus that keeps moving along with
the market, but in this case the surplus was eaten up about a year
ago, so now there's nothing that we're carrying forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much of the inventory crunch can be pegged to a
strong economy, as well as years of relatively low interest rates.
But real estate brokers cite other factors as well.
</P>
<P>
   First, because of rising land values, new-home construction is
virtually nonexistent in many areas of suburban New York and the
city itself, especially the most desirable sections; for the same
reason, many homeowners are deciding to stay put and renovate
rather than move.
</P>
<P>
   A contributing but statistically untrackable factor, brokers and
others knowledgeable about the market say, is that the flush
economy is spurring homeowners, mostly in the suburbs, to try to
sell homes on their own rather than listing them with a broker and
paying a subsequent fee.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, meanwhile, are reacting to the inventory crunch by
increasingly asking that listings be considered exclusives rather
than sharing listings with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   All this has already fostered a mountain of anecdotes. There are
tales of brokers who used to routinely have dozens of listings at a
time but now are hard pressed to come up with enough to count on
one hand; open houses that have long lines of potential buyers
snaking out the door, and brokers who are slashing commissions _
perhaps by half _ to get listings.
</P>
<P>
   There are stories of smaller real estate firms that have gone
out of business for lack of listings, as well as sellers who have
become so overwhelmed by multiple bids for their homes that they
have whisked them off the market. And finally, there are examples
of how dispirited many potential home buyers have become.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last three sales that I've had, the first question I
was asked was how long had the house been on the market,'' said
Katy Anastasio, the founder of Anastasio Associates Inc. Realtors
in Huntington, which has been in business since 1980. ``It seems
that if a house is on the market for longer than a week, then
people wonder if there is something wrong with it.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In some communities, the current inventory drought apparently
has less to do with fewer houses coming on the market overall, and
more to do with lightning-fast turnover, which has caused so-called
standing inventory to reach dismally low levels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Linda Hodge, a broker at the Greenwich, Conn.,
office for Preferred Properties, said that brokers in her area
actually had slightly more listings for single-family residential
properties _ 1,910 listings vs. 1,899 _ through the first eight
months of this year than they did for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that inventory is low, as it is responding to
market turnover,'' said Ms. Hodge. ``It's a turnover situation
because houses that were once just satisfactory are moving faster
than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebie Wood, regional manager for Houlihan Lawrence in Pound Ridge
and South Salem agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have the same amount of homes coming on to the
market as in the past, but now they're coming on at time where
there are a lot of serious buyers who are not lingering when they
see a house that meets their needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many real estate agents report that they are actually
seeing far fewer listings than before. Moreover, they report that
the drought doesn't appear to be tied to the fact that fall is a
time when generally fewer houses go on the market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Anastasio said that in her area, which is the
north shore of western Suffolk County, there are currently only
about 150 listings of houses for sale, as opposed to 350 at the
same time last year. Ms. Ross added that over the last six months
of this year, brokers in New Rochelle had only 182 listings, a
number that traditionally would have been perhaps 500 or 600.
</P>
<P>
   Certain types of homes appear to be especially scarce. For
example, a year ago, Evelyn Atanas, the founder of the 15-year-old
Atanas Realty in Williston Park had some 20 homes to show in
central Nassau County that were priced in the low $200,000s. But
now her least expensive home is a ``tiny'' house in Mineola, for
$249,000; most of her listings are priced at $279,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the supply of town houses and condominiums that
are relatively close to New York City is especially tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a healthy market we would probably have about five months
of town-house inventory, which means we would have 75 listings for
every 15 reported sales,'' said Jacelyn Botti, regional vice
president for Weichert Realtors in central New Jersey. ``But now we
have less than a 30-day supply of such homes, which means we have
fewer listings than we do reported sales.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   In general, ``we've been in a low inventory situation for
years,'' said Lawrence Sicular, an appraisal analyst for Brown
Harris Stevens, which handles mostly blue-chip properties.
Nevertheless, Sicular added that supply _ relative to demand _
appears to be substantially tighter for certain types of properties
vs. others, and is now generally tightest for larger apartments,
which have also experienced the largest price jumps over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, Sicular has conducted a monthly inventory survey
for his firm of the most expensive sections of the Upper East Side
and Central Park West. And he cautioned that his results are often
based on relatively small sample sizes, because certain types of
apartments for sale, such as prewar six-room units, are relatively
rare to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in his most recent survey, taken last week, he
found that there are now roughly 28 percent fewer Classic Six
prewar co-op apartments _ with two bedrooms, a dining room and a
maid's room _ for sale in those neighborhoods than there were in
April. On the other hand, he said, the supply of similar postwar
apartments in those neighborhoods has grown 110 percent, while the
number of 1,500-square-foot or more lofts downtown has grown 34
percent since July.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, Sicular suspects that the inventory crunch
in Manhattan has eased a bit since Labor Day, for seasonal reasons
and possibly because a jittery stock market has put some potential
buyers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Manhattan, ``We're in a situation where demand for
one- to four-family homes has far exceeded supply,'' said Kenyatta
Punter, the founder of a real estate firm with the same name. ``We
started to see signs of an inventory problem in the fourth quarter
of 1998, and it's been a tight market since then.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how tight the situation has become, Punter, who
is also president of the Greater Harlem Real Estate Board, said
that open houses in his area now bring, on average, 50 to 75
attendees, whereas in 1997 attendance might have been 15 to 20
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Monday, it's not atypical now to receive 10 offers from an
open house, whereas in 1997 you might solicit just two or three
offers,'' he said, adding that the inventory crunch has also caused
prices in his area to rise 20 percent to 25 percent since January.
He said that a brownstone in the Hamilton Heights area near City
College that had an asking price of $500,000 in February is now in
contract for $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the brownstone communities surrounding Brooklyn Heights,
Cobble Hill, and Park Slope, Christopher Thomas, director of the
Brooklyn offices for the William May Company, said that there is
currently less town-house inventory available, compared to last
fall, but that the number of co-op apartments for sale has probably
stayed about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in prices here has been driven heavily by the
lack of inventory,'' Thomas added. According to his figures,
Brooklyn town houses that were selling for between $1.7 million and
$2 million this time last year are now available for $2.3 million
and up. As for co-op apartments, prices have risen, on average,
some 15 percent since January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory crunch may, however, be easing, according to
Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East
Brunswick, N.J., who said that a sharp drop in the number of sales
contracts in New Jersey suggests that buyers may be resisting
paying the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the buying resistance, Otteau said, is seasonal: Most
local buyers tend to buy in the spring and summer months, so that
they can move before school begins. Nevertheless, he added, his
firm is now seeing cases of sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are looking at significantly higher prices for less
desirable homes than what we had available six months ago, and that
has created price resistance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Otteau added that the resistance helps explain why home sales in
New Jersey _ as measured by signed contracts _ appear to have
dropped dramatically since last summer _ some 40 percent _ as well
as why prices appear to have peaked. By comparison, Otteau said,
sales from the summer to the fall last year dropped between 15
percent and 20 percent, less than half the rate for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions to the sharp drop in sales, he said, appear
to be entry-level houses that cost less than $250,000, and homes in
so-called secondary markets, those markets that consumers tend to
settle for when they can't afford the more desirable primary
markets. According to Otteau's figures, housing prices in New
Jersey's primary markets have jumped between 15 percent and 20
percent over the last year, but they have risen only 5 percent to
10 percent in the state's secondary markets
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hodes-Stempler is a home shopper frustrated by the price
jumps in her area, as well as the dearth of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her husband, 2-year-old son, and brother, Ms.
Hodes-Stempler now lives in a rented five-bedroom, three-bathroom
house in Fresh Meadows, Queens. After four years of renting, the
family is ready to buy a home. But Ms. Hodes-Stempler and her
husband couldn't afford to buy the home they live in _ a house that
went on the market this fall for $389,000 and that received a
successful bid, for $375,000, in just two weeks. Nor can they
afford anything else in Fresh Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the couple are now looking on Long Island, where
they hope to find a home that costs roughly $300,000, to balance
the higher taxes there.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodes-Stempler has seen dozens of houses since August,
through a dozen different real estate agents. Still, she feels as
though she is being shown the same recycled inventory. ``Agents are
acting like all their listings are fresh, but usually when they
call, I've already seen the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, Ms. Hodes-Stempler did hear of one house that
fit her needs: a four-bedroom Cape on a large lot in New Hyde Park
that was listed for $299,000, and that would have had an annual
real-estate tax payment of just $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time her broker was finally able to get her an
appointment to see the house, it was too late: the owners had
already accepted a bid. Still, Ms. Hodes-Stempler liked the house
enough to send the owners a check for $1,000, to hold her own bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mad land grab here, but it is sort of desperate,''
she said. As an example, she pointed to 30 or so real estate agents
and their clients who were parked on the lawn of her rented home
when she came home from work one day a few weeks ago. They were
waiting to see a house that Ms. Hodes-Stempler thinks would have
sold for roughly $100,000 less just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say Ms. Hodes-Stempler's experience isn't
unusual. Indeed, they claim that many consumers have become
unusually aggressive at getting the house they want.
</P>
<P>
   Take the couple who attended an open house that Ms. Atanas, the
Williston Park broker, recently sponsored in Mineola. The open
house was for a three-bedroom Colonial that was priced at $235,000,
a rarity, by any measure, in central Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Atanas, the first day the house was on the
market, its owners received three offers, all full-priced. In the
end, however, the owners accepted a bid from a couple who refused
to leave the house until they knew they had it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atanas called a mortgage broker that she works with, who
preapproved the couple's mortgage on the spot. Meanwhile, the
couple arranged to have an engineer inspect the house Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract went out on Tuesday, and within a week it was
signed, sealed, and delivered,'' she said. ``That's how fast this
couple worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every home is moving at such speed, of course. Ms. Wood, for
example, can think of one home in northern Westchester that was
recently put on the market by its owners _ an estate _ for
$550,000, but which she thought should have been priced at
$495,000.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after it went on the market, the house received two bids,
for $480,000 and $485,000, but the estate turned both offers down.
After several months of paying carrying charges for the property,
however, the estate reduced the price of the home to $475,000, and
eventually sold it for $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   In this market, if that house had been priced properly, it would
have sold immediately,'' Ms. Wood said. ``Sellers should remember
that their home will probably sell for less than it would have sold
for if it had gone to market at the right price, and while this is
usually a real-estate truism, it's especially true in a very active
market such as what we now have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Otteau also urges sellers not to get too greedy. Based on
what he has recently noticed within the New Jersey real estate
market, he thinks that homeowners who want to sell their homes over
the next three or four months will need to price them more
competitively than was necessary six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Betsy Goss, a sales agent at Prudential Connecticut
Realty in Darien, urges sellers to remember that the fall and
winter months often bring in a different kind of buyer than do the
spring months. ``Often these buyers have been looking and looking,
and are educated enough to know the market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What about buyers? Ms. Goss advises them to get preapproval for
a mortgage before they start looking, and to come see the house as
soon as they can with checkbooks in hand. As for Ms. Ross, the real
estate agent in New Rochelle, she urges buyers to take a reality
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the asking price no longer gets you the
house,'' she said. ``If it's a good house, you've got to go over
that price immediately.''

AUSTRALIA BEATS SOUTH AFRICA IN WORLD CUP RUGBY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ South Africa had never lost a game in the rugby union
World Cup, and when their stocky fly-half Jannie de Beer sent an
improbable 40-meter penalty kick through on the last play of
regulation to send Saturday's semifinal against Australia into
overtime, it appeared that the Springboks might not leave
windswept, rainswept Twickenham Stadium a loser either.
</P>
<P>
   There was a whiff of destiny about de Beer's oscillating kick
into the wind; a whiff of the sort of good fortune that had helped
the South Africans win the last World Cup on their own soil and
spark a national celebration and a powerful, if ephemeral,
rapprochement between the black majority that never much cared for
rugby because of its links with the apartheid regime and the white
minority that could not get enough of the rough and tumble game.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, de Beer's kick was only a perfectly timed
tease. There will be no chance to repeat the memorable victory
embrace between Nelson Mandela, the former South African president,
and the Springbok captain. Not this year. The Australians, slightly
more constructive and creative throughout this bone-rattling
encounter, made sure of that by scoring nine points to the South
Africans' three in the 20 minutes of overtime and then walking off
the field drenched and delighted with a 27-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians will now face the winner of Sunday's semifinal,
between the tournament favorite, New Zealand, and this year's most
prominent underachiever, France.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for any of the remaining games to match the
suspense of this one. It was a game without tries (comparable to
touchdowns in football), but a game in which the players never
stopped trying their best: tackling ferociously and scrambling for
loose balls and precious meters inside and outside the aptly named
scrums and rucks and mauls that are the rough and equally rough
equivalent of line play in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a roller-coaster ride, a great sporting game,'' said
South African coach Nick Mallett. ``There are two ways you can be
disappointed: because you let yourself down or because of the
result. This team has not let itself down. It gave its best and has
nothing to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa and Australia know each other well. They play
against each other annually in the Tri Nations tournament along
with New Zealand. They are the best the Southern Hemisphere has to
offer, and the Southern Hemisphere remains the center of power in
this sport that was invented, like so many other of this century's
most popular games, by the British.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand won the first World Cup in 1987; Australia the
second in 1991; the South Africans the third in their return to
international competition after being banned from the first two
because of their political system.
</P>
<P>
   The Springboks experienced another tumultuous stretch in 1997
and 1998 in which the specter of racism on their team resurfaced
and coach Andre Markgraaff and federation president Louis Luyt
resigned. They experienced a disquieting stretch earlier this year
when their 17-game victory streak came to a halt and they were
beaten by Wales, trounced twice by New Zealand and once by
Australia, in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Springboks and Mallet, their uncommonly cosmopolitan
coach, managed to grind out a much-needed 10-9 victory over the
Australians in the return match in South Africa in August and then
proved that they had recovered their balance and confidence by
defeating England in last week's World Cup quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The key to that victory was de Beer's five drop goals _ a record
_ and a tactical flourish to which the English could find no
riposte. But it was clear early Saturday that the points would not
come as easily for de Beer or his team. De Beer missed his first
two drop goal attempts and the third was blocked. He ended up one
for five.
</P>
<P>
   His place-kicking was much more accurate, however, and he and
Australia's designated kicker, fullback Matt Burke, engaged in an
afternoon-long duel. Burke finished with 24 points on eight penalty
kicks, de Beer with all 21 of South Africa's points on seven
penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic came in the final seconds of injury time in
the second half with Australia leading by 18-15 and agonizingly
close to celebrating. South Africa had possession inside
Australia's half, but the Australians only needed to avoid errors,
contain the Springboks and let the clock run out. Instead,
Australian forward Owen Finegan was called for a penalty after
handling the ball in a ruck, which might sound innocuous to an
uninitiated American but was anything but to Welsh referee Derek
Bevan.
</P>
<P>
   De Beer took a swig of water and made his difficult 40-meter
penalty kick from an angle to send the game into overtime, which
consists of two 10-minute periods with the teams changing sides
between periods. After the first, the score was still even at
21-21, but the Australians knew that if it finished that way, they
would be the team to reach the final because of the tie-breaking
rules in use here (the South Africans had had a player expelled
from a match during this tournament; the Australians had not).
</P>
<P>
   The Springboks needed the points. The Australians would end up
getting them, first on a surprise drop kick from 45 meters by their
own fly-half Stephen Larkham in the 13th minute of overtime. The
kick looked as spontaneous as it was straight, and Burke would add
the final three points with a penalty kick in the 18th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Australians have the chance to win their second World
Cup this year in Britain. Their cricket team won the first this
summer.

INSIDE PARCELLS' HEADSET, SIGNALS ARE SCRAMBLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you may be wondering: is all this misery finally too much
for Bill Parcells, and is he going to pack it in after this season?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. Well, at least not necessarily _ that is, if
you listen to him, try to interpret it, and guess what it all
means.
</P>
<P>
   His team is 1-6 (although without too much stretch of the
imagination, it could be 3-4 or 4-3). With a bye week, he has a
rare Sunday at home to reflect on how difficult this season has
been. And during the week he went through the emotional trauma of
losing his good friend and longtime agent, Robert Fraley, in the
plane crash that claimed the lives of golfer Payne Stewart and four
others.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the future, Parcells said last week that he can
only concentrate on the next game _ next Sunday against the Arizona
Cardinals at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was going to hang 'em up, why is he worrying about
next season's backup quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' he also said last week, ``I'm going to have
to find out whether it's Rick Mirer or Ray Lucas _ it won't be Tom
Tupa _ as Vinny Testaverde's backup next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do something to improve my chances at the position
next season? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   This much Parcells has said about retirement: He wants it to
happen by the time he is 60. He will not be 60 until 2,001.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel my health is an issue, I'll retire,'' he has also
said.
</P>
<P>
   And how is his health?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' he said just the other day.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that when time for retirement comes, ``There'll be
no shame in that.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite quotation of his is borrowed from Marv Levy, his
former colleague in the coaching fraternity who had a long run of
success with the Buffalo Bills. ``When you're thinking of
retirement, you're already retired,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there is this to wonder about: the sale of the club.
Parcells' $2.4 million-a-year contract will still be in force next
year. But how much is Parcells worth to any billionaire who will
shell out about $500 million _ and will, no doubt, want to keep the
coach who turned around the franchise? Certainly, it would seem
that incentives for Parcells to stay would be in the millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But this area is murky, too. What the average fan thinks a
Parcells is worth to a franchise, a potential owner may not.
</P>
<P>
   One recent buyer, who backed away because he thought the team's
price would be too steep, considered the Parcells effect in
purchasing the team. The businessman, who is also active in sports
but did not want to be identified, suggested the following: ``If
you asked me six months ago, I'd give you a different answer. They
were headed for the Super Bowl then. That said, Parcells is good,
but is he the difference in buying a team? I don't think so. The
deal is so expensive, it's not based on people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a problematic lease in that the money they take in
falls far short of what other franchises, with their own stadiums,
have been able to amass.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur looked at it coolly when asked whether he, or
any buyer, would raise Parcells' $2.4 million salary to keep him,
if that is what it took. ``You'd sweeten it,'' he said. ``But it's
hard to sweeten it for only eight games.'' He meant, of course,
that the Jets play eight home games at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   His players have been wondering for weeks whether Parcells will
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'd want to go out on a note like this,''
linebacker Chad Cascadden said. ``We were talking about it and we
came to the conclusion he'd want to go out a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   And Testaverde plans to speak to Parcells after the season about
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him back,'' the quarterback said.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde will tell him that many of the major components,
which Parcells had refined in the past off-season, will remain in
place next season. Indeed, the Jets on paper were a significantly
better club this year than last season, when they came a few
fumbles from winning the American Conference title and going to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells knows that he will face serious cap issues next
season because of the number of high-salaried players. And the team
has yet to sign Pro Bowl linebacker Mo Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask everyone here,'' said a high-ranking team official
who, like almost everyone in the organization, does not want to be
quoted by name, ``to a man no one knows. He just hasn't let on. I
wish I knew, but I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said of Parcells' style, ``He won't know it
until 20 minutes before he knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill goes by how he feels,'' said left tackle Jumbo
Elliott, who had a long stint with Parcells on the Giants before
hooking up with him again on the Jets. ``When he knows, you'll
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime Parcells player whose relationship began back
in New England, running back Curtis Martin, merely said, ``I hope
Bill does what makes his heart sing.''

   BKN-HAWKS _ The Hawks spent the offseason upgrading their
roster, hoping to become more athletic and younger and challenging
the top teams in the Eastern Conference. The revolving door
included the departure of Steve Smith, Mookie Blaylock and Grant
Long while newcomers include Jim Jackson, Lorenzen Wright and draft

defenders won't be allowed to use their hands on players. For the
quicker players in the league such as Philadelphia's Allen Iverson

KWAN IS ENJOYING THE TWISTS OF HER DOUBLE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SKATE-AMERICA) 
(lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS _ On weekdays, when anonymity swallows her up
in the stampede of 24,000 UCLA undergrads hustling to get to class
on time and struggling to stay awake once they get there, Michelle
Kwan's mandatory accessories are books and a baseball cap. On
weekends like this one, when world-class competition calls to her
like a siren, it's back to Spandex, sequins, and a Mona Lisa smile
for the inevitable celebrity spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   This double life that Kwan, the two-time world champion and
three-time national champion, has opted to live, so far has proven
more restorative than distracting. Here at Skate America, the first
significant test of the season, Kwan blithely skated into first
place after Friday's short program with a performance that
expressed a duality befitting its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Kwan hone in like a technician on all eight
required elements, she gave Lennon-McCartney's ``A Day in the
Life'' an air of brooding reverie that transformed a compulsory
test into a work of art. Kwan later supposed it was her karmic
connection to the Beatles (her father named her for their song
``Michelle'') that enabled her to ``let it rip.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, it was that moment of freedom when, just as visions of
homework flitted into her consciousness, she was able to tell
herself that all she had to do for the next two minutes was skate
to perfection. It felt like a release instead of a responsibility.
It felt right.
</P>
<P>
   Now that skating has become her other dimension instead of her
only dimension, Kwan, at 19, could be undergoing a rejuvenation.
After a disappointing 1998 Olympics, where she was upstaged in
Nagano by Tara Lipinski (who immediately abandoned her amateur
career upon pocketing the gold medal and some $10 million in
attendant endorsements), Kwan took her silver medal and began
taking stock of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I thought I could never be happy with just
a silver medal; when I watched the Olympics on TV, I remember I
always pitied the person who got the silver,'' Kwan said over a
post-practice cup of tea, having sworn off the ice cream, fries,
and pizza that added a treacherous 3 pounds to her sylph-like frame
after just one week at college. Kwan said even that tiny quantity
of extra ballast made the two-year-old stress fracture in her toe
start to throb and caused her usually unflappable coach, Frank
Carroll, to exclaim, ``Oh, my God!'' the first time he saw her
after she'd started school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all that late-night studying, sitting there on your
fanny,'' said Kwan, who pulls all-nighters like the rest of the
inmates, but has tempered her snacking and her studying technique.
``I keep myself moving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to assume that Kwan has elected to attend
college and retain her Olympic-eligibility because she's fixated on
coming away from Salt Lake City with a gold medal in 2002, she
hopes that isn't her only reason for making a ``pivotal'' lifestyle
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could stay amateur just for 2002; that's so
far away, and who knows what's going to happen there,'' Kwan said.
``I want to be there with all my heart, but I don't think that's
why I'm doing this. It's not tangible; it's more for the everyday
challenge of skating, of competing, of trying to figure out why, if
I've done that triple a million times in practice, how can I miss
it in competition? How can you say that six minutes at the Olympics
is going to tell you that you'll be happy for the rest of your
life? That's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   So is studying until 4 a.m. in an unair-conditioned dormitory
cubicle while stereos compete for the airwaves and unofficial
football games rage in the hallway, especially when you have to
wake up at seven for a skate and then hustle back to take a quiz.
But for this quarter at least, Kwan is reveling in the frenzy.
She's soaking in ``the whole 9 yards'' of the college experience,
and doing it in sync with her contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me I should wait until I'm 21 to go to school,''
said Kwan, who instead took her cues from her brother and sister
(at California-Irvine and Boston University, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know school could wait, but the experience I wanted
couldn't. I was ready to have my mind not thinking about skating
100 percent; it can drive someone crazy. Believe me, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she also had the positive examples of Olympic medalists
who went the academic route: Dick Button, a Harvard man, won gold
in 1948 and '52; Tenley Albright graduated from Harvard Medical
School after winning gold in '56, and Debi Thomas was attending
Stanford when she won bronze in '88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to succeed 100 percent at combining
school and skating; at times I may fail, but hopefully not
miserably,'' said Kwan, who has noted a connection between her
attitude toward skating and studies. ``I'm pretty extreme; I expect
so much from myself: Why do things halfway?''
</P>
<P>
   Just before this competition, Kwan was fretting about receiving
a B on a quiz, a mark that left her father, Danny, unperturbed.
``He told me what's wrong with a B, B's are good,''' said Kwan.
``But I wanted an A. I guess it's just innate in me that I want to
be better.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kwan, who picked up another record-breaking 6.0, her 21st
in Olympic-style skating, for presentation here on Friday, leaves
unsaid is that she'd like to be best; according to her coach, she's
already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got millions; she doesn't need to work a day in her life
if she doesn't want to, and if she walked away from skating right
this minute, I still feel she'd go down as one of the greats,''
said the 61-year-old Carroll, who has vowed not to retire until
Kwan does.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's not through with it yet. She's intellectual enough
that she knows where she draws her satisfaction from, and it's not
money or medals. It's simply the beauty of skating, and the
competing. Before she started at UCLA, she had the feeling she was
wasting time, wasting her life just on skating, and she did
something about it. She knew she can't be doing double axels until
she's 50, but that education is something you have forever, until
you're dead. Now that she's challenging her mind, the skating has
become a joy again. We'll have to wait and see where that goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ICE CHIPS:
</P>
<P>
   Just behind Michelle Kwan in the short program was 14-year-old
Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., with Russia's Elena Sokolova in
third. The men's standings heading into tonight's long program,
worth two thirds of their score, had Alexei Yagudin of Russia, the
two-time world champion who is also defending this title, in first
place. Michael Weiss, the 1999 United States champion, was second,
and 19-year-old Timothy Goebel, who last year became the first man
to land a quadruple salchow in competition and Friday night became
the first to land the jump in a short program, was third.

IT'S TIME TO CHECK CHIMNEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's flue season. Has your chimney had its annual checkup?
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend that people have their chimneys inspected at
least once a year,'' said Julie Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the
nonprofit National Fire Protection Association, based in Quincy,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reynolds said that of an average 8,800 home fires each year
because of faulty or improperly used fireplaces, about 5,500 are
caused by fires in the chimney itself.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in most chimney fires, she said, is creosote _ a
chemical substance formed from burning wood _ which builds up
inside the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a lot of creosote, it can actually ignite,'' Ms.
Reynolds said. ``And having a fire in your chimney is a lot
different than having a fire in your fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   With a chimney fire, she said, dangerous amounts of smoke can
back up into the house, creating a potentially deadly hazard for
occupants. And if the fire in the chimney gets hot enough, it can
end up setting the house on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason for having an annual chimney checkup, Ms.
Reynolds said, is to ensure that the lining of the flue is in good
shape and will keep smoke and dangerous gases out of the living
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have loose bricks or cracks in the chimney lining, you
can end up with carbon monoxide seeping into the house,'' she said.
``And while we recommend that people consider installing carbon
monoxide detectors, that is no replacement for making sure your
chimney is working properly.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you don't use your fireplace? Is an inspection still
necessary? And what if you don't even have a fireplace to use?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you don't have a fireplace, doesn't mean you
don't have a chimney,'' said Ashley Eldridge, technical director
for the National Chimney Sweep Guild, an industry organization
based in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge explained that just about any house that has to vent
combustion gases _ whether from a fireplace, a wood stove, an oil
furnace, a gas furnace, or even a gas water heater _ will have a
chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, houses that have more than one source of
combustion _ for example, a house with a fireplace and a gas
furnace _ will usually have two separate flues running inside the
chimney. That means that if a homeowner decides to use electric
logs in the fireplace this year, the chimney still needs to be
inspected, because it will be venting the exhaust gas from the
furnace.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, inspecting the chimney by crawling into the
fireplace and shining a flashlight up toward the roof is hardly
going to reveal the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flue from the fireplace might look fine while the flue
from the furnace could be collecting debris,'' he said. One of the
most common causes of heating-system ventilation problems, he said,
is debris that has accumulated at the point where the vent from the
furnace enters the chimney. And while an oil- or gas-furnace flue
is not likely to have problems related to a buildup of creosote,
both are prone to problems of their own.
</P>
<P>
   An oil-fired furnace that is not properly adjusted can cause a
buildup of soot on the interior walls of the chimney. If allowed to
accumulate, Eldridge said, that soot can clog the chimney, thereby
further reducing the efficiency of the furnace. Or the soot can
fall off the lining walls to the bottom and clog the vent itself.
</P>
<P>
   And while gas-fired furnaces burn cleaner and cooler than oil
furnaces, they can cause even more trouble than an oil furnace if
they are not vented correctly. ``There's not a lot of smoke with a
gas appliance,'' Eldridge said. ``But there could be a lot of
condensation.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that since most chimneys were built to accommodate
the exhaust that high-temperature gases produce when coal or oil is
burned, they are not properly sized for exhausting the cooler gases
produced when gas is burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem that bigger is always better, but that's usually
not the case when a new gas furnace is vented into an old
chimney,'' Eldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that since chimneys work because rising hot air
creates the draft necessary to keep everything moving up and out,
problems can arise if the gas in the chimney cools too soon _
something that often happens when low-temperature appliances are
vented through flues designed for high-temperature exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   And when the exhaust from a gas appliance cools too soon,
Eldridge said, condensation forms on the inside walls of the
chimney, setting the stage for major problems down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condensate can be acidic,'' he said, explaining that when
water comes in contact with the byproducts of combustion that line
the interior walls of the flue, one of the resulting substances is
hydrochloric acid. ``The acids can actually destroy the chimney by
eating away at it from within.'' In other words, he said, even a
chimney that looks fine from the outside could have some serious
internal problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   George Infantino, the owner of Chimney Tech, a chimney
inspection and cleaning company based in Island Park, N.Y., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't call me until something goes wrong,''
Infantino said. The most common signs of chimney problems that
homeowners notice are furnace malfunctions, smoke in the house or
loose bricks or masonry on the floor of a fireplace. ``And by the
time things have gotten to that point,'' he said, ``they usually
have a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, he said, the only way to avoid serious
chimney damage is to identify and repair small problems before they
become big ones. And the first thing a reputable company will do is
to determine whether the chimney itself is appropriate for the
appliances that are being vented through it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, while a 50-year-old chimney with an
8-by-8-inch flue might have been appropriate for a coal furnace, a
smaller flue is likely to be required for a high-efficiency gas
furnace. If that is the case, he said, the size of the flue can be
reduced by inserting a stainless steel liner inside the existing
opening. The cost of relining a chimney in a two-story house, he
said, runs from about $1,200 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   If the existing flue is determined to be the proper size, it
still needs to be inspected. And while it is possible to inspect
the interior of a chimney using high-powered lights and mirrors,
the most accurate chimney inspection is obtained by means of a
video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera gives you the ability to go down inside the flue
and see things you'd never be able to see with lights and
mirrors,'' said Tom Urban, the owner of Estoban Corp., a Fairfield,
Iowa, company that manufactures and markets Chim-Scan, a video
system used by chimney inspection companies across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Chimney inspection companies that use the Chim-Scan system,
Urban said, typically make a videotape of the inspection so that
the homeowner can see the condition of the interior of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a great way for people who are buying a house to
check the condition of the chimney beforehand,'' he said. Urban
said video inspections of chimneys can run from under $100 to
several hundred dollars, depending on the size and location of the
chimney and the number of flues to be inspected.

ITALIAN BOAT SPEEDS AHEAD ON MONEY, LUCK AND TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an old, telling story about Italy's first America's Cup
challenge, in 1983. One could always foresee an Italian tack, it
was said, when the crewmen, in unison, tossed their freshly lighted
smokes over the side.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, observers found the game, but inexperienced, Azzurra
bunch to be a source of great mirth. But no one is laughing at
Italy's latest ensemble. For at the conclusion of the first round
of the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials last Thursday, the
Milan-based Prada Challenge sat firmly atop the standing with a
10-0 record. The second round of trials begins on Saturday, Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the wealthy Bertellis of global fashion renown,
Prada's budget reportedly ranges between $50 million and $70
million. Along with cash, they have talent: Doug Peterson, the
naval architect who helped create the last two cup-winning boats
sailed by Bill Koch's America3 syndicate and Team New Zealand,
commands a design effort that includes German Frers, the legendary
Argentine.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie cup afterguard, led by Francesco de Angelis, the
internationally tested big-boat skipper, and the Brazilian-born
tactician Torben Grael, a three-time Olympic sailing medalist, have
proved that they can compete with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first round-robin, the Italians also enjoyed a
priceless intangible _ sweet, dumb luck. Twice they encountered
critical matches with American challengers also sporting
unblemished records: first against the San Francisco-based America
One crew and, a day later, with the New York Yacht Club's Young
America contingent.
</P>
<P>
   In both races, the U.S. team was winning with the finish line in
sight. Incredibly, in each contest, the American boat came undone
when an identical spinnaker shackle failed, the equivalent of
lightning striking twice. The Italians capitalized on the gaffes to
remain undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   With duplicate 8-2 marks, Young America, skippered by Ed Baird,
and Paul Cayard's America One are tied for second and have joined
Prada in the elite ranks of the 11 challenging syndicates. All
three squads are now heavily favored to advance to the six-team
semifinal challengers round next January. But the remaining three
spots are wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday a much-anticipated race between the two top
American syndicates proved anticlimactic when America One, unable
to hoist its mainsail because of rig damage, retired after two
legs. In 18 to 20 knots of breeze, Young America sailed the course
uncontested to record the victory, worth one point. In the next
round robin, each victory will be worth four points.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter stages of the first round, stiff winds and broken
gear became continual refrains. On one windy, bewildering day that
seemed more like a demolition derby than a regatta, six of eight
scheduled races turned into one-sided fiascos because of a litany
of miscues. Meanwhile, on an adjacent course, the two Team New
Zealand yachts conducted a flawless heavy-air practice session, a
sight the Louis Vuitton spokesman Bruno Trouble called
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The weather, which in the early going brought nearly breathless
conditions before freshening to the more seasonly spring gusts, has
not been the only surprise. Dawn Riley's coed America True
campaign, also based in San Francisco, has showed flashes of
downwind brilliance and is holding fourth place. Japan's Nippon
Challenge, which rallied after a poor start, is fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a half-point penalty imposed by an international jury
for a prestart collision during a race with America One, Dennis
Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes trails the Spanish Challenge, in sixth,
though both teams are deadlocked at 5-5. The incident, which sent
America One into the shed for repairs to its stern, was partly
responsible for several days of postponed racing. In assessing the
penalty, the jury appeared to be sending a hard-line message to the
fleet regarding future contact between competitors.
</P>
<P>
   John Kolius' Honolulu-based Abracadabra, the French yacht Le
Defi Francais, and Young Australia were all off the pace in Round
1. As is the case with Prada, Young America, America One, and the
Nippon Challenge, Kolius has a second new boat at his disposal and
may hold an ace up his sleeve. The others must tinker and try to
eke more speed from their lone entries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the Swiss boat Be Happy, the only challenger
that failed to win a race in the first round. With limited backing,
the Swiss are to be commended for trying something different. But
their radical yacht _ which reportedly employs two keels and
fore-and-aft rudders _ is dreadfully slow and a nightmare to steer.
</P>
<P>
   The British sailing journalist Tim Jeffrey has suggested that
the Swiss add a three-word preface to their boat's name. Already a
handful, No Reason to Be Happy would also be a mouthful.

 &HT;    Papers show military reluctant at Mount Carmel
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Images of the military's involvement at Mount
Carmel still wind through our collective memory six years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Abrams tanks roamed the landscape
outside Waco in 1993 from one edge of the TV screen to the other.
Behind the scenes, there were caches of generators, gas masks and
night vision equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But documents released to Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of
Information Act show the military was for the most part a reluctant
participant. After a bitter internal struggle, it scaled back its
assistance to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as the
agency prepared to raid the Branch Davidian compound and during the
siege refused to sign off on the FBI's tear gas assault.
</P>
<P>
   The military's involvement at Mount Carmel began in December
1992 when the ATF first contacted Operation Alliance, an agency
that coordinates and prioritizes requests from law enforcement for
the military's help in fighting drugs. ATF officials asked the
military to help serve a search warrant to ``a dangerous extremist
organization believed to be producing methamphetamine.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional critics would later charge that the ATF cooked up
the drug allegation simply to get the military's help.
</P>
<P>
   By law, specifically the Posse Comitatus Act, the military is
barred from intervening in police actions except under certain
circumstances. Helping in the war against drugs, however, is one of
the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ATF officials, however, wanted to arrest Koresh for stockpiling
illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 22, 1993, letter to Operation Alliance, ATF officials
requested a training site in Central Texas, training by special
forces troops, instruction in driving Bradley Fighting Vehicles and
the loan of seven Bradleys for two weeks in February.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Alliance forwarded ATF's request on Feb. 2, 1993 --
less than a month before the Feb. 28, 1993, raid on Mount Carmel --
to El Paso's Fort Bliss and the military's headquarters for
domestic anti-drug efforts, known as Joint Task Force-6. Officials
there were told that assistance was ``in direct support of
interdiction activities along the Southwest border.''
</P>
<P>
   ATF's request hit a snag the next day when the commander of the
Army's special forces questioned its legality.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of Rapid Support Unit Commander Maj. Mark Petree at
Fort Bragg, N.C., eventually reached the legal adviser for the
Special Operations Command, Maj. Phillip Lindley, Office of Staff
Judge Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Petree is now deputy director of Special Operations Command in
Panama. An Army spokeswoman said comments regarding Mount Carmel
can only come from the Department of Defense. Lindley is retired,
but declined to comment citing a subpoena he received in connection
with the upcoming civil lawsuit against the federal government by
surviving Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 3, 1993, memo, however, Lindley stated that he
believed the ATF's request would make the military an active
partner in a domestic police action, a violation of the Posse
Comitatus Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this was not an emergency situation, in full control of
the civilian authorities on civilian lands with expert civilian
(drug) laboratory 'takedown' teams available and civilian medical
facilities (available) ... this appeared to go beyond the DOD
guidance for these missions,'' Lindley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley recommended the military scale back its offer of support
to the ATF. That recommendation led to a blistering call from the
legal adviser to Joint Task Force-6, who accused Lindley of being
out to ``undermine'' and ``undercut'' the success of the mission,
according to the memo by Lindley.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same day, Lindley called his superior, Lt. Col.
Douglas Andrews, Deputy Staff Judge Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews disagreed only slightly with Lindley's viewpoint,
according to Andrews' declassified report on his participation in
the matter. He told Lindley that the military could probably
evaluate the ATF's plan of action, but not ``scrub'' it, or rewrite
it for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``... everything else was a legal no-go,'' Andrews wrote. ``I
felt that this was the true outer edge of the envelope and did not
feel all that comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After being told that Joint Task Force-6 was asking the
Department of Defense to approve the ATF's request for help,
Lindley got a phone call at about 7 p.m. from the judge advocate's
office. The proposed medical mission was off and the military's
only involvement with ATF would be to coordinate the agency's use
of an Army range and to comment on its plan to raid Mount Carmel,
Lindley was told, according to his Feb. 3 memo.
</P>
<P>
   Joint Task Force-6 acknowledged the restraints on the military's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``RSU assets will not become directly involved in BATF
operational planning, nor assume responsibility for the BATF
plan,'' a task force memo read. ``Observing and critiquing the
rehearsal of the operational plan is authorized, particularly in
the area of safety. Rehearsal critique comments will be provided as
the opinion of trained military observers, not an official DOD
endorsement of the soundness of the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Hood, on Feb. 24, 1993, ATF leaders met with the special
forces troops assigned to train them.
</P>
<P>
   The military advisers helped construct a mock-up of Mount Carmel
and opened the rifle range for ATF's sharpshooters, who practiced
shooting from a range of 260 meters. The Special Forces troops even
impersonated Davidians to help in the ATF's training. According to
written statements taken from the troops, however, they kept within
the guidelines given them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, command made it very clear that in no way are we
to get involved with the planning of the MSN (mission), make
suggestions about the MSN, or teach tactics in any form or have
anything to do with the MSN,'' wrote Staff Sergeant (SSG) Cordell
Ackley.
</P>
<P>
   The strictures wore on the Special Forces troops, according to
their statements.
</P>
<P>
   SSG. Jay Burkhardt reported that several ATF agents asked if he
could accompany them on the raid as medical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response each time was no, due to restrictions placed upon
us by federal law,'' Burkhardt wrote, adding, ``I felt as if my
hands were tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Petree took steps to ensure the Special Forces troops were
limited in what help they could provide to the ATF -- no matter how
sympathetic they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the mission constraints, I picked the team which
would support BATF based upon the fact that none had attended
Special Operations Training in Close Quarter Battle,'' Petree wrote
in a memo. ``When we got to Fort Hood, this fact was told to the
BATF so that they would not think of the Special Forces element as
experts in SOT/CQB.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1993, the day of the ATF's raid on Mount Carmel, the
military ordered its training force to be on the road headed for
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we may be criticized for being too conservative
and not providing enough support,'' wrote Col. Donald DeCort, Staff
Judge Advocate, in a May 18, 1993, memo. ``We can live with that!''
</P>
<P>
   The death of four ATF agents -- five Branch Davidians died as
well during the raid -- at Mount Carmel led to the FBI getting the
Bradleys and other machinery and equipment denied to the ATF. There
have been accusations that the military's more active role went as
far as members of the Army's Delta Force squad engaging in a
shoot-out with the Branch Davidians on the day of the fire that
killed Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials, however, insist only three Delta Force
members were at Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993, as observers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released to Cox Newspapers show a continuing
reluctance by the military to fully involve itself with the
government's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Delta Force officers met with Attorney General Janet
Reno, an unnamed Delta Force officer reported in a document that
Reno was only offered limited advice -- including the military's
belief that inserting CS gas into the residence might cause mothers
to panic and ``run off and leave infants.'' A disclaimer was added,
however, that the military's rules of engagement were so different
from the FBI's that it made it difficult to offer advice.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Delta Force officers told Reno that if Mount
Carmel were a military operation, the goal of ending the siege
would be done by capturing or killing Koresh, according to the FOI
document.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the military refused to ``grade the FBI
paper,'' its plan to flush the Branch Davidians out of Mount
Carmel, ``as this was not a military mission,'' according to a
military synopsis of the Reno meeting. A May 15, 1993, memo from
the Army's special forces command stated that the Delta Force
officers ``responded only to specific questions and did not
approve, critique or attempt to influence (the) 'tear gas' plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Force member's report makes it clear how out of place
he felt at the Reno meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their approach was substantially different than anything that
I have encountered,'' he wrote. ``They were not assaulting the
compound and they were not there to rescue anyone. This was
surprising to me, but certainly not something of which I am
critical. It is simply a different way of looking at the
situation.''

 &HT;    MORE THAN DOLLARS SEPARATE CLINTON, CONGRESS IN BUDGET END GAME
 &HT;    EDS: Updates after 4th graf with Saturday developments.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of heated rhetoric and partisan
maneuvering, President Clinton and congressional leaders are poised
to wage the final skirmishes this week in their fight over the 2000
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of money, the Democrats and Republicans are not far
apart. They are squabbling over a difference of about $10 billion
in a budget whose tax and spending proposals total $1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides have staked out sharply different positions on
several important issues, including education and foreign policy.
While funding disputes are often settled by splitting the
difference, compromises on policy are harder to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has signaled his willingness to bend on some of these
issues _ ``I never thought I'd get 100 percent of what I wanted,''
he said last week _ but aides insist he will not give them up
completely.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the two sides promised to work together even as
they traded barbs.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter House leaders sent to Clinton _ it was signed
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Majority Leader Dick Armey of
Texas, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, and J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the House Republican Conference chairman _ they
complained their efforts to reach a budget agreement have been
blocked by Democrats out ``to advance their political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta
accused Republicans of pushing proposals that would jeopardize the
financial stability of the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes are making the negotiations difficult. Each
party hopes to make points that will carry them to victory in next
year's presidential and congressional elections. Currently, the GOP
controls both houses of Congress. But the margin in the House is
only 222-211, with one Democrat-leaning Independent and one
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security surplus has emerged as the battleground that
underlies all the combat.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have agreed to depart from 30
years of budget practice and reserve surplus Social Security taxes
_ projected to hit $147 billion next year _ to reduce the $5.7
trillion federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has already accused the other of trying to renege.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from Democrats, the Congressional Budget
Office reported last week that under its own spending assumptions,
the Republican budget would gouge $17 billion out of next year's
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly got the CBO to state that under the more
flexible accounting rules used by GOP appropriators, the surplus
would not be tapped. In contrast, they said, it is Democrats who
want to spend the surplus for unneeded programs.
</P>
<P>
   To make their own budget add up, House Republicans last week
approved a 1 percent across-the-board cut in discretionary
spending, excepting some defense programs. Discretionary spending
is the one-third of the federal budget not mandated as payouts to
veterans, retirees and Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking federal agencies to do is what single moms
and single dads, working moms and dads all over the country do on a
weekly basis,'' House Republican Conference Committee chairman
Watts told PBS on Friday. ``For someone to say that we can't find
one penny, one penny of every dollar that comes into the government
in savings, seems to be a bit of a stretch to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House countered that the plan would cut into the
marrow of needed programs. Discretionary spending, points out White
House spokesman Barry Toiv, has already fallen over the past eight
years from 8.7 percent of the country's total economic output to
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, ``at
which you can die of a thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Clinton is expected to veto the GOP plan for
across-the-board cuts. The plan is likely to be passed by the
Senate early this week and sent to Clinton's desk after he returns
Tuesday night from a trip to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   That trip will spotlight his fight for increased funding of a
host of his foreign affairs priorities. He and his congressional
foes are roughly $3 billion apart on his request for money to help
pay back dues the United States owes to the United Nations, Third
World debt relief and aid Clinton has promised to Palestinians and
Israelis as part of their efforts to secure peace in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who agreed to Republican increases in the $268 billion
defense spending bill, wants his foreign aid requests funded in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that, you know, I've worked with them. I signed that
defense bill ... and I think they ought to work with me so that we
can have a balanced national security policy,'' Clinton said in an
interview. ``I feel very strongly about it, and I'm going to fight
hard for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton has dug in his heels on money to hire new
teachers to reduce the size of elementary school classes. Congress
wants to lump the education money into block grants that states can
spend as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, Clinton on Friday signed a third
temporary spending bill that will government operating without a
formal budget until Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remains optimistic that he and his Republican foes
can wrap up this contentious season of budget wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, as much as I fight with these Republicans, it's
amazing, if we just sit down and talk and spend a few hours
together, normally we can work it out,'' Clinton said in an Oval
Office interview Wednesday. ``You actually have to work hard not to
make an agreement with me _ if we can do it in good faith.''

FRANCIS WHITAKER, 92, PRESERVER OF BLACKSMITH'S ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif., N.C., N.M., Mass., Texas, Minn., Ind.)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis Whitaker, a blacksmith who never shod a horse but who
helped preserve the 3,000-year-old craft of molding iron and
elevated it to the level of an art, died Oct. 23 at a hospital in
Glenwood Springs, Colo. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Before his own proficiency and that of the hundreds he would
teach brought him fame, he studied as an apprentice with the great
smiths of Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Over his long career, he hammered thousands upon thousands of
iron bars into artistic shapes to adorn buildings throughout the
United States. And in his 70s, when the craft appeared to be dying,
he began a mission to pass his Old World techniques and aesthetics
to young smiths lured by the magical malleability of the metal.
Just a month ago, he helped his son Stephen fashion andirons for a
house he was building in California.
</P>
<P>
   At his explicit request, he grasped a hammer at the moment of
his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iron has a strength no other material has,'' Whitaker once
said, ``and yet it has a capacity for being light, graceful and
beautiful. It has this capacity _ but no desire. It will do nothing
by itself except resist you.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the desire, and all the knowledge of how to impart this
desire to the iron, must come from the smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Whitaker's thousands of delicate, oddly fluid creations
can be seen at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Liberty
Street in Manhattan, as well as at the former Central Savings Bank
building at Broadway and 73rd Street in New York; on the intricate
gates of the Spanish Revival homes of Carmel, Calif., and on a
balcony in Aspen, Colo., that is so sensitively made that it
appears almost feathery.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, a big, robust man with appropriately bulging biceps,
was named a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for
the Arts in 1997, but his proudest achievement was working with the
hundreds of young artisans eager to follow in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   He and the handful of other surviving blacksmiths had feared
that the acetylene torch and the arc welder, tools developed during
World War II, would make working iron as simple as cutting wood or
putting a jigsaw puzzle together. Efficiency threatened art.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1976, increasing numbers of young blacksmiths were
banding together to preserve ornamental blacksmithing, an
architectural tradition with roots going back to 14th-century
Europe. At a conference of the new Artist-Blacksmith Association of
North America, Whitaker had a sort of epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the conference,'' he said, ``I knew I had a
mission. I had never seen so many people hungry for knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He established the Francis Whitaker Blacksmith Schools, one at
the Rocky Mountain School in Carbondale, Colo., where he lived, and
one at the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, N.C. He
taught at more than 150 blacksmith workshops and wrote many
articles and a book, ``The Blacksmith's Cookbook: Recipes in
Iron.'' He corresponded extensively with many aspiring blacksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Frank, nobody would be doing this as a
profession or even as a token craft,'' said Dorothy Stiegler, a
blacksmith who lives in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered him telling her how a great blacksmith must look
at a hunk of iron and perceive a candlestick or an animal head
hidden in the middle. She also recalled him as an exacting
taskmaster. ``Now make 100 of these and you'll probably have it,''
he would say after a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was to help rescue a dying profession. ``It really
was on the wane,'' said Tom Joyce, a 43-year-old blacksmith in
Santa Fe, N.M., who was heartily encouraged by Whitaker. ``There
weren't many blacksmiths of his generation who were willing to
share information like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker was born in Woburn, Mass. His father was an
architecture critic who became the first editor of the Journal of
the American Institute of Architects. His mother, a suffragist who
was once beaten in a demonstration, demanded that her four children
know the value of hard work and taught them to cook, wash dishes
and darn socks.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his junior year at an Alabama boarding school,
Whitaker had had enough of formal education. Through his father's
connections, he was accepted as an apprentice by Samuel Yellin in
Philadelphia, perhaps the United States' most famous architectural
blacksmith at the time. He brought few preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew about blacksmiths at that time was that they were
usually brawny men who sweated a lot and they put shoes on
horses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was dissatisfied with being part of a 200-person shop with
large commissions from the federal government, because he had no
opportunity to take a project through to completion. So after
completing that apprenticeship, he went to Berlin as an apprentice
to Julius Schramm, also a master blacksmith. In addition to
sharpening his skills, he became interested in designing artistic
ironwork.
</P>
<P>
   He then found his way to Carmel, where enthusiasm for Spanish
Revival architecture was strong in the 1920s and '30s and where he
found a ready market for his ironwork.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Whitaker taught welding in shipyards. He
became friends with John Steinbeck, with whom he played cards on
the beach. He inspired the pivotal character in Steinbeck's story
``The Chrysanthemums,'' and was also the model for the heroic
Connor Larkin in the Leon Uris novel ``Trinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a strong environmentalist, he was on the City Council in
Carmel, as he was in Aspen, where he moved in 1963, when he began
to feel that Carmel was losing its small-town charm. After he
questioned the commercialism of Aspen, he moved to Carbondale in
1988.

IRVINE HOPES EXPERIENCE IN JAPAN IS AN ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Japan's motor racing culture has helped to create several
Formula One world champions, the favor has not yet been returned.
</P>
<P>
   But at the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka on
Sunday, Eddie Irvine, current points leader, is counting on his
experience of racing in Japan to give him an edge over the
defending series champion, Mika Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine raced in the local Formula 3000 series in Japan from 1991
to 1993, and he started his Formula One career at the Japanese
Grand Prix at Suzuka in 1993 driving a Jordan to a sensational
sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to win the championship and I could choose where to
win it, this is the place I would want to do it,'' Irvine said in
Suzuka on Thursday. ``I came out of amateur racing in Europe into
what was a very professional series at the time, here in Japan, and
this is the country where I became a proper racing driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not a bad place for Hakkinen either, however, as it was
where last year he won both the race and his first drivers' title.
He has always been popular with the Japanese fans and has usually
done well on the track, finishing third in 1993 and 1996 and second
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not have as much experience in Japan as Irvine and
several other drivers in Formula One. With its large automobile
industry, Japan has one of the world's strongest racing cultures,
and in recent years it has become a training ground for European
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a bit of a parking place if a driver's career has
stalled out in Europe,'' said Harvey Postlethwaite shortly before
his death this year while setting up a now-aborted Formula One team
for Honda. ``Japanese Formula 3000 is in some ways even closer to
Formula One than European Formula 3000 because you've got more
freedom, more tire work and whatnot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen went to Japan
before entering Formula One to try to revive careers that had
sagged in Europe. Johnny Herbert, who won the European Grand Prix
at the Nurburgring in Germany, raced in Japanese Formula 3000 in
1991 after a false start in Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   Ralf Schumacher went to Japan in 1996 and won the All Nippon
Formula 3000 series, after finishing second and third in Formula 3
championships in Europe. He then graduated straight to Formula One
with the Jordan team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Frentzen raced in a Japanese prototype series in 1992 and in
Formula 3000 in 1992 and 1993 before entering Formula One in 1994.
Both Frentzen and Villeneuve this week said their two favorite
circuits were Spa, in Belgium, and Suzuka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't decide which I really prefer,'' Frentzen said.
``Suzuka is a very interesting and very rich circuit where you can
find almost all level of driving difficulties: quick curves,
combinations of turns and straights or long straight lines. For me
it is exactly what you feel like being on when you are getting
toward the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Villeneuve raced in the Japanese Formula 3 series in 1992,
winning three races and finishing second over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult and risky place,'' he said of the Suzuka
track. ``The circuit adopts the shape of the landscape and its
high-speed corners are very spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Japan has contributed to the creation of European
stars _ Honda powered Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to multiple
world titles, the Mugen-Honda engine powers Frentzen's Jordan, and
Bridgestone equips cars with tires _ there is only one Japanese
driver in Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   Toranosuke Takagi was raised in the Japanese series from
childhood. While he has frequently out-qualified Pedro de la Rosa,
his Spanish teammate at Arrows, he has yet to make a mark. De la
Rosa, by the way, also raced in Japan, in Formula 3, Formula 3000
and the GT championship, in 1995, 1996 and 1997.

SUIT BY MAN ACCUSED OF AIRLINE ATTACK IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People are always filing lawsuits seeking to
vindicate their constitutional rights, but a judge says a Manhattan
lawyer went too far in a suit having to do with air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no constitutional right to separate the shoulder of a
flight attendant on a delayed flight,'' U.S. District Judge John S.
Martin Jr. wrote in an opinion released Friday that dismissed the
case. He said he was considering sanctions against the lawyer,
Howard Gotbetter, for filing a frivolous suit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Gotbetter and a woman he was traveling with
became angry that their plane was in a holding pattern before a
landing.
</P>
<P>
   While Gotbetter's companion _ ``a woman with an apparently
limited vocabulary,'' as the judge put it _ screamed ``gutter
epithets'' at a flight attendant, Gotbetter grabbed the crew member
by the shoulder and shook her so violently that she suffered a
partially separated left shoulder and an injury to her rotator
cuff. She was out of work for six months, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not surprisingly,'' Martin continued, Gotbetter and his friend
were later removed from the plane ``to the apparent delight of
several of the other passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the government later opened administrative
proceedings against Gotbetter under a Federal Aviation
Administration rule that says ``no person may assault, threaten,
intimidate or interfere'' with a plane's crew. The lawyer was
trying to block those proceedings with his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Saturday by phone, Gotbetter said, ``Judge Martin's
opinion is totally contrary to fact.'' He denied assaulting the
attendant on the American Airlines flight from San Francisco to New
York in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbetter said an administrative judge with the FAA found
earlier that he had touched the flight attendant for 14 seconds,
which had constituted assault. He contended that she had backed
into a ski magazine he was holding. He also said the FAA judge
found that he had not threatened, intimidated, or interfered with
the attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbetter argued in his lawsuit that the regulation was
``unconstitutionally vague'' because it ``does not give a person of
ordinary intelligence a reasonable basis to know what is
prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin said even someone of ``limited intelligence'' would
grasp the idea. ``One does not have a right to take out one's
frustration over the vagaries of air travel by assaulting the crew
of an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the regulation protected crew members from ``unwarranted
assaults by antisocial airline passengers whose egos are so large
that they have no concern for the rights of others.''

EDITORIAL: SENSELESS CONGRESSIONAL CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board federal spending cut approved by the House
last week must have seemed to Republican leaders like a good way to
send a message of frugality. Perhaps it was viewed that way by the
35 percent of Americans who, according to polls, think the GOP
congressional leaders are doing a good job. But it makes no
economic or budgetary sense to apply the budget knife to every
program on the federal books just because Republicans want to score
some political points. President Clinton is right to threaten a
veto if the cuts get to his desk.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about the budget-cutting frenzy that both
leading Republican presidential candidates have distanced
themselves from Congress' reckless handiwork. An earlier attempt to
rescind part of a tax break for the working poor drew criticism
from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Last week Sen. John McCain
mocked Congress for cutting meals-on-wheels while allowing a
congressional pay raise to go through. The pay raise was trimmed
slightly, for appearances, but the point is still valid. McCain
also questions why regular military expenditures are getting cut
while Congress is financing planes and ships that the armed forces
say they do not need. The reasons are the influence of campaign
donors and jobs in the districts of powerful lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of these budget cuts is to force Clinton and the
Democrats to demand that they be restored with funds generated by
Social Security payroll taxes. The Republicans then plan to run
even more television commercials accusing the Democrats of
``raiding'' Social Security. But the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office has determined that even the House Republican budget
plan taps the very Social Security revenues the Republicans claim
are sacrosanct. After the budget-cut scheme passed, Speaker Dennis
Hastert declared, ``They said it couldn't be done.'' He was right.
It wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties have a challenge to meet here. The
Republicans need to eschew mindless across-the-board cuts designed
to embarrass the president and start serious negotiations on which
programs deserve increases and which deserve cuts. The White House,
for its part, must make clear how it would find the money to avoid
spending cuts and also increase spending on teachers, police and
the like. Clinton still maintains that revenues can be raised from
a modest tobacco tax and other revenue steps, as well as some
unspecified cost re-estimates. But the tax and revenue measures
advocated by the White House have little support in Congress. They
are the administration's refuge right now from the need to be more
clear on how to solve the budget disagreements with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With members of Congress looking to get out of town and go home,
there is little time to wrap up the budget negotiations. Rep. C.W.
Bill Young of Florida says the Republican and Democratic budget
demands ``are not that far apart'' even though ``we are far apart
on the political rhetoric.'' The two sides need to go from the
latter to the former before they can pass a budget. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has flopped into bed exhausted, knowing his sleep
would last three hours. Thank God, Luis Castillo has said to
himself before drifting off, and he has thought about what he
would've missed if he hadn't written that letter to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He would've never seen Paul O'Neill catch the last out of David
Wells' perfect game last year, from 25 feet away. He would've never
come to know Derek Jeter's singing voice or been given a nickname
by the shortstop, or warmed up David Cone on the day he pitched his
perfect game. He wouldn't have been able to stand next to home
plate and listen to Roger Clemens' fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But Castillo did write the letter, and over the last two
seasons, he witnessed the creation of baseball history and came to
regard his hero _ Cone _ as a friend, and the Yankees as family.
When Chad Curtis caught the final out of the World Series sweep at
Yankee Stadium Wednesday, Castillo stood in the Yankees' dugout and
sobbed, for Castillo, a batboy, knew the anguish that the players
felt.
</P>
<P>
   His mother speaks often of what a unique and incredible
experience her son has had. ``I consider myself very lucky,'' said
Castillo, 17, a senior at Wings Academy who lives in the Bronx, his
home a 10-minute walk or a short late-night cab ride from Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo had always been a Yankees fan, often begging his mother
for $6 to buy space in the bleachers at Yankee Stadium. He
succeeded one day in the spring of 1997, took a seat and
immediately found himself the target of angry screaming, from Tina
Lewis, a member of the Bleacher Creatures. Castillo had unknowingly
occupied a place that once belonged to a revered and now deceased
member of the Creatures, and was ordered out of the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo returned the next day and apologized to Lewis, who
responded in kind and adopted Castillo into the band. Later that
summer, Lewis suggested that Castillo apply to be a batboy, and she
helped him prepare a letter to Sonny Hight, the vice president of
administration to the Yankees. Hight wrote back and outlined the
criteria for the job: Castillo had to get good grades and be a
model citizen in his school.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo improved his marks and was hired three months later,
after his parents signed off on the unusual work schedule. Like the
team's other three batboys, Castillo works every day when the
Yankees are at home, earning the minimum wage, plus a tip at the
end of the season. After school, Castillo would take a train to
Yankee Stadium, arriving by 4 p.m., often finishing his homework
while the players took batting practice. He worked during the games
either in the dugout or retrieving balls along the foul lines,
helped with the postgame laundering process, and then returned home
at 2:30 or 3 a.m., before rising for school at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But Castillo found his weariness was overcome by the depth of
his experience. The players, coaches and manager Joe Torre treated
the batboys respectfully and graciously. Castillo goes by the name
Luigi and it wasn't long before Jeter _ who nicknamed Chuck
Knoblauch, Hideki Irabu and other teammates _ amended that to
Squeegee.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry would stroll over and extend a hand, look him
in the eye and ask how he was doing. Bernie Williams would be
consumed by his guitar before games, and when Williams erred while
turning off his bass, filling the air with piercing feedback he
would turn to the batboys sitting nearby and apologize in his quiet
way. Knoblauch would stay late after games, laugh with the batboys
and tease them about their laundry duties. ``It's like he's one of
us,'' said Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter likes to mimic songs on the radio and sing aloud. Castillo
would call the bench coach, Don Zimmer, ``Chief,'' and Zimmer would
laugh. Chili Davis, who has roots in Jamaica, surprised Castillo by
calling him ``Primo'' _ Spanish for ``cousin'' _ and then chatting
with him in that language.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo plays baseball in high school _ he hopes to continue
doing so next year in college _ and he had always followed Cone's
career closely. He was stunned when the pitcher offered to help
him. During batting practice, Cone would bend at the knees in the
outfield and set a target, like a catcher. Castillo showed Cone his
curveball; Cone was impressed. Cone demonstrated how to throw a cut
fastball, how to put pressure on the index finger. They worked
together so often that one day, while Cone and Castillo played
catch, relievers Mike Stanton and Tony Fossas began chanting,
``Little Coney.''
</P>
<P>
   He was often given the duty of patrolling the foul lines, and
the Bleacher Creatures included Castillo in their roll call, right
after third baseman Scott Brosius. Castillo came to love working
along the right field foul line, because it was his responsibility
to warm up O'Neill between innings _ ``playing catch, with a major
leaguer, everybody watching.'' When O'Neill is in a particularly
good mood while playing catch, Castillo said, he will raise his
right leg high, step and unleash hard-breaking curveballs. Shane
Spencer is tougher to warm up, because he throws hard and his
throws will often knuckle, moving erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was on the foul line on May 17, 1998, when O'Neill
drifted close by to catch a high fly, the 27th and final out of
Wells' perfect game. Castillo's instinct was to run onto the field,
but he forced himself to the dugout and watched as the players
carried Wells off the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 months later, on another Sunday afternoon at Yankee
Stadium, a third-inning rain delay was about to end, and as
Castillo hustled to the clubhouse to retrieve more baseballs for
the umpires, Cone _ who was pitching against the Montreal Expos
that day _ stopped him in the runway and asked Castillo to grab a
glove and warm him up. They played catch there, underneath the
stands, and when they finished Castillo stuffed the ball in his
pocket. Two hours later, Cone was carried off the field, after
pitching a perfect game, and he signed the ball that he had tossed
with Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched against the Mets this year at Yankee Stadium,
and as he warmed up for the second inning, Castillo brought a towel
and water to the umpire; while waiting, Castillo stood just outside
the batter's box and turned slightly while watching Clemens warm
up, and it was apparent that he was simulating the experience of
batting against the future Hall of Famer. ``Amazing,'' he said
afterward, recalling the hiss of the baseball. ``That's why he's
the Rocket Man.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox in the American
League Championship Series earlier this month, Castillo was told to
join the team on the road. He hadn't traveled extensively _ he went
to Puerto Rico once, to Brooklyn, to Connecticut, but can't
remember going to New Jersey. He bought a pair of slacks and a tie,
borrowed a jacket from his father, Luis, and fretted that he would
be so overwhelmed that he might forget to retrieve a bat. The first
game he ever saw in Fenway Park was the match-up between Pedro
Martinez and Clemens; his father, who is Dominican, rooted for
Martinez, but the son rooted desperately for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was in Fenway Park when fans threw bottles on the field
and the game had to be stopped. He was in Atlanta when the Yankees
won the first two games of the World Series. He had seen how the
death of their fathers had effected Scott Brosius, Luis Sojo and
Paul O'Neill. He was in Yankee Stadium Wednesday night, when Curtis
caught the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo and the other batboys had been told they could run onto
the field and celebrate. But Castillo found himself frozen in the
mouth of the dugout, crying, sad for his teammates, stunned by
their achievement. He composed himself, returned to the clubhouse,
hugged Cone and sprayed his friend with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo lies in bed at night, wondering how different his life
would be if he hadn't written that letter. Thank God, he thinks.

EDITORIAL: AN ISLAND BOMBING RANGE  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   A presidential panel created by Defense Secretary William Cohen
recommended earlier this month that the Navy cease all training
activities on the island of Vieques near Puerto Rico in five years.
In the interim, the Navy would be allowed to use the island for
live bombing exercises. That phase-out plan is not fast enough. The
Navy should discontinue the shelling right now and promptly return
the land to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,300 people live on Vieques, a small island six miles off
the coast of Puerto Rico. The Navy controls two-thirds of its
33,000 acres. Aerial bombing and naval gunfire over the past two
decades have degraded the environment and stymied efforts to
increase tourism and maritime jobs. Angry protests from local
residents, who are U.S. citizens, and the Puerto Rican government
erupted in April when a civilian guard was killed at the Naval
range in a bombing accident. Live fire exercises have been
suspended pending a final decision by President Clinton. Meanwhile,
Sens. Charles Schumer and Frank Murkowski have introduced a bill
calling for the immediate removal of the Navy from the island.
</P>
<P>
   This controversy goes back to the 1970s, when the Navy ceased
using the neighboring island of Culebra for weapons training after
mortar fire landed on a beach where children were playing. Training
exercises were transferred from Culebra to Vieques, despite intense
opposition from the governor of Puerto Rico and the island
community. In 1983, the governor and the Navy secretary signed an
agreement in which the Navy promised to help with economic
development, address safety and environmental hazards caused by the
shelling, and keep the use of live fire to an absolute minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential panel found that the Navy has not lived up to
those commitments. The percentage of live fire used in relation to
inert ammunition actually doubled from the late 1970s to the 1990s.
No real effort has been made to deal with noise and health
concerns, and relations with the community have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says it cannot perform combined combat exercises
anywhere on the East Coast. But separate components of the
exercises, such as aerial bombing, artillery training and ship
gunfire training, can be conducted at ranges elsewhere. The panel
noted that the availability and convenience of Vieques may have
influenced the assessment of other sites. The panel's
recommendation that an alternative be found in five years suggests
that military readiness need not be compromised by using other
venues and other training methods. The people of Vieques should not
have to wait that long before the Navy clears out.

EDITORIAL: ISOLATIONISM'S RETURN  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Isolationism _ the notion that U.S. interests are best served by
minimal involvement in foreign affairs and alliances _ has been a
recurrent issue in U.S. political debate. The issue has now
resurfaced with surprising passion, with President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore and their senior advisers joining in an attack on
those they call the ``new isolationists.'' Their main targets are
the senators who voted to kill the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
but lately their ire has expanded to include almost anyone who has
opposed military intervention in Kosovo, full financing of foreign
aid and the repayment of America's $1 billion debt to the United
Nations. For their part, Republicans have accused the White House
of caricaturing honest differences of opinion on complicated
issues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of exchange that can either degenerate into
partisan name-calling or add something useful to what could be a
healthy debate over America's role in the world as it approaches a
new administration, not to mention a new millennium. The early
signs are not reassuring. The White House argument _ that the
test-ban vote proves that the GOP has been hijacked by America
Firsters _ ignores the fact that those voting no included such
principled Republican internationalists as Sens. Richard Lugar of
Indiana and Olympia Snowe of Maine. The argument from some
Republicans _ that the White House's squishy internationalism would
make America hostage to utopian and unenforceable treaties _ is
similarly overdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, isolationism has taken different forms. But only
once _ the years following the post-World War I decision not to
join the League of Nations _ has it taken root for any length of
time. Since then, isolationism has been regularly trumped by the
pressure of world events. Pearl Harbor undercut the most virulent
America Firsters, while the need for postwar reconstruction and the
onset of the Cold War trumped the opposition of Sen. Robert Taft
and other isolationist Republicans to multilateral institutions
like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union, however, has created
uncertainties about America's global role and given life to two
quite different forms of isolationism. One is Patrick Buchanan's, a
blend of nativism and protectionism that rests partly on a fearful
assessment of America's ability to compete in a global economy. The
other derives not from the insecurities that afflict Buchanan but,
conversely, from a supreme self-confidence that America can go it
alone, that its wealth and military power make international
treaties unnecessary. This is the smug and shortsighted
isolationism of the Republican congressional leadership, people
like Trent Lott and Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   This Republican insularity on Capitol Hill is all the more
striking given that the leading Republican presidential candidates,
George W. Bush and John McCain, are both internationalists, as are
Bill Bradley and Gore on the Democratic side. With the
congressional leadership frozen in place, the presidential campaign
becomes an important arena for defining what sort of
internationalism the United States should embrace, and where and
when it should exercise its moral influence, its military power and
its economic clout. These are fundamental questions. Today's furor
over neo-isolationism will have served a purpose if it forces the
leading candidates in both parties to engage them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a number of analysts have noted, the real threat to
America's tradition of global engagement may not be political but
generational. An entire generation, the one just below George W.
Bush's, is growing up with no connection to World War II and only
the dimmest memories of the Cold War. This generation is clearly
comfortable with economic engagement abroad. The task for
internationalists in both parties will be to make the case for an
expansive world view that defines broader diplomatic engagement and
leadership by the United States as necessary components of national
security and global stability.

SPURS PRESSING TO GET OUT VOTE IN SAN ANTONIO 
GIVING VANCOUVER A CHANCE 
HORNETS HAVING THEIR PROBLEMS 
THE LAKERS' MISSING PIECE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Duncan has threatened to leave, via free agency. The owner,
Peter Holt, is implying that he may move the team. Even the
gracious David Robinson has joined the gallant fight to make the
people of San Antonio pay for a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Warning the citizenry of the great catastrophe at hand if they
fail to vote for a referendum on Tuesday, Robinson said: ``If they
don't want the team there, that's fine. But they have to realize
what comes with that or what goes with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA champions have suddenly become politicians as they open
defense of their title. At issue is a proposed hotel and car rental
tax that would raise a projected 84 percent of the money needed for
a new $175 million arena to replace the cavernous and outdated
Alamodome. Residents of Bexar County, Texas, will vote on the
controversial referendum on the same day the Spurs will open the
season and raise their championship banner.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new arena _ and the extra revenue that comes with
luxury boxes, food courts and other amenities _ the Spurs have
intimated that they won't be able to sign Duncan, the game's most
accomplished player who can become a free agent at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arena is a big part of it,'' Duncan told The Chicago
Tribune earlier this month. ``If there is a possibility they're
going to move, I don't want to be stuck in a city I don't want to
be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt also has hinted at the possibility of moving the franchise
should the referendum be rejected. Despite winning the
championship, the Spurs claim they lost $12 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The current deal has Holt only putting up $28.5 million of the
expected $175 million price tag for the new arena. In late
September, Citizens for Responsible Spending conducted a survey of
500 likely San Antonio voters from the hospitality industry.
According to the data gathered, 48 percent opposed the plan, 41
percent approved and 11 percent were undecided. Hence, the campaign
trail blazed by Robinson, Duncan and even Sean Elliott, who
underwent a kidney transplant in August.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, Michael Jordan baited Washington Wizards
owner Abe Pollin into a verbal sparring session by suggesting that
Pollin should sell his team if he could not make a profit on it.
Pollin, the league's senior owner, had a right to be angry. He had
spent $200 million for a downtown arena and paid Juwan Howard $105
million the past four years. He did not ask the District of
Columbia for financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Spurs try to gouge their city for a new arena
reminds us that for all the feel-good emotion a championship team
can bring, what it really wants back is not your applause or
worship. It's your dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Vancouver a Chance
</P>
<P>
   After St. Louis billionaire Bill Laurie and his wife, Wal-Mart
heiress Nancy Laurie, purchased the Vancouver Grizzlies last month
from John McCaw, the franchise was all but headed to the Midwest.
The Lauries own the St. Louis Blues and the Kiel Center in which
the Blues play, so the idea of the Grizzlies moving by the
2001-2002 season did not seem farfetched, despite David Stern's
bluster over the league's owners wanting to give Vancouver a better
chance as an NBA city.
</P>
<P>
   But at a board of governors meeting in New York on Friday, the
league's financial advisory committee considered the proposed
transfer of ownership and decided it was not prepared to recommend
approval of the deal as it is currently structured.
</P>
<P>
   The committee expressed concern that the two years remaining
under the expansion agreement might not provide a sufficient
opportunity for Vancouver to demonstrate that it can support an NBA
team.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the committee, the Suns' owner, Jerry Colangelo,
had much to do with the decision. Under the expansion agreement
under which the Grizzlies entered the league in 1995, the team
cannot be moved until the 2001-2002 season _ at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in Vancouver as an NBA marketplace then and I still
do,'' Colangelo said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie needs a two-thirds majority of the board of governors to
approve his purchase. Both parties will resubmit their request
after further discussion, but it appears the league's owners are
not going to sign off on a franchise move in the next three years.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hornets Having Their Problems
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silas knows he has enough talent in Charlotte to contend
for the Eastern Conference championship. He also found out last
week that he has enough potential turmoil to wind up in the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Derrick Coleman was charged with driving while
intoxicated after an accident. Guard Eldridge Recasner, a passenger
in Coleman's vehicle, will miss at least six weeks of the season
because of a broken shoulder and collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who suffered only minor bruises, was charged after he
apparently tried to make a left turn in front of an oncoming
grocery delivery truck. He refused a Breathalyzer test after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Silas has seen much of Coleman's self-destructive behavior _
from his eating binges in Charlotte and Philadelphia to his
nonchalant work ethic with the Nets, where Silas was an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he's going to have to think hard about and deal
with,'' Silas said. ``If you have a problem _ I'm not necessarily
saying he does have one _ you've got to admit it and deal with it.
There's only so much we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Missing Piece
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson may have inherited a talented team, but he is
already campaigning for the acquisition of the Lakers' missing
piece: a bona fide power forward to take some of the pressure off
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry has been hurt and looks lost in the triangle
offense, A.C. Green is nearing 37 years old and Travis Knight
leaves much to be desired as a stopper. Among the possible
solutions: Bison Dele (the former Brian Williams), who played for
Jackson's 1997 champion Bulls team but shocked the Pistons by
retiring recently, and Dennis Rodman, who starred for Jackson's
Bulls but has not played since being waived by the Lakers last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a special relationship with Brian Williams,'' Jackson
said. ``I don't know Bison Dele. I've never met him. If Brian
Williams tells me he wants to talk to me about playing basketball,
and he comes and tells me he's Bison Dele, yes, we'll have a
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with the news media last Monday,
Jackson also mentioned Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we haven't addressed that Dennis question,''
Jackson said, ``but it's there and it ultimately has to be
addressed at some level. But we hope that it's not something that
we'll jump into as a sign of desperation for a while.''

KENNETH MacKENZIE, 79, DANCER OF LEAD ROLES AT BALLETS RUSSES 
 (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth MacKenzie, an American dancer with Col. W. de Basil's
Ballets Russes in the 1940s and a star of one of that troupe's most
controversial productions, died on Sept. 23 at his home in New
Hope, Pa. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his son, Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago, where he received his early training,
MacKenzie was a member of the Ballets Russes from 1940 to 1947. An
attractive and muscular dancer, he created a sensation in 1946 as
Cain in David Lichine's ``Cain and Abel,'' with Oleg Tupine as
Abel.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet raised eyebrows because the choreography required the
men to wrestle in skimpy trunks and to dance erotically with
flimsily clad women symbolizing Good and Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual role MacKenzie danced with the Ballets Russes in
1946 was the Sun God in Vania Psota's ``Yara,'' a retelling of
Brazilian folklore with Surrealist scenery by painter Candido
Portinari.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ballets Russes, MacKenzie appeared in summer theaters
and in a City Center revival of ``Carousel'' in 1949. Then, having
injured his Achilles' tendon, he worked on a pipeline and in a
General Motors factory in Ewing, N.J. He bought property in New
Hope during the '50s and opened a coffeehouse there.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his wife, Mildred Ferguson, a former Ballet
Theater dancer, died in 1981, he was reintroduced to Nina
Stroganova, a Danish-born ballerina he had known from the Ballets
Russes. They remained companions until her death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, of New Hope, he is survived by a
daughter, Holly Hrynczyszyn of Buckingham, Pa.

RESIDENTIAL LIFE IS RETURNING TO ATLANTA'S DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Gould said he felt like an urban pioneer when he
stepped through a kudzu-shrouded doorway nine years ago into his
new home.
</P>
<P>
   The 25,000-square-foot brick building dated to the 1880s when
Standard Oil of Kentucky built it for a barrel-making operation;
more recently it had been an automobile-parts supply house and a
junk dealer's warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the back yard lay a railroad yard, while next door
were other industrial buildings, also empty, also hidden by kudzu
vines. And yet this industrial no man's land stood at the edge of a
growing downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, a photographer, envisioned loft apartments, spaces for
artists like himself to live and work in at a reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
   Now 39, Gould is a pioneer no more.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of residential units, in new high rises and conversions
of industrial buildings, have been built in the last few years as
developers have discovered a heady market for living in downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The two-square-mile downtown had long been overlooked in favor
of fancier midtown addresses or the even-more elegant Buckhead
area, both to the north. Families tended to trek farther out to
suburban enclaves in neighboring counties, subdivisions that sprawl
for miles across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary out here,'' said Gould, whose Allied Factory
Warehouse now includes eight apartments and work space for more
than a dozen artists. ``The area had almost returned to
wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   He was attracted to the site first by a love of industrial
buildings and then by a cobblestone street at the rear, a rarity
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about Atlanta that doesn't appeal to me is
everything is new,'' he said. ``We've been tearing down buildings
since the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Atlanta is a place where new is revered. High rises
were built only after smaller, older buildings were demolished in a
steady progression beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the
early 1990s. One of Atlanta's best-known companies, Coca-Cola Co.,
left downtown in 1919 _ the year that Ernest Woodruff bought it for
$25 million _ for a campuslike setting in midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1976, Cable News Network opted to buy a
1.5-million-square-foot building at the edge of downtown for its
headquarters. The building is now nestled between two new
civic-related developments, Centennial Olympic Park, built for the
Olympics, and Phillips Arena, home to Atlanta's Thrashers hockey
team and its Hawks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The arena was built by Ted Turner, founder of CNN; Philips
Electronics North America paid for the right to have it named for
the company and to have its huge sign on the building.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, $1 billion has been invested in downtown Atlanta.
Much of the money was spent on Olympics-related construction, such
as the park and Turner Field, used for the Olympics and now home to
the Atlanta Braves, and landscaping along downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, 2,690 housing units were built downtown,
according to a report for the Centennial Olympic Park Area, a
private, nonprofit organization founded to guide development around
the 21-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agency's first projects is a three-acre site at the
northeast corner of the park that is to include about 100
condominium units, 200 rentals, retail spaces and, possibly, a
children's museum. The agency paid $6.5 million for property, which
is to be developed by a private developer sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the park, Legacy Property Group expects to
break ground next month on a 10-story residential condominium at
the rear of the Embassy Suites Hotel. Called Centennial Park West,
the units will range in price from $200,000 for 1,000 square feet
of space with one bedroom to $1 million for 4,000 square feet and
four bedrooms, according to John Pauli, an architect whose firm,
Stang &AMP; Newdow, is designing the interior. The firm of May &AMP; Pinska
of New York City designed the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Most developers here credit the Olympics with not only making
the city more attractive but also with spurring the first projects
that brought people back to the city. Some of the games' sponsors
subsidized projects to convert three downtown office buildings into
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   One, the 89-unit Metropolitan, once the home of the First
National Bank, is now being sold as condominiums, ranging in price
from $50,000 to $120,000. The other two _ the 65-unit Muses and
114-unit William-Oliver _ are still rental apartments, according to
a report by Dale Henson Associates, a real estate consulting firm
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mild to severe case of condo-mania,'' said Dale
Henson, a real estate consultant here. ``There is a frantic effort
to get into the market before it gets too filled out or we have an
economic setback.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the office-building conversions, several
industrial buildings close to Gould's property in the Marietta
Street area have been converted into lofts and many of them have
been sold as condominiums. The site of a former gasket manufacturer
was turned into 30 units that sold for $145,000 to $337,000, while
a seed company's building was transformed into 18 condominium units
ranging in price from $137,000 to $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he had decided to rent out space because his
development proceeded one unit at a time, without bank financing.
Now that the renovation is nearly complete, he is considering
selling the units as condominiums.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another area seeing a surge in residential development is the
Fairlie-Poplar neighborhood, once a high-crime area of bars and
rundown hotels. Several buildings have been converted to loft
condominiums, while the first new residential construction downtown
in many years is taking place at what will be 123 Luckie St., now
the site of a parking lot. Prices for the 49-unit condominium will
range from $190,000 for a one-bedroom to $550,000 for four
bedrooms, said Pauli, the project's architect.
</P>
<P>
   Henson noted, however, that while the market looked vibrant the
actual number of units recently completed or under way is less than
a thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many does it take to create a community?'' he asked.
``There's not enough to create an environment that will make a
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a downtown like Atlanta's certainly poses challenges,
Gould said. The area could be considered in its infancy for
residents, meaning few restaurants open at night and only one
grocery _ a Kroger Supermarket across the street from the State
Capitol _ anywhere close.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a perception that crime is worse here than in
the outlying areas. But Gould, as well as city leaders, say that is
perception, not reality. Reported crime has decreased since the
police increased street patrols and put neighborhood precincts in
storefronts across the city.
</P>
<P>
   The city has made attracting downtown residents a priority as
well. The need for a vibrant middle class was highlighted in a 1998
report issued by the Atlanta Renaissance Program, which called its
absence ``missing rungs in the ladder to progress.'' The report
showed that the city had become home to the poor and the wealthy
and set goals such as improving education and transforming
deteriorated areas to attract more middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Williams, chairman of Post Properties and president of
the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, said the city was working hard to
solve those problems so that it could be home to others besides
empty-nesters, young marrieds and singles.
</P>
<P>
   One element that city leaders see as crucial to this end is
keeping Macy's open on Peachtree Street in the heart of the city.
Williams' company has offered to buy the six-story building, lease
the ground floor to Macy's and put offices on the second and third
floors and 150 residential units on the top three floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to a vibrant downtown is people,'' he said. ``The city
is now very popular, a response to rebellion against sprawl that
has infected Atlanta. The customer is making a choice to live in an
environment different than suburbs.''

DOCTOR'S WOES SPOTLIGHT DEBATE OVER RAPID DETOXIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ When New Jersey investigators filed a lawsuit
against Dr. Lance Gooberman earlier this month that linked his
unusual heroin detoxification treatment to six patient deaths,
officials in the state attorney general's office proclaimed they
had stopped an ``unlawful'' treatment that put addicts' lives in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   But the state board responsible for regulating medical
procedures knew of Gooberman's treatment well before the first
patient death in 1995, records show, and though it determined the
heroin treatment to be ``potentially life threatening'' in 1997,
several months before three more patients died, it did not
intervene until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gooberman disclosed to the state in July 1998 that
one of his patients died shortly after a treatment, investigators
did not begin an inquiry until a year later, when he told them
another patient had died.
</P>
<P>
   There were other public warnings about Gooberman's treatment. In
July 1997, he acknowledged after a speech to doctors at the
University of Pennsylvania that three or four of his patients had
died, said doctors who attended. More recently, on Aug. 2, the
American Medical News published an article in which Gooberman
revealed that within 48 hours of his treatment, five of his
patients died, three apparently due to subsequent drug use.
</P>
<P>
   State officials defend the timing of their investigation by
pointing out that patients die every day, and regulators need firm
legal reasons to bar questionable or unsavory treatments. In this
case, one death was not enough to force the state to block
Gooberman's unorthodox treatments, said Mark Herr, the director of
the state attorney general's division of consumer affairs, which
oversees the state medical board. ``The knowledge of the deaths
transformed this from something that needed to be examined to
something that needed a more urgent response,'' Herr said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   During the state's investigation of Gooberman, who insists he
has been singled out unfairly, the doctor's sixth patient died.
Now, investigators are discreetly looking into the possibility of
more deaths related to Gooberman's treatment, a four- to six-hour
outpatient heroin treatment called ultra-rapid opiate
detoxification.
</P>
<P>
   Gooberman's current troubles offer a glimpse into the
controversy surrounding the growing business of rapid
detoxification, an unorthodox treatment for addiction that, in the
last five years, has spawned a rush among a handful of doctors to
patent _ and profit from _ their own versions of a procedure that
many doctors believe is unproven and needlessly risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concerns about its safety,'' said Dr. Alan
Trachtenberg of the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,
in Bethesda, Md. ``What is actually being accomplished by pushing
someone through detox rapidly?''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ultra-rapid opiate detoxification a subject of debate
is its speed _ it can be done in as few as four hours, with no
required after care _ and its use of anesthesia to knock patients
out while doctors feed them a series of intravenous drugs that
remove the opiates in the brain that cause physical addictions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a significant downside to the treatment, which
costs up to $8,000. Patients awaken cleansed of opiates, but they
are not cured of addiction and still face a punishing psychological
need for heroin. The drastic chemical changes the patient undergoes
can also cause heart and respiratory problems, addiction
specialists say. And once they leave the clinic or hospital,
relapse is a constant threat.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent addicts from relapsing after the treatment,
Gooberman surgically inserts a pellet of a heroin-blocking drug,
naltrexone, into their abdomens. The pellet, which the doctor has
patented along with his detoxification procedure, is meant to
dissolve over 60 days to block further cravings for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the state's lawsuit, Gooberman and his partner,
Dr. David Bradway, signed a legal agreement two weeks ago not to
perform any more detoxifications without the state's permission. He
is still allowed to insert new naltrexone pellets in his patients,
which include state prisoners, as part of their continuing
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In July, even as the state attorney general was investigating
Gooberman, the state's Administrative Office of the Courts
contracted with him to treat heroin-addicted convicts enrolled in a
work-release program, according to documents provided by
Gooberman's lawyer, Alma Saravia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that about 10,000 heroin users worldwide have
undergone anesthetized detoxification since ultra-rapid opiate
detoxification was invented in the late 1980s by an Austrian
physician. The treatment has been associated with at least 10
deaths, including six of Gooberman's patients.
</P>
<P>
   Even the doctors who advocate the treatment acknowledge a dearth
of research proving that it works. Many doctors say ultra-rapid
detoxification will never take the place of a complete withdrawal
program like methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Callahan, the executive vice president of the American
Society of Addiction Medicine, equated anesthetized detox to a
quick fix. ``It runs counter to what we have seen work with people
who have chronic histories of opiate addiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A federally funded study of ultra-rapid opiate detoxification
may soon shed more light on the treatment. The study, started on
Sept. 5 by Dr. Herbert Kleber, the medical director of the National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
will track the treatment's effectiveness on 60 heroin addicts over
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber, 65, is an outspoken opponent of commercial one-day
detoxification treatments like Gooberman's. He will soon give his
views directly to New Jersey's medical board, known as the Board of
Medical Examiners, which has hired him as an expert witness in
Gooberman's case, Ms. Saravia said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The board passed up several opportunities to halt Gooberman's
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Oct. 19, Herr said the board first heard of
Gooberman and his treatment ``sometime in the last two years.''
Three days later, Herr amended that, saying the board first learned
of Gooberman in December 1996 or January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Gooberman dated April 19, 1995, and supplied
to The New York Times by Ms. Saravia, the board said it was aware
of his detoxification procedure and requested more information
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the board published a set of proposals to
strictly regulate anesthesia detoxification, but a year later chose
to enact a lesser measure governing the use of anesthesia in all
outpatient treatments.
</P>
<P>
   By then, five of Gooberman's patients had died.
</P>
<P>
   Gooberman, a short, stout man with a red beard and pale blue
eyes, says he has been unfairly pursued by state officials. ``The
whole time I was doing it,'' he said last week in an interview, ``I
knew I was doing what's right for the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the treatment holds out new promise for the
nation's estimated 810,000 heroin users, especially those for whom
methadone has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Many American physicians believe the treatment has spawned a
gold-rush mentality among a coterie of doctor-entrepreneurs.
Instead of sharing their breakthroughs with their peers, their
critics say, the doctors have used patents and trademarks to make
money on them.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a growing list of physician-owned businesses with
names like U.S. Detox, which Gooberman controls, and Intensive
Narcotic Detoxification Centers of America, of Tolland, Conn., a
company founded by Dr. David Simon, an anesthesiologist who
recently trademarked the phrases ``intensive narcotic
detoxification'' and the more catchy ``kick in your sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the business of heroin detoxification would be
nothing without a steady supply of customers. Driving the demand
for the anesthetized detox treatment is an emerging kind of heroin
addict: middle-class suburban youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm seeing now is kids and parents that are desperate,''
said Gooberman, 48, of Haddonfield, N.J., near Philadelphia. Since
1994, he has detoxified 2,150 patients, he said, many of whom are
teen-agers who arrive at his clinic with a parent in tow.
</P>
<P>
   With Gooberman's treatment on hold pending a ruling from the
state's Board of Medical Examiners, the rapid detoxification market
in the metropolitan region is left to two others: Simon in
Connecticut and Bennett Oppenheim, a clinical psychologist who runs
UltraMed International of Fort Lee, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheim began his business last year, after a clinic he ran at
Metropolitan Hospital in Harlem with the help of two Israeli
partners was closed by New York City's Health and Hospitals Corp.
when its contract expired in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, David Yerushalmi and his brother-in-law, Dr. Andre
Waismann, are notable because they were the first to trademark the
phrase ``ultra-rapid opiate detoxification'' and, through their now
defunct company, CITA Americas, performed the $7,000 procedure on
addicts in prestigious hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami,
Oppenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Each man has since struck out on his own. Oppenheim is now
paired with a different physician, a different name for his
treatment and a new venue, at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   All this medical entrepreneurship worries some doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance to make a profit has stimulated its growth more
than its effectiveness,'' said Dr. Joseph Volpicelli, a
psychiatrist in the University of Pennsylvania's medical school who
has studied anesthetized detox treatments. ``It may be the wave of
the future and that's how medical companies will make their
profits,'' he said, reflecting on the wave of patents in recent
years. ``But that would be a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association strongly advises its members
not to patent medical procedures, saying patents represent
``substantial risks to the effective practice of medicine.''
Furthermore, federal law forbids doctors to enforce patents on
medical procedures, said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a former AMA president.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors like Simon in Connecticut, who recently sued another
heroin detox concern for using his treatment method, dismiss such
criticism as babbittry from doctors wedded to methadone treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychiatrists don't want to replace five days of inpatient
detox, which they manage, with one day of outpatient detox''
performed by anesthesiologists like him, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooberman's formal response to the New Jersey medical board is
due Nov. 10, Ms. Saravia said. After that, the board has 30 days to
decide whether to revoke his medical license or refer the matter to
a state judge, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooberman said he hopes to be back in the rapid-detox business
soon. ``We have to offer drug addicts more options,'' he said,
``not less.''

 &HT;    Home's not sweet in nightmare year
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _There is a point in at least every other Falcons season
when everybody becomes numb. If it hasn't happened already, a loss
today at home to Carolina (2-4) might be the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (1-6) won every home game last year, and brought an
11-game home winning streak into this season. But remember, this is
a team that has never in 33 previous years had back-to-back winning
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So what's happened?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have lost all three home games, including 17-14 to
the Vikings when Atlanta had a minus-three turnover deficit and
Morten Andersen missed two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   There was the 13-3 third-quarter lead they blew in a 19-13
overtime loss to Baltimore. And the 41-13 thumping by the Rams
remains an open wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's gone right, absolutely nothing,'' said quarterback
Chris Chandler. ``It's been one screw-up after another. It's pretty
much been a total nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there is hope. In '97, the Falcons began the season
1-7 but went 6-2 the rest of way, catapulting themselves toward
last year's Super Bowl run. So maybe they can start another run one
game earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If today's the magic day, the Falcons must:
</P>
<P>
   1. Get the running game going. If it means trying running back
Winslow Oliver, or using wide receiver Tim Dwight more, do whatever
it takes.
</P>
<P>
   The line needs to hold blocks longer. Ken Oxendine and Byron
Hanspard need to stop missing holes, and drag a few tacklers for a
change. Monday night at Pittsburgh, Atlanta running backs carried
21 times for 36 yards. Fifteen of those carries went for 2 yards or
less. Five went for 2 yards. Four went for 1 yard. Three went for
no gain. Three lost yardage. Nobody can win that way.
</P>
<P>
   2. Do a better job of picking up blitzes, and make the Panthers
pay when they blitz by hitting a couple big plays. Carolina doesn't
mix up its rush packages as much as last year, when the 3-4 was its
base defense. But everybody blitzes more against the Falcons,
who've yet to demonstrate they can stop it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep Carolina tight end Wesley Walls from finding seams in
the secondary. He's had some huge games against the Falcons, and
with wide receiver Rae Carruth out, and Patrick Jeffers injured and
possibly out, quarterback Steve Beuerlein is likely to look even
more at Walls. 4. Win the turnover war. The Falcons have scored 10
points off six takeaways, and surrendered 63 points off 17
turnovers. That's a recipe for 1-6.
</P>
<P>
   5. Get the lead first, and keep it. The Falcons have held the
lead for 33 minutes, 10 seconds all season _ out of a possible 422
minutes, 29 seconds.

 &HT;    Success comes to Muhammad
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing in the NFL can sometimes be a game of timing. Carolina
receiver Muhsin Muhammad was plagued by injuries his first two
seasons, but he enjoyed a breakout season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's durability was still a factor when the former
Michigan State star and the Panthers couldn't agree on a contract
extension before training camp. Six games into his fourth season,
Muhammad probably stands to earn a lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 217-pound native of Lansing, Mich., ranks first in
the NFC in receiving yards (593) and fourth in receptions (34).
Muhammad, 26, is on pace to shatter Carolina's single-season record
for catches (69) and receiving yards (1,024), set by Raghib Ismail
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great player here since the beginning of last
year,'' Panthers quarterback Steve Beuerlein said. ``He had a real
solid year for us last season and I always felt that if he could
stay healthy, he would really establish himself as a premier
receiver. He took the first steps toward doing that last year, and
I think he's just backing it up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, who was drafted in the second round in 1996, was a
late bloomer at Michigan State. He had only 28 catches his first
three seasons, but 41 catches for 696 yards as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Against LSU in the 1995 Independence Bowl, Muhammad had nine
receptions for 178 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown. That
performance drew comparisons to former Spartans star Andre Rison
and improved Muhammad's value in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great receiver,'' said Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan,
who will cover Muhammad today. ``I've been watching him grow the
past three years. Last year, I thought he did a pretty good job. He
just needed to get the ball thrown to him. This year, he's come
into his own. I respect the guy. He can make a lot of plays out
there. Steve Beuerlein has been putting a lot of faith and trust in
throwing the ball to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in Muhammad's first two seasons. As a
rookie in 1996, he missed both games against the Falcons because of
shoulder and hamstring injuries. He finished with 25 catches and
one touchdown in nine games, including five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad missed four games in his second season because of a
broken left wrist. He finished with only 27 receptions and no
scores. Last season, he finally stayed healthy and started all 16
games. He posted career highs with 68 catches, 941 receiving yards
and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to go out and produce on a weekly basis,''
Beuerlein said. ``I think he'd be the first person to tell you, and
I'd agree with him, that he's just going to get better as he gets
more reps and more confidence. As we as players and coaches learn
to use him better, he'll do nothing but get better.''
</P>
<P>
   With his gaudy statistics, Muhammad's attractiveness as a free
agent is soaring. Contract talks between the Panthers and his
agent, Ajili Hodari, have resumed. Muhammad will become an
unrestricted free agent in February if a deal isn't reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really focusing and concentrating on playing the games,''
Muhammad said. ``The contract will take care of itself if I come
out and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Height, weight: 6-2, 217.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 26.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: East Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   College: Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Career highlights: Muhammad posted career highs with 68 catches,
941 receiving yards and six touchdowns last season. ... He missed
10 games in his first two seasons because of injuries. ... Muhammad
was drafted in the second round by the Panthers in 1996 out of
Michigan State. ... Muhammad's first name is Arabic for
``charitable'' or ``one who does good deeds.''

 &HT;    Rhodes does not panic
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He has been, for the last two games, exactly what the
general manager envisioned. A goalie who can steal a game. A goalie
who can put a fledgling franchise in position to win a game. A
goalie who doesn't panic when it seems the players around him might
be doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can do that,'' Damian Rhodes said. ``I think I
can play even better than I have at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to a preseason marketing campaign, central to the
Thrashers' hopes in their first season, Rhodes will make his eighth
start in 10 games tonight when they play host to the Ottawa
Senators at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That Rhodes spent his last three and a half seasons in the
Canadian provincial capital and left there after being on a
goaltending yo-yo with Ron Tugnutt under coach Jacques Martin
provides some added incentive tonight for the 30-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerves will be up a little bit,'' Rhodes said. ``No matter
what terms you leave a team on you always want to play well against
them and show that you really are a player. But I think the reason
I had to leave was my contract was up and they couldn't afford to
pay two goalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes was the first player under contract to the Thrashers. He
was acquired from the Senators in a trade just before the expansion
draft but would have landed here either way. General manager Don
Waddell was set to take him off Ottawa's roster because the
Senators were likely to protect Tugnutt (who was under contract) in
the draft. Martin also had a closer relationship with Tugnutt than
he did with Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes says he isn't bitter about his stay in Ottawa. ``We got
better every year, I got better every year,'' he said. ``You have
to take the positives out of it.'' But after six seasons in Canada
(Toronto, then Ottawa), the Minnesota native was anxious to get
back on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe Ottawa, Rhodes said, ``Cold.'' There, he
rented an apartment, although the inability of a mortgage interest
write-off in Canada for a U.S. citizen partly was the reason. Here,
Rhodes owns a home with his wife, Lara, in Sugarloaf Country Club
on the third tee.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels ``more comfortable here'' than in the hockey
fishbowl of Ottawa. On the ice, it shows. Last Tuesday, he stopped
30 of 31 shots by Calgary, including 14 in the third period, to
preserve a 2-1 win. The next night in Toronto, he blanked the
high-powered Maple Leafs on 16 shots in the first but, abandoned by
his teammates, eventually fell victim to a 37-shot assault and lost
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say he got off to a slow start, although
maybe the Buffalo game (when the Sabres rallied for two goals in a
5-5 tie) he was a little bit off,'' Waddell said. ``But certainly
the last two games he's been great. He has given us a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has faced an average of 31 shots per game. In Ottawa, he
faced only 26 per game last year, and generally less quality
chances. No problem, says Rhodes, who added, ``I don't think I've
hit my stride yet but it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, he might even be recognized. He has yet to be stopped
on the street, a stark contrast to Canada, where ``if you're a
hockey player, you get noticed. Here, I even come off the ice in my
goalie equipment and kids don't know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the Thrashers.

with her parents, Darcy and Kristopher Carlisle. When it comes to
medical care, the cruise ships to which millions of Americans flock
every year are free of any U.S. regulation. There is no

not require cruise ships to provide any for passengers. (Jeffery A.

Two years after he lost the use of his legs in a car accident, Mark
Brew, 22, is back on stage in the ballet ``Gilchrist's Dream,'' at
the Theater of the Riverside Church. To be a dancer in a
paraplegic's body is to have your soul crave movement, and your
body resist it. ``I do professional training, ballet class every
day,'' he says. ``I just feel like my career is going in a
different direction, less toward the classics, more experimental.
I'm doing a lot of movement; I'm using my legs, even if I can't
feel it.'' (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

Mike Stanton and Tony Fossas began chanting, ``Little Coney.''

LAST INDONESIAN TROOPS LEAVE EAST TIMOR, ENDING 24-YEAR
OCCUPATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update 1st and 2nd grafs to early Sunday morning; 2nd graf
is new.)  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Ending a failed 24-year occupation that
culminated in a rampage of destruction, the last 900 Indonesian
soldiers remaining on this island territory pulled down their
red-and-white flag and departed from East Timor on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With a shout to the Australian harbormaster of ``OK sir, thank
you, sir,'' the Indonesians' crowded troop ship cast off from
Dili's dark and deserted harbor one hour after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Their officers were seen off earlier at the airport by the
people who took their place: the U.N. representative, the
Australian general who heads an international peacekeeping force
and Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the guerrilla chief who led a separatist
war against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sensational,'' said Gusmao with a delighted grin after
sharing polite smiles and handshakes with the departing officers.
Freed from seven years in detention in Indonesia, he is now the
effective leader of an emerging new East Timorese nation. He and
his countrymen had battled the Indonesians since they invaded in
1975, occupying the vacuum left when Portugal abandoned this land,
its former colony, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, beginning today, there is no more Indonesia here,'' said
Lt. Col. J.D. Sembiring, one of the departing officers, who said he
thought the East Timorese had erred in voting for independence, but
wished them well. ``Now we want to leave this area because in the
struggle so many people have died,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 East Timorese have been slain or died of
disease and starvation since Indonesia invaded and annexed this
land as its 27th province. Tens of thousands of Indonesian soldiers
have also lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun sank Saturday evening, young men danced around a
small fire on the beach, singing a song of freedom and shouting,
``Yeehah! Viva East Timor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughingly, we celebrate our freedom,'' said one, Santos
Kosme. ``Today is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the last of the Indonesian soldiers filed aboard
their transport ship, each with his bag on his shoulder, in a
silence broken only by their low murmuring.
</P>
<P>
   In the last action of their long years here, a small guard unit
crouched behind a perimeter fence at the port with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The troop departure was the final step in a painful separation
that began with a referendum on Aug. 30 in which 78.5 percent of
those voting chose to break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was followed by a rampage of terror and destruction by
militias backed by the Indonesian military that destroyed or
damaged an estimated 70 percent of East Timor's buildings and
forced most of its 800,000 people to become refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an international peacekeeping force of 7,500 troops
was deployed here on Sept. 20. The Indonesian Parliament voted this
month to accept East Timor's vote for independence. Four days ago,
the United Nations voted to set up an interim administration here
for two to three years, including the deployment of 9,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of East Timor and the presence of foreign troops here
have humiliated Indonesia and aroused a defensive wave of
nationalism. But these were only side issues in an intense
political upheaval that ended Oct. 20 with the parliamentary
election of Abdurrahman Wahid, a Muslim cleric, as the new
president of the world's fourth-largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of conciliation, Wahid said he would greet Gusmao
at the airport if he traveled to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Gusmao said Saturday that he planned to accept the invitation and
also to talk with Indonesian military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost whispering as he spoke to reporters in a light rain,
sometimes opening his eyes wide, sometimes breaking into a bright,
happy smile, Gusmao said he hoped Indonesia and East Timor could be
good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in a position to look at the future and we hope
that the two countries can develop friendly and cooperative
relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As if he did not want the moment to end, Gusmao chatted at
length in the airport departure lounge with the Indonesian
officers. Most of them managed to continue smiling as long as he
did.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall was a newly painted advertisement for beer that
read, ``Welcome to the Nation of Lorosae,'' the local name for East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the day's emotion was the port, where a ferryload
of 1,400 returning refugees docked Saturday morning, just 300 yards
from the gray transport ship where soldiers were preparing to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Because of previous incidents of rock-throwing, the peacekeepers
had erected a huge burlap shield along the perimeter fence to block
the departing soldiers from view. The troops were escorted through
the streets by Australian armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For days now, crowds of men have gathered outside the port to
jeer as they watch the departing remnants of an Indonesian force
that once numbered as many as 24,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad they are going because now we are free from
intimidation, free from terror, and now we can develop our own
country,'' said Jose Barros, 34, who worked until the recent wave
of violence as an official in a local government office. ``I
respect what they built for us here, but what is more important for
us than roads and houses and schools is our right to determine
ourselves for independence.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During its quarter-century of occupation, Indonesia poured an
estimated $100 million a year into the small territory _ much of it
spent in trying to subdue the small but stubborn guerrilla
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of blood spilled over the decades in keeping
their empire together,'' said Eric Chamberlain, a former Australian
military attache in Indonesia who now works for a relief
organization here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they spent a fortune trying to make it a showplace,'' he
said. ``They used to tell me a lot of soldiers were angry about how
much more money was being poured in here than into their own towns.
So they made it a showplace and now they've trashed it, and they
did it with such a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those military officers who coordinated and took part in
it, he said, the campaign of destruction was clearly meant to send
a message _ a message sprayed in graffiti on the side of one of the
burned buildings in Dili's commercial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of making the wrong choice,'' it said, in a
reference to the vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Dili remains in ruins, but is swarming with life as refugees
return from the hills or on boats and aircraft from camps in
Indonesian West Timor, where they fled or were forced to go by the
rampaging militias. People are moving back into their burned-out
homes, though many must use blue tarpaulins issued by aid agencies
as roofs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Indonesian troops have departed over recent weeks, they
have carried off whatever furniture or other loot they could. Even
the nets were gone from the tennis courts they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The returnees who will now take their places as masters of East
Timor begin with almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get the basics of life,'' said Luciano Calestini, an
official of the aid agency World Vision, who was handing out
supplies Saturday morning. ``The basics of life is a plastic sheet,
a blanket, a couple of bars of soap, a jerrycan for water and five
kilograms of rice.''

FAMILY'S ABSENCE AT TRIAL UNDERSCORES MENTAL ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During each day of the trial of Andrew Goldstein, the
schizophrenic man accused of pushing Kendra Webdale in front of a
subway train, Ms. Webdale's mother and sister have sat resolutely
in the courtroom's second row, just behind prosecutors. But the
rows behind Goldstein have remained empty.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's mother, Barbara, a former secretary who lives in
Little Neck, Queens; his father, Edmund, a Maryland doctor, and his
brothers, Douglas, a Manhattan optician, and Richard, have never
appeared in court.
</P>
<P>
   They have refused all interview requests from the media and have
declined to testify at the trial in Goldstein's defense. They have
even refused to speak with an expert psychiatrist working with
defense lawyers to save their son or brother from 25 years to life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A jury continued deliberating Saturday afternoon in his murder
trial at State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Those who might look for signals in the absence of the family of
Goldstein, a 30-year-old man with a decade-long history of
schizophrenia, could reach contradictory conclusions: either that
Goldstein's family is callous and uncaring, or that he is himself,
and has driven his family away.
</P>
<P>
   But according to other schizophrenics and their families,
neither extreme is likely to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between Goldstein and his relatives is familiar to most
families with schizophrenic members, medical experts say. Studies
have shown that 95 percent of schizophrenics fail to have regular
contact with their families. The Goldstein family's absence from
court, other schizophrenics and their families say, may not reflect
their judgment of him as much as their own exhaustion and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen MacNamara, a 54-year-old woman from Albany whose
estranged son Jeff is mentally ill, said she understood how a
mother could both desperately love her son and desperately not want
to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lived here, he threatened me with a knife,'' Ms.
MacNamara said, her voice choked with emotion. ``He threatened to
kill me. I'm afraid of him now. I know he couldn't live in my house
and we can't be together, but I love him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of detailed testimony that covered intimate
parts of Goldstein's life, his relationship with his parents, who
divorced when he was 8, and his siblings remains a mystery.
Prosecutors paint a picture of abuse so intense that it eventually
sparked a murderous attack from Goldstein. Defense lawyers portray
a family so frustrated by dealing with a dysfunctional state mental
health system that they were simply forced to give up.
</P>
<P>
   One revelation at the trial seized on by prosecutors is that
Goldstein carried out the fatal attack on his mother's birthday.
Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum has argued that
rejection from his family, particularly his mother, fueled the rage
that led Goldstein to kill Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein told acquaintances before the attack that his mother
gave him some money in mid-December and told him not to bother her
during the holidays. His father, he said, came to New York to
celebrate New Year's with Goldstein's brothers, but had not invited
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a far more serious allegation, Goldstein told psychiatrists
that his father beat him in 1998 because he believed Goldstein had
given his medication to his father's dogs. The dogs apparently were
sleepy. Goldstein also said that before his parents divorced, his
father regularly beat him and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   With Goldstein's family declining to be interviewed, it is
impossible to determine to what extent the stories are true, if at
all. Goldstein may have simply made everything up.
</P>
<P>
   The family's decision not to testify in his defense could also
reflect a decision on their part to protect him. Under
cross-examination by prosecutors Goldstein's mother, father, or
brothers could have been forced to disclose damaging information
about him that could weaken his case.
</P>
<P>
   His defense lawyers, Harvey Fishbein and Jack Hoffinger, have
highlighted the parts of the medical record that portray
Goldstein's relationship with his family as destroyed by a cruel
and incurable mental disease. Fishbein has repeatedly recited to
the jury a note written by a Bellevue Hospital social worker in
1997, eight years after Goldstein began cycling in and out of
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The social worker wrote that Goldstein's mother said in a
telephone conversation that she ``has since given up because she
says she is unable to deal with him anymore after so many years.
She feels like she has a lost a son. He is a completely different
person.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldstein's relationship with his mother first began to crumble
in 1989 after his schizophrenia forced him to drop out of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, medical records show. He
moved in with her, but in an ugly confrontation, he shoved her and
threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   A note in his medical records detail his delusions at the time.
``He is threatening to kill her,'' it says, ``because she gave him
poisoned food and there is poison in the air and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's mother took him in again after he was released from
the hospital. But weeks later, she again called an ambulance after
he stood in his room in a catatonic state for several hours, not
moving or responding to questions. After he was released from the
hospital yet again, his mother, who may have been frightened of him
at this point, refused to take him in.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence in the record of an early effort by
Goldstein's father to aid him. In 1992, he moved to Delaware to
live with his father. There, Goldstein tried to re-enroll in
college.
</P>
<P>
   He took classes at a local community college, he told
psychiatrists, but his father was disappointed with his grades.
After several months, he said, he was ordered out of his father's
home and retreated to New York, he said. There, his mother refused
to take him.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein was able to find rooms to live in at that point. His
parents appear to have intermittently given him money over the next
several years and there was at least one other brief visit to his
father. But he told psychiatrists and friends that he continued to
feel rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Nuza, one of Goldstein's roommates, quoted Goldstein as
telling him in 1998 ``that his family pretty much disowned him,
that his parents didn't want anything to do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But medical records show that his mother made an effort to help
him only two weeks before the killing. A note states that his
mother went to North General Hospital in Manhattan, where Goldstein
was from Nov. 15 to Dec. 10 last year, and asked that he be
admitted to Creedmoor for long-term care. Her efforts failed and he
was released onto the street. He killed Ms. Webdale two weeks
later.

IN SUBURBIA, FENCES VANISH BUT DOGS STAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. _ Katy's behaving beautifully. She approaches the
edge of the large lawn and pulls back, frightened, as if she's
about to fall off the end of the earth. ``She's an all-star,''
announces Tony Wilmot, a friendly man wearing a blue hat that says
``Invisible Fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy is a dog, a soft-coated wheaten terrier, and, for our
purposes, a postmodern suburban pet learning to live within the
confines of an e-canine world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've seen an Invisible Fence _ well, seen its results.
A dog is on a lawn, doing its thing _ running, barking, sniffing _
when it abruptly stops for no apparent reason. Suddenly, it is
nosing and growling along an unseen wall, acting like Marcel
Marceau trapped in an imaginary box.
</P>
<P>
   A buried antenna wire transmits a beeping noise to a special
collar on the dog if it approaches the line of the ``fence.'' The
dog is trained to turn back once it hears the beeping. If it
doesn't, the collar emits a positively Pavlovian low-level shock.
To paraphrase a certain Supreme Court justice, it's a high-tech
leashing.
</P>
<P>
   The Invisible Fence is a perfect appliance for suburban hamlets
where boundaries of property and propriety are always there, even
if you can't see them at first.
</P>
<P>
   These fences are selling wildly, since more people have the
money to pay for the pieces of a well-rounded life, but have less
time to attend to them. Working any kink out of the daily routine
is worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, owning a dog carries some guilt,'' said Kimberly S.
Leasure, a spokeswoman for the Invisible Fence Co. ``Both spouses
are working. There are kids. You come home, and there's a dog that
is jumping up and wants your attention. It gives you a peace of
mind to just open the door and give the dog the off-leash aerobic
exercise he needs to be a member of the family and not a pain in
the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   In case wiring your dog creates new guilt, the fence folks refer
to the shock as ``a correction'' as in: ``Did the dog yelp when it
received a correction?'' Dogs usually learn fast not to tempt fate,
and the fence has the ASPCA seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move toward the walkless dog. That sets the imagination
loose on other candidates for remote-control taming. Children. Men
bearing buckets of black goop wanting to seal your driveway. People
at your door promising eternal happiness in exchange for a magazine
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmot says that almost every customer eventually suggests
collaring the kids, usually in jest. Susan Douglass, Katy's owner,
was holding the electronic collar and talking about her three
children, when she joked, ``I'd like to put it on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the state gets involved,'' Wilmot responded,
without missing a beat. (``I've used that a thousand times,'' he
said later.)
</P>
<P>
   The Canine Fence Co., started in Carol and Henry Hill's basement
15 years ago, now has 168 employees and installs several thousand
Invisible Fences a year as the Northeast distributor. They'll also
wire indoors to keep the dog away from the Jacuzzi, the Christmas
tree or the kids' homework. The Invisible Fence people provide
training _ making a basic package cost about $600 for a
quarter-acre _ and they look down their snouts at competitors who
simply sell homeowners the hardware, as if it's a weed whacker or
something.
</P>
<P>
   The company is well situated here in Fairfield County, where
shaded roads edged with remnants of stone fences wind past estates
new and old. It is a landscape nourished by Wall Street through the
umbilical cord of the commuter railroad. Those magically contained
dogs are just another detail of life that appears to have been
attended to, even pampered, and put in its proper place.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, achieving that delicate balance only looks easy.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilmot pulls into Ms. Douglass' driveway, men from Morning
Mist, an underground sprinkler company, are leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're Invisible Fence?'' one of the Morning Mist men asks,
seeing Wilmot's hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Wilmot. ``Be careful of the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You be careful of the pipe,'' the Mist man says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another struggle just beneath the surface of suburbia.

 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight last Feb. 25, James Curtis, a 59-year-old
retired businessman from Maryland, was found unconscious in a
public restroom aboard the Sensation, one of the 14 ships of
Carnival Cruise Lines. He was revived by the ship's nurse and taken
to the infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six hours, Curtis drifted in and out of
consciousness, all the time complaining about worsening stomach
pains. The nurse and a doctor hooked him to an IV and gave him a
breathing tube. But they missed that an abdominal rupture was
causing him to bleed to death. Such ruptures are often fatal. But
even had they recognized the blood loss, they had no equipment to
give him a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like watching an avalanche coming at me and not being
able to stop it,'' his wife, Irma Curtis, said as she recalled
watching helplessly as he finally died at 6:50 that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Medical emergencies are terrifying anywhere. But when something
goes seriously wrong on a cruise ship hundreds of miles out at sea,
passengers are on their own more than they might imagine. Even on
the largest ships _ floating towns with as many as 3,100 passengers
and 1,500 crew members _ those aboard must rely on infirmaries that
are better equipped for sunburn and seasickness than for heart
attacks. And they are often staffed by doctors not qualified to
work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to medical care, the cruise ships to which
millions of Americans flock every year are free of any U.S.
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Though more than 90 percent of the passengers are Americans, the
ships are governed by the laws of the countries where they are
flagged, mainly Panama, Liberia and the Bahamas. The $12 billion
industry pays virtually no U.S. corporate taxes and can ignore many
U.S. laws governing labor standards, the environment and security.
</P>
<P>
   There is no international oversight of medical care because
maritime law does not require cruise ships to provide any for
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the fast-growing industry has been left to
establish its own guidelines, which are voluntary. In response to
pressure from the medical establishment, the care has improved
lately. But the quality of doctors and the sophistication of
equipment vary significantly from company to company.
</P>
<P>
   The major cruise lines have doctors, nurses and infirmaries on
their ships. But the medical personnel are independent contractors,
not employees, and courts have ruled that the lines are not liable
for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Many shipboard doctors have degrees from foreign medical schools
and lack the minimum training to practice in American hospitals.
Hiring practices can be slipshod. Doctors can be on call 24 hours
but are often paid substantially less than doctors in the United
States. Most cruise lines lack formal processes for reviewing a
doctor's work.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than 5 million people will take cruises out of
U.S. ports on ships sailing under foreign flags, a record. And the
average age of passengers has been declining, to 50, reflecting the
greater popularity of cruise vacations among families.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the passengers will ever think about medical care on the
ships, and the overwhelming majority of those who do will not
suffer serious injury or illness. But hundreds of passengers each
year do experience medical emergencies, and 20 or so die, according
to medical experts and statistics from the cruise lines and the
medical examiner's office in Miami, the nation's busiest cruise
port.
</P>
<P>
   In most emergencies, passengers recover, some to write glowing
letters of praise to the ship's staff for quick and effective care.
But an examination by The New York Times, including a survey of all
major cruise companies, a review of court cases and interviews with
current and former employees of cruise lines, shows that in other
cases the results are injuries, death and striking accusations of
negligence and malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret DiBari, a 47-year-old nursing home inspector from
Queens, complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing on her
dream cruise, and the ship's doctors said she had acute bronchitis.
The day after the ship returned to New York, however, doctors at
Lenox Hill Hospital discovered she had had a heart attack, most
likely on the ship. Admitted to intensive care, she had a second
attack and died.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Elizabeth Carlisle, a 14-year-old from Michigan,
said she sustained lifelong health problems because a ship's doctor
failed for three days to recognize that her appendix had ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Hatch, a diabetic on her honeymoon, lapsed into
unconsciousness and convulsions after a ship's nurse apparently
gave her the wrong medication.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharon Lum, a California kindergarten teacher, said she
returned to a ship's infirmary five minutes after a nurse said her
husband was improving after severe vomiting and diarrhea, to find
him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are drawn from interviews and pending lawsuits,
and the cruise lines dispute the accusations of negligence in each
case. A review of lawsuits filed over three years against cruise
lines in Miami, where most cruise tickets stipulate that actions
against the companies must be filed, found that most cases were
settled, with the terms kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the cruise companies say cases are settled to save
legal costs and for other business reasons. Lawyers for passengers
say the companies resolve claims to avoid appeals that would
challenge their exemption from liability for their doctors' actions
on board ships.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care is not perfect on land, and suits are filed
regularly against leading hospitals, too. But the quality of care
at sea has become a more pressing issue as the cruise industry has
doubled in size over the last decade and its ships have also grown.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the American Medical Association brought
pressure on the industry to improve care after a study by two
Florida doctors, Bradley S. Feuer and Richard S. Prager, found
glaring inadequacies in staff qualifications and equipment on
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 11 cruise lines, the doctors found that 27
percent of doctors and nurses did not have advanced training in
treating victims of heart attacks, the leading killer on ships, and
54 percent of doctors and 72 percent of nurses lacked advanced
training for dealing with traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of shipboard doctors _ 45 percent _ had board
certification, an important credential that is granted after three
to seven years of residency and a written examination in a
specialty, or its equivalent. There are 24 specialty board
certifications recognized by the American Medical Association and
the American Board of Medical Specialties. Ideally, ship doctors
would have certification or an international equivalent in
emergency medicine, family practice or internal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   As for equipment, the survey found that 63 percent of the ships
did not have equipment for blood tests for diagnosing heart
attacks, and 45 percent did not have mechanical ventilators or
external pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was that the quality of maritime medical care
was less than adequate, from the medical facilities to nurse and
physician credentials,'' said Prager, a critical-care physician at
Baptist Hospital in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association passed a resolution in 1996
calling for federal legislation or an international treaty to
establish minimum medical standards on all cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the association, Robert J. Mills, said
establishing standards remained a legislative priority. But
Congress has not acted and the issue was not raised at
congressional hearings on safety in the industry earlier in
October.

</P>
<P>
   The absence of medical standards is one of several examples of
the lack of regulation over the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   In part to head off federal government controls, the cruise
companies and their increasingly influential Washington trade
association, the International Council of Cruise Lines, have turned
to voluntary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   After articles in The Times about shipboard assaults and efforts
to cover up incidents, the industry association said in July that
its members would report all suspected crimes to the proper
authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And after Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty to criminal
pollution charges and paid $27 million in fines in the last 18
months, the industry said in October that it would take voluntary
steps to improve environmental controls.
</P>
<P>
   The industry responded in similar voluntary fashion to the
medical establishment in 1996, adopting guidelines for staffing and
equipment that were written with help from the American College of
Emergency Physicians, whose members sometimes serve on ships. The
industry emphasizes that its guidelines are suggestions, not
standards, but people within the industry and some outsiders credit
them with improving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically there has been a range of capabilities and
facilities,'' said Dr. Carter Hill, medical director for Holland
America Line. ``A lot of that was because there were no guidelines.
I really feel the industry has responded in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines adopted by the industry in 1996 say doctors
should have a medical license and competency in advanced life
support or cardiac care, though certification is not required. They
say doctors should have experience in general practice and also in
emergency or critical care, but board certification or equivalent
international certification is not required.
</P>
<P>
   The industry suggests that ships carry two cardiac monitors, two
portable defibrillators, an electrocardiograph, an external
pacemaker, respiratory support equipment and, on new ships, X-ray
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ships generally have one or two doctors and two or three nurses,
depending on the number of passengers. The cruise lines serving
U.S. ports, including Carnival, Royal Caribbean International and
Princess Cruises, meet the industry guidelines, according to
responses to a survey sent out by the Times.
</P>
<P>
   But not all ships meet the higher standards outlined in the 1996
study that prompted the American Medical Association's resolution,
according to the survey responses from 10 of the 16 foreign-owned
cruise lines operating out of U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Carnival, the world's biggest cruise line, said 56
percent of the doctors on its 14 ships had board certification or
equivalent credentials. Royal Caribbean, the second-largest line,
said 85 percent of its doctors were board certified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major lines, only Princess Cruises and Holland America
Line said all of their ships carried blood-transfusion equipment,
according to their responses to the Times survey.
</P>
<P>
   Princess and Holland America, a division of Carnival Corp.,
received high marks from outside medical experts, and both exceeded
the industry guidelines. Princess Cruises, for example, employs
only full-time physicians licensed in Britain, which has
requirements similar to those of the United States; its doctors
have at least three years of postgraduate training and
certification in advanced trauma life support. The line pays them
$120,000 a year, more than twice the salary at most other cruise
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try and pay the amount of money required to attract
well-qualified individuals,'' said Dr. Alastair Smith, the medical
officer of Princess Cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 2,600-passenger Grand Princess has the industry's
first telemedicine system, which allows specialists at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles to connect to the ship via satellite
to assist the on-board doctors. All nine Princess ships carry
thrombolytic drugs, the so-called clot-busting superdrugs that
increase survival chances in many heart attack patients. Few other
lines carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most sophisticated cruise ship is not a floating
hospital. The goal in the most serious emergencies is to stabilize
patients until they can be transported to hospitals on land (at
passengers' expense). Industry experts say the quality of care is
comparable to what travelers would expect in any resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ship is a small town, and people should expect to find the
same medical care there that they would in any other small town of
a couple thousand people,'' said Dr. Theodore E. Harrison,
president of a company that recruits doctors for cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   But other doctors and critics of the lines challenge that
comparison. Qualifications for small-town doctors in the United
States are more stringent than those for doctors on most cruise
ships. And transporting a critically ill patient from a rural
clinic or hospital to a more sophisticated one is far easier than
evacuating someone from a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel S. Cronin, who spent 10 years as a surgeon before
becoming a maritime lawyer, said: ``It may be fair to say care on a
ship is like a small town, except for one thing. In the small town,
they can call an ambulance and get you to a big city. It's a lot
easier, and a lot cheaper, too.''

   Last Christmas, Dr. Marie Gade, a New York City radiologist, was
on a cruise with her family on Cunard's flagship Queen Elizabeth 2
when she was struck by a van during an excursion on the island of
St. Thomas. Her pelvis was fractured in several places, and she and
her husband, Dr. Ronald Gade, decided to avoid the island's
hospital in favor of the care offered on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   But when the couple arrived at the infirmary, they discovered
that there was no equipment to transfuse blood, which would have
been needed if Marie Gade had had internal bleeding, and that other
basic equipment was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than remain on the ship, Marie Gade was taken to an
airport on a nearby island and flown on a medical jet back to New
York, she and her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of needing shipboard medical care are slim, but the
American College of Emergency Physicians estimates that 4 percent
to 5 percent of passengers will succumb to anything from a sprained
ankle to food poisoning. That means a minimum of 200,000 medical
cases this year. The group estimates that 500 of those passengers
will require removal to a hospital on shore.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do face emergencies on cruise ships, the primary
cause of death is heart attacks. An analysis by The Times of the 60
reported natural deaths aboard cruise ships sailing out of Miami
from 1996 through mid-September of this year found that more than
90 percent were caused by heart attacks or heart-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were elderly or had a history of heart disease or
both, but some were younger and had shown no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret DiBari had no history of heart problems when she
boarded Celebrity's Zenith for a cruise from New York to Bermuda on
June 28, 1997. Two days later, she went to the infirmary
complaining of difficulty breathing and chest pain. One doctor,
German Leon, took a chest X-ray and diagnosed an upper respiratory
tract infection and acute bronchitis, according to deposition
testimony in the suit brought by her mother against Celebrity
Cruises and two doctors in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, Ms. DiBari's condition did not
improve, and she returned regularly to the infirmary, where she was
treated by Leon and a colleague, Dr. Juan Sarmiento, both natives
of Colombia and graduates of medical schools there. Her condition
did not improve. The day after the ship returned to New York, she
was hospitalized, and she died in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard P. Friedlander, a cardiologist hired by Ms. DiBari's
mother, wrote in a report prepared for her lawyer, Alan L.
Fuchsberg, that the shipboard doctors had failed to detect evidence
of a heart problem on the X-ray. He wrote that the failure to treat
Ms. DiBari properly and to refer her urgently to a hospital ``more
likely than not'' increased the risk of her second, fatal heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Sarmiento said he had not looked at the X-ray
as part of his examination of Ms. DiBari. While examining the X-ray
during questioning, he said that it could indicate a heart ailment,
but that it was also consistent with other problems. Lawyers for
the cruise line and the two doctors maintained in court filings
that Ms. DiBari was treated properly and that her death was not
related to what occurred on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   A Celebrity spokeswoman said the company would not comment, and
lawyers for Leon and Sarmiento did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento's deposition and documents produced in the court case
shed light on the hiring and pay practices at Celebrity Cruises,
which is part of Royal Caribbean. Neither doctor was licensed to
practice in the United States or had advanced training in cardiac
care. They were paid $2,300 a month in cash by the ship's purser.
In addition, they received 9 percent of the fees charged passengers
for treatment, and free accommodations. Neither carried malpractice
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Gonzalez, a former ship's doctor, is a medical
consultant to Celebrity responsible for evaluating doctors applying
to work on ships. In a deposition, he said most applicants were not
board certified, but he said that did not mean they were
unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors trained in some developing countries, Gonzalez said, use
the shipboard jobs ``as a step to coming into the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he had interviewed Sarmiento after a former
colleague introduced them, but he said he had no recollection of
contacting any of his references. According to court records, the
resume submitted by Sarmiento did not list references.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to the Times survey, Celebrity declined to say
what percentage of its doctors were licensed in the United States.
It said only that its shipboard doctors held valid medical licenses
in their respective countries, which is consistent with the
industry's guidelines. Half of its doctors hold board
certifications or an international equivalent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor who was not licensed in the United States also saw
Elizabeth Carlisle when she became ill on Carnival's
2,000-passenger Ecstasy in March 1997. Shortly before boarding the
ship with her parents, the teen-ager felt mildly ill. Her mother,
Darcy Carlisle, telephoned Elizabeth's pediatrician at home in Ann
Arbor, Mich. He suggested they check with the ship's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Not far out of Miami, her parents took Elizabeth to the
infirmary, where Dr. Mauro Neri saw her. Without examining her, he
said her symptoms sounded like flu and prescribed an antibiotic,
according to the complaint filed by the family against Carnival in
Dade County Circuit Court in Miami. The next day, nauseated and in
pain, she returned to the infirmary and Neri prescribed a different
antibiotic, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, the symptoms had grown worse, and the
Carlisles faxed the details to her pediatrician. He urged them to
return home immediately. Before the Ecstasy docked in Cozumel,
Mexico, Mrs. Carlisle took Elizabeth back to Neri. At Mrs.
Carlisle's insistence, he examined her physically for the first
time, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him point blank if this could be appendicitis,'' Mrs.
Carlisle said in an interview. ``He said, `No, no, it's not. I'm
not sure what it is. I'm sorry your vacation has been ruined.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, doctors discovered that Elizabeth's appendix had
ruptured and she had a massive infection. She underwent two
operations and has what are expected to be lifelong health
problems, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint accuses Carnival of employing doctors who were
poorly educated, not licensed in the United States and not skilled
in handling emergencies. It also accuses the company of false
advertising for saying there was a competent doctor on board.
</P>
<P>
   Charles R. Lipcon, the Miami lawyer who filed the suit, said,
``In every suit I file against cruise companies, I claim bad
medical care because invariably there is bad medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers said the company was not responsible for the
care provided by Neri. ``It is well settled that a cruise ship
operator cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence of
its ship's medical staff in the care and treatment of passengers,''
they said in a court filing, citing several cases in which judges
ruled in cruise lines' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival and other cruise lines say they are not responsible for
the doctors and nurses on their ships because they are independent
contractors, not employees. They also say that maritime law
requires them to provide medical care only for the crew, not
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for passengers counter that the doctors are agents of
the ship's owner because they wear an officer's uniform, have their
office on the ship and are paid by the ship. Passengers, they say,
are essentially captives unable to seek other medical care. The
courts, however, have sided with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Neri has not responded to the Carlisle suit, and efforts to
locate him were unsuccessful. According to court records, Neri
finished medical school in his native Italy in 1981 and had nine
medical jobs in Italy, Africa and England before he was hired by
Carnival in 1996 for $1,057 a month. His last job had been at a
hospital in Middlesex, England.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Diskin, chairman of the emergency department at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, is Carnival's medical hiring
consultant. He said he had relied on Neri's resume in recommending
hiring him and made no independent effort at verification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the British system, I would have relied a lot upon his
most recent employment being in Britain,'' he said in a deposition
in the family's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors applying to a small-town hospital, by contrast, usually
have their license and medical-school record examined by a
credentials committee. Representatives of the committee also talk
directly to those named as a doctor's references, and the applicant
must appear for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of foreign medical schools must pass a series of tests
to apply for a license in this country. New York City's public
hospitals rely heavily on foreign-trained doctors, but their
minimum standards require that the doctor complete a residency and
pass a foreign medical exam and the state licensing exam.
</P>
<P>
   The point, said Dr. Jane Zimmerman of the city's Health and
Hospitals Corp., is not that foreign-trained doctors are not as
good as their American counterparts but that they must meet the
same basic qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival officials declined a request for an interview. In
response to written questions, the company said the credentials and
references of its doctors and nurses were verified by telephone or
in writing. The company also said that its medical staff and
infirmaries met the industry's guidelines and that its doctors had
malpractice insurance.
</P>
<P>
   People rarely consider medical care when planning a cruise. They
are more likely to think about the size of their cabin, the quality
of the food and the ports of call. Often, ship's doctors said,
passengers even forget to bring their medications.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Curtis, a real estate agent from Cockeysville, Md., did not
want to leave anything to chance when she and her husband, James,
headed off on a weeklong cruise last February aboard Carnival's
Sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Jimmy had had heart surgery a year earlier, I insisted
that he get a complete physical before we went,'' she said in an
interview. ``I wanted to make sure we weren't going to be in the
middle of nowhere and have something happen. The doctors said he
was absolutely fine, 100 percent fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days after setting sail from Tampa, Fla., after an
afternoon on a Mexican beach and a relaxing night with friends,
Curtis lay dying in the Sensation's infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Curtis slowly and painfully bled to death through a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,'' according to the complaint
filed by his wife against Carnival Corp., Dr. James R. Otworth and
Constance Jackson, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said that Otworth and Ms. Jackson had failed to
diagnose Curtis' condition and had not provided proper treatment,
including a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blood, Curtis was given so much intravenous solution
that his corpse was bloated, his wife said in an interview. Sitting
in her house outside Baltimore, surrounded by mementos of 30 years
of marriage, she said she did not sue Carnival just for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is money now?'' she said. ``I want to make an issue
of the substandard care aboard cruise ships.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that different care could have saved Curtis. His
wife's lawyer, Michael A. Mullen, said medical experts were
reviewing the case. A Carnival lawyer, Jeffrey B. Maltzman, said
the rupture that killed Curtis was extremely difficult to diagnose
and required immediate surgery at a major trauma center. He said
the condition was usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Maltzman said that the captain had begun to divert the ship and
had notified the Coast Guard but that Curtis died before arriving
in port. He also said Otworth was an American physician who was
board certified in internal medicine as well as in advanced cardiac
and trauma care.
</P>
<P>
   Otworth and Ms. Jackson have not responded in court, and efforts
to reach them were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson also provided care for Janice Hatch aboard the
Sensation in 1997. Mrs. Hatch, a diabetic from Flint, Mich., and
her husband, Craig, were on their honeymoon when she felt flushed
on a walk in port and went to the infirmary upon returning to the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ms. Jackson and Dr. Leon Rand, a semiretired physician
from New Jersey, checked Mrs. Hatch's blood sugar with a glucose
meter. According to the couple's lawsuit, filed against Carnival in
Dade County Circuit Court, Ms. Jackson said the blood sugar was
extremely high and administered fast-acting insulin to bring it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of getting better, she got worse and worse,'' Hatch
said in an interview. ``She was totally unconscious and went into a
diabetic coma and was wringing wet. I called for the nurse, and she
said she'd come around. I waited and she started jerking real
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he raced to the couple's cabin to grab his wife's
glucose meter and returned to the infirmary. When he measured her
blood sugar, he discovered that it was not too high but too low.
Ms. Jackson administered glucose, and Mrs. Hatch regained
consciousness after about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by doctors hired by the Hatches in the court files
indicate that brain damage and other injuries from the episode have
left Mrs. Hatch disoriented and unable to return to her job as a
millwright for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers have challenged the suit on several grounds,
including that cruise lines are not required to provide medical
care. They said that the ship's glucose meter had been checked for
accuracy the day before the incident and that infirmary records
showed only that Mrs. Hatch received both insulin and glucose and
left the ship without complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident of our position and believe the final
outcome will vindicate Carnival from any wrongdoing,'' a statement
from the cruise line said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said in the interview that they had been too frightened to
seek further care. ``I wouldn't have asked them for an aspirin,''
he said. ``Why would I? I'm the one that saved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rand and Ms. Jackson were named in a separate suit, and their
lawyer, Christopher E. Knight, said neither he nor his clients had
any comment. But Knight, who often represents doctors and nurses
from the cruise industry, said shipboard treatment met the basic
standard for care.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a passenger should expect and will find is reasonable
emergency medical care,'' he said. ``What a cruise ship does not
have is a full medical staff like a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government does not monitor medical care on
cruise ships, it does inspect them for sanitation, and there is
evidence that the regulation helps. Government officials said food
and water sanitation had improved significantly in recent years,
and large outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness have declined.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Vessel Sanitation Program inspects cruise ships that use U.S.
ports. Inspectors with a 42-item checklist examine sanitation and
general cleanliness. Vessels that fail to score at least 86 out of
100 are inspected again within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   If a ship fails a second time, the agency can recommend that it
not sail, a step taken only once in the last three years with a
large cruise ship. In the most serious instances, the Centers for
Disease Control can ask the Coast Guard to invoke quarantine laws
and detain a ship. Officials said that had never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that the commitment to sanitation by the cruise lines
is very strong,'' said David L. Forney, acting director of the
sanitation program, ``because they realize the consequences of
having an outbreak on a ship and because they realize the power of
our scores from a public-relations standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ship's scores, called green sheets, are posted on the
agency's Internet site (www.cdc.gov/travel) within a week and are
distributed regularly to about 6,000 travel agents and frequent
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported outbreaks of illness affecting 3 percent
or more of passengers or crew members has declined to 10 in 1997
and nine in 1998 from an average of 15 a year a decade ago,
according to the agency. There has been one so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forney said the program held cruise ships to a higher standard
of cleanliness than restaurants on land because an outbreak at sea
was potentially so serious. ``The consequences of something
happening, you don't even want to think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, at least 270 people became ill with vomiting and
diarrhea from gastroenteritis on Princess Cruises' Regal Princess
over three consecutive cruises. The previous year, 354 passengers
and crew members became ill in an outbreak of gastroenteritis
aboard the Royal Odyssey, a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak aboard Carnival's Jubilee in June 1996 was smaller,
but deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers on that cruise were Russell Lum, 52, an
aircraft mechanic from Berkeley, Calif.; his wife, Sharon; their
daughter, Courtney, and a niece, Robin Tom. They had boarded the
Jubilee on Father's Day in San Pedro, Calif., for a weeklong cruise
along the coast of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint in a wrongful-death suit filed by
Mrs. Lum against Carnival in U.S. District Court in Miami, on the
second night Lum complained that he was not feeling well. He
vomited and spent the next day resting in the cabin. His wife,
meanwhile, heard other passengers discussing people falling ill
with diarrhea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:30 a.m. on the third day, Mrs. Lum said in an interview,
she woke when her husband collapsed outside the cabin's bathroom.
She said she called the ship's infirmary but the nurse tried to
discourage her from bringing him there because it was so late. Mrs.
Lum said she insisted, and her husband was put on an intravenous
solution to avoid dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, the nurse took Lum's blood pressure and said he
was improving and could return to his cabin. Tired but relieved,
Mrs. Lum hurried to the cabin to get towels and a change of
clothes, because her husband had soiled his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and niece were awake, and I told them he was fine
and would be coming back,'' Mrs. Lum said. ``I was gone about five
minutes, and when I got back to the infirmary the doctor and nurse
asked me to wait in the waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing briefly, Mrs. Lum said she waited for several minutes,
wondering what was going on. Then the doctor and nurse returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back and told me that he had taken a turn for the
worse and he had died,'' she said. ``I asked them how that was
possible, and they said there was nothing they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum was the only person to die among the 52 passengers and 16
crew members who came down with viral gastroenteritis on the
cruise. His death was caused by extensive blood loss from a tear in
his esophagus caused by vomiting, according to the family's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lum died of retching to death,'' said Erik Peterson, the
family's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis J. Mase, a lawyer for Carnival, said in court papers that
the company was not responsible, contending that the death was an
act of God and that Lum had failed to seek timely or appropriate
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Lum's own negligence contributed to his death and
injuries,'' Mase said.

IN QB-SHORT NFL, BUDDING STAR AND PROVEN STAR FACE OFF IN INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a good look today at the quarterback play in Indy.
Something rare will be on display, which doesn't necessarily mean
Troy Aikman will force a few smiles for the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what we will have here is a young/heralded QB who is
showing NFL progress _ this was Aikman a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Aikman's long career is stuck in a
week-to-week gear of what have you done for us lately. But for
Peyton Manning, the career anticipation is immense. How far will he
eventually carry the up-and-coming Colts?
</P>
<P>
   In a critical stretch of schedule for the Cowboys, this is
another tell-tale contest of measuring recovery progress from those
twin disasters known as Eagles and Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For the Colts and Manning, this is a game that was earmarked on
the schedule last summer. Beat Dallas and you will get more credit
than you probably deserve. But a surprising 4-2 start for Indy now
makes this a springboard game into the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the short haul or the long run, of course, it will be about
the quarterback. Good, solid, consistent play at that position is
what each NFL club is seeking. Yet very few are finding it.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning, in his second year out of Tennessee, has been an
exception in this season of spotty-to-awful quarterback
performances. When Arena League product Kurt Warner of the St.
Louis Rams is the NFL's most valuable quarterback to date, what
does that say?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much talk about the shortage of potential franchise
type quarterbacks,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said, ``but I really
don't think it's any different than a decade ago. The search is
never ending for the quarterback who can hold up mentally and
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking for someone with the skill to win a game and
the judgment not to lose it. That's a hard order to fill. Which is
also why a Manning jumps out at everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider this dwindling list:
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in the NFL, the elite quarterbacks were John Elway,
Brett Favre, Aikman, Steve Young and Dan Marino. Elway has retired,
Young should retire and while Marino is currently injured, Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson may also be preparing to move on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, the franchise builders at quarterback had
names like Todd Collins, Mark Brunell, Trent Dilfer and Drew
Bledsoe. Only Bledsoe in New England remains highly regarded while
Collins and Dilfer no longer even register on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   On the list of emerging QBs was once Jake Plummer, Elvis Grbac,
Kordell Stewart, Steve McNair, Scott Mitchell and Heath Shuler. All
of those are either disappointments or washouts, although Plummer
is a good bet for the bounce-back.
</P>
<P>
   The usual suspects among the retreads included Vinny Testaverde,
Doug Flutie, Chris Chandler, Jeff George, Randall Cunningham, Rich
Gannon and Brad Johnson. This would have been the most productive
group of QBs, except for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks who have dropped in this season from either the
moon or Canada include Warner, Jon Kitna, Charlie Batch and Jeff
Garcia. Outside of Garcia, this is the best group in the league at
the moment. How scary is that?
</P>
<P>
   In the category of too-early-to-tell would be a promising catch
of rookies, along with Brian Griese in Denver and possibly the
headcase in San Diego, Mr. Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together, however, and it leaves the NFL in a
quarterbacking ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the position that impacts how a team plays and impacts
how a team drafts _ if you are wrong, you pay heavily,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   But all that scouting research can take place, and then a Warner
shows up in St. Louis and goes bombs away on the rest of the
league. Blind luck? Yes. But as long as the results are there, who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take every quarterback who has been available \Rin the
draft\S during the 90s, we had Manning rated the highest, with
Bledsoe real close,'' said Larry Lacewell, the Cowboys' director of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I wondered if Bledsoe would be physically tough
enough, and I was wrong about that. He is. But for the total
package, Manning was it. And we are starting to see the total
package come together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that Manning somewhat goes against the trend
most teams now deem important _ the quarterback who moves around
freely, avoiding the rush. Manning is mobile, but his style is also
a lot like Aikman's _ the five-step drop and the quick release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the trend is _ the only thing that
counts is if your quarterback can make plays,'' Lacewell added.
``Manning is still learning, but he can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL of today, that has become a rare blessing.

 &HT;    Award's principles put quality in schools
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOVALL, N.C. _ Out here amid the trailer homes and rusty-roof
barns, where education was headed down a rutted road to mediocrity,
lessons from corporate America are rejuvenating Stovall-Shaw
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   School districts across the country are putting to work in
classrooms successful methods from the corporate world. Some of the
most dramatic changes are happening here in North Carolina in such
unlikely places as Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary school looks ordinary. It's been around for 50
years, a red-brick fixture in rural, blue-collar Granville County,
just south of the Virginia state line. Yellow buses park out front.
A crackly voice from the public address system echoes through the
main hallway, which, like most of the building, has the personality
of apple butter on toast. Walls are beige, the floor brown.
</P>
<P>
   But in Anne Fitz's sixth-grade classroom, the students are fixed
on Tamsin Norris. The 11-year-old is wandering around with her eyes
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find me where my voice is,'' Fitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamsin's classmates giggle as she bumps into desks. When she
nears the teacher, the game ends. Then the lesson begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the one thing that she lacked?'' Fitz asked, walking
among the two dozen students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vision,'' they said. ``Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is vision?'' asked Fitz, making a point that symbolizes
the importance of goal-setting and other business principles in
North Carolina's education reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can achieve your goals if you can envision what they look
like and see how to get there,'' said Fitz, 36, a teacher for 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the business world, administrators and teachers
at Stovall-Shaw Elementary set goals to solve problems ranging from
bathroom cleanliness to student attendance. They use flow charts to
prepare lesson plans and to organize how students go from their
classrooms to the gymnasium for physical education.
</P>
<P>
   Empowering students
</P>
<P>
   Fitz's students started the school year by debating and writing
a vision statement. Each student signed it, and Fitz posted it on
the dark green chalkboard at the front of the cramped classroom.
Students can revise it at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it reads: ``We will show respect, cooperation, and
acceptance of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is part of Fitz's belief in empowering students to
think and act on their own. It's also the mantra of total quality
management, a concept from the corporate world finding a place in
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, principals and teachers who use business
techniques to organize their schools and classrooms report higher
standardized test scores, better attendance and less disruption and
violence among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fundamentally changing the way we do business by
focusing on customer service,'' said Mike Ward, sounding more like
a salesman than the North Carolina superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
   In public education, Ward said, the customers include students,
parents, local governing boards and state legislatures that are
dole out tax dollars to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, customers weren't getting much for their
money in North Carolina, historically laggard in national student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, national educators took notice of the Tar Heel state.
The National Education Goals Panel reported that students from
North Carolina and Texas had scored the greatest average gains in
state testing of reading, writing and math basic since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state test results show improvements as well, with 69
percent of North Carolina's 1.2 million students scoring at or
above grade level on tests in reading and math. Six years ago, 53
percent were capable of grade-level work.
</P>
<P>
   The Goals Panel commissioned a study to explain North Carolina's
progress. Published in August, it concluded that cooperation among
educators, the business community and state government in a
six-year initiative called Total Quality in Education has played a
big role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a way to engage business expertise in
partnerships that will really help transform education,'' said
Peggy Siegel, the North Carolina report's author.
</P>
<P>
   As director of business/education leadership initiatives at the
National Alliance of Business, a nonprofit organization in
Washington, Siegel is at the forefront of the movement to instill
business principles in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1991, the public schools in Pinellas County, Fla.,
were among the first in the nation to embrace business methods
across its entire district. In seeking a way to assess the
performance of its program, the Tampa Bay district adopted the
criteria of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other school systems _ including North Carolina's _
have modeled their programs upon Pinellas County's. They, too, have
adopted the Baldrige criteria to judge their results.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the prestigious award in 1987, the year
Malcolm Baldrige died. As President Reagan's commerce secretary,
Baldrige had realized that many American businesses needed to
restructure themselves dramatically to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   Baldrige envisioned a rigorous competition among U.S.
corporations that would measure improvements in planning,
productivity, profitability, treatment of employees and customer
service. Managed by the Commerce Department and the private sector,
the award has emerged as a widely accepted model of business
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, the Baldrige competition is open
to educational organizations. That category attracted 16
nominations (the organizations haven't been disclosed). President
Clinton and Commerce Secretary William Daley are expected to
announce the winners this month.
</P>
<P>
   Staying competitive
</P>
<P>
   Using the Baldrige criteria, school districts share a common
rulebook for measuring their performance. It breeds cooperation and
competition among schools, answering some critics of public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing element in public education is not a missing set
of Baldrige principles,'' said John Hood, president of the John
Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. ``It is the competition
that makes those principles important.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Granville County, school superintendent Janice Davis said
the Baldrige principles encourage educators to focus on growing
competition from charter schools, private schools and home
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our parents had the resources to choose another educational
alternative, would they still choose us over our competition?''
Davis said. ``Our goal is to be the schools of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing savvy of North Carolina's education reforms drew
a national award last month. The National Alliance for Business
selected the North Carolina Partnership for Excellence as a
recipient of a distinguished performance award.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit partnership is an offshoot of North Carolina's
six-year effort to incorporate business practices in the classroom.
Shortly after he was elected governor in 1992, Jim Hunt met with
state business leaders, who complained that partnerships between
companies and schools had done little to improve student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders started anew in 1993, creating pilot projects in six
school districts, including Granville County. Using the Baldrige
criteria to judge results, school officials teamed up with local
corporations and local colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding, then doing
</P>
<P>
   In Granville County, an IBM official helped the superintendent
figure out how to make the district's budget process work more
smoothly. It involved the principles of individual schools taking
greater responsibility for deciding how much money they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool is that schools are empowered to do this,'' Davis
said. ``They are now fixing problems that I do not even know we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by improving student achievement, the state
Legislature began allocating funds in 1995 to expand the pilot
project. It has now spread to 45 school systems, which have
volunteered to incorporate business practices. The goal is to reach
all 116 systems by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina has taken such marvelous flight,'' said Chris
Harwell, a trainer for the Pinellas County school district who has
worked with North Carolina educators.
</P>
<P>
   Not all teachers embrace the new methods, not even in districts,
such as Granville County, where efforts have been under way the
longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This too shall pass _ that's the attitude among some
teachers,'' said Fitz. But for her, a return to tradition, where
teachers are the undisputed boss, would be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be a boss; I want to be a leader,'' Fitz
said. ``Listen to the difference. Which one sounds more appealing
to you?''

INDY'S BIG THREE REMINISCENT OF COWBOYS' TRIPLETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is in
commercials with Michael Jordan and has a cameo role with wide
receiver Marvin Harrison in an episode of ``The Jersey'', a
children's cable television series. Along with running back
Edgerrin James, Manning and Harrison are the toast of local sports
talk radio. ESPN is calling them ``Team 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   So at least they are getting the headlines, like a certain set
of triplets who've been the class of the 1990s. But before
comparing Manning, Harrison and James to the Cowboys' triumvirate
of Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith, Colts coach Jim
Mora says to take a good look at his fingers and then think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any Super Bowl rings yet. Those guys have
three,'' Mora said last week. ``Those guys with the Cowboys have
done this a long time. Our three guys are basically pups. To
compare us to them, uh, we need to have some success. That is
measured by what you do over a long period of time. You just can't
compare us to them until we've done something. We haven't won
anything yet, not even a division title.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but as the Colts (4-2) prepare to face the Cowboys (4-2) at
the RCA Dome today, notice how the new triplets look like the old
ones when the 1990s began: young, talented, and confident.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Beastie Boys rocking the Grammys, the Colts' three-man
band took home a trophy case full of NFL awards in September. In a
Week 3 victory against San Diego, Manning had a club-record 404
passing yards, two touchdown passes and one rushing TD, and was
selected the AFC offensive player of the week. James was NFL
offensive rookie of the month on the strength of 75 carries for 276
yards and two touchdowns. Harrison was AFC offensive player of the
month after he had 28 receptions for 422 yards with six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is third in the league in passing yards (1,679) and
second in touchdowns (13). Harrison is second in yards (709) and
second in receptions (45). James is third in rushing yards (520).
Hey, maybe they'll never win a Super Bowl. But at least the
foundation appears to be set to keep the Colts competitive for the
next decade and beyond, Miami Dolphins coach and AFC East rival
Jimmy Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've surrounded \RManning\S with a better supporting cast
than what I did in Dallas,'' said Johnson, who coached the original
triplets from 1989-93. ``Troy really struggled for the first couple
of years and really started to come on about his third year. But I
think Peyton has come on stronger than what Troy did.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning has started all of his 22 NFL games and has better stats
than Aikman had in his first 22 starts, including 1,653 more yards
passing and 22 more touchdown passes. Manning has thrown touchdowns
in 19 consecutive games, and on six occasions he has led the Colts'
offense to 20 points in a half.
</P>
<P>
   Colts offensive coordinator Tom Moore said Manning, son of
former New Orleans Saints great Archie Manning, ``is like a coach
on the field,'' because he is so astute with Moore's playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, however, credits his improvement this season to lessons
learned from his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year I'm doing a better job of throwing it to
different spots on the field,'' Manning said. ``You always try to
get the ball to your playmakers. But last year, I was just throwing
the ball to the outside receiver on the right or on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I'm using my layoffs better. I'm taking \Rtight
end\S Ken Dilger, who a lot of times may be the third read, or
Edgerrin James. When defenses see that, they can't just cover the
outside guys. They know they have to cover everybody.'' \Nsubheds:
The receiver Usually, Manning ends up throwing to Harrison. The
fourth-year pro from Syracuse is the go-to-guy for Moore, the
Pittsburgh Steelers' receivers coach when they had Lynn Swann and
John Stallworth. Moore was also offensive coordinator of a 1995
Detroit Lions team that was the first in NFL history to have two
wide receivers catch more than 100 passes each.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who missed the last four games of 1998 with a shoulder
injury, has started 18 games with Manning and caught 15 touchdown
passes. At 6-foot, 181 pounds, he is not as big as Irvin but he is
just as productive. He has four games of 100 or more yards
receiving this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' second-year receiver Jerome Pathon said, ``Peyton
and Marvin are one of the best tandems in the league. Everyone else
\Rother Colts receivers\S is just trying to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Manning describe his rapport with Harrison, and you'd
think it's Aikman talking about Irvin in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin and I have a bond, a feel that's hard to describe,''
Manning said. ``We go to dinner. We hang around. We spend extra
time on the practice field. Even when Marvin's the second or third
read, I know I can count on him to be open. If it is an 18-yard
route, I know he's going to go precisely 18 yards. He knows the
ball is going to be in the air before he turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison may get all the passes. But unlike Irvin, Harrison is
quiet and unassuming in the locker room. Outside the locker room,
he doesn't get the publicity that Manning and James get.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right,'' Harrison said. ``It's something I've been
living with all my life. Even coming out of Syracuse, \RPatriots
wide receiver\S Terry Glenn was at Ohio State. I was always
overshadowed. Now you've got Terry and Keyshawn Johnson in my
division. But I believe my time will come.'' \Nsubheds:The running
back
</P>
<P>
   James, whom general manager Bill Polian selected out of Miami
instead of former Texas back Ricky Williams, believes his time has
come. Like the Cowboys in Smith's early years, the Colts have been
a one-horse show. James is the only running back Manning has handed
off to this year. And with 149 carries, he is on pace to break Eric
Dickerson's team record of rushes in a season (388 in 1988).
</P>
<P>
   He has more rushing yards (520) than Smith had (319) in his
first six starts. Yet despite the early success, James, who has
lost two costly fumbles, said he knows he has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be like Terrell Davis or Michael Jordan,'' James
said. ``Right now, I'm just another guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And James, Harrison and Manning may be just like any other
threesome in the game. But somehow, you get the feeling that they
may be more, that the next great trio is in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look around the league over the past years,
there's always been a combination of quarterback, receiver and
running back,'' Harrison said. ``I think we have that here.''

COWBOYS SAY COLTS HAVE POTENTIAL TO FOLLOW THEIR TREK TO GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith wasn't thinking ``Triplets'' when he joined the
Cowboys in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman was coming off a rookie season in which he was 0-11
as a starter. Michael Irvin, who had appeared in 20 games (4-16) at
that point, brought 58 career receptions for slightly more than
1,000 yards into '90.
</P>
<P>
   Smith instead took note of what Barry Sanders was doing in
Detroit, what Neil Anderson was doing in Chicago and what Thurman
Thomas was doing in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the elite group that I wanted to be in. This was what
I myself wanted to do on a year-to-year basis,'' Smith said this
week. ``I wasn't even thinking of \Rhelping to create a triplets
concept on the Cowboys\S in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   While the comparison between ``Old Triplets'' and ``New
Triplets'' is inevitable with rookie running back Edgerrin James
joining second-year quarterback Peyton Manning and fourth-year wide
receiver Marvin Harrison in Indianapolis, where the Cowboys play
the Colts today, one fact remains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Indianapolis has some young players who remind a
lot of people of our offensive group back several years ago,''
Aikman said. ``And, yes, I think they've got the potential to be
that. But as soon as I say, `Yes, I think they do,' then I'm
implying that it's easy to do and that it just happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won Super Bowls in three of four seasons (1992-93,
'95); Aikman was a fourth-, fifth- and seventh-year NFL
quarterback. That means for the Indy Triplets to match what the
Dallas Triplets have done, Manning-Harris-James would have to win
Super Bowls in 2001, 2002 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a period of time ... that's the whole key,'' Smith said.
``That has been the unique thing about what Michael, Troy, myself
and this whole organization have been able to do. Over a 10-year
period, we've been fairly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I strive for as an individual. I knew from Day One
that I'd rather average a certain amout of yards over a long period
of time than go out and have one great year and eight to 10
mediocre years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency is what we've strived for. I think we've been able
to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 87-59 (.596) with Aikman as the starting
quarterback, 98-62 (.613) including postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who is the oldest Cowboys' Triplet at 33, now faces a
career decision about his future since an examination for an Oct.
10 spinal contusion revealed a genetic narrowing of the spinal
canal called cervical stenosis. The Cowboys are 36-11 in games in
which Irvin has 100 yards or more receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 48-10 when Smith rushed for 100 yards or more in
a game, 55-10 including the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And when Irvin and Smith both eclipse the 100-yard mark in the
same game, the Cowboys are 20-0, 23-0 including the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   While comparisons among sports groups or individuals generally
are unfair for both sides, Aikman was able to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``With Manning coming in last year and showing what he already
has shown, and with James being a top rookie and Harrison being
very productive ... the comparison is probably a little more valid
in this case.''

HOLLYWOOD ZEN: PHIL JACKSON'S COACHING YEN TAKES HIM TO LA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Richie Whitt 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``To: clashingegos &LR; WHATAWASTE.com(Los Angeles
Lakers)''
</P>
<P>
   Turn down your Walkmans, turn over your Pokemons and tune in
your new coach, Phil Jackson. He owns eight rings, a spiritual
grasp of the mysterious Triangle, inner peace from Zen Buddhism and
a vision of depth in bubble wrap. The only things deep about you
are your pockets and your trouble. While you were holding your own
Fight Club the last two seasons, the less-talented Utah Jazz and
San Antonio Spurs made you their personal BackSweep Boys. So
please, listen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't get their attention,'' said former Lakers star
Magic Johnson, ``nobody will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To: den o'zen &LR; WAYOUTTHERE.net(Phil Jackson)''
</P>
<P>
   You certain that Eight Isn't Enough? And, isn't it kinda creepy
that you're working for two Jerry's again? Whatever, don't go to LA
expecting a smooth Boyz II Men brainwash. These kids have scars
from Shaq being jealous of Kobe's fans, Kobe being envious of
Shaq's money, owner Jerry going over president Jerry's head to sign
Dennis, Del getting fired, Dennis getting fired, Kurt getting
fired, and a dysfunctional unit with more cliques than a high
school cafeteria. Be patient. It will take time for your wacky
wisdom to penetrate the cell phones and hard heads of stars who
would rather be leading scorer than leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll have to go to their Web pages and e-mail them,''
joked Jackson, who took over the Lakers on June 16 after a one-year
coaching hiatus preceded by him walking away from the most
successful sports dynasty of the 1990s. ``I'd say the key word here
isn't `sacrifice,' but `submit.' These players are going to have to
change not only the way they play the game but also the way they
approach it. They've tried to win with `me'; now, we're going to
try as `we'.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel Jackson, meet the Hollywood Squares.
</P>
<P>
   While arguably the NBA's most-talented team _ with All-Stars
Kobe Bryant out front, Glen Rice on the wing and Shaquille O'Neal
in the middle _ unraveled in a four-game sweep to the
eventual-champion San Antonio Spurs last spring, Phillip D. Jackson
was riding his Harley, fly-fishing in Alaska and stumping for close
friend, former teammate and presidential candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year removed from his second three-peat with the Chicago
Bulls, already one of the league's 10 greatest coaches, with the
NBA's best winning percentage in the regular season (73.8, 545-193)
and playoffs (73.0, 111-41), and owner of eight championship rings,
the 54-year-old has nowhere to go but down.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, have his Jackson Five starting lineup of
motivation, beginning with a five-year, $30 million contract from
owner Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the opportunity to finally coach a dominant center
in O'Neal, and the challenge to mature the adolescent,
underachieving Lakers, whom Jackson said made him ``cringe'' with
their stagnant offense and late-game mental collapses in the '99
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major limitation is their attention span,'' Jackson said.
``It comes from too much rap music and agents whispering in their
ears. We've got to develop interlocking components of compassion
and selflessness to find peace. And that's difficult with these
kids, because their focal points last about as long a TV
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also is back to erase that little stigma at the bottom
of his bio. It's written in invisible ink, but screams out like a
blood-curdling Halloween victim: ``Never won a championship without
Michael Jordan!''
</P>
<P>
   He, like former Jordan sidekick Scottie Pippen, shrugs off the
asterisk though those close to him say it eats at Jackson like that
upstairs leaky faucet at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil wants to prove he can win without Michael, sure,'' said
Charley Rosen, Jackson's close friend of 26 years. ``You betcha
it's a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there is the inevitable urge. No matter how many
times Jackson meditates on his black pillow, he is and always will
be a hoops junkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the Zen thing about being in the hills and
breathing fresh air,'' said veteran guard Ron Harper, signed as a
liaison between old Bulls and new Lakers. ``But Phil can do that
being retired. The thing about him is he loves coaching basketball,
being in the gym. He's a coach first. All the psychological stuff
comes later.'' \Nsubheds:Now and Zen As a player, Jackson was a
crafty 6-foot-8 forward nicknamed ``Bones'' who butted heads with
Boston Celtics-turned-Mavericks coach Don Nelson for the New York
Knicks' championship teams in '70 and '73.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, he exudes the aura of a man who knows something you
don't, and is so intellectually and spiritually superior you don't
even dare ask him about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes Phil,'' whispered the teen-ager in a No. 8 Bryant
jersey to his buddy in a No. 32 O'Neal jersey before a recent
exhibition game at the San Diego Sports Arena. ``Dude, he's ... the
... man.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a rowdy class coming to order at the arrival of their
teacher, fans who were only seconds earlier screaming wildly for
player autographs suddenly grew silent. It was an eerie,
fascinatingly reverent treatment usually reserved for serial
killers or priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to teach us to respect him,'' O'Neal said.
``That came automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lakers president Jerry West, ``He'll speed up our mentality
and our maturity. He's one of the most intellectually stimulating
people I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Deer Lodge, Mont., to Pentecostal ministers, Jackson
lived in the basement of a church and didn't go to his first movie
until he was 17. While an All-American at North Dakota, he turned
on to Zen Buddhism through his brother Joe, who was studying
psychology at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While learning basketball from coaches Red Holzman with the
Knicks, Jackson lived in the loft of an auto repair shop in order
to learn from the Zen owner, Hakin, seeking enlightenment through
meditation and intuition rather than in scripture. While playing
for the Knicks he took yoga classes, studied the teachings of the
Lakota Sioux and often retreated to the Rangers hockey locker room
to meditate for 45 minutes before Knicks games.
</P>
<P>
   As coach of the Bulls from '90-98, Jackson decorated his office
with spiritual trinkets including a bear claw necklace and the
middle feather from an owl. He preached oneness over one-on-one,
often mixed in clips from The Wizard of Oz or Full Metal Jacket
into game film, wore Grateful Dead T-shirts to workouts and began
and ended each practice with a sacred circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to life than basketball,'' Jackson wrote in his
book, Sacred Hoops. ``And there's more to basketball than
basketball. It's not focusing on winning or losing, just on what's
happening at this very instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Said veteran John Salley, who played for Jackson in Chicago in
1995-96 and signed with the Lakers this past off-season, ``One
night we'd lose a game, the next day we're sitting on a pillow
holding hands. And you know what, there wasn't one smirk in the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing purple-framed glasses and sipping iced tea before an
exhibition game at The Great Western Forum, Jackson claimed his
one-year absence from nightly game tension and daily pressure
dealing with Jerrys Reinsdorf and Krause has re-booted his energy
and enthusiasm. He's building a 6,000-square-foot home on the beach
in Santa Monica, Calif., and promised his wife, June, not to fall
into the reclusive traps that led to stress-related gout and
problems with his thyroid, kidney and liver in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life became pretty much just basketball,'' Jackson said of
his decade with the Bulls. ``And even though I had my reading and
other interests, to have that down time to protect myself I
excluded people even in my own family life. I've made some personal
goals here to be with people, to get out more. Get on my bike, my
Porsche, my motorcycle, go to concerts. Don't wall off people and
be defensive, because they can be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Triangle offense to install and new personalities to
learn during training camp, Jackson said he hasn't yet opened up
personally or begun to deliver the Zen tactics that became his
Bulls legacy. In Chicago he often gave players books to read on
long trips, once offering an angry Pippen author Langston Hughes'
Ways of the White Folks and Beavis and Butthead to Stacey King.
\Nsubheds:Livin' L.A. Vida Loco It's going to take more than
Jackson quoting Ghalib (''For the raindrop, joy is entering the
river'') or Rudyard Kipling (''The strength of the pack is the
wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack'') to mesh L.A.'s
talented five fingers into a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's 31-19 record, Del Harris, Dennis Rodman and
Kurt Rambis each failed to survive with the team and O'Neal was so
peeved at Bryant after the Game 4 loss to the Spurs in the Western
Semifinals that he wouldn't join the post-game huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years we've had incidents and scenarios and
personalities that have clashed,'' guard Rick Fox said.
``Everything seemed to be a fight against ourselves. It was
sickening. For now, that's all stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The healing has begun. So, more importantly, has the learning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shocked Lakers management and surprised Bryant by
attending his 21st birthday party Aug. 23. O'Neal now refers to
Bryant as his ``little brother'' and Jackson said he's seen no
signs of outward jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Phil will have to be a mediator,'' said Bryant,
sidelined until the end of November with a broken right hand. ``I
don't see any problems between the two of us, really. Some of it
was inevitable. We both put ourselves before the team and learned a
hard lesson from it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has embraced Jackson's spookiness and system. He's
co-existed with Bryant, tried to think ``pass-first'' in the
Triangle and, incredibly, managed to somehow become an even worse
free-throw shooter (35.3 percent in the preseason compared to 54
percent last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a good free-throw shooter, but everything else I do is
perfect,'' O'Neal said. ``Whatever Phil wants me to do, I'll do it.
I don't want to ruin his perfect resume. I have an array of passes
that you haven't seen before that will make the difference in my
game this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said West: ``Shaq will be the MVP this season. He's the happiest
I have seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   With $50 million committed to his top six players, Jackson
predicts 60 victories in the regular season while also
acknowledging pressure to get the Lakers back to the Finals for the
first time since '91. Sensing the power struggle between the
27-year-old O'Neal and 21-year-old Bryant, he ordered new pre-game
warm-ups with bland white pants and jackets void of players' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big gulp,'' Jackson said of the lack of direction.
``There's some leadership that has to be developed here. It's a
maturation point. It's a responsibility that each of them has.''
</P>
<P>
   But the burden to teach the Lakers how to play defense, and how
not to bog down on offense in crunch time, is all on Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   So how did he begin Basketball Maturation 101? His first two
training camp practices in Santa Barbara included no ball or any
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule No. 1 is that there is one ball and five players,''
Harper said. ``It's called sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 24 options off one pass, there are no Cliffs
Notes to Jackson's Triangle offense that Michael Jordan derisively
called ``the equal opportunity system'' when introduced to it in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is ideal for this offense, but he's got to get in his
head that he's a feeder first, then a scorer,'' said Triangle
innovator and former Bulls-turned-Lakers assistant Tex Winter. ``We
don't have Michael, but we've got more overall talent here than we
had in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``When it's running smoothly, it's like a five-man
tai chi where nobody is thinking. Where playground ball is like
John Coltrane and jazz music, the Triangle is more like Mozart and
Bach.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, however, Jackson said the key change in L.A. will
be on defense. After a week of practice, he assessed that the
Lakers ``have no clue'' about what kind of intensity it takes to
play ``honest defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was that guys didn't want to commit to being
on the same page, but more that we never really had a page to
follow,'' guard Derek Fisher said. ``Now we've got a handbook we
know works.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson realizes his team will be far from polished by the time
the Lakers debut in the new $400 million glass-and-steel downtown
Staples Center Wednesday against the Vancouver Grizzlies. Bryant is
out, Buss was unwilling to pay the price to acquire Pippen, it took
the Bulls a year-and-a-half to master the nuances of the Triangle,
and 36-year-old former Maverick A.C. Green or undersized Robert
Horry will be the starting power forward. (Jackson only winks and
smiles when asked about a possible return of Rodman).
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe by December we can judge whether they are going to be
champions or not,'' said Jackson, who has brought in veterans
Harper, Salley and Green and former Bulls assistants Winter, Frank
Hamblen and Jim Cleamons to smooth the transition. ``But these guys
have been in remedial reading for a month. Now we're in junior high
school and then they'll get their secondary education in pro
basketball. We have to teach them new skills. They have to learn a
new system and we have to correct bad habits.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Jackson's memory of the past, grasp of the present,
vision of the future and awareness of all planes in between, he
sees winning as a matter of ``when'' rather than ``if.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in being the savior has been presented to me,'' Jackson
said. ``It's a weird feeling to have, but a good one. I came here
to win a championship and I cannot expect anything less.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Lakers may have failed chemistry. But if they can master
Phil-osophy and strategic geometry, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of chaos, we'll build a team and a family,'' former
Mavericks coach Cleamons said. ``If our marquee players are willing
to sacrifice their egos, this can be a dominant team. The talent
has always been here. Now they've got direction.''

POLIAN IS THE OLD GUY DIRECTING THE YOUTH MOVEMENT IN INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There is something special here, and it has
nothing to do with the $8 million renovations done to the Colts'
practice facilities. Walk into the plush locker room and see the
youth and one might think this is what the Cowboys locker room must
have looked like in 1991: Talented, but still unsure of how good
they'll be, and not taking life so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   There is Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, whose locker is among
the linemen's lockers, joking around with tackle Adam Meadows.
There is defensive tackle Bernard Whittington and tight end Marcus
Pollard taking note of the amount of media around their cubicles.
There is running back Edgerrin James, telling you that his mom and
Deion Sanders' mom talk on the phone frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, youth is good. But to know why the 4-2 Colts have the
potential to be one of the great teams for years to come, one must
find the old guy with the big office. It's a short walk outside the
locker room, around the corner past the huge posters of Lenny Moore
and Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Colts president Bill Polian, 56, has a winning resume as thick
as his Bronx accent. He is unafraid to make the big deal that could
make a mediocre team average, or an average team great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is aggressive,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``One of his
best qualities is that when he makes a decision, he is like, `Let's
go forward.' He's not afraid to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This team became a winner the day \Rteam owner\S Mr. \RJim\S
Irsay decided to hire Bill Polian,'' said Colts linebacker
Cornelius Bennett, who has also played for the Bills and Falcons
after being originally drafted by the Colts in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In Polian's first major job, as general manager of the Buffalo
Bills from 1984-92, he drafted or signed 13 players who have
combined to make 31 Pro Bowl appearances. One of those players, of
course, was Bennett, whom Polian acquired from the Colts as part of
the three-way Eric Dickerson deal in 1987 involving the Rams and
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Polian became general manager of the expansion Carolina
Panthers. And with a combination of free agents and draft choices,
the Panthers knocked off the Cowboys in the 1996 divisional
playoffs to make the NFC Championship Game. Eight players drafted
or signed by Polian have combined to make 13 Pro Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Polian came to Indianapolis in December 1997, as the Colts were
finishing a 3-13 season. In 21 months, he has hired a new coaching
staff and brought over much of his scouting department from
Carolina to help with personnel decisions. On the field, only 12
players remain from his first day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   He has made three deals that could have blown up in his face:
Drafting Peyton Manning over Ryan Leaf. Chasing off Pro Bowl
running back Marshall Faulk. And taking running back Edgerrin James
over Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Polian looks smart. Leaf, who had problems on and off
the field in 1998, hasn't played a down in 1999 and could wind up
in NFL Europe. Faulk is having a nice season in St. Louis, but his
replacement, James, has more rushing yards (520 to 403) and
touchdowns (4 to 0) than Williams, who has been slowed of his
rookie season injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about what people think about the decisions we
make,'' said Polian as he leaned back in the big leather chair in
his office. ``Sometimes, it is out of your hands. One of the best
picks I thought we ever made in Carolina was \Rrunning back\S Tim
Biakabutuka. Now, up until this season, he was viewed by the media
and some in that organization as a failure. He's a great player,
but he's been injured. You just can't control those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Polian has had better luck with the situation in Indianapolis, a
situation he compares to the one he had in Buffalo. ``We had to
rebuild both clubs from scratch,'' he said. ``The only difference
is the salary cap.''
</P>
<P>
   He has built the Colts with a mix of youth and experience. Ten
of the 11 starters on offense have not been in the league more than
four years. Fifth-year tight end Ken Dilger, 28, is the old man of
the unit. On defense, 10 of the 11 starters have been in the league
at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Polian is confident that the mix, as long as Manning, James, and
wide receiver Marvin Harrison remain the key ingredients, will
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we on schedule? Yeah,'' Polian said. ``Are we there yet?
No, not by a long shot. But we'll get there. I'm sure of that.''

   Seattle's Holmgren makes his first return to Green Bay
 &LR; subheds:SPOTLIGHT: Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren On ``Monday Night
Football,'' Mike Holmgren will return to Green Bay for the first
time since he left there last winter to takeover as coach and
general manager of the Seahawks. Here is a question-and-answer
session on how Holmgren feels about the club he led to consecutive
Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You left because you had a chance to be a general manager.
How hard was it to leave Green Bay?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was very difficult. My two youngest daughters grew up
there, graduated from high school there. We made life-long
associations there. \RLeaving\S was more of a business decision
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you expect the Green Bay fans to react to your return?
</P>
<P>
   A: They'll root for Green Bay. I'm no longer a Green Bay Packer.
They are rooting hard now for \Rhead coach\S Ray \RRhodes\S. At
\Rformer defensive coordinator\S Fritz's \RShurmur's\S funeral, I
saw some of the players, most of the players that were highly
critical of me. And it went OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big would a win against your old team be?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you can compete with the Green Bay Packers and the top
teams in the league, then you can kind of measure where your team
is. We're too early in this thing to say we've arrived. But again,
I'll equate it to when we \Rthe Packers\S beat San Francisco in
that game in 1995. That really put a stamp on our team and that was
a launching point for us. This is too early for that but it
certainly would be something.''  &LR; subheds:NFC NOTES  &LR; subheds:Moss'
hero  &LR; agatea:Even though his team finally broke through offensively
by scoring 40 points against the 49ers last week, Vikings wide
receiver Randy Moss still isn't sold on Vikings offensive
coordinator Ray Sherman. When asked last week if Sherman was a hero
in the wake of the 49ers game, Moss said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he a hero? No. I think if we can call anybody a hero, it
would be Jeff George. But as far as Ray Sherman being a hero, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RSherman's\S just a coach, man,'' Moss said as his team
prepared to face the Broncos today. ``Our hero is gone. Our hero is
down in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss was speaking of former Vikings offensive coordinator Brian
Billick, who helped guide the club to an NFL record 556 points last
year.  &LR; subheds:Grass or turf  &LR; agatea:It is the last day of October
and the undefeated St. Louis Rams will be playing their first game
on grass this season when they play the Tennessee Titans. Will the
surface affect the club's undersized defense and quick,
skill-position players on offense? ``I don't think it makes one bit
of difference,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil said. ``In fact, I asked
them, `if we went out and practiced three days, would you rather
practice inside on AstroTurf or outside on grass?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said they'd rather practice on the natural grass,''
Vermeil said. ``Because it makes them feel better, the bumps and
bruises and everything else.''  &LR; subheds:The said, sad, sad Saints
 &LR; agatea:Maybe rookie Saints running back Ricky Williams has been
hit in the head too many times. Despite a 1-5 start, Williams
thinks the Saints will make the playoffs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll finish the season with a winning record,''
Williams said. ``I think we'll make the playoffs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints offensive lineman Willie Roaf, meanwhile, was much more
realistic about the Saints' situation. ``It doesn't look like \Rthe
end of the tunnel\S is in sight right now,'' Roaf said. ``It can't
get any worse than it is right now. And the thing is, we've got a
lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Saints coach Mike Ditka acknowledged that he might be
fired after the season.
</P>
<P>
   It is, ``a possibility,'' Ditka said. ``I don't control that.''
 &LR; subheds:Briefly  &LR; agatea:Former 49ers great Joe Montana, who was
nominated last week for induction into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame, was asked if he thought 49ers quarterback Steve Young should
retire because of his concussions. ``It's hard to tell any athlete
what to do, but when you start looking at the brain, you have to
think about going out. He's had a long, great career.'' It's
interesting to note that Montana admitted Young has had a, ``great
career,'' for the two have barely spoken to each other since Young
replaced Montana at the beginning of the decade. ... Reggie White,
who had his number retired by the Packers this month, has told
safety LeRoy Butler that he might try for a comeback next season.
``Me and him have talked about it,'' Butler said. ``He said,
`LeRoy, I've been thinking about coming back.' ''  &LR; subheds:AFC
NOTES Brotherly love  &LR; agatea:Despite their different last names,
Broncos cornerback Dale Carter, 29, and Vikings wide receiver Jake
Reed, 32, are brothers. Both have the same mother and father. Why
the difference in the last name? Reed was born before their parents
married and kept his mother's maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   They'll face each other for the third time. The last time, in a
1996 game, Reed says Carter didn't play fair.
</P>
<P>
   He tickled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running down the field and \RDale\S puts his fingers in my
side trying to tickle me as I'm running the route,'' Reed said of
Carter, who was then a cornerback with the Chiefs. ``I kind of hate
to say this, but I don't really like playing against Dale. We have
a lot of fun, but I think he likes to play around a lot with me out
on the field. I try to be more serious about the game, and he's
trying to get me off my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter: ``I'm going to pop him. Nah, I'm not going to try
to hurt my brother. I'm not going to purposely go out and let him
beat me, and he's not going to let me get the best of him. Whatever
happens, happens, and we just laugh about it after.''  &LR; subheds:Joy
to Stingley's heart  &LR; agatea:The Jets signed Derek Stingley to their
practice squad last week. Stingley, 28, is the son of former
Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley, who was paralyzed from the
neck down after he was hit by Oakland's Jack Tatum in a 1977
preseason game. Derek Stingley, who was 7 at the time of his
father's injury, has played Arena Football the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, very elated,'' said Darryl Stingley about his
son getting a chance to play in the NFL. ``Naturally, this elation
was brought about because most people are aware of what happened to
me some 21 years ago. Derek was a very young kid then.''
</P>
<P>
   Stingley, in a conference call with the local media, was asked
whether he thought Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin (spinal
condition) and 49ers quarterback Steve Young (concussion) should
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who ever played the game are true warriors,''
Stingley said. ``As long as you can breathe, you think you have an
opportunity to go out and play. But I think these guys ought to use
a lot of common sense. They've both had great careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take a logical approach and say, `I had a great time
doing it. I had a great career. Now it's time to go in another
direction, be with family, friends and do something for your
community.''  &LR; subheds:Gogan by the bay  &LR; agatea:When the Dolphins
play the Raiders today, Miami guard Kevin Gogan returns to the Bay
Area for the first time since the 49ers traded him last spring for
salary cap relief. At least that's the reason Gogan was given, but
Gogan isn't buying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really understand the whole deal behind it,'' he
said. ``I understand the team was $25 million over the cap, but
it's not like dumping Kevin Gogan is going to relieve $1.9 million.
They saved $400,000 with me, which is pennies under the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogan said he didn't think 49ers GM Bill Walsh or offensive line
coach Bobb McKittrick liked him, though he respected McKittrick for
his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobb never lied to me, he always told me he didn't like me,''
Gogan said. ``I respect Bobb for telling me the truth. Bobb hated
me and my 300-pound body.''  &LR; subheds:Games of note  &LR; agatea:Dolphins
at Raiders: The Dolphins are going to start Damon Huard in place of
the injured Dan Marino. And you know Raiders cornerbacks Eric Allen
and Charles Woodson are daring Huard to throw in their directions.
Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon (hand) is hurting, but the game's
best rushing offense should be enough for a minor upset. Raiders
20, Dolphins 16
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks at Packers: Mike Holmgren comes back for a ``Monday
Night Football'' visit to the town in which he has a street named
after him. Problem is, Holmgren's team isn't quite ready for Prime
Time yet, and after the game, Holmgren will wish he was still a
Packer. Packers 35, Seahawks 14
</P>
<P>
   Rams at Titans: This is the Rams' first game on grass and so
perhaps their quickness on offense could suffer. The Titans have
already handed the Jaguars their only loss and would love to do the
same thing to the Rams. Another minor upset in the making. Titans
20, Rams 17

 &HT;    Cubs' tradition wins over Baylor
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Baylor has accepted an offer to become manager of the
Chicago Cubs, a hiring that will be official today. Baylor agreed
to a four-year deal worth $5.2 million, for an average of $1.3
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the managing ranks after a season as hitting coach
for the Braves. Baylor was fired from the Colorado Rockies last
year after managing them for their first six years and taking them
to the playoffs in 1995 _ the fastest any expansion team has
reached the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor also considered offers from Anaheim and Milwaukee, which
were competitive with the Cubs in money and length of contract, but
the lure of working for the storied Cubs and staying in the
National League was too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not that many opportunities you have to manage the
Braves, the Yankees, the Cubs, the Dodgers,'' Baylor said Saturday.
``It's a great move for me to make. I've been in the league now for
six years as a manager and (two) as a coach. I know the league now.
In the American League, I don't know as much, watching the
slugfests over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who played his entire 19-year major-league career in the
AL, has his strongest ties in that league with the Angels, with
whom he won the MVP award in 1979 among his six seasons there. He
makes his offseason home in La Quinta, Calif. But Baylor didn't
feel comfortable with the state of the Angels organization when
they made their offer on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an awkward feeling,'' Baylor said. ``You're negotiating
with the president of the team, not the general manager. It's for
sale, too. Too many variables. The stability of the Cubs and
Wrigley Field won me over.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians general manager John Hart wanted to interview Baylor,
but he never seriously considered that job.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs fired manager Jim Riggleman after they finished last in
the NL Central with the third-worst record in baseball (67-95),
ahead of only the Marlins (64-98) and Twins (63-97). This came on
the heels of a 1998 NL wild-card berth in a season highlighted by
Sammy Sosa's MVP award and 66 home runs in his chase with Mark
McGwire and the rise to stardom of pitcher Kerry Wood.Baylor's
impact on Braves hitters was undeniable. Chipper Jones, a switch
hitter, credits Baylor with helping him change his approach from
the right side on his way to hitting a career-high 45 homers and
setting the stage for winning this year's NL MVP.

BEING HARDHEADED ISN'T ALWAYS SAFE

By DEION SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders' column, as told to staff
writer Clarence E. Hill Jr., will appear in the ``Fort Worth
Star-Telegram'' every week during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever misplaced a set of keys? An important document? A
pair of glasses? Or forgot where you parked your car at the
shopping mall?
</P>
<P>
   These things happen on a regular basis. I would even understand
if you forgot to pick up your child from school, practice or a
friend's house, because my momma did so when I was a shorty.
</P>
<P>
   But how could you forget where you are on a Sunday afternoon
around 12:30. I don't drink, smoke or get high, so what's the
excuse? Let me share with you the experience of the second
concussion of my 11-year NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta. I caught a punt off a bounce during a game in 1990. I
shook two guys but the second one stuck his arm out and hit me on
the top of my helmet.
</P>
<P>
   I ran for about 5 more yards and sort of fainted with no one
close to make the tackle. It was hilarious to everyone on the
sideline but me. I probably would have laughed also if I had known
what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion against Washington on Sunday was different.] I
was so hyped up to play this game for many reasons, and I knew the
Lord would allow me to make a big play, especially after certain
players spoke against me.
</P>
<P>
   I was back speaking to the Lord as I always do when I'm waiting
for a punt on fourth down. I was saying things such as: ``Use me,
Lord; use me right now, Lord. I'll give you the glory Lord. I'll
praise you.'' That's what I'm saying when you see me dancing around
waiting to receive the punt.
</P>
<P>
   I fielded this punt as I would any other. I danced by one
defender and spun in the middle of field, which is a big no-no as a
punt returner. I recall getting hit head-on then I saw a blur of
assorted colors. I then held my hands up hoping one of my teammates
would help me as usual because this time I literally couldn't help
myself up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon as they helped me, I spotted trainer Jim Maurer half way on
the field so that told me which way to go. They sat me down and
peppered me with questions to see if I was OK. I tried my best to
dance around the questions, but I couldn't tell you what they asked
me.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall going in the locker room or taking X-rays, but
slowly I'm starting to come back. Dr. Z \RJ.R. Zamorano\S stayed
inside and continued the questions, which I tried to avoid. I was
flunking like I flunked honors Algebra in high school. He said,
``This is it for you today, my man.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime I felt like I was OK. I still didn't recall what
happened, but I was having no problems recognizing and remembering
anyone. I knew where I was, and I knew I badly wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   I told Emmitt Smith what I was going to do. I waited until
everyone was gone back out, and I started to pray and pray and get
loose. Michael Irvin had come in with his son to eat some hot dogs
and clown me. He was laughing as hard as he could about the
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   I told him to come out and watch me. But he just kept laughing.
I said, ``Don't come out, but listen to the roar of the fans in a
minute.'' I didn't know what was going on the first few plays. And
my neck was killing me.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a few minutes later came the punt return. I did my
prayer and the Lord answered them. You know I wanted to dance when
I got the end zone, and I'm sure everybody expected me to do
something, especially considering all the trash talking. But the
Lord made this possible. He allowed me to come back and make a big
play for the team.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the battle, I must tell you it's hard to make
decisions. I was only thinking about the team. I was out there for
my team and because of my intense competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, my mother was in the luxury box crying,
and my wife and kids were worried sick.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I don't know if I did the right thing. But I have
faith in the Lord. I believe he will always take care of me and
point me in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   I put the decision in his hands. And as always, whatever he
touches turns out right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.'' _
Philippians 4:13
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Jesus loves you! Ask Deion ``E-mail your questions to
cehill\Nstar-telegram.com. This week's question:'' You've played in
a number of different cities and media markets: Atlanta, San
Francisco and Cincinnati. How does playing here compare? ``DS: What
trips me out most about this place is the media. That's probably
the strangest thing because the Cowboys are it down here. With
apologies to the Rangers and Stars, the Cowboys are the biggest
attraction down here by far. But the media down here constantly try
to tear us down over and over. That's what baffles me.''

 &HT;    Players find it easier to play after service
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For Payne and in pain. It's been that kind of a
gut-wrenching week.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a week for Tiger Woods to tear up Champions Golf Club
and be torn up emotionally. On his way to a seventh PGA Tour win in
1999, Woods has a three-stroke lead in the $5 million Tour
Championship at 13-under-par 200.
</P>
<P>
   No other play
</P>
<P>
   er has matched Woods on the leaderboard, but after Friday's
gut-wrenching services in Orlando for Payne Stewart, they all
seemed rejuvenated during 27 sometimes rainy holes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind was a lot more at ease today than it was any time
during this week,'' Woods said, ``because it was nice to finally
put an end to it and have some kind of resolve and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Woods said ``I just lost it and started bawling'' when
Tracey Stewart, Payne's wife, walked through the line of PGA Tour
players at the service and grabbed his hand, he channeled the
strength she displayed as a way of handling the
</P>
<P>
   mental hurdles of a return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you, seeing Tracey get up there and speak
from the heart,'' Woods said, ``if she can have that kind of
strength, then we can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be pretty difficult to bet against Woods finishing off
the $900,000 win today. In his previous 11 times with at least a
share of the lead after 54 holes, Woods has won 10 times and on 10
straight occasions. With the American Express Invitational in Spain
remaining next week, the 23-year-old Woods is trying to equal
Johnny Miller's record of eight PGA Tour wins in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods wins today, including the Deutsche Bank Open in Germany
in May, it would be seven victories in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet numbers to be sure for everyone's player of the year, but
this one, following the emotional turmoil from Stewart's death in a
bizarre plane crash Monday, won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do win tomorrow, the victory probably will be a nice
thing to feel, but I don't think I'll feel quite as high just
because of what went on this week,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III, who had led Woods by a stroke
through the 27 holes that were played prior to Friday's suspension,
played 27 more Saturday and is still at 7-under par, but now trails
Woods by six shots.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry, who is second at 10-under 203, wore a piece of
plaid fabric on his cap, in addition to a black ribbon, in memory
of Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is truly going to be missed,'' said Perry, who met Stewart
when he was first on tour, in 1986. ``I think he's going to change
a lot of people's lives because of what happened. I know he's going
to change mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 29 players, the PGA Tour's top moneywinners, felt a
similar flood of relief Saturday following formal funeral service
for Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like going to Orlando yesterday gave everybody a
little bit of closure,'' said Tom Lehman. ``It was a little easier
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also felt a rush of strength from at least finally seeing
Tracey Stewart and her children, Chelsea and Aaron. Watching from
Houston, unable to comfort those grieving in Orlando, brought it's
own type of mental burden. On Friday he told Tracey how much his
friendship with the 1999 U.S. Open champion and fellow Ryder cup
teammate had grown in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I only wish I had a chance to tell him how much of a
friend he was,''' Sutton said. ``She said, `He's right here. Just
tell him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sutton felt even more burdened at having to play the
first round immediately after Thursday's emotional ceremony at
Champions, even Saturday his thoughts remained scattered. When his
score was added up afterward and it totaled 64, Sutton said,
``Really? I don't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little better leaving there,'' said Stuart Appleby,
who lost his wife in a car accident 15 months ago, ``but it's very
hard switching to trying to tear it up on the golf course after
being so sorrowful. We're all just really playing for Payne this
week.''

 &HT;    TOUR NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    Tiger is still in charge
 &HT;    Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Well, one thing is certain. Tiger Woods obviously did
no serious damage through his botched Sergio Garcia impersonation
Thursday in the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of treatment following a shot where Woods tried
to hit through a fist-sized rock and suffered a ``stinger'' in his
neck and shoulder, Woods emerged healthy enough Saturday to start
sprinting away from the field, taking a three-stroke lead at
13-under par 200 entering today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would make the same decision if facing the shot
again, Woods said, drawing laughter, ``I'd do it differently. I'd
hit it (the rock) harder and get the ball back to the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said his left shoulder stiffened somewhat at the end of
Saturday's 27 holes, but moreso because Houston's warm, muggy
weather changed from rain, to cool and breezy in a matter of
moments at mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we didn't have was an ark go through No. 8,''
said Woods. ``I think we had everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   With such an incredible run this year _ he's gunning for a
seventh win in his last 10 starts today _ Woods was asked to
measure whether he can possibly improve on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could predict the future, then I'd be able to answer that
question, but I can tell you this,'' said Woods, who has won more
than $4.7 million this year. ``I will continue to work just as hard
as I have been. I've been very patient with the changes I've made
in my golf swing. . .. How much better can I get? Only time will
tell . . Hopefully, I'll continue to get better. Everybody's goal
out here is to improve each and every year, and so far I've been
able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Orlando for the Stewart funeral, Woods picked up a
replacement 60-degree wedge for the one gouged by the rock shot
Thursday. ``It was not USGA-legal, that's for sure,'' Woods said. .
. .David Duval is tied for 10th at 5-under, eight shots behind
Woods. . . Canadian Mike Weir is 29th at 4-over-par 217. . . Hal
Sutton jumped from a tie for 23rd to a tie for fourth. . . Andy
Martinez, Lehman's caddie, wore a Payne Stewart-type cap as a
tribute.

 &HT;    Award's principles put quality in schools
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOVALL, N.C. _ Out here amid the trailer homes and rusty-roof
barns, where education was headed down a rutted road to mediocrity,
lessons from corporate America are rejuvenating Stovall-Shaw
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   School districts across the country are putting to work in
classrooms successful methods from the corporate world. Some of the
most dramatic changes are happening here in North Carolina in such
unlikely places as Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary school looks ordinary. It's been around for 50
years, a red-brick fixture in rural, blue-collar Granville County,
just south of the Virginia state line. Yellow buses park out front.
A crackly voice from the public address system echoes through the
main hallway, which, like most of the building, has the personality
of apple butter on toast. Walls are beige, the floor brown.
</P>
<P>
   But in Anne Fitz's sixth-grade classroom, the students are fixed
on Tamsin Norris. The 11-year-old is wandering around with her eyes
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find me where my voice is,'' Fitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamsin's classmates giggle as she bumps into desks. When she
nears the teacher, the game ends. Then the lesson begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the one thing that she lacked?'' Fitz asked, walking
among the two dozen students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vision,'' they said. ``Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is vision?'' asked Fitz, making a point that symbolizes
the importance of goal-setting and other business principles in
North Carolina's education reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can achieve your goals if you can envision what they look
like and see how to get there,'' said Fitz, 36, a teacher for 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the business world, administrators and teachers
at Stovall-Shaw Elementary set goals to solve problems ranging from
bathroom cleanliness to student attendance. They use flow charts to
prepare lesson plans and to organize how students go from their
classrooms to the gymnasium for physical education.
</P>
<P>
   Empowering students
</P>
<P>
   Fitz's students started the school year by debating and writing
a vision statement. Each student signed it, and Fitz posted it on
the dark green chalkboard at the front of the cramped classroom.
Students can revise it at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it reads: ``We will show respect, cooperation, and
acceptance of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is part of Fitz's belief in empowering students to
think and act on their own. It's also the mantra of total quality
management, a concept from the corporate world finding a place in
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, principals and teachers who use business
techniques to organize their schools and classrooms report higher
standardized test scores, better attendance and less disruption and
violence among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fundamentally changing the way we do business by
focusing on customer service,'' said Mike Ward, sounding more like
a salesman than the North Carolina superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
   In public education, Ward said, the customers include students,
parents, local governing boards and state legislatures that are
dole out tax dollars to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, customers weren't getting much for their
money in North Carolina, historically laggard in national student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, national educators took notice of the Tar Heel state.
The National Education Goals Panel reported that students from
North Carolina and Texas had scored the greatest average gains in
state testing of reading, writing and math basic since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state test results show improvements as well, with 69
percent of North Carolina's 1.2 million students scoring at or
above grade level on tests in reading and math. Six years ago, 53
percent were capable of grade-level work.
</P>
<P>
   The Goals Panel commissioned a study to explain North Carolina's
progress. Published in August, it concluded that cooperation among
educators, the business community and state government in a
six-year initiative called Total Quality in Education has played a
big role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a way to engage business expertise in
partnerships that will really help transform education,'' said
Peggy Siegel, the North Carolina report's author.
</P>
<P>
   As director of business/education leadership initiatives at the
National Alliance of Business, a nonprofit organization in
Washington, Siegel is at the forefront of the movement to instill
business principles in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1991, the public schools in Pinellas County, Fla.,
were among the first in the nation to embrace business methods
across its entire district. In seeking a way to assess the
performance of its program, the Tampa Bay district adopted the
criteria of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other school systems _ including North Carolina's _
have modeled their programs upon Pinellas County's. They, too, have
adopted the Baldrige criteria to judge their results.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the prestigious award in 1987, the year
Malcolm Baldrige died. As President Reagan's commerce secretary,
Baldrige had realized that many American businesses needed to
restructure themselves dramatically to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   Baldrige envisioned a rigorous competition among U.S.
corporations that would measure improvements in planning,
productivity, profitability, treatment of employees and customer
service. Managed by the Commerce Department and the private sector,
the award has emerged as a widely accepted model of business
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, the Baldrige competition is open
to educational organizations. That category attracted 16
nominations (the organizations haven't been disclosed). President
Clinton and Commerce Secretary William Daley are expected to
announce the winners this month.
</P>
<P>
   Staying competitive
</P>
<P>
   Using the Baldrige criteria, school districts share a common
rulebook for measuring their performance. It breeds cooperation and
competition among schools, answering some critics of public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing element in public education is not a missing set
of Baldrige principles,'' said John Hood, president of the John
Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. ``It is the competition
that makes those principles important.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Granville County, school superintendent Janice Davis said
the Baldrige principles encourage educators to focus on growing
competition from charter schools, private schools and home
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our parents had the resources to choose another educational
alternative, would they still choose us over our competition?''
Davis said. ``Our goal is to be the schools of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing savvy of North Carolina's education reforms drew
a national award last month. The National Alliance for Business
selected the North Carolina Partnership for Excellence as a
recipient of a distinguished performance award.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit partnership is an offshoot of North Carolina's
six-year effort to incorporate business practices in the classroom.
Shortly after he was elected governor in 1992, Jim Hunt met with
state business leaders, who complained that partnerships between
companies and schools had done little to improve student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders started anew in 1993, creating pilot projects in six
school districts, including Granville County. Using the Baldrige
criteria to judge results, school officials teamed up with local
corporations and local colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding, then doing
</P>
<P>
   In Granville County, an IBM official helped the superintendent
figure out how to make the district's budget process work more
smoothly. It involved the principles of individual schools taking
greater responsibility for deciding how much money they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool is that schools are empowered to do this,'' Davis
said. ``They are now fixing problems that I do not even know we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by improving student achievement, the state
Legislature began allocating funds in 1995 to expand the pilot
project. It has now spread to 45 school systems, which have
volunteered to incorporate business practices. The goal is to reach
all 116 systems by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina has taken such marvelous flight,'' said Chris
Harwell, a trainer for the Pinellas County school district who has
worked with North Carolina educators.
</P>
<P>
   Not all teachers embrace the new methods, not even in districts,
such as Granville County, where efforts have been under way the
longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This too shall pass _ that's the attitude among some
teachers,'' said Fitz. But for her, a return to tradition, where
teachers are the undisputed boss, would be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be a boss; I want to be a leader,'' Fitz
said. ``Listen to the difference. Which one sounds more appealing
to you?''

PENN STATE BEATS ILLINOIS, 27-7  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. _ Last week, Rashard Casey was spitting blood
after taking a hit to the chest in the third quarter against
Purdue. Saturday, he drew blood in the third quarter on three
frenetic plays that stopped Illinois' valiant attempt for an upset.
When the unpredictable half of Penn State's two-quarterback
rotation was done, the Nittany Lions had scored 20 points and
dumped the Fighting Illini, 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   Casey did it with his arm. He did it with his legs. He did it
with his heart, which apparently was not damaged last week when
Purdue linebacker Willie Fells laid a helmet on him, resulting in a
chest bruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were in trouble before Casey was inserted into
the game with little more than four minutes left in the third
quarter. Casey had played sparingly in the first half and the
Nittany Lions clung to a 10-7 lead; the 50,014 at Memorial Stadium
were beginning to believe that, like last week against Michigan, an
improving team was poised to knock down a football giant.
</P>
<P>
   But Casey let them know immediately that it was not going to
happen. First, he rolled right at the Illinois 43-yard line,
stopped and drilled the ball 27 yards down the field to John
Gilmore. The pass was so hard it knocked down the 6-foot-4-inch,
253-pound tight end at the Illini 16-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions called the play again, but Casey was chased
down the line by Danny Clark. The quarterback made a pump fake, and
the linebacker jumped. That gave Casey enough room to fire the ball
into the end zone, where another tight end, Tony Stewart, was
waiting, giving the Nittany Lions a 17-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence earned Casey a place in the huddle again after the
Nittany Lion defense forced Illinois to punt from its end zone.
Once more, he rolled right, but this time Illinois linemen Rameel
Connor and Mike McGee were right behind him. Connor took his shot;
Casey ducked and turned back left. McGee swooped into him. Casey
spun and turned up the field. Safety Asim Pleas dived and missed.
So did two more Illinois defenders. Casey never looked back and
went 34 yards for a touchdown and a 24-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Travis Forney kicked a 39-yard field goal _ his
second of the day _ Casey had rushed for 75 yards, thrown for
another 49 and kept Penn State (9-0, No. 2 in the New York Times
and the Associated Press rankings) in the hunt for the national
title.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Memorial Stadium crowd roared in appreciation
as the Illini stormed off the field. Both players and crowd sensed
that an upset could be at hand on this sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois defense had given up 232 yards, and the Nittany
Lions had driven into Fighting Illini territory four times. But
three first-half sacks, two interceptions and 40 yards of Penn
State penalties had the teams tied at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini defense had something to do with Penn State's sloppy
play. In the second quarter, Illinois held Penn State on
fourth-and-3 at the Illini 25-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as time was running out in the half and the Nittany Lions
were threatening from the Illinois 12-yard line, a persistent pass
rush forced quarterback Kevin Thompson to throw his second
interception. Thompson pumped once but was wrapped up by the legs
as he overthrew a desperate pass to Tony Stewart that Illinois
cornerback Tony Francis gathered in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini offense hoped to keep up a scoring binge that began
late in the third quarter last week against Michigan and allowed
Illinois to come from 20 points down to upset the Wolverines.
Again, quarterback Kurt Kittner propelled the Illini down the
field. In a five-play, 89-yard drive, he got 33 yards when he
lofted a pass down the middle of the field that tight end Josh
Whitman took to the Nittany Lions' 34. On the next play, halfback
Rocky Harvey streaked inside his left tackle and breezed untouched
into the end zone to put the Illini ahead, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thompson, the starter in Penn State's banged-up
quarterback rotation, who moved quickly to answer. Although he
threw two touchdown passes last week in the Nittany Lions' narrow
escape at Purdue, Thompson is still bothered by soreness from a
separated shoulder that he sustained two weeks ago against Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   With Casey sitting on the bench in the first half, still tender
from the shot to the chest he received in the Purdue game, Thompson
played all but four minutes of Saturday's first half. On
second-and-8 at the Penn State 18, Thompson called a quarterback
draw and lumbered 33 yards up the middle to the Illinois 49-yard
line. Thompson then went back to the air, finding wide receiver
Chafie Fields for a 13-yard gain. Thompson and Fields capped an
84-yard march by hooking up on an arcing fade pattern 13 yards to
the corner of the end zone to tie the score at 7-7.

ODOM MAKING IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know the pose, Clipper fans. Head bowed, eyes
closed and one jittery hand on the bible (The Sporting News NBA
Register).
</P>
<P>
   But this time, put the other hand on Clipper jersey No.7. Right,
the work shirt of rookie Lamar Odom. Buy it for a song at the
Staples Center team shop.
</P>
<P>
   Feel the power of no-look passes, the infectious grin, the
ankle-breakin', ACL-takin' spin moves and relentless,
coast-to-coast assaults on the hoop? What if we throw in a
hallelujah? You may not be healed, but the traditional lottery pick
may slip a few notches.
</P>
<P>
   OK, to accrue evidence that the 6-foot-9 Odom the Clippers'
choice with the fourth pick in the June draft is far more than
another New Yorker who moved to L.A. with a great production deal,
we'll go for the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' says teammate Maurice Taylor. ``I love him. I
keep him around me 24-7. He's a special kind of player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a feel for the game you don't see very often,'' says
Lakers talent sage Jerry West. ``He could be the steal of the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen,''
assistant coach Jim Todd says about an Odom pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to learn to play defense and offense in our
system,'' says coach Chris Ford, who's paid to keep us grounded.
``Rookies don't just come into this league and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's resume the less-subdued testimony. You're up, Scott
Brooks. Let's hear about last Sunday's exhibition moment vs.
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a timeout, Lamar said `I'm going to pick up my game
right now!' Then he went out and dominated the second half,''
Brooks, who was released by the Clips earlier this week, says of
Odom's 19-point, 14-rebound, 6-assist effort. ``It was like a
called shot. He's my new hero.''
</P>
<P>
   It's teammate Eric Murdock's turn at the pulpit, and you might
want to brace yourself for what sounds like grand hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already dubbed him Magic Johnson with more athletic
ability,'' says Murdock, a veteran of eight NBA seasons. ``He's
that good.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd better open your eyes on that one. Magic Johnson with more
athletic ability?
</P>
<P>
   Let's downshift a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The ditches lining every road to NBA glory are fertilized by
words touting the ``next'' Jordan, or the last white guy with
enough chutzpah to conjure the name Bird. Or another tall, lanky
kid who handles the rock and hands out more passes than a lounge
lizard down the home stretch of happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next Magic? That one's awfully tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard comparison to live up to,'' says Odom who has
attempted to integrate the court awareness of Johnson and Larry
Bird into his game. Through such assimilation, he's become more
versatile than a Swiss Army Knife. ``If that's what people see,
then I'm flattered. I don't consciously go out and try to play like
him, but it's really an honor to be even mentioned with Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he certainly jumps higher and jets around the court in
less elapsed time than the ex-Laker great. Dribbling? Forget it.
Magic was functional, textbook; Odom has those next-millennium,
schoolyard handles. Defense? Odom while still guilty of system
mistakes has the length, quickness and desire to play it; Magic
couldn't guard a rhino in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Odom's shooting needs work, but Johnson who lacked
this kid's ability to square and shoot off the dribble wasn't
exactly William Tell when he arrived in L.A. 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Magic began his Laker journey with that emotional victory
over the 76ers in San Diego, he was an old man of 20. Odom, who
leads the Clips in scoring and rebounding through seven exhibitions
games, will turn 20 next week.
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, Odom seeks and delivers the spectacular pass, but
an ability to match this boyhood idol for wisdom in his decisions,
and the knack for overpowering any coming adversity will determine
if he can carry the weight of yet another ``next Magic''
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is right-handed, Odom is a lefty. Leave that one for the
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's something else. Your move, Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Magic came in,'' said Anderson, another new Clipper,
``the Lakers already had Kareem, Jamal Wilkes, Norm Nixon ... ''
</P>
<P>
   What Anderson, in a boldly, self-deprecating way, was
emphasizing is the modest caliber of running mates Odom has joined.
While Anderson, Taylor and center Michael Olowokandi are swell
prospects, they don't provide the caliber of comfort zone, the
margin for error, the aforementioned Lakers gave Johnson. In
return, Johnson helped give the Lakers five championships.
</P>
<P>
   So let's not even start on franchise histories. Aw, why not?
Well, we know Odom while happy to be where he is didn't have a
destination choice, but propelling a Magic sequel while employed by
L.A.'s flip-side team could be harder than duplicating Paul
Revere's ride on the back of a mechanical pony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls weren't very good when Jordan got there,'' Odom
says. ``Every team has to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his greatest hurdle is personal history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson entered the draft after leading Michigan State to the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Odom certainly excelled during his Rhode Island cameo, but his
circuitous, sometimes-confounding route from New York City prep
legend to Clipper rookie has invited critics to overlook his
enormous skill and label him a can't-help-but-miss prospect.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems he was as reluctant to enter the NBA as Johnson was
to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that if I don't do well,'' Odom says, ``I'll be
criticized because of my past. But I think I can handle that,
because the pressure I put on myself is so much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   That self-imposed challenge includes clearing a path for the
next phenom whose youthful uncertainty grows a field of red flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that all the time,'' Odom says. ``You know, if I
do well, it might be easier for the next guy. It might be someone
from my own neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest assist may come in passing the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day,'' said Brooks, ``we're going to be comparing guys to
Lamar.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen, Clipper fans.

FOR SOME, IT'S A RULE OF FLAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rick Fox can hardly contain himself. He's about to
verbally unload on the NBA's new, call-every-apparent-foul policy
when the TV monitor five feet away makes his point for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch, right !ital!here!off!. Look! Look!'' he says excitedly
as the videotape shows Phoenix Suns rookie Shawn Marion glide by
Fox, through the paint and straight to the hoop, unmolested, for an
easy one-hand jam.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Marion would have had an elbow in his gut three
steps into his drive. Not now. Not with the NBA cracking down on
what it perceives as too-rough defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   The league hopes the crackdown, combined with a handful of new
rules, will reverse a 10-year scoring decline and return the league
to a more aesthetically pleasing offensive game. Rather than the
bruising, offensive-to-the-eyes game it had become.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Per-game scoring this exhibition season
rose to 97.4 points per team, up from 90.7 last exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   That's all fine for owners and NBA marketing agents. But for
many players and coaches, the new edicts amount to a
criminalization of basic defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started letting people go,'' rather than risk a foul, Fox
said, explaining Marion's highlight-reel flight. ``Normally, as he
drove, I would have got right into him. He had me beat, but I could
do something about it before.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Not without drawing a whistle. And Fox's matador act
with Marion is essentially what the league wants. More fast breaks,
more wide-open play. And points, points, points.
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams last season averaged just 91 points per game _ the
lowest since the shot clock was introduced in 1954-55. Only the
Sacramento Kings averaged more than 100 points per game. By
comparison, in the 1989-90 season, only one team !ital!didn't!off!
average 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the NBA's point perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game was getting too physical,'' said Rod Thorn, NBA vice
president of operations. ``The grabbing, clutching, impeding
progress, chucking _ those things were becoming rampant in our
game, and the consensus is overwhelming that we had to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution takes several forms, not all of them aimed at
defense. First is the directive to officials to better enforce
what's already on the books. The second step was to adopt four new
rules for the 1999-2000 season:
</P>
<P>
   _A prohibition on hand-checking and forearm checking, except
between the baseline and the free-throw line (imagine it extended
across the court). Self-explanatory.
</P>
<P>
   _The Mark Jackson/Charles Barkley rule. A player dribbling the
ball below the free-throw line, his back to the basket, must shoot
or pass within five seconds. This eliminates the awful, plodding
strategy of backing a defender into the paint while the other eight
players stand around plotting investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   _The shot clock will be reset to 14 seconds rather than 24 under
certain circumstances. Again, play will be sped up, mathematically
ensuring more possessions per team and, presumably, more points.
</P>
<P>
   _A modification in the arcane illegal-defense rules. (No
explanation will suffice. Just trust the league on this one.)
</P>
<P>
   Only the first two rules have drawn any substantial criticism.
The Pacers' Jackson, naturally, objects to having his
bread-and-butter play taken away, saying, ``People may say it's
boring . . . (but) it's simple in its purest form, getting a team
at a disadvantage and then exploiting it. I don't agree with (the
rule), then at the same time, five seconds to make a move is plenty
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, the five-second rule has only resulted in a blown
whistle ``three or four'' times, according to Thorn. ``The players
immediately adjusted to that during the whole preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to the hands-off defensive rules has been tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to change the mentality and develop some
techniques and tactics . . . that still are going to allow us to be
a good defensive team,'' said coach Pat Riley, whose Miami Heat
squads have earned a reputation for aggression. ``I think (the new
policy) has taken the edge off of the defense allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively, it all seems to point to more fouls called, more
stoppages of play, more free throws and longer games. The Lakers
played a three-hour exhibition that included 105 free throws and 75
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   But players have indeed adjusted. On average, teams attempted
30.3 free throws per game this exhibition season, which is in line
with the past few seasons. Teams have been called for 28.5 fouls,
an increase of a foul per game, per team.
</P>
<P>
   The average game time of two hours and 16 minutes also is close
to past marks, Thorn said, and the league is ``guardedly
optimistic'' that the new rules are working to increase scoring
without negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson has had his complaints, particularly
over the lack of consistency in officiating, but he believes the
league's approach makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for the new rules because I think it creates
lanes in which people can cut,'' he said. ``We have an offense
that's not a motion offense, but it's movement with purpose. We'd
like the ability for players to cut, not get jammed up, not get
held, not get tackled.''
</P>
<P>
   To balance the restrictions on defenders, officials also are
calling more offensive fouls, primarily on illegal screens, but
also for charging. The league also has vowed to call players for
``carrying'' the ball more often.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the whole the new rules seem to favor the play of
quick-footed slashers like New York's Latrell Sprewell,
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and the Lakers' Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   That's great for ``SportsCenter'' producers, but it's all a bit
distasteful to players who have made a living on the small bumps
and taps that make them good defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been discouraged, because I've always prided myself
defensively,'' Fox said. ``Now they're telling me I can't play the
way I've played the last 15 years. It's frustrating, because it's
not basketball. You're basically asking the defensive player to
give the offensive player free reign to the basket. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we just go up and down the court, and I let you
score, and you let me score, and I let you score, you let me score.
Where's the defense?''

<P>
   But in the coming week, those will be drowned out by larger,
smarter questions as horseplayers and horsemen prepare for
Saturday's Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Breeders' Cup will include eight races _ covering both
sexes, all ages and a range of dirt, turf and distance specialties
_ with $13 million in purses and most year-end championships up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions that will shape it.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Will Bob Baffert have a day for the history books,
or a blank page?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The dominant trainer aims to saddle contenders in five of the
eight races, including 3-year-old General Challenge and 7-year-old
River Keen in the $4 million Classic. He could break the record of
three winners at a single Breeders' Cup set by D. Wayne Lukas in
1988 at Churchill Downs. Or he could shoot the most embarrassing
0-fer in racing history.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's horses will be the most closely watched in the
exercise gallops this week.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Is Silverbulletday out of this world, or out of
gas?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old queen is the hardest of Baffert's horses to
figure. After winning 11 races in a row against fillies her age,
she was dominated by 4-year-old Beautiful Pleasure on a sloppy
track at Belmont Park last time out. Now she faces Beautiful
Pleasure and other older fillies and mares in the $1 million
Breeders' Cup Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   Was Silverbulletday outclassed by an elder? Is she tuckered out
as she nears the end of a long season? Or is that defeat an
aberration?
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Will Europeans complain it's not the horse, it's the
humidity?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-degree Florida weather was blamed when English- and
French-prepped horses went winless in 28 starts at the 1989 and
1992 Breeders' Cups at Gulfstream. European horses are growing
their winter coats this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream officials prevented a Euro boycott by cranking up the
quarantine-barn air conditioning and allowing early-morning turf
workouts. Twenty-one Euro-prepped horses are among the 128
``pre-entries.'' They include Daylami and Royal Anthem, contenders
in the $2 million Breeders' Cup Turf.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Is the Gulfstream turf course ``firm,'' ``good,''
``yielding'' _ or submerged?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The infield lake overflowed in Hurricane Irene, soaking the
clay-based grass oval, which remains soggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Florida, we don't ever rely on forecasts, but if we don't
get much (more) rain, it should be OK,'' said Gulfstream president
Doug Donn. If not, the Florida climate might turn out to help the
Europeans, who are used to softer footing.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Is another Arazi hiding in one of those barns?(end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and early retirements have taken away some of the
event's equine marquee power. But sometimes it helps to establish a
new star, as when transatlantic 2-year-old Arazi created a
sensation in the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Some possibilities: Chilukki and Surfside ($1 million Juvenile
Fillies), Forest Camp, Dixie Union, and English-based Brahms and
Mull of Kintyre (Juvenile), and 3-year-old General Challenge
(Classic).
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Will the ``Ultra Pick Six'' be too difficult to bet
on?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup pick-six's latest format excludes the usually
formful Distaff and Juvenile Fillies, and challenges fans to link
the winners of six of the world's toughest races.
</P>
<P>
   Before putting together a ticket, anyone without the bankroll to
cover thousands of combinations must decide if it's worth the
trouble, although the guaranteed $5 million pool will make a $12
stab hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Can Bobby Frankel overcome his Breeders' Cup
jinx?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   This event would seem to owe one to Frankel, the wonderfully
profane, Brooklyn-born trainer who is in the Hall of Fame despite
never winning a Breeders' Cup or Triple Crown race. Frankel has
saddled four second- and five third-place Breeders' Cup finishers _
most recently Bertrando in the Classic won by 133-1 Arcangues at
Santa Anita in 1993 _ and is 10th on the earnings list with $2.9
million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it frustrating? Only when you guys bring it up,'' said
Frankel, who'll try again with Chester House (Classic), Keeper Hill
(Distaff), Kirkwall ($1 million Mile) and Spanish Fern ($1 million
Filly and Mare Turf). ``I just go about it like any other race.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Who will clinch ``Jockey of the '90s'' honors _ Gary
Stevens, Jerry Bailey or Pat Day?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three has been inducted into the Hall of Fame, won
at least one Eclipse Award, won at least one Kentucky Derby,
Preakness and Belmont and been among the 1990s' leaders in
Breeders' Cup victories, Bailey with seven and Stevens and Day with
six. (Mike Smith has eight, but has flopped in the Triple Crown
races.)
</P>
<P>
   A big day Saturday could push one to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Can we get through a Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup
without tragedy?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   On the Line was injured in the 1989 Sprint and died weeks later.
Mr Brooks was fatally injured in the 1992 Sprint and legendary
English jockey Lester Piggott was seriously injured in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup, once plagued by accidents, hasn't had a fatal
mishap since Mr Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Will Easy Goer finally go past Sunday Silence?(end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   The two rivals retired in 1990. Easy Goer has been dead since
1994. But Easy Goer's fans in the eastern press haven't given up
hope that one day they'll wake up to find his neck loss to
California-based Sunday Silence in the Breeders' Cup Classic at
Gulfstream a decade ago was only a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never convince me that Easy Goer shouldn't have won
that Classic,'' Daily Racing Form handicapper Mike Watchmaker wrote
this week, citing trouble caused by the horse and jockey Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   Watchmaker made Easy Goer and Sunday Silence the only
co-honorees in a race-by-race best-of-the-Breeders' Cup list.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, 1999's questions are challenging enough without
agonizing over 1989's. &QL;

TEXAS TECH CURES WHAT AILS MISSOURI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ There was really no reason for Texas Tech to don
costume in observance of the weekend's macabre holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The team of a thousand faces merely came to Missouri dressed as
itself _ The Phantom of the Soap Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of two consecutive games for the first time this season,
the Red Raiders were thoroughly dominated, 34-7, by a Missouri team
that was winless in four Big 12 games and had been shut out last
week by Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``It is a mystery
that we play so good at times ... over our heads at times and
underachieving at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating. It starts at the top. I've had a hard read
on getting these guys to play at the same level with the same kind
of intensity week after week. The buck stops here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's game _ both offensively and defensively _ stopped at the
line of scrimmage. Missouri (4-4, 1-4) held the Raiders (4-4, 3-2)
to a season-low 169 yards total offense, 9 rushing, while racking
up six sacks. Meanwhile, sophomore backup tailback Zain Gilmore
gouged Tech's middle behind a bullish offensive line for a
career-high 165 yards and three touchdowns on a school-record 45
carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were penalized 13 times for 109 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore's previous best was 139 yards against Western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practiced against an eight-man front, so when they did
that, it didn't matter,'' said Gilmore, who celebrated his 20th
birthday. ``I said all week I could get outside, but it was kind of
easy running between the tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's lone touchdown came on an 86-yard fumble return in the
first quarter by safety Kevin Curtis. Curtis also caused a fumble
that halted a Missouri drive at the Tech 12 late in the first
quarter. But the Raiders' defense finally began to sag after
holding the Tigers to a pair of early field goals when it couldn't
slow the Missouri rush and got no help from its offense.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri coach Larry Smith said he challenged his team both
mentally and physically after the 21-0 loss to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the heck out of these guys in practice this week,'' he
said. ``I was afraid they'd be tired, but the key is to work our
butts off in practice and do the same in a game. This is the best
whole game we've played all year. It was a fantastic effort by the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech gained 67 of its 87 yards total offense and its only four
first downs of the first half on a drive that ended on
second-and-goal at the Missouri 1 when Tigers nose tackle Cedric
Harden tipped a Rob Peters pass and teammate Pat Duffy intercepted
four seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just bad luck,'' Peters said. ``We got what we wanted _ a post
to the back side. The linebacker blitzed and \Rwide receiver\S
Darrell Jones was wide open. The defensive lineman just got his
hand up in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders tight end Tim Winn had dropped a first-down slant pass
to the other side after fullback Sammy Morris had gotten to the lip
of the goal on a 24-yard pass-run play with 12 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After the interception, Tech went in at the half down 20-7 and
no more in the game than it had been before that drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key to the ballgame, really. Though I doubt if
Missouri would think so,'' Dykes said. ``If we score right before
the half, it makes a different ballgame out of it and we go in with
our heads up instead of down.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not try to punch it in with two timeouts left?
</P>
<P>
   ``Time wasn't a factor,'' Dykes said. ``We had been pretty good
on those little angle passes and thought that might have been the
way to do it. In retrospect, I wish we had punched it in.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, Tech had a hard time even making a fist.

TEXAS ESCAPES IOWA STATE ON LAST-SECOND KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Perhaps fearing there might be something amiss in
America's heartland this weekend, Texas coach Mack Brown tossed his
troops the perfect cautionary reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them,'' he said, ``that in order to win a
championship, you've got to win some ugly games on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-ranked Longhorns (7-2, 4-1 Big 12) won a monster
yesterday, dispatching Kris Stockton to boot an 18-yard field goal
for a 44-41 victory as time expired, finally, on the Iowa State
Cyclones (4-4, 1-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we sure got their `A' game,'' said wide receiver Kwame
Cavil (11 catches, 106 yards), ``but I guess you expect that when
they schedule you for homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying a battlefield on which 60 passes were launched to
produce 636 yards, Brown said, ``This was sure a showcase for
quarterbacks and receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was also a showcase for runners and kickers, as
Hodges Mitchell (33 carries, 158 yards) carried seven consecutive
times as the clock wound down toward nil, advancing the ball from
the Cyclones' 34 to the lip of the goal and leaving Stockton at
point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, meanwhile, was on the sidelines, swishing the kick
successfully in his mind, aloof from all else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping Hodges would score on that last run \R10
yards to the one\S so I wouldn't have to go through this,'' he
said. ``But I wasn't that worried. I've done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to look the guys in the face at that moment, and
I don't like doing practice kicks into the net. I don't want to go
onto the field if I've just made a bad kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton was perfect on the sideline and drilled the real one,
deflating most of the 37,218 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   With Major Applewhite (30-for-40, no interceptions) throwing for
345 yards and two touchdowns, the Texas offense was its normal
frisky self. But the defensive game plan went askew quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The prime objective was achieved, as Darren Davis, the nation's
third-leading rusher, was limited to 67 yards on 24 carries. But
quarterback Sage Rosenfels threw for 291 yards and made a mess of
the Texas plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns were also bedeviled by a 5-foot-6 explosive device
named J.J. Moses, who had 249 yards on pass receptions and kickoff
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas victimized him once, after scoring on a pass from
Applewhite to Montrell Flowers to take a 31-27 lead late in the
third quarter. On the ensuing kickoff, Moses was unhinged at his
11-yard line by Maurice Gorden, the ball popped loose, and Beau
Trahan scooped it up at the 5 and ran it in for a sudden 11-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Horns added a fourth-quarter field goal to make it
41-27, Moses ran the kickoff back 80 yards to the 20, and the
Cyclones quickly cut it to seven points.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas stalled, Rosenfels was back _ throwing 34 yards to
Michael Brantey, setting up Davis' 1-yard score to cap a 66-yard
drive with 3:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, Brown figured he liked the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Major Applewhite 3:20 with three timeouts left, he's
gotten it done almost every time,'' Brown said. He just always
thinks he's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the final drive, Applewhite hit Ryan Nunez
for 38 yards to move it to the ISU 34, and Mitchell did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called that pass earlier and hit Kwame for about 16
yards,'' said offensive coordinator Greg Davis. ``Actually, I
thought he was going to throw it to Kwame again, but he did a
perfect job of reading what the safeties were doing, and he made
the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown admitted that the Longhorns _ fresh off victories against
Oklahoma and Nebraska _ were ambushed, and he was happy they
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supposed to run, not throw,'' Brown said. ``But
gosh, that guy \RRosenfels\S threw it as well as anyone. Sometimes,
when you're coming off a big, publicized win like we were, you
forget to respect the next opponent. But they sure earned ours
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Davis said he thought past experience may have been the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trailed both OU and Nebraska, but we came back, and you
learn something from that that you can use later,'' he said. ``It's
like putting a CD in the bank _ it draws interest and it's there
when you need it.''

JUNEAU HOPES FOR WINNING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems safe to forget any thoughts of collusion in the NHL.
Remember when the Bruins cut Dmitri Khristich free and his agent,
Larry Kelly, made less-than-veiled references to possible collusion
among club owners? His guy had been dropped, he said, and if no one
stepped up with an offer . . . blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   We know the rest of the story. Khristich found a pot of gold in
Toronto worth maybe $10 million over four years. Ulf Samuelsson
picked up $4.55 million with the Flyers. Last weekend, ex-Bruin Joe
Juneau signed a pact with Ottawa that could bring him the same kind
of money Samuelsson is making over two years. Slowly, perhaps
reluctantly, clubs are still willing to pay for certain
high-profile free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I had a few offers, I was just waiting for the
right team,'' said Juneau, who is also represented by Kelly. ``For
a while, there just wasn't a club that interested me. I'd said all
along, if I was going to take a little less money than the last
three years and keep playing, then I was going to go with a club
where there was a real chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Along came the Senators, jilted by Alexei Yashin (with one year,
$3.5 million left on his deal) and hindered by the loss (until
around Christmas) of Daniel Alfredsson. Juneau, a free agent after
finishing last season as a rent-a-player with Buffalo, drove the 4
1/2 hours from his home in Quebec and signed on the dotted line. He
was expected to make his Senator debut Saturday night at home
against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the feedback I've gotten from agents and the (Players
Association), it's easy to believe that something's been
happening,'' said Juneau, asked if he thought collusion was at play
this fall. ``But we'll never know for sure. In my case, I think
I've proven that I play to win, and I've always played hard in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 31 years old, Juneau entered the NHL with the Bruins
following the '92 Olympics, arriving as one of their most promising
forwards of the '90s. When his production began to slip some and it
became clear his contract demands would escalate, the Bruins
shoveled him to the Capitals at the March '94 trading deadline for
Al ``The Planet'' Iafrate. He quickly became a multimillionaire in
Washington, where he averaged well in excess of $2 million a year
for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the best thing that ever happened to Juneau was
getting out of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's true, for sure,'' said Juneau. ``The first time
I saw Harry Sinden after I signed my contract (in Washington), he
said to me, first thing, `You never would have gotten that here.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, said Juneau, he would have been willing to swap
some of that money for a different environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I made some good friends and money in Washington,''
he said. ``But I would have traded some of that money _ it's tough
to say _ maybe for a chance to win, and maybe to be in a place
where hockey was more in the spotlight, like Boston. It's tough to
go to a place like Washington, where it's not really a hockey town.
I've got nothing against Washington, but I think everyone would
admit it's not a hockey town _ that's why I'm so happy to be in a
place like Ottawa, where everyone cares so much about the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Juneau, who got his degree in aeronautical engineering at RPI,
pilots his own airplane. He uses it mostly for fishing trips in
Quebec, popping in and out of lakes in the summer, flying from one
to the other to land the catch of the day. As with any pilot, this
year's airplane accidents that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. and Payne
Stewart have caught his attention. The day Kennedy's plane went
down off Martha's Vineyard, Juneau was flying around Quebec, the
humidity high and conditions often foggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visibility wasn't good where I was, and I'm sure it was
worse over the ocean than in Quebec,'' he said. ``It's hard at
night with that kind of visibility. It's almost like you're in a
cloud. What must have happened to him _ and I'm not
instrument-certified, and maybe I'm not the best to ask _ but when
you get in that situation, you have to forget your senses and just
trust the dash(board) and what the instruments are telling you.
Whatever it is, you have to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Juneau flies his puddle-jumper, he rarely exceeds an
altitude of 6,000 feet. Stewart's Learjet was capable of cruising
at 35,000 feet or higher, and Juneau suspects that something
``broke down, exploded, or malfunctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They'll figure it out, but something major went
wrong. At that altitude, with no pressure and that severe cold, no
one could survive that. They had to die right away, fall asleep, or
freeze to death.''
</P>
<P>
   None of it, said Juneau, has led him to consider taking himself
out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad it happened to them, but there are always
accidents,'' he said. ``For some reason, in these cases it happened
to people who were well-known. If something like that happened to
someone else, you probably wouldn't have heard about it. The truth
is, on a percentage basis, there are more accidents on the road.
Flying is a very safe means of transportation. I think if you fly
your own plane and keep it up yourself, it's very easy to be
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago blues
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's 0-4-4 start not only earned it the dubious distinction
of being the last NHL team this season to get a win (1-0 over
Montreal Wednesday night), it also equaled the Blackhawks' worst
start ever, in 1953-54. So much for last season's strong finish.
The Blackhawks haven't recovered since the August 1996 trade that
sent Jeremy Roenick to Phoenix after they were unwilling to meet
Roenick's contract demands. They went 94-119-42 after the deal,
missed the playoffs twice, and went 2-4 in their lone round of
postseason play (1997). Roenick will average $4.4 million over
these next three seasons. It ranks up there with Montreal's
dismissal of Patrick Roy as the worst deals of the decade . . . You
know the heat's rising in Montreal when head coach Alain Vigneault
benches Trevor Linden, only to make it worse by ordering the
29-year-old center not to talk to the media. In Montreal, that's
tantamount to changing Linden's number to 911 and setting his hair
on fire. Right now, Vigneault, Lorne Molleken in Chicago, and John
Muckler in New York (Rangers) lead the race for first coach to be
sacked. In each case, they're working with the mess handed down
from above, but that rarely prevents the executioner's song from
being sung . . . Who knows whether it will last, but it's fun to
see Los Angeles with an entertaining product on the ice once again.
The deal to bring in Ziggy Palffy was key, of course, but head
coach Andy Murray is getting strong, accountable performances up
and down the lineup, including the continued hot hand of Luc
Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Prime real estate
</P>
<P>
   Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs found an extra $6 million sitting
around the office and plunked it down for the famed Butler Mansion
in Buffalo, right there on the corner of Delaware and North _ not
far from Marine Midland Arena. He has yet to figure out what he'll
do with the grand piece of architecture, which includes acreage and
carriage house, and undoubtedly room for a few butlers . . . Group
2 free agent Bill Guerin, looking for $3.5 million a year, still
hasn't come to terms with the Oilers, each day increasing the odds
that he'll get dealt. Guerin, an ex-Boston College Eagle, has some
grit, but he never has scored more than the 64 points he collected
last season. At his asking price, there won't be many takers. Even
the insatiable Rangers have to stop somewhere (although they've
offered Manny Malhotra and a draft pick for Guerin) . . . Speaking
of the Blueshirts, they were back on the ice Saturday night in
Montreal, looking to end a horrendous skid of three straight
shutouts _ their worst scoreless stretch since the '20s (214
minutes 31 seconds and counting). Lavish free agent acquisitions
over the summer boosted the New York payroll to a league-high of
some $60 million, but thus far more money has brought only more
losing. Once again, it's not necessarily how much you spend, but
paying the right people the right money. General manager Neil Smith
invested too much in players who were too old, bringing the
all-too-predictable results (including a league-worst 4 for 55 on
the man advantage prior to Saturday night) . . . Ex-Bruin Tim
Taylor continues to travel the unlucky trail in Manhattan. His most
recent setback: As he prepared for a faceoff, a two-inch splinter
from his own stick pierced his glove and then his hand, ultimately
leading him to the hospital. Earlier this season, Taylor missed
time after an emergency appendectomy and then a concussion. ``I've
never seen a person so unlucky in all my life,'' said Muckler.
``He's just jinxed.'' . . . Ex-Bruin Steve Leach signed for the
rock-bottom price of $200,000 to keep his career going and is
getting a decent amount of fourth-line duty with the Penguins. It's
yet another sign that some veterans slowly are willing to take some
serious discounts for the sake of making what most people would
still consider outrageous dough. To wit: Veteran winger Dave Lowry,
also an unrestricted free agent, signed a one-year deal with San
Jose for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers game
</P>
<P>
   Just over two weeks ago, when the expansion Thrashers were in
Uniondale, N.Y., to face the Islanders, the announced attendance
was around 5,300. Truth in numbers: The turnstile count was only
3,062. OK, so the Yankees were in the Bronx that night, facing the
Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, but a number
that low is a huge embarrassment, and at some point the league has
to force a resolution here (i.e., put up a new building with a
legitimate franchise or get the thing sold and moved) . . . In a
lackluster 4-3 loss to the Predators, the struggling Sabres allowed
an ungodly five-on-one breakout (rub eyes here), with only Jean-Luc
Grand-Pierre left to defend in front of Dominik Hasek. The next
day, the Sabres summoned goalie Martin Biron from the minors, and
it was Grand-Pierre who got dished back to Rochester. The Sabres
still appear hung over from their disappointing loss to Dallas in
the Cup finals _ clinched on Brett Hull's disputed goal. One
measure of the malaise: At one point last week, the Sabres'
celebrated checking line of Dixon Ward-Michael Peca-Vaclav Varada
was a dumbfounding minus-20, and Varada was still looking for his
first goal since January . . . Biron's brother, Mathieu, a
6-foot-6-inch defenseman, was considered a throw-in for the
Islanders in the deal that sent Palffy to the Kings. But right now
the 19-year-old Biron is factoring prominently in the Islander
defense. He has great size and great enthusiasm, the latter perhaps
the most important ingredient on a team that is a living train
wreck . . . When you just know things are going bad: The Flames
outshot the Lightning, 36-9, last Saturday night and lost, 2-1. On
the upside for the Flames, Valeri ``The Other'' Bure carried nine
goals into Saturday night's game in Toronto, giving him four more
strikes than famed brother Pavel. Couldn't the Canadiens use
Valeri's touch now? Remember, the Habs dished Bure to Calgary late
in the 1997-98 season for Jonas Hoglund (now in Toronto) and Zarley
Zalapski (he of ZSC Zurich last season). Just another of the
front-office bunglings that have helped make the Habs the '66
Yankees of hockey.

TEXAS ESCAPES IOWA STATE ON LAST-SECOND KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Perhaps fearing there might be something amiss in
America's heartland this weekend, Texas coach Mack Brown tossed his
troops the perfect cautionary reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them,'' he said, ``that in order to win a
championship, you've got to win some ugly games on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-ranked Longhorns (7-2, 4-1 Big 12) won a monster
yesterday, dispatching Kris Stockton to boot an 18-yard field goal
for a 44-41 victory as time expired, finally, on the Iowa State
Cyclones (4-4, 1-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we sure got their `A' game,'' said wide receiver Kwame
Cavil (11 catches, 106 yards), ``but I guess you expect that when
they schedule you for homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying a battlefield on which 60 passes were launched to
produce 636 yards, Brown said, ``This was sure a showcase for
quarterbacks and receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was also a showcase for runners and kickers, as
Hodges Mitchell (33 carries, 158 yards) carried seven consecutive
times as the clock wound down toward nil, advancing the ball from
the Cyclones' 34 to the lip of the goal and leaving Stockton at
point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, meanwhile, was on the sidelines, swishing the kick
successfully in his mind, aloof from all else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping Hodges would score on that last run \R10
yards to the one\S so I wouldn't have to go through this,'' he
said. ``But I wasn't that worried. I've done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to look the guys in the face at that moment, and
I don't like doing practice kicks into the net. I don't want to go
onto the field if I've just made a bad kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton was perfect on the sideline and drilled the real one,
deflating most of the 37,218 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   With Major Applewhite (30-for-40, no interceptions) throwing for
345 yards and two touchdowns, the Texas offense was its normal
frisky self. But the defensive game plan went askew quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The prime objective was achieved, as Darren Davis, the nation's
third-leading rusher, was limited to 67 yards on 24 carries. But
quarterback Sage Rosenfels threw for 291 yards and made a mess of
the Texas plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns were also bedeviled by a 5-foot-6 explosive device
named J.J. Moses, who had 249 yards on pass receptions and kickoff
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas victimized him once, after scoring on a pass from
Applewhite to Montrell Flowers to take a 31-27 lead late in the
third quarter. On the ensuing kickoff, Moses was unhinged at his
11-yard line by Maurice Gorden, the ball popped loose, and Beau
Trahan scooped it up at the 5 and ran it in for a sudden 11-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Horns added a fourth-quarter field goal to make it
41-27, Moses ran the kickoff back 80 yards to the 20, and the
Cyclones quickly cut it to seven points.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas stalled, Rosenfels was back _ throwing 34 yards to
Michael Brantey, setting up Davis' 1-yard score to cap a 66-yard
drive with 3:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, Brown figured he liked the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Major Applewhite 3:20 with three timeouts left, he's
gotten it done almost every time,'' Brown said. He just always
thinks he's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the final drive, Applewhite hit Ryan Nunez
for 38 yards to move it to the ISU 34, and Mitchell did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called that pass earlier and hit Kwame for about 16
yards,'' said offensive coordinator Greg Davis. ``Actually, I
thought he was going to throw it to Kwame again, but he did a
perfect job of reading what the safeties were doing, and he made
the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown admitted that the Longhorns _ fresh off victories against
Oklahoma and Nebraska _ were ambushed, and he was happy they
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supposed to run, not throw,'' Brown said. ``But
gosh, that guy \RRosenfels\S threw it as well as anyone. Sometimes,
when you're coming off a big, publicized win like we were, you
forget to respect the next opponent. But they sure earned ours
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Davis said he thought past experience may have been the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trailed both OU and Nebraska, but we came back, and you
learn something from that that you can use later,'' he said. ``It's
like putting a CD in the bank _ it draws interest and it's there
when you need it.''

LASTING IMAGE OF A TRUE CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a moment he probably had been dreaming about for six
years, ever since that September day at The Belfry when the United
States had last won a Ryder Cup. And as Payne Stewart joined his
teammates in celebrating minutes after the dramatic rally past
Europe at The Country Club a month ago, I found myself watching
him.
</P>
<P>
   There were thousands of people off the 18th green and in front
of the men's locker room, there was so much going on, and you could
barely move. Yet in that sea of chaos, Stewart's was the only face
I noticed for quite a while. He had made such a big deal out of
returning to the Ryder Cup, so sure that he could help reverse the
losses of 1995 and 1997 _ years in which he had not played, he
would remind you _ that I focused on him, curious to see his
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, his smile as wide as possible, placed one hand on each
side of Justin Leonard's face and urged the crowd to salute the
hero of the match. Thousands responded on cue, and Stewart kissed
Leonard once, twice, then hugged the kid as tightly as he could.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering went on, the celebration moved to the balcony above
the men's grill, and Stewart remained right in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   He had to be the most satisfied of all, I found myself thinking,
and it was impossible not to feel good for him. He had stuck his
neck out about making the team at a time when most felt his career
was on the downturn, just as he had accepted the challenge of
another US Open a few months earlier, to the snickers of the
critics who were telling anyone listening that Stewart would find a
way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart won that US Open, of course, and he played a leadership
role in doing what he had talked about passionately: winning back
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many people in this world who have guts. But I
saw that a lot in him,'' said Tommy Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan is a former club professional from Milton who got into
the clothing business many years ago and had the license to sell
and merchandise the Payne Stewart Collection. In that capacity,
Riordan in recent years came across a lot of people who doubted
Stewart's ability to return to the top of the sport. There had been
some seasons of complacency, and as Stewart turned 40, he surely
did not have the fortitude to bounce back, skeptics thought.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart dedicated 1999 to making that Ryder Cup team, and in
accomplishing that goal, he silenced his critics. ``It was as if he
crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's,'' said Stewart's golf
coach, Chuck Cook, at Friday's memorial service in Orlando, Fla.,
for the player, who was killed in an airplane accident Monday in
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart showed courage on the golf course (he may have been the
best US Open player of his era, and please never forget the grace
he showed in his Ryder match with Colin Montgomerie) and even more
of it in life, for he recognized the flaws he had as a person and
strived each day to get things right in his life. By all accounts,
he succeeded _ and how many of us can say that?
</P>
<P>
   So, for me, the lasting image will have nothing to do with
knickers and caps, US Open championships, or the sweetest golf
swing my eyes have ever witnessed. It will be of a man standing in
front of thousands of people and, despite having gone 0-2-1 in the
Ryder Cup, wearing the biggest smile. The team had won, and he was
very much a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have dreams,'' William Payne Stewart once said. ``The
funny thing is, sometimes you get to live them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scary moments
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Stewart was killed, Ian Woosnam revealed that a
twin-engine plane he was in had begun depressurizing as he traveled
to this week's Volvo Masters in Spain. Oxygen masks dropped, and
the pilot was able to dive and equalize pressure. ``It was scary,''
said Woosnam, ``but I don't want to make a big thing about it,
especially after the tragedy of Payne.'' . . . Reporters could have
found a more suitable person to ask about the Stewart tragedy than
John Daly. Yet there he was the other day, saying how the plane
disaster scared him so much that he drove six hours _ rather than
take a one-hour flight _ to get to the PGA Tour stop in
Mississippi. An understandable sentiment in light of the disaster,
but how silly it was to have Daly talk about the safety of
automobile travel. This is a guy who a few weeks ago talked openly
about taking a few six-packs with him for a drive from Memphis to
Arkansas . . . When the Southern Farm Bureau Classic was cut to 54
holes out of respect for the Stewart memorial service, it put more
pressure on those players trying to make the top 125 on the money
list, and thus gain exempt status for 2000. Or make that the top
131. Since six non-American PGA Tour members (Jose Maria Olazabal,
Sergio Garcia, Paul Lawrie, Lee Westwood, Montgomerie, and Jean Van
de Velde) are high on the list thanks to the influx of World Golf
Championships money, the cutoff drops accordingly . . . Remember
Justin Rose? He nearly won the 1998 British Open as an amateur,
then spent his first year as a pro playing Thursdays and Fridays,
but never weekends. But he breezed through the second stage of
European Tour qualifying and will try to secure his card for 2000
at the finals Nov. 17-22.
</P>
<P>
   Payback pairings
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is responsible for the pairings on the European Tour has
a sense of humor. At last week's Belgacom Open, Mark James was
paired with Robert Karlsson. In the opening round of the Volvo
Masters, James drew Bernhard Langer as a playing partner. As
European Ryder Cup captain, of course, James had overlooked both
Karlsson (11th in points standings) and Langer (14th) and chose
unheralded Scotsman Andrew Coltart (12th) as a captain's pick. ``It
was a bit tense,'' said Karlsson, ``especially the first few
holes.'' Karlsson went on to win in Belgium, a result he credited
indirectly to James. ``Probably, if I'd played the Ryder Cup,'' he
said, ``I wouldn't have been fresh to win.'' James no doubt did not
ask Karlsson for his opinion, but if he had, the Swede would have
told him that the captain had erred. ``I'd have picked Bernhard
Langer if it had been me,'' said Karlsson . . . Langer, a devout
Christian, led the moment of silence that European players held in
memory of Stewart at the 18th green following Friday's second round
. . . Quite a back nine for American Bob May in the first round in
Spain. He made a double bogey at the 10th and closed with a
three-putt bogey from 15 feet on the 18th, but in between he made
six birdies and a par to shoot 70 . . . Overshadowed by Montgomerie
and unheralded because he plays mainly in Europe, South African
Retief Goosen has put together a splendid season. He flirted with a
59 in the Volvo opener Thursday before settling for a 62. Goosen
has one win, four seconds, and six other top-10 finishes and is
fourth on the Order of Merit . . . Latest golfer to pay the price
for not knowing the rules: Westwood. He slammed his second shot on
a par 5 at the Volvo Masters into a pile of loose grass clippings
near a bush and didn't have much of a shot, his ball barely
visible. Free lift? No, he was told. He got angry with a rules
official and hastily took a foolish swipe, barely moving the ball.
On his fourth shot, the ball trickled out of the cuttings, and
Westwood ended up with a double bogey, sinful on such a short par
5. When he discovered later that he could have scraped the cuttings
away since they were considered loose impediments, Westwood at
first got mad at the rules official (who was under no obligation to
offer this option to the player, though had Westwood not been so
rude, perhaps he would have), and then he conceded it was his
fault. ``If I'd known the rules better,'' he said, ``I'd have saved
at least two shots.'' Not to mention embarrassment to the poor
rules official.
</P>
<P>
   Captain promoted
</P>
<P>
   It was an important story in the golf world as of noon Monday.
By 2 p.m., though, the appointment of Curtis Strange as 2001 US
Ryder Cup captain was lost amid the Stewart tragedy. During his
press conference, Strange covered a wide range of Ryder Cup
opinions _ from his belief that the event has not become too
intense (``When you are growing, there are going to be growing
pains; certainly there are instances that need to be addressed and
will be'') to the question about whether wives should be inside the
ropes (``It's exactly where they should be''). Strange, 44, played
on five Ryder Cup teams (1-3-1) and said being named captain was
``truly one of the most exciting days of my life.'' Some other
Strange thoughts: Don't look for him to get as involved as Ben
Crenshaw was, right down to clothing. ``All of them are going to
get six pair of khakis and a dozen white shirts,'' he said. ``I
told Tiger (Woods), if he plays well, I'll give him a red shirt for
Sunday.'' He expects Sam Torrance to be the European captain. ``A
wonderful pick,'' said Strange. ``I've known Sam for 23 years. He's
well-respected and well-liked.'' On the compensation issue: ``I had
mixed emotions all this year when it came up. In 1983 and '85, the
PGA of America lost money. Now they're putting on a heck of a show,
and the players are not getting anything out of it. I can
understand where the players are coming from.'' On the players'
responsibility to restore dignity to the event: ``We're all grown
men, and we have to respect each other.'' On his heralded
competitive fire: ``I've always said that if you think you're good
enough to win, you have to have the guts to lose.'' Whereas
Crenshaw had two assistant captains, Strange said he will have one.
In addition, he will bring along his sons, Tom, 17, and David, 14.
``I would never think about not taking them,'' he said. Strange's
work with ABC has helped his relationship with the younger players.
But he still plays a hefty schedule and, he said, ``I hope they see
me as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour finally in her cards
</P>
<P>
   Pam Kerrigan quietly secured her LPGA Tour card for next year,
tying for second last week at Daytona Beach, Fla., in the final
stage of the qualifying tournament. The Franklin native will give
up her teaching job at the Mike Adams Academy in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., but she hasn't mapped out her schedule for 2000.
``We were supposed to have a rookie meeting, but they canceled it
(because of a lengthy seven-player playoff for the final three
spots) and left us on our own,'' said Kerrigan. ``I was exhausted,
so I haven't looked at the schedule.'' The graduate of Colby-Sawyer
made folks take note, and not just because of her steady golf
(73-68-72-74). At 34, she is the oldest rookie to graduate to the
LPGA Tour next year. Although many of her qualifying opponents were
teenagers or recent college graduates, Kerrigan doesn't pay much
attention to the age factor. ``I started playing later than most of
them,'' she said, ``and I had the sense that for some of the kids
there, it is life and death. Not for me. It's a great job and I
love to play, but I'm just going to go out and play as well as I
can.'' It was her sixth trip to the qualifying tournament, the
third time she made the final stage. ``I played solid the first two
days, but I didn't hit it well the last two,'' said Kerrigan. ``I
kind of survived. But I'm happy and looking forward to next year.''
Her joy was tempered somewhat by the fact that her good friends and
fellow Bay Staters _ Kevin Johnson and Fran Quinn _ fell short of
earning their PGA Tour cards during the Nike Tour Championship.
Johnson, 14th on the money list entering the event (the top 15 got
cards), shot 83-80 on the weekend and fell to 16th. Quinn, needing
a top-five finish, started the final round birdie-birdie to tickle
the top of the leaderboard, but couldn't finish strongly and
dropped to 18th on the list. Still, said Quinn, there is a bright
side. Both he and Johnson, by virtue of being in the 16-25 range on
the money list, get to skip the second stage of qualifying and will
be at Doral Nov. 17-22 for the final stage. ``It's a great golf
course,'' said Quinn. ``I've played there a few times.'' The first
of six second-stage events in this annual torture gets under way
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   URI in the swing
</P>
<P>
   The University of Rhode Island men's team was in Baton Rouge,
La., this weekend, completing its fall schedule with the LSU
Invitational. Freshman Michael Carbone of Brewster did not make the
trip, however, as his left hand is still not completely healed from
an Oct. 5 car accident. Carbone was driving home in a rainstorm,
said URI coach Tom Drennan, when the accident occurred; he was
spared more serious injury because he was wearing a seatbelt. URI
recently won the New England Intercollegiate at New Seabury as all
five Rams _ Michael Sims, Josh Hillman of Greenfield, Jim Salinetti
of Stockbridge, Justin Thompson, and Michael Lucas of Framingham _
broke 80 in typical fall weather (cold, windy) at the seaside
layout. Salinetti, the Massachusetts Golf Association Player of the
Year for the second time in three years, has placed in the top 10
in all five events this fall, said Drennan, while Sims, who hails
from Bermuda, has done so four times. Carbone's injury allowed
Lucas, a transfer from the University of North Carolina, and Dave
Vetelino of Rockland to crack the lineup for a few events . . .
Monday is the last chance to vote for what you believe is the
greatest golf moment of the 20th century. You can cast your ballot
at www.thegolfchannel.com. The cable service will announce the
results Nov. 21-22. My vote goes to the drama at The Country Club,
and I don't mean last month's Ryder Cup matches. Here's a vote for
Francis Ouimet's 1913 US Open triumph over Ted Ray and Harry
Vardon, which went a long way in bringing the game to the masses. A
close second is Bobby Jones's 1930 Grand Slam.

BC THRILLS IN SPILLING SYRACUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ It had everything you could have wanted from a
Saturday matinee cliffhanger. There was a shocking start that had
you leaping from your seat. There was a richly layered plot that
churned your stomach with each twist and turnover. And there was a
gripping finish that had everyone on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Boston College's sixth victory of the season, a 24-23
triumph over Syracuse before a Carrier Dome crowd of 48,487
Saturday, proved as taut a thriller as ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   DuJuan Daniels, subbing on the kick-return team for injured
freshman William Green, got the game off to a stunning start when
he returned the opening kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. It was
another in the series of firsts for Daniels, who scored on his
first varsity play in high school, hauled in a 64-yard touchdown
against Navy on his first collegiate play, and scored the first
time he ever handled a kick return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deja vu No. 3,'' said Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Then John Matich, who missed a critical 33-yard field goal in
the fourth quarter of last week's gut-wrenching 31-28 loss to
Miami, converted a 34-yarder to rally BC from a 23-21 deficit with
2:57 left. Matich's only attempt of the game trumped the three
successful tries by Syracuse's Nate Trout, who converted from 34,
31, and 36 yards before missing a 40-yard attempt to the right with
9:08 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, myself, more than anyone else on this team, feel
redeemed,'' said Matich. ``It's been a long season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior linebacker Frank Chamberlin provided the gripping finish
when he made a game-saving ankle tackle on Syracuse quarterback
Madei Williams, stopping one him 1 yard shy of converting a
fourth-and-13 play. It punctuated a huge day for Chamberlin, who
had 24 tackles (14 unassisted), 1 1/2 sacks, and a 26-yard
interception return. But he saved his best and biggest tackle for
last when he brought down Williams to clinch it with 1:09
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what you do when you have the will to win,'' said
BC coach Tom O'Brien, who is assured of his first winning season
following back-to-back 4-7 seasons at The Heights, as his team
improved to 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the Big East. ``These kids came
in here and that's all we talked about this week. We challenged
them at halftime. I didn't know who was going to win, but I was
going to grade the film on effort. I wanted to know who the
warriors were in this football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had some warriors, they were going to show up in the
second half. At the end of the first half, we had guys starting to
feel sorry for themselves. It was the same ol' BC, but if we were
going to be different, we were going to have to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Not against a Syracuse team intent on redeeming
itself after a 62-0 thrashing two weeks ago at Virginia Tech. So,
after they were staggered by Daniels's return, the Orangemen went
on a 19-play, 70-yard drive that consumed 9:30. The Eagles gave up
only a field goal, however, and held on to a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Nunes, who started the day at quarterback, gave the
Orangemen a 10-7 lead when he scored on a 5-yard run. Television
replays showed Nunes's knee touched down at the 1, but officials
let the score stand.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck got the Eagles back on top
when he capped a nine-play, 80-yard drive with an 11-yard run. The
march was highlighted by Hasselbeck's 40-yard pass to fullback Ryan
Burch on the first play.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck accounted for 213 of BC's 269 yards of total offense.
He led all Eagles with 11 carries for 52 yards and completed 6 of
13 passes for 161 yards, averaging almost 27 per completion.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse took a 17-14 lead into the break when running back Dee
Brown, operating at quarterback, scored on a 9-yard keeper.
Chamberlin then chased Nunes from the game in the third quarter
with his interception that gave BC the ball at the Syracuse 37. Six
plays later, Cedric Washington scored on a 1-yard plunge for a
21-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, who scored on five of their first seven
possessions while converting third-and-longs at will, trudged 51
yards in 12 plays for a 31-yard field goal by Trout with 4:47 left
in the third that cut BC's lead to 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   After Hasselbeck fumbled at midfield, giving Syracuse possession
at its 49, BC's defense forced the Orangemen to settle for another
field goal by Trout with 11:43 left in the fourth after a 14-play,
33-yard drive fizzled at the 18.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 23-21, the Eagles averted disaster deep inside their
own territory when Keith Bulluck's apparent interception return for
a touchdown was ruled an incompletion. It was the break the Eagles
needed to survive the cliffhanger, and Matich's field goal sealed
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the time off because whatever we had, we used up,''
said O'Brien, eyeing next week's open date. ``Obviously, we're
extremely happy to come back after the game last week. We
resurrected ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in the nick of time.

PITINO'S CONCERN IS NOTHING HEAVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ There are few things more important than conditioning
for any player on a Rick Pitino team. And 48 hours before the
Celtics open the 1999-2000 season, the coach says his marquee
player, Antoine Walker, is not quite where he wants him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said Saturday Walker is ``85 percent'' of what he should
be, mainly in the weight department. According to the coach, Walker
has already lost 10 pounds and needs to lose another 6 or 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in bad shape. He's in good shape. He needs to get in
great shape,'' Pitino said. ``At the five- to six-minute mark, he
breaks down. We need to get him to the eight- or nine-minute mark.
In another week to 10 days, he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has looked tired at times during the exhibition games,
most noticeably on Thursday in Springfield, the second of
back-to-back games with the Washington Wizards. In the 102-101
loss, Walker was 1 for 8 from the field and watched from the bench
for almost the entire fourth quarter as the second unit got the
team back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said his ankle, which he badly sprained last April, is
not a major concern. He also said he didn't think there was
anything wrong with his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in bad shape, I would be hurt,'' he said. ``That's
not a factor. I don't understand why everyone talks about that. I'm
playing basketball. I'm fine. I'm playing. I'm happy. That's not a
question for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino thinks Walker is at an acceptable weight to play power
forward, which is where he will spend most of his time the next two
months as Danny Fortson recovers from foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight is fine (for power forward),'' said Pitino, who
added Walker rarely comes off the floor in practice. ``He needs to
bring it down and tighten it up.''
</P>
<P>
   By dropping another 7 pounds, the coach feels, Walker will be
able to move seamlessly between the forward positions. Walker has
dismissed such talk as recently as nine days ago, when he said
making the move to small forward was, in his mind, not a matter of
weight.
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't all this supposed to be a non-issue with the lockout
over? Wasn't Walker supposed to hire a personal trainer this
summer? Weren't the Celtics going to be on top of him _ and his
teammates _ to make sure they were on the right conditioning
programs and were meeting offseason goals? Isn't that what the
lockout prevented?
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys go on vacation,'' Pitino said. ``We did (stay on top of
everyone) to a certain degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he wasn't even certain Walker had hired a trainer _
Walker said he had one until the end of August _ and added that his
captain never should have come back last May after suffering the
ankle injury. Pitino also said Walker isn't the easiest person to
find in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough to monitor,'' Pitino said. ``He plays a lot of
basketball. Some guys don't play and live in the weight room. In
the middle is the truth of it all _ Paul Pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Walker, ``I had the trainer and he was fine. A local guy
(in Chicago). He really helped me get my ankle stronger. It really
helped me a lot. But I played on it in the process of getting it
stronger, so I don't know if that helped it or hurt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said his ankle bothers him only a little, mostly on
back-to-back games. (The Celtics have two sets this week.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it's been fine,'' he said. ``It's been easy
for me to jump, cut, and move. It's getting to the point where it's
not a factor anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible aid _ having his ankles taped _ is a no-no, Walker
said. Most players get their ankles taped. Most trainers advise
their players to tape their ankles. Walker doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to play with tape on,'' he said. ``I just feel it
holds me down. I like my shoes to be tight on my feet. If you put
on tape and extra socks, it takes away from that. I don't feel
right doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Celtic center and coach-without-portfolio Dave Cowens was
at practice. Cowens recently moved back to the Boston area and
could do some scouting for the San Antonio Spurs. The NBA Hall of
Famer was in to work with what's left of the Boston front line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in to work with our big men _ offense, defense,
post-up, positioning,'' Pitino said. ``For our guys who are
undersized at the center position, and at power forward, he's
probably the perfect undersized guy who's played the game at that
position.''

NEW PATRIOT DRAMA LIKELY TO UNFOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ If you're an avid Patsologist, you undoubtedly
circled  &UR; today &LR; 's date on your calendar the moment you laid eyes on
the 1999 NFL schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps you're new to this whole deal. Perhaps you're a
transplant. Perhaps you're new to football. Perhaps you don't
realize that each of the three previous Patriots-Cardinals games
played in Sun Devil Stadium have been quasi-surreal experiences for
Patriots fans. It kind of makes you wonder what delectable
spectating treat is in store for us Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The first Patriots excursion to the Valley of the Sun took place
Nov. 25, 1990. The Rod Rust Pats were 1-10 and losers of nine
straight when they lined up against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The big issue all week was who would be the starting
quarterback, Marc Wilson or Tommy Hodson? Steve Grogan had been
KO'd by the Eagles a few weeks earlier. Coach Rust, who was born to
operate behind a closed door with a full stack of videotapes at the
ready, and who was as ill-suited to be a general as he was to be a
disc jockey, had made this bit of NFL minutiae into a major affair
by stubbornly refusing to identify his starting quarterback, right
up to Sunday morning. Quipped colleague Frank Dell'Apa, ``Rust
guarded the starting quarterback announcement like the Enigma
code.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the crafty Rust opted for Hodson. The rookie acquitted
himself quite well, guiding the Patriots to a 14-14 standoff at the
half. He would finish 17 of 29 with 189 yards, two touchdowns, and
no interceptions, but the Patriots would be outscored, 21-0, in the
second half. Rookie Junior Robinson _ how's that for a forgotten
trivia item? _ would fumble away two kickoffs in his NFL debut.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the times, it was just another gruesome road
game during the Victor Kiam regime. But it did showcase the
astonishing conservatism and indecisiveness of Rust, who, when it
was over, refused to commit to Hodson for the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to depart from the procedures we've
followed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those procedures got him a 1-15 record. He has never had another
head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The next visit to Tempe will always be remembered as the day the
Patriots turned the Cardinals' Tom Tupa into a combination of Otto
Graham, Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, and David Copperfield during a
24-10 loss Sept. 29, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The 312 yards and three touchdowns are in the books forever. Tom
Tupa! Oh, but it was infinitely more embarrassing. The Patriots
should be thankful no one makes an annual perusal of third-down
yardage stats, because they would almost undoubtedly be the
one-game reverse record-holders.
</P>
<P>
   In this game, Tupa was third and long 13 times. He responded
with nine double-digit conversions for _ get this _ 217 yards,
seven first downs, and two touchdowns. Way to buckle up, guys!
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them third and 20 and they made it, for Christ's
sake,'' moaned defensive coordinator Joe Collier. Also third and
10, 11, 12, and just about every other number between 13 and 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' only touchdown? A 99-yard kickoff return by Jon
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   But the news hasn't always been bad out here.
</P>
<P>
   In the oft-bizarre annals of this truly unique NFL franchise, it
can be difficult to cite Example A or Example B as the
best/worst/most/least of anything, but the deciding play in the
Patriots' 23-21 victory Oct. 10, 1993, occupies a special niche. It
remains the most improbable winning play in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Situation: Patriots trailing, 21-16. First and 10 on their own
16. Just under five minutes left. Scott Secules, replacing the
injured Drew Bledsoe (sprained knee on a Ken Harvey hit 13 seconds
before halftime), connects with fullback Kevin Turner at the 20.
Turner legs it up to the Cardinals' 19, where he is grabbed by the
ankles. Before he goes down, he laterals (actually hands off) to an
oncoming Leonard Russell, who lugs it to the Cardinals' 2. Secules
then finds Ben Coates in the end zone for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Let's back up a bit. No sooner had Russell been brought down
when a flag was thrown. Every Patriot, every Patriot coach, every
Patriot fan, and, of course, every member of the media, assumed the
play would be brought back. After all, weren't these the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to bring it back,'' reasoned Pat
Harlow, by then a typical battle-scarred Patriot. ``I thought it
was a good lateral, but it's the Patriots, man.''
</P>
<P>
   After a full-scale officials powwow, the amazing decision was
rendered: The play stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure they were going to take something away from
us again,'' said Russell. ``I knew I was behind Kevin when he took
the ball, but I figured it was 50-50 that this could happen to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being on the other side. Turner was looking around for
help for a long time. Where were all the other Cardinals? Coach Joe
Bugel sure wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven or eight guys watching the play and three holding
an ankle,'' marveled the Cardinals' mentor.
</P>
<P>
   And how about Secules? This guy had spent six years not playing
behind Dan Marino. He signed with the Patriots as a free agent and
then watched as they drafted Bledsoe. This was his Big Moment, too,
as he finished his one great half of play 12 for 20 with 214 yards
and the touchdown pass. ``I'd like to introduce everybody's
All-American, Scott Secules,'' joked then-coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. This was the first Tuna Triumph as a Patriots
coach. Not that he wanted to make too much out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team that we didn't win the Rose Bowl today, but
this was a long time coming,'' Parcells said. ``I'm just happy to
get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, even the Tuna would have to remember the Great Lateral
among the thousands of plays he's witnessed during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird play,'' decided Russell. ``It's one of those
things that probably only happens once in your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably?
</P>
<P>
   We haven't even mentioned the 115-degree temperature on the
field and the players needing halftime IVs in '91. It's just not
normal here. You'll see.

HEAT CAUSES A LOT OF BURNING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How fitting to be discussing the Atlantic Division on Halloween.
But this is the anti-goblin division: No one here really scares
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion, Miami, is still reeling from a
first-round KO by the Knicks last year. The Heat are back almost
intact _ Terry Porter left _ and while Pat Riley has had to change
a few of his street-mugging drills to comply with the new rules, he
still has the most available talent, which is crucial. Everyone
else, with pretensions, expectations, or pipe dreams, is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks? No Patrick. The Nets? No Jayson. The Sixers? No big
men. The Magic? No Penny, Nick, Ike, or Horace. The Wizards? No
Rod, on some nights. The Celtics? No Danny.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom not too long ago was that this was the
deepest of the league's four divisions. With the injuries, that is
no longer the case. It's hard to make a rock-solid playoff case for
any of these teams, other than Miami, unless key people are ready.
Larry Brown, the Sixers' major-domo, sounded downright funereal (as
is his wont) on a conference call the other day as he talked about
all of his wounded lads. Jeff Van Gundy already has told his Knicks
that there's a fine line between the playoffs and the lottery. He
should know. He came awfully close to crossing it last season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change has been in Orlando, which ripped apart its
team and is starting over with a new coach, draft picks, and money
for free agents next summer (read: Tim Duncan). The Magic have
played well in the exhibition season, which means absolutely
nothing, of course. They are more than willing to take a hit this
season and have things (no state taxes, nice weather, no Michael
legacy) that Chicago simply can't compete with in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics? We will offer an unbiased, objective assessment of
their chances. We're still looking for one preview that has them
any higher than fifth _ a few have them dead last _ and even Sports
Illustrated for Kids picked them to finish in the basement, noting
nonetheless that they do play hard.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a preview of the division, with teams listed in
projected order of finish:
</P>
<P>
   1. MIAMI HEAT &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 33-17, first place (tie). Lost to New York in
first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Otis Thorpe, Harold Jamison, Anthony Carter.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Terry Porter, Terry Mills.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``It's So Hard to Wait.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Gee, how much time do you think Riley has spent
altering his practice drills? It was reported that the Heat are
even playing the entire floor in workouts. One thing hasn't
changed: They've already been involved in one ``incident'' leading
to one-game suspensions for Penny Hardaway and Rex Chapman. (Miami
miscreant Rex Walters was the victim.) All that aside, these guys
will adjust and still defend as tenaciously as ever. They were
among the top three teams last year in points allowed and defensive
field goal percentage. It's hard to see that focus changing. Alonzo
Mourning is coming off a breakthrough, MVP-caliber season. Tim
Hardaway is still around, as is everyone else of import from that
lovable group. They just need to find a way to score.
</P>
<P>
   2. NEW JERSEY NETS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 16-34, seventh place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Johnny Newman, Sherman Douglas, Michael
Cage.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Rony Seikaly, Eric Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key maybe: Jayson Williams.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Good Vibrations.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: This may be a bit of a reach, especially with
Williams's iffy situation. But coach Don Casey reports that
Williams is working out and hoping to be back in December. That
doesn't jibe with rumors that Williams may be out until February.
It's probably somewhere in between. But if the Nets can somehow
stock the middle with mediocrity until/if Williams returns, that
should be enough. Stephon Marbury is ready for an All-Star season,
as is Keith Van Horn. They still could use a healthy Kerry Kittles.
Casey is the anti-Cal, of course, and will be on the spot in his
first head job since 1990. The players lobbied for him, and it's up
to everyone to make it work. If the pieces are in place, there's
plenty with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   3. PHILADELPHIA 76ERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 28-22, third place. Lost to Indiana in second
round.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Billy Owens, Bruce Bowen, Rodrick Rhodes,
Jumaine Jones, Todd MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Rick Mahorn, Harvey Grant, Anthony Parker.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Learn to Be Still.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Looking for a reason why Orlando blew it all up?
You need to go no farther than the videotape, as Warner Wolf might
say, of last year's first-round series with the 76ers. Philadelphia
dominated the high-payroll, low-achieving Magic, and Orlando had to
see it wasn't going to work. But enough of that. The Sixers should
be even better this season, now that they've had a sniff of
success. The early-season injury problems are significant; Matt
Geiger is out for a month or more and Theo Ratliff is hobbled, too.
Larry Brown has resorted to bringing in Stanley Roberts, of all
people. The coach also has a dilemma about where to play Larry
Hughes. He has been dazzling so far, but he plays the same position
as Allen Iverson. Brown also has Bowen, who, as we all know here,
is a jump shot away from being a great player. (Or was that Andrew
DeClercq?)
</P>
<P>
   4. WASHINGTON WIZARDS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 18-32, sixth place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Ike Austin, Michael Smith, Richard Hamilton,
Aaron Williams, Laron Profit.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Ben Wallace, Tim Legler, Otis Thorpe, Calbert
Cheaney.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``One Way or Another.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Quick, what was the Wizards' main weakness last
year? And what position does Austin play? There, that's a quick
upgrade. There's also a favorable schedule for the first month,
which could enable Austin and his mates to get out of the blocks.
That's assuming they're healthy, which right now they're not. Smith
is Ben Wallace with a (marginally) better track record at the line.
But this team's success should still hinge on how its Big Three
play. Rod Strickland, when he wants to be, is one of the best point
guards in the league. He's been AWOL once already, however; not a
good sign for new coach Gar Heard. Mitch Richmond has his contract
and needs to show he can take a team somewhere other than the
lottery. Juwan Howard? It's time for him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   5. NEW YORK KNICKS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 27-23, fourth place. Lost to San Antonio in NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: John Wallace, Andrew Lang.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: None, unless you count Herb Williams.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key maybe: Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``In the Hush Before the Heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Van Gundy said last week that the Knicks have
proven to be a .500 team without Ewing the last two years. The good
side is that playing without Patrick is getting to be no big deal
for the Knicks. The bad side is that they can't be deemed a serious
threat unless he does play, especially with 10 of their first 13
games on the road. The Knicks learned how to win without Ewing but
still were lucky to get into the playoffs and through the first
round. They need Marcus Camby to continue to develop and for
someone (Lang?) to be a presence inside until/if Ewing returns.
They still have two dynamic scorers in Latrell Sprewell and Allan
Houston, but their point guard position is one of the worst in the
division. The Knicks are in transition, and the Ewing situation
isn't helping.
</P>
<P>
   6. BOSTON CELTICS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 19-31, fifth place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Danny Fortson, Eric Williams, Calbert
Cheaney, Adrian Griffin, Eric Washington, Wayne Turner.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Ron Mercer, Bruce Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``I Promise You a Happy Ending.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: You will have a hard time finding anyone who picks
the Celtics to finish higher than this. And most picks were
submitted before Fortson went down with a stress fracture. It's
hard to see how this team will, as the coach has promised, leapfrog
four clubs and make it into the playoffs (not that that is any
great feat in and of itself). The Celtics again have a number of
new faces, and most, if not all, will play. There's a lack of size,
unless Pervis Ellison miraculously makes it through a season, and
too many guys who play the same position. The loss of Fortson is
huge because he'll miss the early part of the season, when the
schedule favors the Celtics. It'd also be nice to see Antoine
Walker improve somewhere other than at the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   7. ORLANDO MAGIC &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 33-17, first place (tie). Lost to Philadelphia in
first round.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Tariq Abdul-Wahid, Ben Wallace, Corey
Maggette, Pat Garrity, and a lot of veterans who will have to be
cut.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Penny Hardaway, Ike Austin, Nick Anderson,
Horace Grant.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Brilliant Disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Unlike some other teams trying to come out of a
tailspin, these guys appear to have a plan. They decided they
couldn't win with what they had, and figured two (or three) steps
backward was the prudent way to go forward. If the exhibition
season is any gauge, there won't be a lot of easy nights when this
team is on your schedule. (Sort of like the Celtics.) There isn't
much here, and the Magic may have trouble getting 15-20 wins. But
that's what they wanted and why Doc Rivers has four years to turn
it around. He's got some pieces in place already and may soon
develop a reputation as a coach you might want to play for. He's
also got the Florida intangibles and the commitment of a
deep-pockets owner.

PUTTING KNOCK ON NFL INJURY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Teddy Atlas hears about Deion Sanders sustaining a
concussion and then coming back into the game and returning a punt
for a touchdown on a play he later said he remembered nothing
about, the first thing that comes to mind is not thoughts of
bravery. The first thing that comes to the mind of the veteran
fight trainer is that boxing gets a bum rap.
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of people in boxing who hear stories of NFL players
going back into games after concussions or other serious injuries _
as Sanders did a week ago for the Cowboys _ there is no comparison
between the violence in prizefighting and the long-term
debilitating effects of what football players are asked to endure.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when he thinks about how the NFL looks at concussions,
it makes Atlas's head hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has the reputation of being the most barbaric sport
there is, but if a fighter gets knocked out _ which is what a
concussion is _ he's out for 45 to 90 days,'' said Atlas. ``He
can't go back into the gym without a CAT scan. He don't just get up
and go back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries in football are much more rampant and much more
severe than in boxing. Neck injuries. Paralysis. Concussions.
Crippling injuries these guys have to deal with at the end of their
careers. You don't have that in boxing very often. It happens, but
nothing like in football. Incorporate high school and college
football and your mind would be boggled at the number of serious,
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing doesn't get nearly the serious injuries football does.
It's incredible the numbers every Sunday when you're watching, but
you just don't hear about it because football is much more
corporate. It's a well-run machine. Football dresses up its
violence better. Nobody says anything about what goes on in pro
football until someone like Steve Young gets a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ain't going back and playing this weekend, but how many
other guys are? If Steve Young is a lineman who got those
concussions, would they be treating him the same way? No they
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas's point is well taken. Every Sunday, handfuls of players
get knocked out in NFL games; they just don't call it a knockout.
Who can forget the rolled-up eyes of ex-Charger quarterback Stan
Humphries after he got KO'd against the Patriots a few years back?
A couple of weeks later, he was back in the saddle (although not
for long).
</P>
<P>
   But players don't get knocked out in the NFL. Oh, no. They get
``dinged,'' a harmless-sounding term.
</P>
<P>
   Dinged. Like when you flip your finger against the side of a
metal pan.
</P>
<P>
   Ding.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, no?
</P>
<P>
   Atlas and others will tell you otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think football is finally realizing what we realized a long
time ago,'' said Mark Ratner, executive director of the Nevada
State Athletic Commission and a college football referee on the
West Coast. ``It's a dangerous, dangerous occurrence. Boxing has
always been careful about head injuries. Football has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chuck Minker was the executive director here and I worked
for him, we used to talk about that all the time. How can they let
guys go back in and play football? I've seen it myself at the
college level, and it's wrong. We just had it last week at UNLV
against BYU. They had a player get a concussion and play the whole
game and not remember a thing about it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing would never do that, but the two sports are looked at
so differently. The fact is boxing is medically regulated better
than any sport, including football. Head blows are common in
boxing, but the very thought of sending a fighter back out after
being knocked out is anathema to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remember the fight when Buster Douglas got hit after
the bell by Louis Monaco and got knocked out, there was some
discussion about giving him a five- or 10-minute rest and then
restarting the fight. They didn't do it for one reason: because it
was crazy. But they do it in the NFL every week and no one says a
thing about it until someone like Steve Young goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not always proud of boxing, but I am on this point. Steve
Young and a lot of others are playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers quarterback has not played since being KO'd Sept. 29
by Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams without even being hit in the
head. The body blow he took snapped his head back so hard that he
was out cold before he hit the ground. It was his fourth concussion
in three years, by his accounting, or his seventh if you believe
his agent, Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue is whether Young will play again. Although he says
he no longer is suffering from postconcussive problems such as
headaches, memory loss, and blurred vision, he has yet to find a
neurologist who will clear him to play. Were he a professional
fighter who suffered as severe a knockout, he would not fight again
until January at the earliest, yet two weeks ago Young was
petitioning to get back into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe this is a ploy and Young will retire after the
season, saving the 49ers serious salary cap consequences. Perhaps,
but Sanders will play Sunday and so will Patriots running back
Terry Allen, who sustained a concussion last Sunday against the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Allen didn't get ``knocked out,'' of course. He got ``dinged.''
He didn't return to the game, either, but he'll be back Sunday
against the Cardinals. The Patriots will tell you that Allen was
never unconscious, which is true, but that doesn't mean he wasn't
concussed.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, coach Pete Carroll called Allen's concussion
``mild.'' A mild concussion is like ``minor surgery'': It means
you're not the one going through it.
</P>
<P>
   Allen will be back 45 days before a boxer would be allowed to
return after visiting what is called ``the black lights.''
</P>
<P>
   To boxing people such as Atlas, that reasoning borders on the
criminally insane. ``You try to do that in boxing,'' he said, ``and
somebody would have you arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching his son play Pop Warner football in Staten
Island, N.Y., for three years, Atlas pulled the boy out of the
sport, directing him toward baseball and golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I didn't want my own son to play football, people got a
kick out of that because I'm a boxing trainer,'' said Atlas. ``But
I saw how hard they got hit. You can only get hit from one
direction in boxing. Football is not a sport for your son if you
want him to stay healthy. You have to be lucky in football. You
have to be very blessed to play for long without getting a major
injury. It's not, `Will you get hurt?' it's just the degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boxing, at least you have some control over how you get hit
and they're only throwing one limb at your head from one direction,
not their whole bodies from every direction. I laugh when you hear
these football coaches talk about dingers. There's no dingers in
boxing. You get knocked out, you're out of the game. And you should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas recalled his own football experience, when he got a dinger
and walked to the wrong sideline. ``I couldn't find my way back to
the right sideline,'' he said. ``Somebody had to lead me over
there. I wasn't on the floor, but I was out. And they put me back
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is a strong supporter of Young, who he said ``is so
bright and so well-equipped he'll know what's right. I know how
Steve is. I know he's talked to the top people in the country about
his condition, and if they leave him alone, he'll make the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll also knows that Atlas and Ratner may have a point.
``When I was playing defensive back (in college), there were times
I'd hit a guy and I couldn't see,'' Carroll recalled with pride in
his voice. ``Lawyer (Milloy, the Patriots' knockout safety) and I
were talking about that, and he's had the same thing happen. You
can't see but you still can play. He had it happen earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably one play from being gone, but you can play
when you sort of feel like you can't see. It's wild but you can do
it. There is some of that warrior mentality now that goes beyond
the norm. You have to guard against that. After three or four
times, I imagine it's not too good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I imagine not.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine what they'd be saying if we were talking about a
prizefighter instead of a prized football player.
</P>
<P>
   Does the term ``criminal charges'' ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   Brotherly love is lacking
</P>
<P>
   Word is circulating that all is not peaches and cream in
Philadelphia. Eagles owner Jeff Lurie and director of football
operations Tom Modrak engaged in a desk-pounding, expletive-filled
argument at Veterans Stadium three weeks ago, and the animus
lingers. Modrak claims it was an effort to clear the air and things
have been smoothed over, but that's not what the word is around the
NFL. Modrak can walk on his five-year deal at the end of the
season, and if things don't improve, don't be surprised if he does.
Modrak was never in favor of hiring Andy Reid as head coach over
his candidate, Jim Haslett _ although he publicly denies that _ and
he remains angry that the new stadium and practice field he was
promised more than a year ago have not been started, which makes it
difficult to recruit free agents . . . When Tony Banks takes the
first snap for the Ravens  &UR; today &LR; , he will be coach Brian Billick's
third starting quarterback this season. Billick came into the job
this year saying he was responsible for the development of numerous
top quarterbacks over the years. Apparently he's trying to double
the number in one season. Stoney Case and Scott Mitchell were the
starters before Banks. All three are healthy . . . When the new
rule concerning footballs for kickers was announced this year, many
speculated that it was a response to Minnesota punter Mitch Berger,
who was a legend for doctoring balls. Well, maybe it wasn't that
simple. Berger is averaging 50.8 yards a punt, with a net of 41.8
yards, both best in the league. He may really explode Sunday,
kicking in the thin air of Denver's Mile High Stadium . . .
Everyone in New Orleans is disappointed over the Saints' 1-5 start,
but five-time Pro Bowl tackle Willie Roaf is so infuriated that he
called himself the team's best trade bait and said he did not know
how much longer he wanted to stay in New Orleans. He's not alone.
After last Sunday's 31-3 shellacking by the Giants, coach Mike
Ditka went up to club president Bill Kuharich and told him he
should fire the entire coaching staff. You get the feeling Ditka
doesn't want to do this anymore? Kuharich says he does not intend
to get rid of either . . . Kicking has always been an inexact
science that bordered on the mystical. A case in point is in
Arizona, where Scott Player has risen to fifth in the NFC in
punting after a dreadful start. What's the difference? According to
Player, it's that he no longer punts on Thursdays. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp finds strength
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think that a 40-pound weight loss has helped the
play of Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp, consider this: His
seven sacks are as many as he had in 16 games last season . . .
Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan experienced chest pains
Wednesday night and was taken by ambulance from the team offices to
a local hospital, where he underwent an angioplasty. When head
coach Dick Vermeil got to the hospital to check on him, Hanifan was
on a gurney, working on the run-blocking schemes for this week's
game plan . . . Rams director of personnel Charley Armey believes
the success of quarterback Kurt Warner is attributable in part to
playing in the fast-paced indoor Arena League for several years.
``He sees everything and reacts so quickly mentally,'' Armey said
of Warner, whose 131.5 quarterback rating and 72.8 completion
percentage are the best in the NFL. ``After six straight weeks, his
performance is no fluke.'' . . . The Rams hoped small electronic
earplugs would help their offensive linemen block out the noise at
Tennessee's Adelphia Coliseum, but the league prohibited their use.
The Titans learned of St. Louis's plans on the Internet and
notified the league. An angry Vermeil said, ``I thought innovation
was part of the game.'' . . . These are tough times for Bill
Parcells. His predicted romp to the AFC championship with the Jets
has collapsed into a weekly march toward defeat and more injury,
and he is now as absurdly criticized by the New York media as he
was once absurdly praised by them. Drew Bledsoe was asked recently
to reflect on his time with Parcells, and his assessment was not
much different from that of another ex-Parcells quarterback, Jeff
Hostetler. ``There was never a situation where I felt he was unfair
or overly harsh,'' Bledsoe said. ``I've never said that, nor did I
believe it. But he was not a fun guy to play for except when what
he was saying wasn't directed at you. I did recognize there was a
method to his madness, though. It's very easy to define greatness
in football: winning football games. He's won every place he's
been. He's the only guy to take three teams from losers to winners,
from losers to the Super Bowl.'' Which makes him a great coach
regardless of what happens with the Jets this year . . . Bills GM
John Butler has a surprising choice for Coach of the Year through
the first half of the season. ``Parcells has done a remarkable
job,'' Butler said. ``He's a great coach. Great coach. He's done a
great job with that team. They lost so many players and they're
still in every game. A lot of that is coaching.'' Someone should
remind the New York media that great coaching often doesn't equal a
great number of victories. In fact, it's often the opposite because
great coaching is maximizing your talents and minimizing your
weaknesses, not merely winning when you have the most talent.
Parcells has done the former as well as anyone in history.

WOODY HELPS PATRIOTS MAKE UP GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Damien Woody grew up in the hot, muggy conditions
of Beaverdam, Va., so the dry heat of Arizona won't even enter his
mind Sunday as the Patriots take on the Cardinals in what has the
potential to be New England's first blowout win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost on the big center's mind will be making sure the
Patriots string together two straight weeks of top-level
run-blocking, finally ending the questions that have haunted the
offensive line this season.
</P>
<P>
   Woody isn't used to such criticism. In his days at Boston
College, Omari Walker and Mike Cloud ran quite well behind the big
line, and Woody took it for granted that things would be even
better at the pro level.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until last week that New England's veterans caught
up to Woody, who has turned out to be a gem of a pick (17th
overall).
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Denver, the offensive line began opening
holes, the runners found them, and the Patriots amassed a
season-high 133 yards rushing, 106 of them from Terry Allen, who
scored two rushing touchdowns while rookie Kevin Faulk added
another in a 24-23 win.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the success came up the middle, the area Woody patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasized the run last week, and we've got to keep
emphasizing it,'' said Woody. ``Our success last week, I think, was
all because of the rushing attempts (28) we had. We kept with it.
We had a lot of 1- or 2-yard gains, but we stuck with it and hoped
the bigger gains would come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is to get it established, maintain it, and then make
it better and just see where it goes. What we don't want to do is
take a step backward with it. It's got to be in our mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time the line had set its mind on positive
run blocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the emphasis for us quite a bit,'' said Woody, ``but
then we'd get away from the run, and it would be difficult to get
into that rhythm you need.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk last week that the Broncos had ``allowed''
the Patriots to run, preferring to avoid their explosive air
attack, but Woody and coach Pete Carroll didn't feel that was the
case.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they would like to leave no doubt. Another reason to
establish the run is to win the time-of-possession battle, which
not only saves wear and tear on the receivers but also keeps the
defense on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps you get a breather when the offense holds on
to the ball and they have longer drives because they're running
it,'' said cornerback Ty Law. ``If it's the other way, that's fine,
but it's a plus. It helps the whole team when that happens. That
would help us a lot this week in a hot climate because you don't
want either side to be out there more than they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who has been cleared to play after sustaining a mild
concussion in the fourth quarter last week, would fit nicely behind
this line if it can drive the Cardinals' big linemen back enough
for him to hit the hole and then make his cuts in the secondary.
The Cardinals have had huge problems stopping the run; they are
ranked 30th overall, allowing 136.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the good things a running game can do for us, so maybe
we'll keep trying to emphasize it,'' said Woody. ``I think that's
what everybody here is trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody has worked on some things the past few weeks, including
his shotgun snaps, which had been erratic for two or three games.
Now he's giving Bledsoe at least belt-high snaps, where before they
were ankle-high, which is tough for a 6-foot-5-inch quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's going pretty good for me right now,'' he said.
``I'm pretty comfortable on the field. It's just been a smooth
transition for me from college to the pro game. There are still
things I need to get better at, like recognition things, technique
things, but those things will come with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody thinks he helped himself greatly by reporting in mid-May,
on the first day that draft picks were scheduled to arrive to team
headquarters. It got him off and running with the playbook, and it
got him accustomed to the pro life and to Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation I came into was really good,'' Woody said.
``Guys around me helped me out and made the transition a lot
smoother. It makes it tough when you don't have that. People always
keep me up even when I make mistakes. Coming out in my first year,
I couldn't have asked for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carroll, ``This guy is really holding his own. He's done a
tremendous job in certain areas for a young center. We're excited
to see how much better he's going to be the second half of the year
and how he progresses from his first year to his second year.''

 &HT;    Georgia's air attack didn't get off the ground
 &HT;    By John Manasso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ Georgia had the running game necessary to beat
Florida. But it didn't have the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who entered with a rushing attack averaging 176
yards per game, totaled 155. In the 1990s, the Gators have allowed
opponents to rush for more than 100 yards only 20 times. The Gators
have lost 16 of those games.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia got poor performances from quarterback Quincy Carter
and the offensive line. Carter completed just 6 of 23 passes for 76
yards, no touchdowns and one interception. He was chased around the
backfield all game and took several heavy hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs partly blamed the heavy rain that fell throughout
the game, but mostly they blamed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Florida) kept a pretty good pass rush on me,'' Carter said.
``They were coming from pretty much everywhere. We got outplayed.
There's pretty much no other way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   After an impressive three-play, 38-second scoring drive on the
its opening possession, Georgia struggled mightily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just totally blame it on the pass rush,'' said
Carter, who set career highs against the Gators last year by
connecting on 33 of 49 passes for 368 yards. ``I wasn't totally in
sync, either. I got rocked a little bit. It's our team. Our offense
wasn't clicking in the second half. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   In that second half, the Bulldogs did not complete their first
pass until less than 14 minutes remained. In the second half,
Carter was 2-of-10 for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A key play came with 9:20 left in the third quarter when
starting left tackle Alex Jennings went out with a sprained right
ankle. He did not return. Playing in his stead was freshman George
Foster, meaning that along with right tackle Jon Stinchcomb, the
Bulldogs had freshmen at both tackle positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was kind of a problem; then again, we lost one of
our top linemen,'' running back Patrick Pass said. ``We were
playing out there with a couple of freshmen, and it's hard to play
against a Florida team with freshmen. And you've got to give credit
to Alex Brown. He had a great game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carter) can't do it all. We've got to protect him more than
we did.''

RANGERS AND LEETCH END ONE DROUGHT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A struggling Rangers team faced an equally inept
Montreal team Saturday night. The result was an entertaining
contest, one that ended in a 2-2 tie, but at least the Rangers
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a remarkable effort from Brian Leetch, it was far from
an offensive explosion from either team at Molson Center. But it
might have seemed like one to the Rangers, who had been shut out in
three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch scored his first goal of the season and assisted on
another. And Mike Richter (29 saves) turned in a brilliant effort
in his 500th National Hockey League game. On the downside, the
Rangers (4-7-2 and without a victory in five games) again struggled
on the power play, going 0 for 4, and they are now a woeful 4 for
59 on the year.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring drought finally ended at 19 minutes 2 seconds of the
first period _ a total of 253:33 over the last five games _ when
Leetch fired a slap shot from the left wing circle past Montreal
goalie Jeff Hackett, tying the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Leetch _ long considered one of the finest
offensive defensemen in the game _ ended the scoreless streak. It
broke one for Leetch, too. The goal was Leetch's first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the goal was set up by a harmless shot by Mike York
on the previous shift. With the Rangers in the midst of a line
change behind the play, York wheeled and fired the puck on net in
the Canadiens' zone, before turning back for his bench. Hackett
inexplicably covered the rebound of his easy stop, setting up a
face-off in his zone.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor won the draw from Saku Koivu, pulling the puck back
to Leetch, who went backhand-forehand-backhand with the puck before
skating around a confused Brian Savage into the open. Leetch then
blasted the Rangers' 12th shot of the evening past Hackett, and
more than 12 periods of frustration was over.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rangers' team records of four straight scoreless games
and 341:42 without a goal still stand from 1928, the year the
Rangers won their first Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch's goal negated a Martin Rucinsky tap-in from the left
post on a Montreal power play 6:22 into the game. The Canadiens'
power play was the second-worst in the league, behind only the
Rangers. After tying the score, Leetch set up Mike Knuble's score
at 17:07 to give the Rangers their first lead in 254 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had last led on Oct. 19 against San Jose, the last
time they had scored a goal. Since then, they have had to answer
questions about their lack of production. Leetch, as captain of the
team, had answered many of the questions. So it was not surprising
that Leetch seemed like he was on a personal mission Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Richter matched Hackett save for save, as both goalies kept
their teams in the game. And then Kevin Stevens gobbled up a
turnover in the Rangers' zone and skated to neutral ice. Stevens
curled at the red line along the left wing boards and passed to
Leetch at center ice. Leetch, who had four shots in the second
period, skated in with Knuble on Hackett on a 2-on-1 with Eric
Weinrich back attempting to defend the play.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Leetch chose not to shoot. He slid the puck over to
Knuble, who was skating down right wing, and Knuble's wrister beat
Hackett's glove to the right corner of the net for his second goal
of the season. It was the first time in five games the Rangers had
scored more than one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not last long, however. Koivu blasted a one-timer
past Richter from the top of the circles just 30 seconds into the
final period to give the Canadiens another power-play goal and tie
the score at 2-2.

FLYERS BEAT DEVILS, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Flyers played without Eric Lindros and with
their backup goaltender, but they still managed a 5-3 triumph over
the Devils, who collapsed in the second half of the last period
Saturday night at First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 3-2 lead about midway through the third
period, when the rookie John Madden scored his first goal of the
season. But the Flyers then erupted for three goals and also missed
a penalty shot by Valery Zelepukin, who shot wide to the right of
Martin Brodeur with 2 minutes 24 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the lead and we wanted more instantly instead of
settling down and trying to control the tempo,'' said Bobby Holik
of the Devils (6-4-1).
</P>
<P>
   Along with the game, the Devils may lose Krzysztof Oliwa for a
few days and Randy McKay to a possible suspension by the league for
an infraction against Ulf Samuelsson, the defenseman for the
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers took the lead just 51 seconds after the opening
face-off when Sandy McCarthy's crossing pass from the left side hit
the left skate of Devils' defenseman Lyle Odelein standing alone in
front of his goal and sailed past Brodeur. It was the second goal
of the season for McCarthy and it started with Daymond Langkow
winning a face-off from John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Sharifijanov tied it for the Devils with his first goal of
the season with 4:42 left in the first. Odelein started the play
with a long pass to Jay Pandolfo, who had only Brian Boucher to
beat. The Flyers' rookie goalie, making only his second appearance
in the league, stopped Pandolfo but only temporarily because
Sharifijanov followed the play and leaped on the loose puck.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi, who is leading the Flyers in scoring, gave the
Flyers a 2-1 lead with his sixth of the season on a deflection in
the low slot off Langkow's shot from the right point with 4:42 left
in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils came out strong in the third period and tied the
score at 2-2 on Petr Sykora's second and Madden's first, 6:20 into
the period. Sykora took a pass from Scott Gomez from behind the
goal and was allowed two chances to beat Boucher from close range
in front.
</P>
<P>
   Madden gave the Devils a 3-2 lead 8:47 into the period, when he
beat Boucher with a shot from near the blue line. But that lead
lasted only 28 seconds because Mark Creig jammed the net and scored
his second of the season from a rebound off a shot by Simon Gagne
at 9:15. What made it worse for the Devils was that Dan McGillis
gave the Flyers the lead with his second goal of the season with
6:01 left and John LecLair scored the final goal of the game with
2:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils benched Patrik Elias and Denis Morrison for what they
termed precautionary reasons. Elias played his first game of the
season in Friday's victory at Carolina after signing his contract
hours earlier. He missed all of training camp along with Brendan
Morrison, who was scratched again nursing a swollen left foot from
a shot by Ken Daneyko in Friday morning's skate before the Carolina
game.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros missed his second game in a row because of a virus
infection that has resulted in a low blood count.

HURRICANES BEAT ISLANDERS, 4-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The talent hasn't been there, but now the
energy is gone, too, and the Islanders are sinking.
</P>
<P>
   They came into Saturday night's game against the Carolina
Hurricanes with the fewest points in the National Hockey League and
succumbed quietly in a 4-0 loss before 8,944 at Nassau Coliseum.
For the first time this season, the Islanders were roundly booed by
the home fans as they left the ice after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing went right for the Islanders (2-6-1). Passes did not
connect, shots missed their mark and the special teams were
completely ineffective. The Islanders' power play went 0 for 5 and
the penalty killers allowed three goals on four chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is very frustrating,'' said Coach Butch
Goring, who sharply criticized his team for the first time this
season. ``It hurts when you're never even in the hockey game. I'm
going to make life a lot more difficult for the guys. We're just
not committed right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Eric Fichaud, the Islanders' former ``franchise''
goalie, was the best player on the ice Saturday night. He made 24
saves for his first shutout of the season. Felix Potvin made 27
stops for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Fichaud was one of the Islanders' hottest
prospects. But the Islanders landed a better prospect in Roberto
Luongo while Fichaud was having problems with nagging injuries.
Disheartened by Fichaud's lack of progress, the Islanders traded
him to Edmonton, and after a stop at Nashville, he is now
Carolina's backup to Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not ask for a better scenario,'' Fichaud said. ``First
I get the win, second I get the shutout, and it's especially great
against this team in this building.''
</P>
<P>
   Fichaud faced an Islander team that was coming off its worst
defeat of the season, a 6-3 loss last Wednesday to Pavel Bure and
the Florida Panthers. That game was not nearly as close as the
score was. The Islanders were outplayed from the drop of the puck,
and afterward were ripped by their captain, Kenny Jonsson, who
wanted to see more heart and effort.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson did not get a better effort Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem is everyone is doing their own thing,'' he
said. ``It's more discipline than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's exceptionally young defense (the average age Saturday
night was about 22) has been plagued by injuries, and Jamie Heward
(concussion) and Rich Pilon (knee) are nowhere near returning.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes dominated the Islanders for nearly the entire
game..
</P>
<P>
   They took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes on goals by Sean
Hill and Sami Kapenen, whose score was on a power play, while
outshooting the Islanders by 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' third goal came in the second period, a power
play score by the rookie David Tanabe at 1 minute 11 seconds. Jeff
O'Neill tallied Carolina's fourth goal on a power play late in the
third period.

VIRGINIA TECH BEATS PITSSBURGH, 30-17  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ At one point during the fourth quarter of Saturday
night's game between Virginia Tech and Pittsburgh, game officials
lost track of the downs on the field and had to telephone officials
in the booth to find out whether it was second down or third down.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitt Panthers wished they could have confused Virginia Tech
the same way. But Virginia Tech, ranked No. 3 in both the New York
Times computer ranking and in the Associated Press news media poll,
proved just a little too strong on both sides of the ball, and
walked away with a 30-17 victory before a rather subdued crowd of
42,678 at Pitt Stadium. Much of the enthusiasm had been wrung from
the crowd in the first half when Virginia Tech (7-0, 3-0 Big East)
jumped to a 27-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (4-4, 2-3), on the strength of quarterback David
Priestley's arm, tried to come back with an air attack in the
second half. But Priestley could not connect in the end zone, and
the Hokies' defense was not in a giving mood.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, arguments can continue over whether Virginia
Tech, which has not played a demanding schedule, deserves its
ranking among college football's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had a smart offensive game plan, balancing
quick-hitting passes with a rushing attack based on finesse. But
the Panthers soon found that it was best to put the ball in the air
if they were going to have any chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   So Priestley filled the air with footballs; his two main targets
were receivers Latef Grim and Antonio Bryant. It did not matter in
the first half, because as hard as the Panthers tried, they could
not keep up with Virginia Tech, which demonstrated why its offense
leads the Big East in rushing and scoring. The Hokies entered the
game rushing for an average of 242.7 yards and scoring an average
of 43.3 points. And they were fresh from a week off. Two weeks ago
the Hokies mauled Syracuse, 62-0, and it appeared the Panthers
would be in for a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had a punt blocked on its first offensive series of
the game, when Virginia Tech's Andre Davis punched through the
middle of the line of scrimmage and got a hand on Greg DeBolt's
punt. Two plays later the Hokies scored their first touchdown when
Michael Vick started left and cut back right on an option keeper
and went 46 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies went ahead by 10-0 with 1:33 to play in the first
quarter on a 46-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. That score was
set up by a 34-yard run by Shyrone Stith, part of Virginia Tech's
one-two punch in its rushing attack. First the Hokies would hit
Pittsburgh straight on with Stith, a 5-foot-8-inch, 209-pound
battering ram. Then they would pop the Panthers with Andre
Kendrick, a 5-7, 180-pound speedster capable of getting around the
corner. In the first half, Kendrick had 106 yards on 6 carries,
including a 59-yarder to the 12-yard line in which it seemed every
Panther defender on the field had a chance at bringing him down.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh struck back near the beginning of the second quarter
when Priestley put together a seven-play, 72-yard drive capped by a
1-yard run by Nick Goings. Priestley was 4 of 4 passing for 69
yards on the drive, which cut Virginia Tech's lead to 10-7 with
14:09 to play in the half. Virginia Tech turned up the defensive
pressure on Priestley from that point, with defensive ends Corey
Moore and John Engelberger swooping in from opposite corners of the
line and making sure that Priestley was picking himself up off the
turf once he had let the ball go on almost every passing play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vick was the perfect maestro for Virginia Tech. He
avoided most of the heavy pressure and kept the team moving. On a
37-yard touchdown pass to Davis that gave Tech a 17-7 lead in the
second quarter, he demonstrated why he is as dangerous a passer as
he is a runner. Pittsburgh cornerback Demetrious Rich had nearly
perfect coverage on Davis as he ran down the right side. It would
take a perfect pass to beat the coverage. Vick threw one, a
beautiful pass into the end zone that fell over Davis' shoulder and
just past Rich's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 27-7 at halftime, the Panthers came out with plenty
of fight in the second half, scoring a touchdown on a 16-yard pass
from Priestley to Antonio Bryant to narrow Tech's lead to 27-14 at
12:02 of the third quarter. They had a golden opportunity to put
even more pressure on the Hokies at the beginning of the fourth
quarter, but could not punch the ball in for a touchdown on six
tries inside of the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Instead they
settled for a 23-yard field goal by Lotz that made it 27-17 with
14:47 to play.

HEALTH COSTS HIT THE WALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sting from the company flu shot likely still fresh in their
minds, workers opening their benefits packages for next year are
staring at a sharper, longer-lasting pain: big changes in
health-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll deductions for insurance are going up, some office visit
costs, too. Prescription co-payments are spiking, especially for
name brand drugs. And many employees will have to start from
scratch with a new plan as their employers switch providers to save
money.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit: huge increases in health-care insurance costs.
After years of little or no price hikes, employers are seeing
premium increases in the double digits. Benefits consultant Hewitt
Associates projects average increases of as much as 10 percent for
big companies and 15-plus percent for smaller employers next year,
compared with 3.7 percent just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's getting hit right now with rate increases,'' said
John Coyle, senior vice president in the Phoenix office of the
Segal Co., a national benefits consulting firm. ``I think most
employers are going to funnel it down to you and me. Clearly, the
days of single-digit rate increases are behind us, at least in the
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame the hefty increases on everything from
profit-starved HMOs to those ubiquitous Claritin ads.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is widespread, as nearly two out of three workers buy
health insurance on the job. Increased premiums, which are far
outstripping the average salary raise of 3.8 percent and general
inflation of 2.8 percent, mean less take-home pay. For those
already struggling to pay the bills, the increases could force them
to select a plan that provides fewer benefits or even skip
coverage, boosting the ranks of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Hewitt, a 42-year-old analyst with the Arizona
Department of Economic Security, is already feeling the pinch. The
state's new health insurance rates went into effect earlier this
month, and her monthly premiums for family coverage from Cigna
jumped to $150 from $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it would go up, but it was a surprise that it was
going up that much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, a married mother of two, said a slightly cheaper plan
was available, but she didn't want to change doctors. She has
diabetes and asthma and makes regular office visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to live with $50 a month less,'' she said.
``There's not a whole lot you can do about it.'' &QL; 
RELATIVE BARGAINS
</P>
<P>
   Of course, employers that offer insurance plans still shoulder
the biggest chunk of employee health-care costs. And the premiums
and co-pays are a relative bargain compared with buying insurance,
or paying a doctor's bill or prescription costs, on your own.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden, sharp increases, which surfaced in this year's
coverage but are most widespread for the 2000 plan year, are
stunning.
</P>
<P>
   And many employers are seeing increases far above the average
projections.
</P>
<P>
   Insight Enterprises, a rapidly growing Tempe computer seller
with 2,500 workers, says health-care companies have proposed
premium hikes of 15 to 20 percent, double the norm. Chandler's
benefits coordinator was told the city's health-care insurance
costs would have jumped at least 18 percent if not for a contract
cap. They still went up 10 percent in one plan and 7.5 percent in
another, after some concessions in other areas. That compares with
3 to 5 percent increases the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross says the average increase in its plans for 2000 is 9
to 12 percent. &QL; 
FACTORS DRIVING UP COSTS
</P>
<P>
   There are several factors driving up costs, health-care analysts
and providers say.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   More people are going to the doctor, running up the number of
claims. Patients haven't thought twice about going because of
minimal, if any, charges for office visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have a $5 co-pay to go to a doctor, it's not an
incentive for them to ask whether or not this runny nose really
requires a physician visit,'' said Rich Boals, chief operating
officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona, the state's
largest health plan. ``Now, we're moving away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many HMOs and other managed-care providers are reeling from
years of low prices designed to snare market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're under a lot of pressure from Wall Street to get their
profits up, and the way they do that is by raising premiums,'' said
Larry Levitt, principal analyst on the Kaiser Family Foundation and
Health Research and Education Trust Employer Health Benefits survey
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug expenses are skyrocketing. They've grown at
double-digit rates nearly every year since 1980, accelerating to
14.1 percent in 1997, according to the Employee Benefits Research
Institute. It's the most rapidly increasing medical care expense
for job-based insurance, Kaiser says.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are at work: Drugs are more and more expensive
due to heavy spending on high-tech research and development by
their makers as well as big advertising and marketing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaigns _ who hasn't seen a television
commercial for the allergy medication Claritin? _ have employees
everywhere asking for the more expensive name-brand drugs.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have lost much of their cost-savings luster, with nearly 85
percent of employees now enrolled in such plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the efficiencies that HMOs were able to provide early
on were really one-time efficiencies,'' said Gary Shutler, a senior
communications consultant in Hewitt's Newport Beach, Calif.,
office, which covers Arizona. ``Now, they're caught up in some of
the same spiraling costs of new technology and other drivers
(affecting all businesses).'' &QL; 
LITTLE ROOM TO SQUEEZE
</P>
<P>
   There's also little room to squeeze any more discounts out of
doctors and hospitals, who have been burned by backlash against
HMOs and the quality of coverage. Many HMOs, for example, have
dropped such cost-saving requirements as pre-certification, said
Boals, of Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to some ugly numbers for employers and, in most
cases, employees. Some employers are reluctant to pass along the
premium increases given the tight labor market and competition for
workers, but most are finding the double-digit increases too much
to absorb on their own. At the least, they're tweaking their plans
to share some of the financial pain with workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of increasing employees' payroll contributions by a big
percentage, Chandler bumped up co-payments for office visits and
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they have a co-pay for office visits and they have
a little higher prescription cost, they don't pay a whole lot more
out of their paychecks,'' said Mary Fedor, benefits coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   In one plan, the office visit co-pay goes from nothing to $5,
the other from $5 to $10, effective Jan. 1. &QL; 
TIERED CO-PAYMENTS
</P>
<P>
   For prescriptions, the city adopted one of the newest plans in
the business: a tiered co-payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one price for most prescription drugs, payment is
based on the type of drug: generic, brand name and brand names
outside the formulary, or approved list of covered drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In one Chandler plan, employees who used to pay $5 for most
prescriptions will now pay $7 for generic, $12 for approved
name-brand drugs and $25 for all others.
</P>
<P>
   Finova Group Inc. and Phoenix Newspapers Inc., parent of ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic,'' are among the other converts. Insight is
also considering a tiered prescription plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is looking at our plan and saying what in
here is a kind of Cadillac (coverage) and that we could maybe
reduce the benefit or increase the co-pay and not have to pass so
much on to the employee,'' said Louise Dunn, Insight benefits
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prescription changes will hit those with a cabinet
full of medicine and regular visits to the drugstore especially
hard, it will help others. Employees who've been shelling out the
full price for non-formulary drugs _ more than $100 for Merck's
popular migraine medicine Maxalt, for example _ suddenly find
they're saving money.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt River Project, one of Arizona's largest utilities, also
changed its prescription plan, but with a twist. The company
lowered the co-payment on generic drugs to $4 from $7 and increased
the payment on name-brand drugs to $12 from $7.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is give people incentive to use a less expensive,
generic drug, said Leo Elias, manager of benefits, health and
technical services.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, SRP employees will see more money
taken out of their paychecks for insurance. Dependent-care coverage
is going up 10 to 13 percent for next year depending on the plan.
That compares with increases of just 4 percent or so the past few
years, Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   The company laid out the specific increases and the reasons
behind them in a newsletter last week.
</P>
<P>
   To balance things out, many employers are boosting or adding
benefits in other areas, from chiropractic visits to group auto and
life insurance. Most are relatively cheap for companies but are
valuable in workers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do,'' said Coyle, the consultant, ``is
ease your pain.'' &QL;

<P>
   Photo No. 3 is a close-up and features a curdled rivulet of
blood running from the dead man's nose and down the broad leather
strap half-covering his baked pumpkin of a face.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken just after 350-pound Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis was
killed in Florida's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before jailers flipped the switch on Old Sparky one day
last July, Davis developed a nosebleed, dripping electric ooze all
over the clean white shirt he wore for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Smith, the
photograph is stomach-turning proof that Tiny Davis, convicted of
the 1982 murders of a pregnant woman and her two young daughters,
was ``brutally tortured to death.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in September, Smith found himself in the minority of a
4-3 decision in which Florida's highest court found the electric
chair had operated correctly in Davis' case and should not be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   So, Smith posted three pictures of the executed man on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Photo No. 1 shows a dead Tiny with his shaved head exposed and
his bloody shirt opened.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is a full view of a cinched-up, wired Tiny just after his
demise. &QL; 
BARBARITY IN FULL VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Justice Smith posted the photographs on the Web site of
Florida's Supreme Court because he wanted average citizens to get a
good look at the barbarity of an electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to strip away the polite dialogue of a courtroom and
show you, in full color, what it's like to charbroil a man. He
hoped the nauseating photographs would shock and disgust good
people. He wanted to irritate anyone who saw them, make them angry,
furious, even outraged.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread across the Internet, hundreds of thousands of
people from all over America accessed the photographs. Viewers were
angry. They were furious. They were positively outraged _ that
Justice Smith hadn't included ``more'' photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge never saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   I figured anyone with a shred of humanity had gone extinct long
ago, but apparently there is one example left and his name is
Leander Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Justice Smith was so busy trying to reconcile justice
with compassion that he never saw ``Real TV,'' Jerry Springer, or
any program on the Fox network. &QL; 
REAL PEOPLE, REAL PAIN
</P>
<P>
   America loves programs showing real people in real pain,
particularly (but not exclusively) if the person suffering is a
``bad guy.'' That's why the death penalty is so popular.
</P>
<P>
   We've been dispatching murderers behind the dark walls of
prisons for years now, and Judge Smith has proved we want more.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see it.
</P>
<P>
   If not, you wouldn't be asking yourself, ``When in hell is this
guy going to print the name of that Web site?'' (It's
www.firn.edu/supct/deathwarrants.)
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily pulled the plug on
Florida's electric chair. It's trying to decide if zapping someone
is legal under the Constitution. If the justices OK the procedure,
I'd guess the citizens of Florida and elsewhere will demand that
courts refrain from putting pictures of dead guys on the Internet
and, instead, broadcast the killings live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arizona, we executed a murderer by lethal injection just
last week. Of course, in order to get TV viewers to watch a
killing, government will have to offer something besides a needle.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of thousands of men, women and children who've
sought out the Tiny Davis pictures prove that Americans enjoy
variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photos on this Web site are WONDERFUL!'' one woman
e-mailed the court.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal injection is efficient but tasteless. In fast food and
justice, Americans want choices, and could not care less if what's
being served is healthy. On the menu of execution techniques, which
do you think we'd choose?

FRIED KILLER NOW SERVED ON THE WEB

<P>
   Photo No. 3 is a close-up and features a curdled rivulet of
blood running from the dead man's nose and down the broad leather
strap half-covering his baked pumpkin of a face.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken just after 350-pound Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis was
killed in Florida's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before jailers flipped the switch on Old Sparky one day
last July, Davis developed a nosebleed, dripping electric ooze all
over the clean white shirt he wore for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Smith, the
photograph is stomach-turning proof that Tiny Davis, convicted of
the 1982 murders of a pregnant woman and her two young daughters,
was ``brutally tortured to death.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in September, Smith found himself in the minority of a
4-3 decision in which Florida's highest court found the electric
chair had operated correctly in Davis' case and should not be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   So, Smith posted three pictures of the executed man on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Photo No. 1 shows a dead Tiny with his shaved head exposed and
his bloody shirt opened.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is a full view of a cinched-up, wired Tiny just after his
demise. &QL; 
BARBARITY IN FULL VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Justice Smith posted the photographs on the Web site of
Florida's Supreme Court because he wanted average citizens to get a
good look at the barbarity of an electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to strip away the polite dialogue of a courtroom and
show you, in full color, what it's like to charbroil a man. He
hoped the nauseating photographs would shock and disgust good
people. He wanted to irritate anyone who saw them, make them angry,

JACKSON FACES TOUGH DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Knight's sore ankle is nearly ready for
action, which is good news for the Lakers but bad news for coach
Phil Jackson, who now faces a difficult decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' active roster must be pared from 15 to 12 by 3 p.m.
Monday. Kobe Bryant (broken right hand) is headed for the injured
list and Jackson had figured Knight would join him, leaving the
Lakers with just one more cut to make.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA rules require a player on injured reserve to miss five
games, and Jackson doesn't want to lose Knight for that long. The
7-foot forward-center is sorely needed and might be ready to play
by Saturday, the third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the five-game rule ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy could be injured, he could be ready after the first or
second game, but somehow they penalize you if you don't have him on
the roster,'' he said. ``He won't be ready for the Utah and
Vancouver games (Tuesday and Wednesday), but still ready for the
weekend against Portland and Dallas, which is highly likely. . . .
Our decision is how can we project a week and a half down the road
after five games, and what importance is it to our team to have a
player of his size on the team?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight severely sprained his right ankle Oct. 13 and only
recently began practicing again. He has not participated in
full-contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to sneak in there (to practice) for the last
week or so, just trying every day a little more, a little more,''
Knight said. As for playing opening night in Salt Lake City, ``if
it were up to me, I would say yeah,'' he said. ``Obviously, I would
rather not go on the injured list, but I don't want to do anything
that's going to make it nagging the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outage: The season starts Tuesday, but it's still unclear
who the Lakers' starting power forward will be, Robert Horry or
A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made that decision yet,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's rotation is starting to take shape, though, with Fox
and guard Brian Shaw designated as the first two subs off the
bench. Rookie Devean George, despite an impressive exhibition
season, might not make the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy prospect: Former LSU standout John Williams worked out for
the Lakers on Saturday, but the beefy Crenshaw High product is not
likely to get a contract or solve the Lakers' need for a power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted 12th overall in 1986 by Washington, the promising
Williams played almost nine seasons for the Bullets, Clippers and
Pacers before weight problems ended his NBA career in 1995. He's
been playing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to weigh him and see how he looked,'' Jackson said
of Williams, who played for Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter at
LSU. Jackson declined to say how much the 6-foot-9 Williams weighs
but by appearances, he's not in NBA shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bison watch: The Lakers continue to monitor the status of
retired Detroit forward Bison Dele. Dele, who played briefly for
Jackson in Chicago, could be acquired in trade if he decides to
play again. Jackson has not spoken to Dele but said he's returned
to the U.S. (he'd been in Lebanon) and is living in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got word through this ear and that ear that came back to me
that he's deliberating,'' Jackson said. ``He's considering whether
he wants to play basketball.''

GOODYKOONTZ: ON TV, QUALITY IS NO GUARAN TEE OF FAME AND FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the November sweeps hard upon us, with all the leprechauns
and prime-time game shows that implies, now is a good time to
assess the new fall television season's hits and misses.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that it's too early to judge TV's successes and
failures _ after all, the baseball playoffs have wreaked havoc with
two networks' schedules, and it takes some series a little time to
build an audience.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's ``never'' too early to judge television.
Just ask the people who made ``Manchester Prep'' _ Fox pulled the
``Cruel Intention''s-inspired drama before it aired a single
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Probably safe to chalk up ``Manchester Prep'' on the loser side
of the ledger, then.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, ``Judging Amy,'' the chick-friendly drama on
CBS, is a Top 10 hit. Sure, it's just a slightly better version of
the treacly NBC hit ``Providence'' (brilliant, ambitious babe of a
daughter returns to live at childhood home, encounters challenges,
finds self, others, etc.), but quality doesn't matter. Ratings do.
</P>
<P>
   This is TV, after all.
</P>
<P>
   In general terms, the season has been easy to judge so far:
Winners _ dramas; losers _ sitcoms. Of course, there is more to it
than that. Some bad shows deserve to fail. Some good shows don't.
And a gaping middle ground exists between those extremes. Herewith
a look at which shows fall where: &QL; 
JUST DESSERTS &QL; 
``The West Wing:'' It's sometimes sappy, it's occasionally corny
and they talk all the time. What's not to like? Nothing. Aaron
Sorkin's logical extension of ``Sports Night'' is a showcase for a
top-flight cast, especially Brad Whitford as a deputy chief of
staff and John Spencer as his boss. More entertaining than the real
White House, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again:'' Comedy? Drama? Science fiction? Who cares?
Great TV. Dennis Haysbert, as a government doctor (as in, Dr.
Frankenstein, only with humor), is a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel:'' OK, so it's a relative success _ it's not going to
land in the Nielsen Top 20, but the WB demographic loves it.
Deservedly so _ compared with the same character he played in
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' in this spinoff, David Boreanaz shows
a lot more soul. Curious, that _ he's playing a guy who doesn't
have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roswell:'' Another specialized hit (see ``Angel,'' above). If
a show about alienated teenage aliens sounds stupid, well, you
haven't been watching. Either bad luck, a government conspiracy or
bone-headed networks landed this opposite ``The West Wing.''
Brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasteland:'' Proof that getting what you deserve isn't always
a good thing. Kevin Williamson couldn't follow up on the success of
his ``Dawson's Creek'' with this car wreck of a series. Actually,
that's not a fair comparison _ people watch car wrecks.  &QL; 
CRYING SHAMES &QL; 
(or, to quote Homer Simpson, ``Oh cruel fate, why do you mock
me?'') &QL; 
``Action:'' It's funny, it's biting, it's brilliant. Naturally,
it's unwatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks:'' Thanks to the baseball playoffs, it's
aired only three times, but this series _ the best of the new lot,
bar none _ can't seem to scare up an audience. Heartbreaking, like
when Electric Light Orchestra broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again:'' Yuck. Beautiful divorced yuppies emote;
viewers flock to see it. Why? Who knows why? Explain 'N Sync while
you're at it. In a much-publicized flap, ABC is delaying ``NYPD
Blu''e's season premiere until January (!) so it doesn't have to
bump this show early. Viewers are already deserting ``Once and
Again'' for ``Judging Amy'' _ how's ABC going to look when the
show's out of ideas completely? Like, say, next week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet:'' True, it's not the best show on TV, but it
deserves better than the anemic ratings it's garnered so far. Not
exactly helped by having NBC dump a ``Dateline'' between it and
``Providence,'' which could appeal to a similar crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular:'' Isn't. Should be. At least a little. &QL; 
HOW'D THEY DO THAT? &QL; 
(or, shows that are succeeding despite themselves) &QL; 
``Snoops:'' Should have been David E. Kelley's first bomb. What's
drawing viewers? Gina Gershon's lips?
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Law:'' The only explanation for its success is that
every man-bashing woman in the country tunes in. Gives them
something to watch between Olympic figure-skating competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy:'' Watching Tyne Daly in this show is like
drinking Drano. Apparently some people enjoy that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad:'' Move it out of the Magic Time Slot between
``Frasier'' and ``ER'' and it's dead meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkers:'' Mo'Nique is funny. This show isn't. Of course,
success on UPN is a relative thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown Ups:'' Life after Urkel for Jaleel White. See ``The
Parkers,'' above. &QL; 
FISH/BARREL &QL; 
(or, you had to see it coming) &QL; 
``WWF Smackdown!:'' The secret of its success? UPN and young,
intelligence-free, garrulous male viewers _ a match made just a few
feet below heaven, maybe, but no way it could fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and Jill:'' One crown, broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Man:'' Betty White, wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shasta McNasty:'' Not as bad as you think. But still bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real:'' Should take its own advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Money:'' Death, taxes, cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odd Man Out:'' A tough fit for ABC's TGIF Fridays. Truly Great
It's Failing, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Grow Up:'' Or don't. No one will notice anyway. &QL; 
TOO EARLY TO TELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Time of Your Lif''e; ``The Strip.'' &QL; 
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME &QL; 
(or R.I.P. _ or, in some cases, DOA.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester Prep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mike O'Malley Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Work With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Harsh Realm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Came You'' (although it might be revived).
</P>
<P>
   That's where we stand now. Meanwhile, bring on the leprechauns. &QL;

BAGSHOT SHOWS HE CARES IN CAL CUP CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery always believed
Bagshot was good enough to win. They just figured he didn't care to
win.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Saturday's California Cup Classic rolled around, the
5-year-old's losing streak had stretched to 18 races over three
seasons and his breeder-owners feared he'd never win again.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Smokester chose the right day to mend his ways.
Displaying a sense of occasion in front of 31,047 fans at the 10th
annual Cal Cup, he shot to the lead on the far turn under
aggressive riding by Chris Antley, opened up in the stretch and
beat favored Del Mar Gray by 2{ lengths in the $250,000 feature
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshot's only victories in 22 previous starts had come in a
July 6, 1996 maiden race at Hollywood Park and a Sept. 6, 1996
minor stakes at Del Mar. He actually finished second in the Del Mar
race and became the winner when Fearless Pirate was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come up to the lead horses and just kind of watch them,''
Toffan said. ``But this time he got to the lead so early it was
kind of a new experience for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classic, main event of the 10-race Cal Cup, the showcase for
California-bred horses, presented Bagshot with considerably lighter
competition than he'd faced in the 1997 Santa Anita Derby (eighth
to Free House) and the 1998 Strub (third to Silver Charm), Big 'Cap
(second to Malek) and Hollywood Gold Cup (sixth to Skip Away).
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If the Bag Boy's ever going to win, it'll be today,'
'' McCaffery said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned $10.40 as one of four upsetters in a pick-six that
paid $27,456. The Oak Tree association guaranteed a $1 million
pick-six pool and an insurance company kicked in the difference
when $873,605 was bet.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshot's win was the second of the afternoon for McCaffery,
Toffan and trainer Paco Gonzalez. Their 2-year-old colt Spacelink
scored his maiden victory in the Juvenile, leaving odds-on favorite
Stormy Jack six lengths back in third.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big day, too, for jockeys Garrett Gomez (three wins)
and Eddie Delahoussaye (two) and trainer Juan Garcia (two).
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and Garcia teamed up to win the Cal Cup Distaff hillside
sprint with 9-1 Chichim and the Cal Cup Mile on turf with Pomona
Invitational winner Native Desert. Gomez also won the Cal Cup
Sprint for trainer Leonard Duncan with overpowering stretch runner
Love That Red.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye rode Feverish to her fourth straight victory in the
Cal Cup Matron and won a starter handicap race with J.R. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Also winning her fourth in a row to remain undefeated, Cover Gal
lived up to 1-2 odds in the Cal Cup Juvenile Fillies, giving jockey
Gary Stevens his 12th Cal Cup victory to break a tie with Corey
Nakatani at the top of the event's all-time leaders list.
</P>
<P>
   In the starter handicap that opened the program, front-running
Irrelevant gave Pat Valenzuela his first Cal Cup victory since his
four-win day in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bob Hebert, a Los Angeles newspaper turf writer and
handicapper for four decades, died Friday at his home in Carlsbad.
Hebert celebrated his 90th birthday Sept. 25. . . . Fiji, the 1998
female turf champion who would have sought her first 1999 victory
in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf next Saturday, has been
retired, trainer Neil Drysdale said at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
The 5-year-old was dull in races at Santa Anita and Keeneland since
fighting a respiratory infection. . . . Top New York 2-year-old
Greenwood Lake is out of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. . . . Pomona
Derby winner Isaypete won the Calder Derby at 17-1.

DALLAS IS HOT TOPIC FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- The Galaxy is aware of their friends from Dallas,
who must be walking on air after disposing of Chicago in last
week's playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn is on a roll and has renewed confidence entering
today's opening game of the best-of-three Western Conference final
series against the Galaxy at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Dallas won 10 of its past 11, but it is arguably
the league's most balanced team.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn finished second in MLS in goals allowed (35) and in
goals scored (54).
</P>
<P>
   The Burn finished second behind the Galaxy in the Western
Conference during the regular season, then gained some postseason
confidence by defeating Chicago, the defending MLS Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas trailed, 2-0, at halftime of its series-deciding match
with the Fire. But the Burn cut the lead to 2-1 midway through the
second half, then scored two goals in the final 10 minutes for a
3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Dallas' MLS MVP candidate Jason Kreis, who led the
league in scoring with 51 points (18 goals, 15 assists) and other
scoring threats like Arial Graziani, Oscar Pareja and Jorge
Rodriguez, and it's easy to see why the Galaxy-Burn matchup is so
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Galaxy has the league's best defense,
anchored by goalkeeper Kevin Hartman and defender Robin Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles hasn't given up a goal in the playoffs; Dallas has
yielded six in their past two games.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas found a way to penetrate Chicago's stingy defense,
something L.A. couldn't do last year.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfielder Danny Pena and Co. are ready for the series to
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can jump on them early, I like our chances,'' Pena said.
``But the longer they stay in the game, the more difficult it's
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they have a lot of luck on their side. But at the
same time, they deserve a spot in the conference finals for the
effort they gave against Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's top priority is to contain Kreis.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jason, you have to be aware of his shot from distance,''
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``He hits the ball very well. You
can't stop him on free kicks and stuff like that. But we have to be
aware because he gets behind the defense. He's great at showing the
ball and spinning away. We have to make sure we don't bite too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri is concerned by the way Dallas
plays as a cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you see clearly in Dallas is they're a united
team,'' Caligiuri said. ``Everyone understands their roles and they
play well as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some talented forwards in Graziani and Kreis, and
they're dangerous from the first minute to the 90th minute. We will
have our hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy remembers all too well its 4-3 loss to Dallas in the
next-to-last game of the regular season. The Galaxy blew a 3-1
second-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me,'' Schmid said. ``It was something that, I know
when I flew back, somebody said, `Do you want to go out to dinner?'
and I said, `I'm not very good dinner company tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schmid said this series will come down to more than
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play with very good concentration,'' he said. ``If
we play our game and we concentrate on what we need to do, we'll be
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get caught up in what we saw last Wednesday (Dallas'
victory over Chicago) or what happened the last time we played
Dallas. If we have that in the back of our minds, it would make us
nervous and this isn't the time to be nervous.''

CHANGES 12TH GRAF TO KERRY COLLINS, STED TODD COLLINS IN QB-SHORT
NFL, BUDDING STAR AND PROVEN STAR FACE OFF IN INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a good look today at the quarterback play in Indy.
Something rare will be on display, which doesn't necessarily mean
Troy Aikman will force a few smiles for the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what we will have here is a young/heralded QB who is
showing NFL progress _ this was Aikman a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Aikman's long career is stuck in a
week-to-week gear of what have you done for us lately. But for
Peyton Manning, the career anticipation is immense. How far will he
eventually carry the up-and-coming Colts?
</P>
<P>
   In a critical stretch of schedule for the Cowboys, this is
another tell-tale contest of measuring recovery progress from those
twin disasters known as Eagles and Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For the Colts and Manning, this is a game that was earmarked on
the schedule last summer. Beat Dallas and you will get more credit
than you probably deserve. But a surprising 4-2 start for Indy now
makes this a springboard game into the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the short haul or the long run, of course, it will be about
the quarterback. Good, solid, consistent play at that position is
what each NFL club is seeking. Yet very few are finding it.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning, in his second year out of Tennessee, has been an
exception in this season of spotty-to-awful quarterback
performances. When Arena League product Kurt Warner of the St.
Louis Rams is the NFL's most valuable quarterback to date, what
does that say?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much talk about the shortage of potential franchise
type quarterbacks,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said, ``but I really
don't think it's any different than a decade ago. The search is
never ending for the quarterback who can hold up mentally and
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking for someone with the skill to win a game and
the judgment not to lose it. That's a hard order to fill. Which is
also why a Manning jumps out at everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider this dwindling list:
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in the NFL, the elite quarterbacks were John Elway,
Brett Favre, Aikman, Steve Young and Dan Marino. Elway has retired,
Young should retire and while Marino is currently injured, Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson may also be preparing to move on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, the franchise builders at quarterback had
names like Kerry
</P>
<P>
   Collins, Mark Brunell, Trent Dilfer and Drew Bledsoe. Only
Bledsoe in New England remains highly regarded while Collins and
Dilfer no longer even register on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   On the list of emerging QBs was once Jake Plummer, Elvis Grbac,
Kordell Stewart, Steve McNair, Scott Mitchell and Heath Shuler. All
of those are either disappointments or washouts, although Plummer
is a good bet for the bounce-back.
</P>
<P>
   The usual suspects among the retreads included Vinny Testaverde,
Doug Flutie, Chris Chandler, Jeff George, Randall Cunningham, Rich
Gannon and Brad Johnson. This would have been the most productive
group of QBs, except for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks who have dropped in this season from either the
moon or Canada include Warner, Jon Kitna, Charlie Batch and Jeff
Garcia. Outside of Garcia, this is the best group in the league at
the moment. How scary is that?
</P>
<P>
   In the category of too-early-to-tell would be a promising catch
of rookies, along with Brian Griese in Denver and possibly the
headcase in San Diego, Mr. Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together, however, and it leaves the NFL in a
quarterbacking ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the position that impacts how a team plays and impacts
how a team drafts _ if you are wrong, you pay heavily,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   But all that scouting research can take place, and then a Warner
shows up in St. Louis and goes bombs away on the rest of the
league. Blind luck? Yes. But as long as the results are there, who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take every quarterback who has been available \Rin the
draft\S during the 90s, we had Manning rated the highest, with
Bledsoe real close,'' said Larry Lacewell, the Cowboys' director of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I wondered if Bledsoe would be physically tough
enough, and I was wrong about that. He is. But for the total
package, Manning was it. And we are starting to see the total
package come together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that Manning somewhat goes against the trend
most teams now deem important _ the quarterback who moves around
freely, avoiding the rush. Manning is mobile, but his style is also
a lot like Aikman's _ the five-step drop and the quick release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the trend is _ the only thing that
counts is if your quarterback can make plays,'' Lacewell added.
``Manning is still learning, but he can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL of today, that has become a rare blessing.

AGGIES REACH MILESTONES, SHED DOUBTS WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M, a team plagued by ragged
performances in recent weeks, sanded down some rough edges and
produced smooth, round numbers yesterday at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   By dispatching Oklahoma State, 21-3, the 22nd-ranked Aggies
wrapped up the 100th career victory for coach R.C. Slocum and the
600th triumph in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which came in a daylong downpour in front of
74,008, may not have been artistic. But it proved to be emotional
and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it erase some lingering doubts after last week's
51-6 loss to No. 24 Oklahoma, it allowed the Aggies (6-2, 3-2) to
remain within a game of No. 12 Texas (7-2, 4-1) in the Big 12 South
Division on the same day that fellow front-runners Oklahoma (4-3,
2-2) and Texas Tech (4-4, 3-2) suffered losses to North Division
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot more than win a football game out there. We came
together ... like we hadn't done all year,'' said quarterback Randy
McCown, who choked back tears during the postgame news conference
while reflecting on the mental transformation the Aggies have
undergone since the loss to Oklahoma. ``As seniors, a lot of people
questioned our leadership abilities and wondered if we could get
the job done. We wanted to show that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of A&AMP;M heroes proved to be senior-laden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing with a slight separation in his left
(nonthrowing) shoulder, McCown completed 20 of 29 passes for 242
yards and two touchdowns. Both of his scoring strikes went to wide
receiver Matt Bumgardner, a fifth-year senior who established
career highs for receptions (five), yards (79) and touchdowns (2).
Until yesterday, Bumgardner's only career touchdown catch came
against Oklahoma State in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bernard, another fifth-year senior, paced a resurgent A&AMP;M
ground game. Bernard picked up 80 of the Aggies' 152 yards against
a run defense that came in allowing 112.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Aggies turned to seniors Brandon Jennings and
Sedrick Curry as stabilizing influences on a unit that limited
Oklahoma State to 260 yards and only two snaps inside the A&AMP;M
20-yard line. Jennings, a free safety, led the team in tackles (9).
Curry, a cornerback, produced the game's lone turnover, an
interception that sparked an 89-yard touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   One week after being pillaged for 552 yards by Oklahoma, the
``Wrecking Crew'' collected six sacks and allowed OSU to convert
only three of 12 third downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a big step in the right direction,'' linebacker Brian
Gamble said. ``I think it will just keep snowballing from here. In
the locker room, we were all jumping around and feeling great.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Aggies stuffed a Cowboys' offense that played
without starting quarterback Tony Lindsay, who was a game-time
scratch because he was slow in recovering from a shoulder injury
suffered last week against Kansas State. But coach R.C. Slocum
pointed to several players ``who really stepped up'' to lift the
Aggies in their hour of need.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those played on an offense that cranked out 394 yards,
highlighted by time-consuming touchdown drives of 89, 79 and 69
yards. McCown ended the first march with an 11-yard touchdown
strike to Bumgardner, putting A&AMP;M up, 7-0, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies followed OSU kicker Tim Sydnes' second missed
field-goal attempt with a 14-play, 79-yard touchdown drive in the
third quarter, capped by D'Andre Hardeman's 1-yard blast. After
Sydnes connected from 36 yards, A&AMP;M stretched the lead to 21-3 when
McCown hit Bumgardner on a 14-yard fade route with 8:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our pride taken away last week,'' fullback Ja'Mar
Toombs said. ``We had to get our feet back on the ground, and we
did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Slocum collected career victory No. 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fitting that the 100th win came in a game where we really
needed to win,'' Slocum said. ``That's what means something to
me.''

STOCKTON MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Stockton remembers playing Wilshire Country
Club when he was in college at USC and never scoring well on it.
But he's having no such problems now.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, who turns 58 on Tuesday, shot an impressive 7-under 64
Saturday that gave him a two-stroke lead after two rounds of the
$1.2 million Pacific Bell Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was first-round co-leader John Mahaffey, who had
a 68, at 8-under 134. Joining him there was defending champion Joe
Inman (66), Bob Murphy (66) and 63-year-old Gary Player, who had a
66 despite missing five putts inside six feet.
</P>
<P>
   John Jacobs, who shared the first-round lead with Mahaffey, shot
an even-par 71 but isn't out of it by any means at 6-under 136.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's Wilshire's reconfigured layout that has Stockton at
the top of his game. Last year's treacherous, 444-yard 18th hole
now is No.17, and last year's 10th hole, a short but testy par-3,
is this year's No.18. The course was re-routed for gallery purposes
and better sightlines, and there was plenty to see Saturday on a
beautiful, clear day.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end the tournament on a par-3 has drawn mixed
player reactions. Inman called this year's 18th hole ``a great
hole, not a give-up hole.'' Murphy wasn't as complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tournament-wise, I don't like it at all,'' he said. ``If it
was a harder par-3, a two- or three-iron shot, that would be
different. There aren't nearly the amount of mistakes that can be
made as on the other hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But not that much. The par-3 18th ranked 11th-toughest in
Saturday's round, during which 30 players broke par and nine
players moved within six shots of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's presence at the top is surprising, considering his
season includes just one top-10 finish _ a fourth-place tie at the
Bank One Championship _ and just over $330,000 in earnings. He
still was having swing problems entering this event, but discovered
he was leaving too much weight on his right side during his
follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   A better weight shift and a return to an old putter apparently
have worked wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who missed just two greens and had seven birdies
Saturday, said he enjoys seeing his good friend play well. Stockton
just missed the Wilshire tournament record of 63 set by Hale Irwin
in 1997. Dale Douglass holds the overall tournament mark, a 61, set
at Rancho Park in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dave playing well is great,'' Murphy said. ``Neither
of us has had a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the guys can just play bad tomorrow, and Dave and
I have a nice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said he never lost his ability, just his confidence.
And he said he never had much of it at Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever remember even breaking par on this course,'' he
said. ``But all of a sudden, I have opportunities to make a whole
bunch of birdies. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inman, who had five birdies en route to his 66, said he loves
Wilshire because of its classic design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like so many courses that have been built in the last
five years to sell real estate,'' he said. ``It's not like you have
to cross the street and go between two sets of houses to reach the
next tee. I just love these old-style courses. I feel very
comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ageless Player, who turns 64 on Monday, looked and sounded
amazed when he saw the second-round scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite remarkable, isn't it?'' he asked. ``I don't know
what would have happened if you gave Ben Hogan and Sam Snead this
equipment we have today, private jets and beautifully conditioned
golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would they have scored? It's quite amazing.''

DIFFERING VIEWS ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
``Analysis'' 
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question posed to Sen. John McCain was about
how to rebuild the armed forces, so it may have seemed odd that his
response referred to his own temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that perhaps John McCain gets angry,'' the Arizona
Republican said in replying to the query during Thursday's New
Hampshire town meeting with GOP presidential contenders. ``My
friends, I get angry when we spend $350 million on a carrier the
Navy doesn't want or need.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from a throwaway line, that was McCain's way of signaling,
in the coded language of politics, that he accepts the challenge of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's backers to make McCain's temperament a
presidential campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on, McCain suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters did bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Republican governors have talked about this
issue, the McCain temper, in casual conversation in the past,''
John Truscott, chief spokesman for Michigan Gov. John Engler, said
Friday in an interview with ``The'' ``Arizona Republic.'' Engler is
the Bush campaign's liaison to governors.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott said one reason why an overwhelming number of GOP
governors have endorsed Bush is because ``they know he has the
temperament to be president,'' implying that McCain does not.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's critics call him a political bully, allies say
his occasionally white-hot personality, sometimes directed at rival
lawmakers, reporters or others, is just a piece of a man who is
less scripted and more direct than most politicians. They say he is
far more jocular than surly, especially with his core staff
members, who average more than eight years of service apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the number of people who say, `He's just so
straightforward, he's so dead honest, he's so refreshing,' '' said
Torie Clarke, a former McCain press secretary who also worked on
the 1992 re-election campaign of Bush's father, the former
president. ``And, you know, his temper is a part of that. You know
where the guy stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke added, ``It's no secret he does not suffer fools well. So
if you're a fool, if you're a hypocrite or you're obnoxious, look
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press aides deny that the Texas governor is behind any
orchestrated effort to highlight McCain's inner demons or
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign became suspicious of Bush when a ``New York
Times'' article last Monday quoted not only Arizona Gov. Jane Hull
but also Engler in a story about McCain's personality and his
difficulties securing the support of some top elected officials
back home. Hull and Engler have become two of Bush's
highest-profile gubernatorial allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally ridiculous to think Governor Bush can control
what the ``New'' ``York Times'' writes,'' Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan said. ``We're puzzled by the way the senator is
reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, last week, it seemed that the long
honeymoon that McCain has enjoyed with the national news media, a
string of favorable articles devoted to what ``New Republic''
Editor Charles Lane called ``the McCain swoon,'' was coming to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Following the ``Times'' story last week was a ``Wall Street
Journal'' column by John H. Fund portraying McCain as a moody
``Lone Ranger'' and questioning whether the Arizonan can ``build
and lead a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a ``Newsweek'' article chronicled McCain's raking in
special-interest campaign contributions while crusading against big
donors' influence on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you go up in the polls.'' said Dan
Schnur, McCain's national communications director. ``Every
candidate in the history of presidential politics who has made
significant upward movement in the polls, like John McCain has, is
going to get a lot more press scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know McCain say the negative publicity itself is less
important than how McCain chooses to react to it.
</P>
<P>
   He is not known locally to be laconic when things seem to go
against him in the press. His reaction to the shifting media
currents could turn out to be noteworthy in itself, particularly
since his disposition has been placed, at least for now, under the
media glare.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wouldn't return the calls of ``Republic'' reporters for
more than a year after the newspaper published a cartoon in 1994
depicting his wife, Cindy, shaking an emaciated Black child to get
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, Cindy McCain had said she was addicted to
painkillers and admitted stealing some pills from her charitable
organization.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Vietnam War POW, called the cartoon
``incredibly painful.'' He said in 1996 that ``it doesn't matter''
what some Phoenix columnists and radio talk show hosts think
because ``what I care about are the people whom I respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, the blunt McCain has gotten into trouble for saying
too much to the press.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he told a ``Republic'' reporter that he simply didn't
have the votes to cut off a filibuster to keep alive his bill to
reform campaign finance laws. Some supporters, frantically trying
to salvage the bill, were upset at his candor when the article
appeared. McCain's office quickly issued a press release saying
hope was not lost. The bill died.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain slips up on occasion, his friends say it's forgivable
because he is trying to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's passionate, and he fights for the things he believes
in,'' said Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, also a Republican. ``I for one
don't want some Joe Milquetoast who doesn't care about things. When
McCain plays, he plays to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Schnur, ``Show me a politician who never offends anyone,
and I'll show you a politician who never gets anything done. If
John McCain ever stopped fighting for what he believed in, he'd be
just another hack politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his detractors say, McCain goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   GOP state Sen. Tom Smith of Phoenix, a Marine Corps veteran,
said in the ``Wall Street Journal'' story, ``He curries favor with
elitists, and his staff bullies people.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Barbara Barrett has said McCain ``aggressively
encouraged'' her not to run in the 1994 GOP gubernatorial primary
against former Gov. Fife Symington, a McCain ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method and strong-handedness of this seemed excessive,''
she told ``The'' ``Republic'' in 1996. Barrett, who ran anyway and
lost, was out of town Friday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he spoke ``strongly'' with Barrett but did not
instruct her to stay out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Now that McCain's disposition has become part of the campaign
dialogue, the challenge will be for his campaign to attempt to turn
it into an asset by, for example, depicting him as forceful and his
rivals as indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calculated decision for McCain to invoke his own temper
in Thursday's town meeting. He had made a similar reference earlier
in a San Francisco appearance and opted to do it again during the
televised forum, when it mattered most. &QL;

FLORIDA STATE BEATS VIRGINIA, 35-10  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ After 68 years of fielding a football
team, the University of Virginia was host for the first time
Saturday night to an opponent ranked No. 1 nationally in the polls.
And the Cavaliers were stoked for Florida State's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Fans arrived early and cheered often, remembering how Virginia
had knocked the Seminoles from the unbeaten ranks here four years
ago. But that adrenaline could carry the Cavaliers only so far.
Florida State, which trailed at halftime, scored two touchdowns
late in the third quarter and two more in the fourth quarter to
win, 35-10, before 47,900 at Scott Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even three interceptions by quarterback Chris Weinke and a lost
fumble at the Virginia 2-yard line by his backup, Marcus Outzen,
could not stop Florida State from moving to 9-0 over all. The
Seminoles are No. 1 in the Associated Press poll and No. 2 in the
New York Times ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke wound up redeeming himself with his second-half play and
set a Florida State record for 200-yard passing games with his
18th, breaking the mark set by the Heisman Trophy winner Charlie
Ward. Weinke completed 24 of 35 passes for 297 yards and 3
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The bright light for Virginia was tailback Thomas Jones, who
came in averaging 158.4 rushing yards a game. He pierced the
Seminoles for 164 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries and broke the
school rushing record of 3,389 yards held by Tiki Barber, now of
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter touchdowns by flanker Peter Warrick, on a
dazzling 50-yard pass play from Weinke, and Outzen, on a late
1-yard run, made this game seem much easier for Florida State than
it was.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Virginia led deep into the third quarter, 10-7, before
losing for the fourth time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke got off to a nightmarish start that kept the Seminoles
stuck in neutral with four frustrating series. Pressured, he threw
away a third-down pass on Florida State's game-opening drive. Next,
he helped the Seminoles reach the Virginia 21-yard line, but then
flipped an interception to linebacker Byron Thweatt.
</P>
<P>
   That would start a pattern. Near the first quarter's end, with
Florida State at its 43-yard line, Weinke was forced to run to his
right looking for a receiver. What he found was Virginia safety
Jerton Evans with a soft, off-balance throw.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle was not yet complete. Early in the second quarter,
after Weinke appeared to be surprised by the center's snap on a
third-down play, cornerback Dwayne Stukes intercepted yet another
Weinke offering. This one particularly hurt as Virginia took over
at Florida State's 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers had not been able to capitalize on Weinke's first
two interceptions, but the third provided erratic Virginia with too
much generosity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers scored a touchdown after two plays were smothered
by the Seminoles, setting up third down and 15 from the 16-yard
line. Jones took a handoff on a draw play, lunged forward several
steps, then bolted to his right and into the clear. He dived the
last 3 yards into the end zone, as the partisan crowd roared its
approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State did not get flustered, and the Seminoles put
together their best drive of the game. It covered 91 yards and took
14 tension-building plays. Operating largely from a no-huddle
attack, Weinke completed 5 of 6 passes for 64 yards. One was for 38
yards to split end Robert Morgan, and the payoff came on a 4-yard
touchdown to flanker Marvin Minnis.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia did not need long to move ahead again. Jones ate up 71
yards with a stunning first-down run in which he set the Virginia
career rushing record. Jones took a step forward, then swung left,
faked cornerback Clevan Thomas off his feet and sprinted into the
clear. Roverback Derrick Gibson finally caught him at the Florida
State 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles stiffened from there, and Virginia settled for
