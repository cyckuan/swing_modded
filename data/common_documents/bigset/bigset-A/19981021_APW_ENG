<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Senior central bankers from the United
States and Australia Wednesday urged banks not to shut their doors
to lending during the current volatility in global financial
markets.
	   But they also warned banks to be careful about their risks.
	   New York Federal Reserve Bank President William McDonough said
he wanted to remind senior officials at banks that they have ``an
important social role as financial intermediaries'' and that they
should be prepared to take on ``a reasonable amount of risk.''
	   He said he feared an oncoming ``credit crunch,'' which he called
``that most dreaded of all consequences.''
	   ``We aren't there yet and it is my most fervent hope that we
will not reach'' it, he said.
	   Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Ian Macfarlane said bank
supervisors should be ``extremely careful'' not to encourage banks
to take more risks.
	   Both were speaking at the International Conference of Banking
Supervisors in Sydney.
	   Macfarlane said that imposing restrictions on capital flows in
certain circumstances may be wise.

Rangers edge Oilers for first win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mathieu Schneider's power-play goal 8:38 into
the third period gave New York a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton
Oilers Tuesday night as the Rangers avoided matching their worst
start in 40 years.
	   Schneider's tiebreaking goal helped the Rangers stop a five-game
winless streak (0-4-1), one shy of their six-game spin (0-2-4) to
start the 1958-59 National Hockey League season.
	   Manny Malhotra and Brian Leetch also scored for the Rangers. The
Oilers got goals from Bill Guerin and Josef Beranek.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Canucks 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Keith Primeau scored his third
goal in four games and Arturs Irbe beat his former team as the
Carolina Hurricanes downed Vancouver to run their home unbeaten
streak to four straight, including three ties.
	   Irbe, who faced 18 shots by the Canucks, lost his shutout 3:02
into the final period on a deflection by rookie Bill Muckalt, who
scored his first NHL goal.
	   Primeau, who also assisted on Ray Sheppard's goal to open the
scoring, tallied his third goal of the season 1:56 into the second
period on the power play. Sami Kapanen also scored in the second
period as the Hurricanes built a 3-0 lead.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Sharks 1
	   In Philadelphia, Eric Lindros and Rod Brind'Amour each had a
goal and an assist as unbeaten Philadelphia defeated the winless
San Jose Sharks.
	   A goal by the Flyers' Colin Forbes broke a 1-1 tie at 3:20 of
the third period. Lindros put the game away with a wrist shot from
the right circle at 15:48.
	   Brind'Amour and the Sharks' Jeff Friesen traded power-play goals
in the second period of a game dominated for the most part by
excellent goaltending and tenacious defense.
 &UR; Stars 3, Flames 1 &QC; 
	   In Dallas, Darryl Sydor had two goals and an assist to power
Dallas to victory, keeping the Stars unbeaten at home (3-0-0).
	   Sydor has at least one point in each of Dallas' first five
games, matching the longest scoring streak of his career. He had a
five-game streak for the Los Angeles Kings in 1993-94.
	   Sydor snapped a 1-1 tie with a blast from the point at 3:31 of
the second period and the Stars went on to boost their overall
record to 3-1-1.
	   Rookie Martin St. Louis gave Calgary a 1-0 lead before Jamie
Langenbrunner's first goal of the season on a power play rebound
tied it with 41.3 seconds left in the first period.

Hong Kong wonders if property market has finally bottomed out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Bobby Lee and Joyce Shum had been waiting for a
chance to pounce into the real estate market since Asia's economic
downturn rattled Hong Kong.
	   With property prices in the investment-crazed metropolis down by
as much as 60 percent from their peak last August, Lee and Shum
thought they could reap a handsome profit when the market recovers.
	   Finally, the couple signed away dlrs 65,000 of their life
savings for a down payment on a dlrs 436,000, 500-square-foot
(46-square-meter) apartment in a posh new development called Laguna
Verde.
	   They came out of the sales office beaming, hoping they got their
timing right on one of Hong Kong's most pressing questions: Has the
property market finally bottomed out?
	   ``I feel so lucky that we could buy this flat. It's like winning
the lottery,'' said Shum, 30, a handbag merchant.
	   Just a few months ago, anybody who had bought a new apartment in
Hong Kong might have felt like a big loser.
	   After prices spiraled out of control, the bubble finally burst
and property values went into freefall as Asia's economic crisis
combined with a government drive to increase the housing supply.
	   Interest rates rose as Hong Kong's currency came under
speculative attacks, and thousands of people who bought apartments
before the downturn got stuck with higher mortgage payments on
properties that had halved in value.
	   The sharp decline was frightening to people in an economy
heavily dependent on real estate values.
	   Property prices are exorbitant in small, mountainous Hong Kong
because buildable land is extremely scarce. The market accounts for
one in 10 jobs and roughly a third of the economy.
	   Lately, the market has shown signs of stability, with some
developers inching prices higher and trying to talk things up.
Meantime, big banks cut interest rates slightly this week, luring
buyers back into the market.
	   Developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) sold all of the 583 apartments
in the Laguna Verde development in just a few hours Saturday.
People who didn't get in line quickly enough left the sales office
empty-handed.
	   ``I think the prices are about right. I want to buy something
before prices go up again,'' said Christine Ting, an accountant who
already owns a small apartment but wanted a second property. She
was turned away after waiting for 1 1/2 hours.
	   But some analysts warned the apparent revival is a mirage. Alan
Dalgeish at SG Securities (HK) Ltd., predicted prices could plunge
another 20 percent to 30 percent as the economy worsens.
	   ``The reality is unemployment is rising, disposable income is
contracting, and credit risk is increasing,'' said Eugene Chung, a
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read (HK) Ltd. ``Under this scenario,
how can property prices rise?''
	   Many buyers are ignoring the naysayers.
	   The conventional wisdom in Hong Kong suggests people should
hoard up real estate, then wait for prices to rise as the economy
expands. In the heyday of the last boom, some speculators would pay
up to dlrs 128,000 just for the option to buy a new apartment.
	   ``We have extra money in the bank, so we thought, 'Why not?' The
Chinese like to put money in real estate because of the security,''
said Peter Ma, 50, owner of a toy factory in Tianjin, China, who
just bought an apartment for dlrs 641,000.

Elephant hit by car near Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An elephant was hit by an automobile on
a suburban Bangkok road, injuring his teen-age handler and the
occupants of the car, Thai newspapers reported on Wednesday.
	   Doctors at Bangkok's Dusit Zoo will x-ray the elephant on
Wednesday to determine if it suffered any broken bones or other
injuries, The Nation newspaper said.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday evening as the elephant was
crossing Sukhumvit Road, a major highway, near Suan Chang, or
Elephant Garden, where it is employed entertaining tourists.
	   The elephant's 15-year-old handler, Visit Petkla, suffered
injuries to his head and arms, while the two occupants of the car
sustained bruises.
	   The elephant, named Pla Buasri, collapsed on the road, then rose
and ran into a marshy area.
	   A veterinarian from Dusit Zoo was called to the scene, and he
massaged the elephant until it could walk normally, The Nation
said. The doctor found the elephant had injured a leg and hips, it
said.
	   Road accidents involving elephants have become more common as
handlers take them to Bangkok to beg for food because their habitat
is being destroyed by development.
	   On Monday, an elephant had his leg trapped in beams used to
build an elevated train in the capital but was freed after an hour.

West Bank accord said to be taking shape

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with relatives of terror victims meeting with Sharon,
expressing disappointment and new Rubin comments, INSERTS two grafs
after 12th graf pvs: CIA Director .... &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Under President Bill Clinton's
prodding and with Jordan's King Hussein at hand, Israel and the
Palestinians neared a West Bank agreement that calls for the CIA to
supervise the jailing of suspected terrorists, two parties to the
Middle East talks said.
	   Clinton finalized the CIA-terrorist arrangement during dinner
Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the sources said.
	   Palestinian terrorist suspects wanted in Israel would not be
extradited to Israel for trial, as Israel initially demanded. But
the presence of the CIA to verify that punishment is being meted
out by Palestinian authorities evidently satisfies Israel's
concerns, said the sources, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   With Hussein providing advice in separate talks with Clinton,
Arafat and Netanyahu, Israel and the Palestinians began shaping the
framework of a West Bank land-for-peace accord on Tuesday, the
sixth day of their summit talks. Hussein joined the talks for most
of the day at the administration's request.
	   The pace of negotiations picked up, with Israel and the
Palestinians getting down to hard bargaining. Clinton, in his fifth
day at a secluded Maryland retreat, met for 45 minutes with Arafat
and then went into a meeting late Tuesday night with Netanyahu.
	   Clinton had been briefed on his arrival from Washington by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who met with Arafat
following the president to nail down some details ahead of the
U.S.-Israel bilateral meeting.
	   ``There is important work going on here but significant gaps are
still there,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
while several knotty issues remained, Israel and the Palestinians
had succeeded in reaching a preliminary understanding on several
points.
	   These included a 12-week Israeli pullback from a further 13
percent of the West Bank, with the Palestinians responding with the
confiscation of illegally held weapons from militant groups on
territory they already control and the jailing of suspected
terrorists.
	   Israel claims 17 suspects remain free in Palestinian-held land
and 13 serve in the Palestinian police force. Initially, Israeli
negotiators demanded their extradition for trial in Israel; but
they are settling for trial and punishment by Palestinian
authorities.
	   The United States would assume the role of verifying both the
weapons seizures and the jailings, the sources told The Associated
Press.
	   CIA Director George Tenet has played a behind-the-scene role in
the summit talks. He made several trips to the Mideast to develop
intelligence cooperation between Israel and Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
	   A group of Israelis who lost family members in terrorist attacks
were disappointed that Israel was yielding on extraditing suspects.
Meir Indor, who said he was wounded in one attack, called the
development a ``black day.'' He said the group met with Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and described the session as ``very
disappointing.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks had
entered ``the most intensive phase yet,'' adding that drafting of
documents has begun. ``We have overcome some obstacles,'' Rubin
said.
	   The Israeli pullback and the Palestinian counterterrorism moves
would be carried out in parallel phases. A major sticking point
remained whether and when Israel would carry out another pullback.
It has offered to withdraw from an additional 1 percent.
	   While the Palestinians are demanding an unspecified, larger
swath of land, the negotiators were examining an Israeli proposal
that the dispute be taken up by an Israeli-Palestinian committee
with no U.S. participation in its deliberations.
	   According to Israel's proposal, the talks would be held
simultaneously with negotiations over a final settlement with the
Palestinians.
	   In the search for a compromise, the negotiators were considering
having Clinton write a letter to Netanyahu and to Arafat backing
the committee approach.
	   Still in hot dispute, meanwhile, was Israel's demand that the
Palestinian National Council meet within three months of the start
of the Israeli pullback to nullify all anti-Israel provisions in
the charter of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   Israel would give up an initial slice of land at the outset, but
halt the phased pullback if the council did not act, the sources
said.
	   Clinton and Hussein arrived separately at the Wye River
Conference Center, where the talks began last Thursday. The king
had been resting at his Potomac, Maryland, home after a round of
chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic, where he is being treated for
cancer.
	   ``We think he has the unique ability to bring home to the
delegations the necessity for making peace,'' Rubin said.
	   Lockhart said ``we felt he could play a constructive role in the
talks today.''
	   Drawing in another Mideast leader, Clinton gave Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak a 10-minute telephone update on peace
talks. Clinton also expressed his condolences for a weekend train
accident in Alexandria that left 50 dead, Lockhart said.
	   A day after a grenade attack in Israel further complicated the
talks, Rubin said the two sides had shifted from posturing to
``endgame'' bargaining. ``We are past the atmospherics and down to
hard bargaining,'' he said.
	   There were some signs of progress.
	   A senior U.S. official said, ``People are rushing around and
trying to come up with bridging ideas.'' Another was word from the
Palestinian delegation that U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat and an Israeli legal expert, Daniel Reisner,
had resumed drafting tentative language for an agreement after a
three-day suspension.
	   However, Yasser Abed Rabbo, a Palestinian official, said, ``We
will reject any formula for a partial agreement. We are insisting
on a comprehensive agreements, and that's what President Arafat has
told all the parties.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ A change of scenery didn't change a thing for
the San Diego Padres.
	   Scott Brosius made sure of it.
	   Brosius hit his second homer of the game in the eighth inning, a
stunning three-run shot off relief ace Trevor Hoffman and the New
York Yankees moved within one win of a World Series sweep with a
5-4 victory in Game 3 Tuesday night.
	   A sweep would be the Yanks' first since 1950 and could come in
the very unfriendly confines of Qualcomm Stadium _ amid the plam
trees, fish tacos and beachballs _ a continent away from the Bronx.
	   ``We feel like we're on the brink of something special,''
starting pitcher David Cone said.
	   No team in baseball history has overcome an 0-3 deficit in the
postseason, and now the Padres must try to do it against a club
that wants to cement its place as the best ever.
	   Andy Pettitte will start for the Yankees in Game 4 Wednesday
night, most likely against San Diego ace Kevin Brown.
	   A win would give the Yankees an overall record of 125-50 _ at
.714, the best winning percentage since the Murderers' Row team of
the 1927 Yankees with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
	   ``There's nothing more fun than this,'' Brosius said. ``When you
grow up you want to get a chance to play in the World Series,
that's what you play for. We'd like to get 125, that would feel
really good. We're in pretty good shape.''
	   On a night when everything seemed to be going right for San
Diego _ great plays, clutch pitching by Sterling Hitchcock and key
hits from Tony Gwynn _ Brosius and the Yankees ruined it.
	   ``Sure, it's tough taking this. It's the hard part of the
game,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``The only thing we can do
now is go out there and play our hearts out.''
	   Hitless for five innings against Cone, the Padres took a 3-0
lead in the sixth on a burst started by Hitchcock's unlikely
single. Yet with 64,667 crazed fans roaring and the cranked-up rock
music blaring, these Yankees would not break.
	   Hoffman wound up with the loss while Ramiro Mendoza won in
relief. Mariano Rivera held on for a save, working around a pair of
two-out singles by Carlos Hernandez and pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney
by striking out Andy Sheets with runners at the corners for the
last out.
	   Brosius led off the seventh with a home run against Hitchcock,
Most Valuable Player of the National League championship and a
member of the Yankees' rotation with Cone in 1995. New York closed
to 3-2, but shortstop Chris Gomez made an eye-popping catch to
start an inning-ending double play.
	   But in the eighth, there was no one left to save the Padres.
	   Slumping Paul O'Neill drew a leadoff walk from Randy Myers _
once again, the Yankees' patience at the plate paid off _ and then
Bochy made an early call to the bullpen.
	   It was Trevor Time, and Hoffman walked in as AC/DC's ``Hell's
Bells'' sent the crowd into a frenzy. Hoffman had been successful
on 53 of 54 save chances during the regular season, though a blown
chance in the NLCS against Atlanta perhaps was a bad omen.
	   ``This place was rocking all night long,'' Brosius said. ``It's
a lot like Yankee Stadium, only we're on the other side of it.''
	   After O'Neill's walk, Bernie Williams came close to putting the
Yankees ahead, hitting a fly ball that Gwynn caught on the warning
track in right. Tino Martinez followed with a walk and then
Brosius, moved up to sixth in the batting order because the Yankees
played without a Designated Hitter, homered to center for a 5-3
lead.
	   Hoffman had not worked in five days, his longest idle period of
the season, and clearly was not effective with his mix of changeups
and fastballs. He gave up another hit in the eighth before ending
the inning.
	   ``With Trevor, he's the type of pitcher that you know you have
to battle and hope you get a pitch to hit,'' Brosius said. ``On the
second pitch, he threw me a fastball that I fouled off. Later, he
came back with another one that I stayed back on and hit it.''
	   Brosius' shots marked the 41st multihomer game in Series
history, coming after Greg Vaughn's performance in Game 1 for the
Padres. Reggie Jackson was the last do it for the Yankees, hitting
three in the clinching Game 6 in 1977.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the bottom half of the eighth, with
a double by Quilvio Veras, a single by Gwynn and a sacrifice fly by
Vaughn closing the gap to a run.
	   Rivera made it interesting in the ninth before holding on for
his second save, doing the job that Hoffman could not. Rivera has
pitched 12 scoreless innings in nine postseason appearances this
fall, recording five saves.
	   Twilight seemed to take its toll on the hitters. With the game
starting early, neither team had a hit through three innings, the
first time that had happened in the Series since 1965, when Sandy
Koufax of Los Angeles and Mudcat Grant of Minnesota did it in Game
2.
	   Cone became the first pitcher to take a no-hit bid into the
sixth since Atlanta's Tom Glavine in Game 6 of 1995. Hitchcock, a
career .120 hitter, broke it up with a single.
	   After a walk to Veras, Gwynn singled hard to right field.
O'Neill retrieved the ball but made a wild throw across the diamond
that went into the Yankees dugout for a two-base error that allowed
another run to score. Ken Caminiti's sacrifice fly made it 3-0.
	   Caminiti gave it back in the seventh, though, when his error at
third base gave the Yankees a run.

Prime ministers of India and Pakistan talk by telephone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The prime ministers of India and
Pakistan spoke over the telephone following official talks over the
weekend in the Pakistani capital that failed to produce an
agreement, newspaper reports said Wednesday.
	   On Tuesday, India's Atal Bihari Vajpayee used a hot line that
was set up last year to link the two prime ministers, an official
statement said in New Delhi.
	   Vajpayee expressed satisfaction over the outcome of the talks,
The Hindu newspaper said. But that contrasted with an earlier
comment by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaz Aziz that the result
had been less than what Pakistan expected.
	   Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif talked even
as India rejected a no-war pact proposed by Pakistan.
	   ``The problem with the no-war pact is that they (Pakistanis)
have linked it to the settlement of the Kashmir issue before it
comes into being,'' said Brajesh Mishra, Vajpayee's top adviser.
	   ``Now that is not acceptable to us,'' Mishra told a television
network in an interview.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir in the past
50 years. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in
predominantly Hindu India. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and
Pakistan the rest. Muslim militants have been fighting a separatist
war in Jammu-Kashmir since 1989.
	   On Tuesday, India accused Pakistani soldiers of firing on an
Indian position in the Siachin Glacier at 19,000 feet (5,700
meters) in the Himalayan territory. There was no immediate comment
by Pakistan.
	   Pakistan says India should hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under
United Nations resolutions to give the majority Muslims a choice of
whether to stay with India or join Pakistan.
	   India says it will never agree to a plebiscite in Kashmir.
Pakistan considers Kashmir a core issue, linking its settlement to
any improvement in trade and economic ties with India.
	   At their meeting, the Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries
couldn't make any progress on Kashmir, but promised to meet again
in February.
	   Both India and Pakistan are under pressure from the United
States and other countries to ease tensions over Kashmir,
especially after both carried out nuclear tests in May and declared
themselves to be nuclear powers.
	   The two sides also discussed their ballistic missile capability
and conventional arsenals. Both India and Pakistan have missiles
capable of carrying multiple and single nuclear warheads.
	   They also discussed measures to avert the risk of a nuclear
conflict and to prevent an expensive nuclear arms race in the
volatile subcontinent. But they did not agree on any
confidence-building measures.

Four people killed in Vietnam in war-era artillery explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Four people, including three from one
family, were killed when a war-era artillery shell exploded in
central Vietnam, local police said Wednesday.
	   Pham Van Duong was killed instantly in Quang Nam province along
with his wife, son and a neighbor when the 105mm shell went off as
they were trying to cut into it to extract the explosives, police
officer Pham Man said.
	   Man said Duong's wife had found the shell in the jungle. Duong
earlier lost both of his legs when he stepped on an old land mine
while searching for scrap iron.
	   Many farmers in central Vietnam, site of fierce fighting during
the Vietnam War, collect scrap iron to make a living.

Great Scott! Brosius blasts Padres
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Great Scott!
	   In spring training, the New York Yankees hardly knew who Scott
Brosius was.
	   After his two homers and four RBIs in Game 3 of the World
Series, they'll never forget.
	   ``This is the type of thing that as a kid you dream about,''
Brosius said Tuesday night after the Yankees beat San Diego 5-4 to
take a 3-0 World Series lead. ``I've done it in my back yard 100
times.''
	   This time, the field was a little bigger and the fence was a
little farther back.
	   But not too far for Brosius, a symbol of the magical season
these Yankees are having.
	   All summer long, New York has had a different hero every night.
On Tuesday night, it was his turn.
	   ``He had a Reggie Jackson night, one of the great World Series
performances in Yankee history,'' Game 3 starter David Cone said.
``He just crushed the ball.''
	   With San Diego trying to crawl back into this World Series,
Brosius stuck another fork into the Padres, stabbed them really.
	   His solo shot off Sterling Hitchcock in the seventh started the
Yankees' comeback from a 3-0 deficit and his three-run drive off
Trevor Hoffman in the eighth put the Yankees ahead 5-3.
	   You could hear a pin drop in Qualcomm Stadium. Hoffman hung his
head.
	   ``There's nothing more fun than this,'' Brosius said. ``When you
grow up you want to get a chance to play in the World Series,
that's what you play for.''
	   San Diego wasn't beaten by one of those big stars in the middle
of the New York lineup. The Padres were thumped by Brosius, a
virtual throw-in last November who is not even sure New York will
attempt to re-sign him for next year.
	   Brosius came to New York only because Oakland was willing to
take Kenny Rogers off the Yankees' hands.
	   ``It was Ronny Brand's idea,'' Yankees superscout Gene Michael
said before the game, referring to one of the team's West Coast
scouts. ``Turned out pretty good.''
	   Michael and Brand had no idea how good.
	   Brosius arrived at Tampa, Florida, last February after slumping
to .203 with just 41 RBIs for Oakland in 1997.
	   ''We didn't know what Scott Brosius was exactly,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``We had to pick up a press guide in spring
training.''
	   He wound up hitting .300 this year, hitting 19 homers and
driving in a career-high 98 runs.
	   ``He is such a force on this club,'' Torre said. ``It didn't
take long to see he could knock in big runs.''
	   Brosius became an All-Star for the first time. His 1997 slump
was over.
	   ``This game can humble you,'' he said. ``I think sometimes it
was harder to hit .200 than it was to hit .300. It was a just a
year where if anything could go wrong, it did go wrong. It was one
of those things that kind of snowballed.''
	   This year, everything has gone right.
	   In Game 6 of the AL championship series, his three-run homer put
the Yankees ahead of Cleveland 6-0, sending New York on its way to
a record 35th AL pennant.
	   He leads the Yankees in postseason hits (17), average (.395),
homers (four) and RBIs (14). Against the Padres in the Series, he's
7-for-13 (.538).
	   ``Certainly coming over here was a shot of adrenaline for me,''
Brosius said.
	   And he's doing this while worrying about his father, who was
back home in McMinnville, Oregon, recovering from colon cancer
surgery, until jetting into San Diego just before game time.
	   His seventh-inning homer woke up the Yankees, who had left the
bases loaded in the sixth and given up three runs in the bottom
half.
	   With Hoffman, the best closer in baseball, going for San Diego
in the eighth, Brosius worked the count to 2-1, then fouled off a
pitch. The next one went flying over the 405-foot sign in
straightaway center field.
	   ``With Trevor, he's the type of pitcher that you know you have
to battle and hope you get a pitch to hit,'' Brosius said. ``On the
second pitch, he threw me a fastball that I fouled off. Later he
came back with another one that I stayed back on and hit it.''
	   That was that. The Padres never recovered. Chalk up Win No. 124.
	   One more to go, and the magical ride is complete.
	   ``We'd like to get 125, that would feel really good,'' Brosius
said. ``We're in pretty good shape.''

Archaeologists find human remains inside Mexican pyramid

<TEXT>
	   TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico (AP) _ Archaeologists have found a human
skeleton and many artifacts inside the Pyramid of the Moon, once
the biggest ceremonial center of pre-Colombian Mexico.
	   The skeleton was discovered in a structure buried by the later
construction of the pyramid, which served as a platform for a high
altar _ not as a tomb in the Egyptian style.
	   The excavations since June showed that the step-type pyramids,
made most of tamped earth, loose rocks and an outer layer of
mortared stone, may have been built over an earlier civilization
before the mysterious Teotihuacanos.
	   ``It could be very important, once we find out more,'' Saburu
Sugiyama, a Japanese-born archaeologist from Arizona State
University, said Tuesday. ``The skeleton _ bones, but in a very
good condition _ was found buried in a sitting position, facing
south.''
	   Sugiyama said the skeleton is still half buried. Its gender and
age have not been determined, but he estimated it could date to 100
A.D. to 150 A.D.''
	   ``It must have belonged to somebody important, because of the
amount and quality of funeral offerings surrounding it,'' he said.
Around 150 artifacts have been found in the tomb _ figurines,
ceramics, statuettes, jade carvings, and obsidian.
	   The obsidian objects included arrow and spear heads and very
finely ground, small obsidian knives that could have been used to
sew cloth.
	   Sugiyama is one of an international team of archeologists
exploring and mapping the pyramid. Involved are the University of
Tokyo, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the University
of the Americas in Mexico and the National Institute of History and
Anthropology.
	   They are also financing the project jointly, together with the
National Science Foundation of the United States, Ruben Cabrera
Castro, coordinator of the project, told a news conference.
	   Sugiyama said the tomb was discovered by accident about 10 days
ago. The team is digging low tunnels at the bottom of the pyramid
from north to south and from west to east to find out what is
inside the structure.
	   The Pyramid of the Moon is located at the upper end of the
Avenue of the Dead, which runs north-to-south in Teotihuacan.
Further south, on the eastern edge the avenue, is the much taller
Pyramid of the Sun.
	   And at the lower tip of the avenue is the temple of
Quetzalcoatl, the sacred plumed serpent. To one side of it,
decorated with elaborate stone carvings, is a cluster of low
buildings known as the ``Great Complex.''
	   Teotihuacan, in the valley of the same name 30 miles (48
kilometers) north of Mexico City, was a thriving city and
ceremonial center that predated the Aztecs by several centuries.
	   But very little is known about it. Investigators have found the
pyramids and buildings close by, artifacts, a few pictographs, but
no hieroglyphs or other writings of any kind.
	   Teotihuacan began declining sharply around 650 AD, and was
completely deserted by around 750 AD. No one yet knows why.

Noisy fans don't drive Yankees to distraction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with postgame item. &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ That wasn't an earthquake rocking Qualcomm
Stadium in Game 3 Tuesday night. It was 64,667 white towel-waving
Padres fans trying everything they could to drive the Yankees to
distraction.
	   ``You could feel the vibration,'' New York manager Joe Torre
said after the Yankees' 5-4 victory. ``I don't think I've ever been
in a louder ballpark than here.''
	   If the fans weren't yelling loud enough, the stadium sound
system continually blared a variety of hard rock music, including
AC/DC's ``Hell's Bells'' when Padres reliever Trevor Hoffman came
on in the eighth inning.
	   ``This place was rocking all night long,'' said Scott Brosius,
who hit a three-run homer in the eighth off Hoffman. ``It's just a
great atmosphere to play. A lot like Yankee Stadium, although we
were on the other side tonight. We heard they talked about this
ballpark being as loud as ours, and it was pretty close.''
	   Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter wasn't impressed.
	   ``They're loud, but we play in New York,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GREEN ACRES: &LR;  Talk about a bad dye job.
	   The grounds crew at Qualcomm Stadium spread 10,000 gallons
(38,000 liters) of a vegetable dye called ``Wintergreen'' mixed
with fertilizer on the field in an effort to make it presentable
for Game 3 Tuesday night.
	   It's the second time the field needed treatment during the
postseason.
	   Even with the cosmetic assist, the grass looked less than
suitable for a World Series. Right-center field had bare spots from
tractors dragged over it to move stands while converting the
stadium from baseball to football and back to baseball.
	   The Padres share the stadium with the National Football League's
San Diego Chargers, who had a home game last Sunday that chewed up
the field and created divots in the outfield.
	   ``It's not bad,'' San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``It's
going to be quick. It looks green. The dirt is green.''
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner wasn't impressed.
	   ``That thing is like a cow pasture,'' he said after walking the
field and complaining about divots.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FIRST PITCH: &LR;  Baseball honored the memory of the late Anaheim
Angels owner Gene Autry by having his widow, Jackie, throw out the
ceremonial first pitch for Game 3.
	   Autry died Oct. 2, three days after turning 91. He founded the
California Angels as an American League franchise in 1961. He sold
25 percent of the team, now renamed, to the Walt Disney Co. in
1996.
	   The Angels never won a pennant, a major disappointment for one
of the sport's biggest fans. Autry died one week after the Angels
were eliminated from the American League West playoff race by the
Texas Rangers.
	   Hall of Fame outfielder and San Diego native Ted Williams was
scheduled to throw out the first pitch, but plans fell through at
the last minute. Baseball officials did not immediately say what
the problem was.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOCAL HERO: &LR;  The last time Shane Spencer was at a World Series
game in San Diego he sat in the upper deck in right field.
	   ``You couldn't even see the scoreboard,'' he said, recalling
Game 2 of the 1984 Series between the Padres and Detroit Tigers.
	   Spencer's view was much better Tuesday _ he started in left
field.
	   The rookie outfielder, who grew up in San Diego, was New York
manager Joe Torre's last-second selection to start for the Yankees.
Torre decided to use Spencer, a right-handed hitter, over Chad
Curtis, Chili Davis, Tim Raines and Ricky Ledee against lefty
Sterling Hitchcock.
	   Ledee, another rookie, is 4-for-6 in the Series so far.
	   ``I'm totally excited,'' Spencer said. ``I'm going to be a
little nervous during introductions, but after that I'll be fine.
I've already seen guys (in the stands) that I grew up with.''
	   Spencer became an instant celebrity in New York after hitting 10
home runs in just 27 games during the regular season, and then
homering twice as the Yankees swept Texas in the division series.
	   Spencer's a pretty popular guy here this week, but Torre
insisted before the game that didn't factor into his decision.
	   ``If you wouldn't have told me that yesterday I wouldn't have
known anything about it,'' said Torre, who on Monday told both
Raines and Spencer to be prepared to start. ``No, I did it strictly
on hopefully the ability of putting the right guy in left field.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IRABOOOOOO: &LR;  Hideki Irabu got to hear how disliked he is in San
Diego.
	   Irabu's refusal to sign with the Padres last year after they had
purchased his rights from a Japanese League team never sat well
with local fans, who didn't appreciate the Yankee pitcher's snub of
their team and city.
	   Introduced as a reserve before Game 3, Irabu was roundly booed
by the Qualcomm Stadium crowd. He doffed his cap as he jogged to
take his place on the third base line.
	   ``He was so adamant about that he didn't want to be a Padre,
that he didn't want anything to do with the Padres,'' San Diego
general manager Kevin Towers said.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk, seen as
perhaps the only man influential enough to end Cambodia's political
deadlock, will leave the country to seek medical treatment in China
next month, a local paper reported Wednesday.
	   The Cambodia Daily quoted the king in a faxed message to its
publisher as saying he required medical treatment and would leave
for Beijing ``about Nov. 11.''
	   The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety of ailments and
periodically visits his Chinese doctors for examinations. He was
diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into
remission.
	   The announcement of Sihanouk's travel plans comes as
negotiations remain stalled between Cambodian leader Hun Sen's
ruling party and the two-party opposition over the formation of a
government following a July election.
	   The three parties asked Sihanouk earlier this month to lead a
summit in hopes his influence could end the deadlock, but the
opposition's insistence that it be held outside Cambodia has been
rejected by Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a narrow majority in the
election, but not the two-thirds in parliament necessary to form a
government on its own.
	   The opposition, which claims Hun Sen's victory was achieved
through fraud and intimidation, has refused to cooperate with the
ruling party until its allegations are thoroughly investigated.
	   Sihanouk presided over a series of negotiations last month that
led to a ceremonial opening of parliament on Sept. 24, but
opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
left Cambodia the next day and have not returned.
	   Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians
following two alleged attempts on his life, both Ranariddh and
Rainsy have said they are unable to negotiate freely in Cambodia
and asked Sihanouk to host a summit in Beijing.
	   CPP spokesman Khieu Kanharith insisted a summit should be held
on Cambodian soil, but said a call by the king to meet in Beijing
would not be rejected.
	   ``We never say no to the king's decisions,'' he said.
	   A constitutional monarch, Sihanouk has limited powers but is
revered by most of his subjects.

Report: Indonesia lifts ban on American college professor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Muladi in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An American college professor who was
barred from Indonesia after linking a Cabinet minister to an
allegedly shady business deal is now free to visit the country, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Professor Jeffrey Winters of Northwestern University in
Evanston, Illinois angered the Indonesian political establishment
earlier this month with remarks about the chief economics minister,
Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   Ginandjar, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been widely
praised by international lenders and foreign governments for his
efforts to revitalize Indonesia's crisis-ridden economy.
	   Local media quoted Winters as saying in Jakarta that Ginandjar
had facilitated a deal in his previous position as Indonesia's
mines minister.
	   In the deal, a local company, the Bakrie Group, had purchased
shares from PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of New Orleans,
Louisiana-based Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   Justice Minister Muladi slapped a ban on Winters last week in a
sign that reform-minded Indonesia remains sensitive to criticism
despite the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto in May.
	   The Kompas newspaper on Wednesday quoted Muladi as saying that
the ban on Winters had been dropped but that Indonesia was still
eager for Winters to explain the allegations.
	   ``There is no ban on Winters. Please visit Indonesia,'' Muladi
said.
	   Winters, who has just ended a two-week trip to Indonesia, denied
that he had accused Ginandjar of being corrupt. He said he was
simply referring to a report by a respected Indonesian think-tank
about the propriety of Ginandjar's actions.
	   The government renewed its contract of work with Freeport in
1991 after the miner sold a 10 percent stake of its Indonesian
operation to the Bakrie Group, under an agreement to boost
Indonesian participation in the mine.
	   Freeport operates a huge gold and copper mine in the remote
province of Irian Jaya.

Report: Death toll rises to 12 from capsized Malaysian boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The death toll from a weekend boat
accident off Malaysia's western coast rose to 12 Wednesday, with
rescuers still searching for three more bodies, a news report said.
	   Police said they discovered the body of Norhisham Hashim, 20,
about five kilometers (three miles) away from the resort island of
Pulau Besar off the southwestern state of Malacca, the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   Eighteen others on board swam to safety or were rescued after
strong waves flipped the overcrowded boat at around midnight
Sunday. It was carrying mostly workers from a resort on Pulau Besar
island.
	   Officials have suspended the license of the boat's owner after
discovering 33 people had been crammed into the tourist vessel,
which had a capacity of 12.
	   Police said they were still looking for three people, Haslinda
Abdullah, Zaiful Azhar Mohamed and Hafizah Mohamed Dom.

Thai Central Bank governor predicts economy will grow in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank chief said
Wednesday he expects inflation and interest rates to fall by year's
end, and that the economy will start growing again next year.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, also
said he expects gross domestic product to show a positive growth of
1 percent in 1999.
	   That prediction, however, is at odds with most analysts, who say
Thailand's recession-ravaged economy will contract by about 7
percent this year.
	   Inflation will be 8 percent for 1998, lower than International
Monetary Fund estimates of 9.2 percent, Chat Mongkol told a press
conference.
	   He added that it won't exceed 5 percent in 1999, which would
mark a return to levels common before an economic crisis hit the
country in 1997.
	   Unlike some previous central bank governors who routinely made
overly-optimistic economic forecasts for political reasons, Chatu
Mongkol is regarded as independent and one of the country's most
skilled technocrats.
	   The IMF is overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the Thai
economy. As part of its assistance, the IMF has demanded economic
reforms and set targets on spending, inflation and other indicators
for the country's planners.
	   Chatu Mongkol cited the declining purchasing power of Thai
consumers, and the stability of the country's currency, the baht,
as the reasons for improved inflation figures.
	   The stable baht will also help bring down interest rates at
banks to 12-13 percent, he said.
	   The governor also said the Bank of Thailand has not participated
in the foreign exchange market this week as there has been no
unusual movement in the market.
	   The central bank had bought dollars in recent weeks to settle
its forward foreign currency contracts, but not to prevent the rise
of the Thai currency, Chatu Mongkol said.
	   The baht is at an 11-month high against the dollar, trading at
37.85 to the dollar early Wednesday.
	   Thai exports could be hurt if the value of the baht rises too
fast against other foreign currencies, Thai government officials
have said.
	   ``I see no sudden surge of inflow of foreign capital so there is
no need for us to get into the market,'' Chatu Mongkol said. ``The
exchange rate of the baht is now quite stable.''
	   Bangkok-based foreign exchange dealers have attributed the
recent rally of the baht to foreign capital inflows to buy Thai
assets.
	   The state Financial Sector Restructuring Authority will auction
some property projects belonging to 56 shutdown finance companies
next month. On December 2, the FRA will auction 400 billion baht
(U.S. dlrs 10.5 billion) worth of loan portfolios from those
companies.

IOC spokesman rejects U.S. medal claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A bid by four United States swimmers
hoping to upgrade their 1976 Olympic silver medals to gold was
rejected by a leading International Olympic Committee official
Wednesday.
	   Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board member who is a
front-runner to eventually replace Olympic leader Juan Antonio
Samaranch, reiterated the IOC's opposition to retrospective action
on suspected drug users.
	   ``We are not going to change what has happened in the past,''
Rogge said. ``There's absolutely not going to be any change for
things that happened more than 10 years ago.''
	   Citing evidence in a court probe of sports doping in the old
East German regime, the U.S. Olympic Committee said Monday it was
preparing to ask for ``appropriate medal recognition'' for the
American women's 400-meter medley relay team from the 1976 Games.
	   The quartet of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile Wright and
Shirley Babashoff was beaten by 6.6 seconds by the East German team
in Montreal but a German court case has provided what the USOC sees
as irrefutable evidence that one of the Germans was helped by
illegal performance-enhancing drugs.
	   USOC president Bill Hybl said the USOC would not ask that the
East German quartet of Ulrike Richter, Hannelore Anke, Andrea
Pollack and Kornelia Ender relinquish its title, because the doping
appeared to be unknown to the athletes at the time.
	   Hybl said he would ``pursue having appropriate medal
recognition'' for the quartet with Samaranch over the next 2-3
weeks.
	   But Rogge maintained IOC's stance that it was too difficult to
prove that doping robbed athletes of medals during the era.
	   ``You have to have documented evidence if you want to reopen
these cases,'' Rogge said. ``We know of course that there was a
doping problem in some countries but at this stage we still have no
documented evidence of doping of an athlete on the day of Olympic
competitions.
	   ``You cannot just condemn someone because there was a general
problem. Not all of them have taken drugs.''
	   Australian officials tried a similar approach to the IOC earlier
this year through IOC vice-president Kevan Gosper. The approach was
made on behalf of sprinter Raelene Boyle who finished with silver
in the 100- and 200-meter races in 1972 behind East German Renate
Stecher.
	   ``We pursued it because Raelene Boyle raised it with us,'' AOC
president John Coates said Wednesday. ``The response we got was the
response Jacques gave just then.''
	   Coates said he understood the IOC point of view.
	   ``I don't know how you rewrite the record books. And then you've
got different drugs with different rules applying at different
times,'' Coates said.
	   He said if the IOC ever changed its mind on the matter he would
be lining up alongside those like Hybl.
	   ``If the door opens and the IOC is receptive then obviously we'd
have cases on the table as well,'' Coates said. ``I feel very much
for the athletes who now realize they were beaten by people who it
seems had drug benefits, but I think it's very difficult to rewrite
history.''

Japanese stocks close sharply higher, dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices finished sharply higher
Wednesday on optimism that Japan's troubled banks were moving
closer to seeking public funds to boost their depleted capital. The
U.S. dollar was higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
408.28 points, or 2.96 percent, closing the day at 14,216.33. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei had gained 240.85 points, or 1.78 percent.
	   It was the first time the Nikkei finished above 14,000 since
Sept. 24.
	   The rise came on the heels of reported comments by Industrial
Bank of Japan President Masao Nishimura, who was quoted by the
Nihon Keizai newspaper as saying that his bank would apply for
public funds under a government plan. IBJ is the first bank to say
it will seek public money.
	   ``The move will lead to more financial stability and is raising
hopes that banks will ease their restrictive lending policies,
alleviating the credit crunch,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer money into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   Increasing expectations that the government will hold an
extraordinary parliamentary session in December to pass additional
economic stimulus steps also helped boost market sentiment, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section added 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, to 1,071.83. The
TOPIX had risen 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
39.40 points, or about 0.5 percent, to close at 8,505.85. It was
the Dow's first close above 8,500 since late August.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar bought 116.44 yen in
mid-afternoon trading, up 1.30 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
lower than its level of 116.83 yen in late New York trading
overnight.
	   Traders said that steady dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors was preventing a further drop in the U.S. currency,
although the dollar remained below its late New York level on
continued selling by U.S. hedge funds.
	   The yen, meanwhile, was supported by the IBJ president's
comments on public funds, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.825 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.71 from 108.81 yen.

Gymnast Moceanu sues for independence from parents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu, a member of the 1996
U.S. Olympic team that won a team gold medal, is suing for
independence from her parents, alleging that they squandered her
fortune and oppressed her for years.
	   Moceanu, 17, filed a state lawsuit in Houston on Monday asking
to be declared a legal adult so her parents can't control her or
her money, the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.
	   A judge signed a temporary restraining order saying Dumitru and
Camelia Moceanu must stay away from the gymnast, who ran away from
their Harris County home on Sunday, until a Nov. 11 hearing.
	   Dumitru Moceanu, who opened a gym last year with some of his
daughter's earnings, declined comment to the newspaper. His wife
couldn't be reached for comment.
	   According to Miss Moceanu's lawsuit, her father has wasted money
she earned since turning professional at age 10.
	   But she told the Chronicle on Tuesday that the problem is about
much more than money.
	   ``I never had a childhood,'' said Miss Moceanu, who added that
her parents fueled her Olympic dream starting at age 3. ``When I
went to compete when I was young, I always was in fear because I
would get yelled at by my father, and I would say to myself, `I'm
13 years old, come on,''' she said. ``Instead of talking to me,
they're always yelling with me, fighting with me.''
	   Although many teen-agers have similar feelings toward their
parents, Miss Moceanu said her life has been far from typical.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Miss Moceanu said. ``We've been trying to keep things
hidden.''
	   The gymnast also told the newspaper her father has hit her ``a
couple of times.''
	   The gymnast and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, both declined to say
how much money she has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore
said a trust that had been set up for her is all but gone.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she said. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Moore said the Moceanu couple, Romanian immigrants, have refused
to answer their daughter's questions about where the money has
gone.
	   The attorney said all Moceanu must prove to gain her legal adult
status is that she is living away from home and can support
herself. Once that status is granted, she will be able to demand an
accounting of her money through legal channels, Moore said.
	   Moceanu said she has been hiding from her parents for the past
few days, moving from house to house to stay with friends.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games.
	   She's the only member of that team still competing in all
gymnastics events and is aiming to compete in the world
championships next year and possibly the Sydney Games in 2000.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition at the Goodwill Games.
	   Despite the legal action, she hopes to mend her relationship
with her parents.
	   ``I love my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is
over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

Russia's religious leaders honor Armenian Archbishop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Religious and secular leaders honored the
archbishop of Russia's Armenian Apostolic Church on the 50th
anniversary of the Moscow diocese, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church leader, Patriarch Alexy II, praised
Archbishop Tiran's contribution to understanding between Russians
and Armenians, and decorated the archbishop with the Order of
Daniel of Moscow.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov spoke at the Tuesday night ceremony,
and messages were sent by Armenian Apostolic Catholicos Karekin I,
the speakers of both houses of Russia's parliament, and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's office.
	   The Russian and Novo-Nakhichevan Eparchy, or diocese, was
founded 50 years ago. Archbishop Tiran has headed it for 22 years.
	   The archbishop is credited with participating in the settlement
of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, an ethnic Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan, within preventing ethnic conflicts in the
North Caucasus region of Russia, and speaking out against violence
and religious and nationalist fanaticism, ITAR-Tass said.

Yeltsin stays at country home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating
from a cold, was staying at his residence just west of Moscow on
Wednesday, his office said.
	   Yeltsin's illness, described as a respiratory infection, forced
him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last week, and he has
spent most of his time since then at his country residencies.
	   The president has canceled a trip to Malaysia scheduled for next
month, but officials said his trip to Vienna for a summit with the
European Union next week is still on.
	   However, Russian media, citing Yeltsin's chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, have reported that Yeltsin is unlikely to make any more
foreign trips during his presidency.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery two years ago. He has kept an
increasingly low political profile, briefly venturing into the
Kremlin two or three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and staunchly deny
speculation that the president has serious health problems _ a
suggestion that is repeated every time Yeltsin catches a cold.

Thai Central Bank governor predicts economy will grow in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 3rd graf that 7 percent contraction prediction for
1998 not at odds with analysts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank chief said
Wednesday he expects inflation and interest rates to fall by year's
end, and that the economy will start growing again next year.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said he
expects gross domestic product to grow 1 percent in 1999.
	   In 1998, most analysts expect Thailand's recession-ravaged
economy to contract by about 7 percent.
	   Inflation will be 8 percent for 1998, lower than International
Monetary Fund estimates of 9.2 percent, Chat Mongkol told a news
conference.
	   He added that it won't exceed 5 percent in 1999, which would
mark a return to levels common before an economic crisis hit the
country in 1997.
	   Unlike some previous central bank governors who routinely made
overly optimistic economic forecasts for political reasons, Chatu
Mongkol is regarded as independent and one of the country's most
skilled technocrats.
	   The IMF is overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the Thai
economy. As part of the package, it has demanded economic reforms
and set targets on spending, inflation and other indicators for the
country's planners.
	   Chatu Mongkol cited the declining purchasing power of Thai
consumers, and the stability of the country's currency, the baht,
as the reasons for improved inflation figures.
	   The stable baht will also help bring down interest rates at
banks to 12-13 percent, he said.
	   The governor also said the Bank of Thailand has not participated
in the foreign exchange market this week as there has been no
unusual movement in the market.
	   The central bank had bought dollars in recent weeks to settle
its forward foreign currency contracts, but not to prevent the rise
of the Thai currency, Chatu Mongkol said.
	   The baht is at an 11-month high against the dollar, trading at
37.85 to the dollar early Wednesday.
	   Thai exports could be hurt if the value of the baht rises too
fast against other foreign currencies, Thai government officials
have said.
	   ``I see no sudden surge of inflow of foreign capital so there is
no need for us to get into the market,'' Chatu Mongkol said. ``The
exchange rate of the baht is now quite stable.''
	   Bangkok-based foreign exchange dealers have attributed the
recent rally of the baht to foreign capital inflows to buy Thai
assets.
	   The state Financial Sector Restructuring Authority will auction
some property projects belonging to 56 shutdown finance companies
next month. On Dec. 2, the FRA will auction 400 billion baht (U.S.
dlrs 10.5 billion) worth of loan portfolios from those companies.

After new protest, education minister to offer new measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After another major nationwide student protest,
France's education minister was considering new measures to defuse
a movement by high schoolers demanding better classroom conditions.
	   Claude Allegre was scheduled to meet again Wednesday with
student leaders and was expected to announce new measures, a day
after nearly 300,000 youths took to the streets across the country.
	   Tuesday's marches, however, were smaller than ones last week
that drew an estimated half million students across the country.
French media on Wednesday read that as giving the leftist
government more time to seek a solution.
	   ``The students half-protest,'' headlined the leftist daily
Liberation. ``It feels like the end,'' said the front page of the
popular tabloid France-Soir, noting the weeklong Toussaint vacation
begins at the end of the week.
	   The Paris march that drew an estimated 25,000 students was
marred by hooligans despite the deployment of about 4,500 police
who conducted thousands of body searches.
	   Helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from aerosol cans to
disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a posh Left Bank
neighborhood and set fire to a subway car, temporarily interrupting
service on one line.
	   Police said 85 people were lightly injured in Paris. Some 110
young people were arrested nationwide, they said, and 90 of them
were taken into custody.
	   Many of the hooligans were older than the high school students,
who insist the troublemakers have no connection to their movement.
	   But the violence was also an indicator of deeper problems. High
unemployment as well as school neglect in poor suburbs around Paris
have been blamed for chronic and rising youth violence. Recent
crippling strikes by transit drivers attacked by youths pay
testament.
	   Allegre faces a tough budget hold-down by a government under
pressure to keep the budget deficit within 3 percent of the gross
domestic product, as required by the euro single currency that
takes effect at the end of the year.
	   During Tuesday's protest the students' frustration remained
strong despite government promises to hire more teachers, buy new
equipment and reduce the heavy courseload.
	   ``We're here because we've got 40 kids in one classroom that's
falling apart,'' said Ablo Tham, from the working class suburb of
Trappes. ``If the government doesn't listen, we'll make sure it
does.''
	   Many students wore yellow-and-black stickers calling on Allegre
to resign. Others waved banners with colorful slogans reflecting
their anger.
	   ``No promises. Action,'' read a banner in Bordeaux. ``No
teachers, no future,'' read one Paris banner.

Anwar's wife hopes she won't be arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of Malaysia's jailed
dissident leader said Wednesday she hoped she would not be arrested
on charges of encouraging protests against Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   The comments by Azizah Ismail, wife of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim, came after rumors of her arrest swept
across Kuala Lumpur. Reporters and photographers rushed to her
home.
	   Fears of her arrest were fueled by comments by Mahathir Tuesday
just before he concluded a five-day visit to Tokyo.
	   Soon after Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest following a mammoth public
rally demanding Mahathir's resignation, police warned Azizah she
would face the same fate if she led the campaign her husband
started.
	   She drove up to a street protest for the first time Saturday,
waving at the slogan-shouting demonstrators and shaking hands with
many of them.
	   ``I hope the police won't arrest (her), but I don't know. That
is the police business,'' Mahathir reportedly said.
	   On Tuesday, Azizah denied joining the protest. She had driven to
the demonstration out of curiosity, she said.
	   ``I have not committed any offense,'' Azizah added.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli declined to given an assurance
in Parliament on Wednesday that Azizah would not be arrested under
the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention
without trial. The ISA was used against Anwar and many of his
allies.
	   The law would be used only against those who threaten public
security and national stability, the minister said.
	   Of the nearly two dozen people arrested under the ISA in recent
weeks, four are still in jail and will remain there until they
renounce the street protests, Tajol Rosli said.
	   Many of those arrested have come out of prison and made public
statements saying they were not part of the anti-government
campaign.
	   The campaign began after Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2. The
two had differed over economic policy, but Mahathir said he had
acted because Anwar was morally unfit to lead. Anwar since has been
charged with sexual misconduct and corruption _ charges he says are
false and politically motivated.
	   On Wednesday, the government warned the editor of an opposition
newspaper, which has increased its circulation since the pro-Anwar
campaign began, not to sell at newsstands.
	   The editor of the publication run by the Parti Islam SeMalaysia,
or PAS, was summoned to the Home Ministry to explain why the party
newsletter was being sold publicly as a daily newspaper, an
official said. He did not say when the editor was called in.
	   The Harakah daily and other fringe publications by opposition
activists on the Internet have become increasingly popular among
Malaysians jaded by pro-government coverage in the nation's major
newspapers.

Supplements may offer alternative in fighting heart disease
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ New research suggests that
swallowing a supplement packed with artery-protecting nutrients may
be just as effective in preventing heart disease as sipping a good
Cabernet.
	   The nutrients are flavonoids, vitamin-like compounds that
naturally occur in tea and in fruits and vegetables. They make
blood cells called platelets less prone to clotting, and also act
as antioxidants, countering the artery-damaging potential of highly
reactive free radical chemicals.
	   The new findings, presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the
American Dietetic Association, indicate pregnant women and others
who should avoid alcohol can reap the benefits of red wine without
drinking it.
	   Red wine's role in warding off heart trouble was made famous by
research showing that the French, with red wine as a staple, have
lower rates of heart disease despite their penchant for high-fat
food.
	   John Folts, a University of Wisconsin researcher, said tests on
14 people who took the supplement ProVex CV over seven days showed
``significant and encouraging'' reductions in platelet activity.
	   ProVex CV is made by Melaleuca Inc. of Idaho Falls, Idaho, which
funded the research. The supplement contains extracts made of grape
seeds, grape skins, Ginkgo biloba, bilberries and a specific
flavonoid called quercetin.
	   ProVex CV was one of four flavonoid supplements examined by
Folts but was the only one he said showed significant benefits.
	   Larger studies are being planned.
	   ``The problem with red wine, which I enjoy, is that there's many
people who cannot and should not drink alcoholic beverages,'' said
Folts, whose 1973 research led to therapy using aspirin to prevent
heart attacks. ``We know alcohol is not the critical requirement.
We're looking at the other things to provide the necessary
anti-platelet, antioxidant properties that you get with red wine.''
	   Those other things might include onions, garlic, broccoli,
celery, grapes and lemons _ all rich in flavonoids but often low on
the list of diners' preferences.
	   Because many consumers don't eat enough fruits and vegetables,
they'll likely miss the benefits of flavonoids without outside
help, such as red wine.
	   ``People should consume five to seven servings of fruits and
vegetables every day,'' Folts said. ``For those who cannot and will
not do this, a flavonoid supplement ... may be useful.''
	   Researchers say green and black teas are also a good source of
flavonoids. Although there are no known guidelines for flavonoid
consumption, researchers say daily intakes of between 500
milligrams and 800 milligrams _ equivalent to two or three cups of
tea _ have shown marked platelet reductions and antioxidant
qualities.
	   Still, doctors say nothing beats fruits and vegetables for
health benefits.
	   ``The U.S. is not doing what it should to get fruits and
vegetables in its diet,'' said Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a heart
researcher at Harvard Medical School. ``Mom was right when she told
you to eat your vegetables.''

Religious party prepares for massive Islamic gathering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of members of an orthodox
Islamic religious party were erecting a tent city in the heart of
the federal capital on Wednesday in preparation for a massive
three-day gathering aimed at ''enforcing a true Islamic order'' in
Pakistan.
	   More than 10,000 tents stretch across the vast lush-green lawns
outside the grand marble Faisl Mosque, its giant minarets reaching
skyward to dominate the capital skyline.
	   The small, but powerful right-wing religious group,
Jamaat-e-Islami, which is organizing the three-day conference
beginning Friday in Islamabad, expects about 500,000 people to
attend.
	   Giant green banners have been strung across the wide tree-lined
boulevards of the capital extolling the virtues of an Islamic state
and calling on the faithful to fight for their religion.
	   ''Pakistan is for Islam and nothing else,'' said a Jamaat worker
Miraj Uddin. ''We want to establish a society based on justice and
free from corruption ... it is a misconception that Islam only
means chopping off the hands and feet of the criminals.''
	   Rather he said his version of Islam is a ''system in which the
poor will be heard, there will be justice and peace, and
accountability of corrupt rulers like (Prime Minister Nawaz)
Sharif.''
	   Jamaat-e-Islami has dismissed Sharif's attempts to impose
Islamic law in Pakistan as a thinly veiled ploy to consolidate
power in his hands.
	   ''These rulers are using the name of Islam ... they are not
sincere to enforce Islam,'' said Jamaat leader Liaqat Baluch.
	   Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League already has passed a
controversial constitutional amendment in the National Assembly,
the lower house of parliament, which would give the federal
government the authority to ''prescribe what is right and forbid
what is wrong'' according to its interpretation of Islam.
	   The amendment still must be passed by the Senate to become law
and it's not certain that Sharif will be able to muster the votes
he needs.
	   Human rights activists and members of minority religious groups
in Pakistan have adamantly opposed the amendment saying it will
give the radical Islamic element in Pakistan greater authority to
impose its rules on the majority.
	   Opposition politicians say it will be a precursor to a
Taliban-style government, a reference to the hard-line religious
militia which rules in neighboring Afghanistan.
	   The Jamaat, which boycotted the 1997 elections, is the bulwark
of Islamic revivalist movement in Pakistan. It has seldom garnered
more than 3 percent of the vote in elections, but it is considered
the most organized and militant party.
	   Its military wing, Hezbul Mujahedeen, sends young Pakistanis to
fight in India's Jammu-Kashmir state, which has a Muslim majority,
and its volunteers also fought in the Afghan resistance movement
against Soviet forces.

IOC urges tax exemption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
executive board member Jacques Rogge has urged Australia's
government to exempt Sydney's 2000 Olympics from a planned goods
and services tax (GST).
	   John Howard's conservative government won reelection earlier
this month on a platform of tax reform, which included a proposal
for a 10 percent GST to be in place for July 2000.
	   Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee (SOCOG) president Michael
Knight wants a previous exemption from sales and income tax
extended to cover the GST if it is passed through parliament.
	   Knight, who is also a politician on the opposite side to the
conservatives, has estimated a GST on SOCOG services could cost the
organization up to Aust dlrs 200 million (U.S. dlrs 126 million).
Most of the cost will come because tickets sold before July 2000
will attract GST on the service provided at the Sept. 2000 games.
	   SOCOG will brief the IOC Coordination Commission, headed by
Rogge, on the GST during this week's visit to monitor Sydney's
progress.
	   ``We would, of course, hope that SOCOG would be exempted. It is
a serious issue and there is a potential blowout on the budget if a
GST is imposed,'' said Rogge, who will state his view directly to
new Sports Minister Jackie Kelly.
	   ``This is an Australian issue on which the IOC cannot interfere.
We will express the wish that SOCOG's body should not be affected
by the GST or other issues, while at the same time being respectful
of Australian sovereignty.''
	   Rogge and other members of the IOC group toured Olympic venues
Wednesday and they were impressed with the progress with a little
under two years before the opening ceremony.
	   ``The progress we've seen now from the last visit in April is
really impressive. This heralds for an excellent games,'' Rogge
said.
	   Since the group's previous visit in April SOCOG has held its
first test event, with a yachting regatta on Sydney Harbor.
	   ``We've got very good feedback from the international
federation, which was very happy, and the athletes were very happy
and we will get feedback now from SOCOG's perspective,'' Rogge
said.

Italian premier-designate D'Alema close to presenting Cabinet list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema met with Italy's
president early Wednesday and was expected to release a list of
Cabinet choices shortly after their meeting.
	   News reports said D'Alema had asked several ministers in Romano
Prodi's government to stay on, including Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as
treasury and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco as finance
minister. The two are considered key figures to help push through
Italy's 1999 budget, necessary for Italy to maintain its economic
commitments to the European Monetary Union.
	   D'Alema is expected to have 24 ministers compared to Prodi's 19.
	   Before he can start governing, D'Alema still needs to go to
Parliament and ask for a vote of confidence. He is expected to call
the vote Friday which would make him premier in time to attend the
European Union summit in Austria Saturday.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked the former Communist to
form Italy's 56th postwar government Monday, after D'Alema reported
that he had assembled a parliamentary majority. D'Alema spent
several days bargaining with centrist and leftist parties to secure
support.
	   D'Alema has outlined policies in line with Prodi's, who guided
Italy into the European economic and currency union.
	   The parties in D'Alema's center-left coalition pledged to pursue
privatization at the pace Prodi had set, to strive for a 35-hour
work week and to tackle unemployment with government funds linked
to private investment in infrastructure projects
	   Communist hard-liners, upset by a 1999 budget they said did not
do enough to stimulate jobs, provoked the crisis which led to
Prodi's Oct. 9 resignation. Communist Refoundation's leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, has refused to join D'Alema's government.
	   Another wing of the Italian Communists, which broke away from
Refoundation over the budget impasse, have pledged support to
D'Alema.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-long center-left coalition lasted longer than
all but one government in Italy since World War II.

Abkhazia promises to detain Georgian mutiny leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Authorities in the breakaway region of
Abkhazia promised Wednesday to detain the fugitive leader of a
Georgian mutiny if he tries to cross into the territory they
control.
	   Akakiy Eliava and a few supporters have been in hiding since
Tuesday, after a one-day revolt against Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze failed. Mutinous soldiers have returned to their
garrison in western Georgia, and Eliava and some of his men have
been charged with treason.
	   The security chief of Abkhazia, Astamur Tarba, denied
speculation Wednesday that Eliava and his supporters may have
entered the region, which borders on the area where the revolt
occurred.
	   Abkhazian security services think Eliava is hiding near the
Georgian Black Sea port of Poti, not far from the western town of
Senaki, where the mutiny originated.
	   If Eliava and his men try to cross into Abkhazia, ``they will be
detained, or killed if they offer resistance,'' Tarba was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province, declared independence after

a 13-month war. Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in
1994, sporadic clashes have continued.
	   Eliava is a military commander who is also a supporter of the
late Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

After drought breaks, kangaroos eating themselves to death

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Kangaroos are dying by the thousands in
a region of Australia's Outback, victims of illness believed caused
by recent drought-breaking rains producing food too rich for them
to handle.
	   In a region of far northwest New South Wales state, kangaroos
hop wildly out of control as the illness alters their sense of
balance. Other symptoms include lethargy that leaves them lying in
the dirt, unable to move or eat until they die, researchers said
Wednesday.
	   Local farmers and scientists say up to 5,000 kangaroos may have
died in the past three weeks _ about 10 percent of the estimated
population in the Sturt National Park at the corner of New South
Wales, Queensland and South Australia states.
	   ``It's not a total wipeout but it's done a fair cull job,''
local farmer Bill O'Connor told Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV.
``It's taken the lot.''
	   David Croft, a kangaroo researcher and senior lecturer in
biological science at the University of New South Wales, said the
mass deaths probably were the result of natural selection, made
extreme by the environmental conditions of the Outback.
	   He said the deaths are believed linked to recent heavy rains in
the region, which have caused floods after a drought of almost five
years.
	   The rains have transformed a normally arid landscape into
verdant fields of native vegetation, but the kangaroos aren't used
to the rich food, and their digestive systems can't handle it,
Croft said.
	   ``These kangaroos have a digestive system which relies on
certain bacteria and during a time of drought this bacteria is
reduced,'' Croft said. ``After heavy rain, suddenly they get good
quality food and they get diarrhea.
	   ``They need time to rebuild the ability to digest the rich
food.''
	   He said weak or old kangaroos were more likely to be affected
than younger, fit kangaroos.
	   The symptoms of the illness are similar to those of a virus that
broke out in South Australia in 1995. That virus, spread by sand
flies, attacked the optic nerve, blinded and then killed up to 30
percent of the population of gray kangaroos in the state.
	   Croft said the cause of the current illness was difficult to pin
down, and it was possible a virus or poisonous plants were to
blame.
	   Scientists at a research station at Fowler's Gap in the region
had observed fewer kangaroo deaths in recent days, and the
reproduction cycle among the surviving fit kangaroos was expected
to flourish, he said.
	   The deaths are not expected to have a long-lasting effect on
kangaroo numbers in the region.
	   A veterinary pathologist from the National Parks and Wildlife
Service has been sent to collect samples to test for evidence of a
virus.
	   During the South Australian outbreak, farmers were concerned the
virus could spread to livestock.

Italian premier-designate D'Alema close to presenting Cabinet list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema met with Italy's
president early Wednesday and was expected to release a list of
Cabinet choices afterwards.
	   News reports said D'Alema had asked several ministers in Romano
Prodi's government to stay on, including Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as
treasury and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco as finance
minister. The two are considered key figures to help push through
the 1999 budget, necessary for Italy to maintain its economic
commitments to the European Monetary Union.
	   D'Alema is expected to have 24 ministers compared to Prodi's 19.
	   Before he can start governing, D'Alema still needs to go to
Parliament and ask for a vote of confidence. He is expected to call
the vote Friday, which would make him premier in time to attend the
European Union summit in Austria on Saturday.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked the former Communist to
form Italy's 56th postwar government Monday, after D'Alema reported
that he had assembled a parliamentary majority. D'Alema spent
several days bargaining with centrist and leftist parties to secure
support.
	   D'Alema has outlined policies in line with Prodi's, who guided
Italy into the European economic and currency union.
	   The parties in D'Alema's center-left coalition pledged to pursue
privatization at the pace Prodi had set, to strive for a 35-hour
work week and to tackle unemployment with government funds linked
to private investment in infrastructure projects
	   Communist hard-liners, upset by a 1999 budget they said did not
do enough to stimulate jobs, provoked the crisis which led to
Prodi's Oct. 9 resignation. Communist Refoundation's leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, has refused to join D'Alema's government.
	   Another wing of the Italian Communists, which broke away from
Refoundation over the budget impasse, have pledged support to
D'Alema.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-long center-left coalition lasted longer than
all but one government in Italy since World War II.

Indonesian students protest near Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 student activists briefly
blocked a toll road Wednesday after security officers prevented
them from marching to Parliament.
	   The demonstration was the latest in a wave of protests ahead of
a special assembly in November where legislators are expected to
approve guidelines for a May general election.
	   President B.J. Habibie is promoting democratic change after the
resignation five months ago of his authoritarian predecessor,
Suharto.
	   Students have often demonstrated against Habibie, arguing he
does not have the credibility to govern the nation of 200 million
people because he was a close ally of Suharto.
	   However, the students who rallied Wednesday said debates about
Habibie's political legitimacy and other potentially divisive
issues should be set aside for now.
	   They said economically fragile Indonesia, which endured riots
and protests before Suharto stepped down in May, needs unity among
its people to overcome widespread challenges.
	   ``It is time for reconciliation,'' said Densi, a student
protester.
	   Dozens of police and soldiers monitored the peaceful
demonstration, which tied up traffic for three hours on a highway
that leads to Jakarta's international airport.

May 1999 deadline focuses participants in Mideast talks

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ The clock is ticking on Middle East
peace talks.
	   The Israelis and the Palestinians are facing a May 1999 deadline
to complete a final agreement on how their peoples can live side by
side on the West Bank, giving up rocks and bombs for shared borders
and peace.
	   President Bill Clinton, damaged by personal scandal, is looking
to act presidential and show himself a second-term statesman.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who inherited a peace
process he had campaigned against, wants to deliver real security
to please right wing hard-liners in his government and embattled
Jewish settlers.
	   And Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopes to gain control of
the territory he was promised in the 1993 Oslo peace accords and
open an airport and seaport in Gaza to bring jobs and investment to
his impoverished people.
	   Deadlines and dreams of peace on their own terms brought the
leaders to this rural Maryland haven of autumn gold oaks and
off-and-on optimism as they worked to overcome obstacles that had
frozen progress for 19 months.
	   ``I'm prepared to invest as much time as it takes,'' Clinton
said in announcing the Wye Plantation talks after he and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said they saw a ``new spirit'' of
cooperation in Netanyahu and Arafat. ``I will be involved
constantly throughout the process.''
	   Indeed, Clinton extended the talks and spent time every day
except one meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat _ separately and
together _ sometimes into the early morning hours.
	   Besides an opportunity to promote Middle East peace, Clinton
also recognized a chance to polish his tarnished legacy, analysts
said, as he faces the prospect of impeachment over an affair with a
former White House intern and dissatisfaction among some Democrats
about his behavior and politics.
	   ``For Clinton, it's a great time to look presidential,'' said
Yahya Sadowski of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies.
	   Whether the talks fail or succeed hardly matters. ``His personal
credentials would only suffer if he didn't at least try,'' Sadowski
said.
	   James Phillips of the Heritage Foundation said the May 4
deadline laid down by Oslo _ and Arafat's threat to declare
statehood _ is prompting everybody to reach for a deal on so-called
interim issues such as preventing terrorism and handing over West
Bank territory from Israeli to Palestinian control so that final
status issues can be dealt with. Many see a Palestinian state as
inevitable.
	   ``There are a whole bunch of clocks ticking,'' Phillips said.
``The May 4th clock is ticking. The domestic politics clock is
ticking _ for both Clinton and Netanyahu. And Palestinian terrorism
is a kind of time bomb.''
	   Netanyahu, who in his 1996 election campaigned against the Oslo
accord, realizes he can use the lands-for-peace framework to lock
in security guarantees for his people _ not just promises but
verifiable action on the part of Palestinians to go after
extremists and bring them to justice.
	   ``Netanyahu wants to vindicate his own political platform of
peace with security,'' Phillips said. ``One of the ironies is these
negotiations themselves could threaten him with loss of support
from the right wing.''
	   As political cover, Netanyahu named hawk Ariel Sharon foreign
minister and brought him to Wye to sign off on any deal with the
Palestinians.
	   Arafat's strongest incentive to work out a deal at Wye is to
open up the airport and seaport in Gaza and improve the economic
situation of Palestinians, who under border closures face
double-digit unemployment as high as 50 percent. He also is intent
on getting as much West Bank land as possible under his control,
knowing it may be now or never.
	   ``The longer the economic situation festers among Palestinians,
the stronger Islamic fundamentalist opposition becomes,'' said
Phillips.
	   James Zogby of the Arab-American Institute, a frequent critic of
Israel, said the ``reality of violence and depravation'' in the
West Bank eventually will bring the two sides to agree on lasting
peace no matter what obstacles.
	   ``At the end of the day there's no alternative,'' Zogby said.
``The Israelis either have to expel, control or recognize
Palestinians. If we don't get peace now, we'll get it 10 years from
now. If not 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Ultimately, it
will come.''

Court to hear British arguments to extradite ex-spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected after 1200 GMT hearing

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court was hearing arguments Wednesday by
British authorities seeking the extradition of a former
intelligence agent who passed information to a London newspaper.
	   David Shayler and his lawyer failed earlier this month to
persuade a court to release him from jail pending an extradition
ruling.
	   A French prosecutor argued during the Oct. 7 hearing that
releasing the former MI5 agent could endanger other agents.
Shayler, who had sold information to a London newspaper, had
reportedly considered releasing more details on the Internet.
	   At the Palace of Justice on Wednesday afternoon, a judge was to
hear British authorities arguing Shayler's extradition. No
immediate decision was expected.
	   The 32-year-old former MI5 agent, arrested Aug. 1 at Britain's
request, would be charged under the Official Secrets Act if he is
returned home.
	   Shayler, who worked for MI5 from 1994 until 1997, maintains,
among other things, that Britain plotted the assassination of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation the government
denies.
	   Libya also has asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Playing host to an international conference on
African development, Tokyo on Wednesday pledged aid to the
continent totaling 90 billion yen (dlrs 776 million), mostly grants
for educational and health facilities.
	   ``The ultimate objective of development is to improve living
conditions for every human being,'' Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura said in announcing the aid that will span the next
five years.
	   Komura said the assistance will allow 2 million African children
to study in new schools and provide better medical services and
cleaner water to improve the lives of more than 15 million people.
	   At the opening of the three-day conference Monday, Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi promised continued aid to Africa, despite his
nation's lagging economy.
	   The 82 nations and 40 organizations at the 2nd Tokyo
International Conference on African Development also adopted a
resolution Wednesday promising to try to halve the number of
Africans living in poverty by 2015 through increased foreign
investment, better education and democratic governments.
	   ``Democracy and good governance, as well as peace and security,
are essential to socioeconomic development in Africa,'' said the
Tokyo Agenda for Action. ``Violent conflicts in a number of
countries constitute a major obstacle to sustainable development in
Africa.''
	   The Agenda for Action reaffirmed the need for economic
development in Africa, whose share of world trade totals less than
2 percent. Africa gets only 2 percent of total foreign direct
investment in developing countries.
	   Conference participants agreed that African nations should
increase spending on education so that by 2005, at least 80 percent
of children complete primary education. African economies would
need to grow by 5 percent a year for a significant reduction in
poverty, they said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who attended the conference,
called for more foreign aid and investment to help lift Africa out
of poverty.
	   He asked that nations that have extended loans to the poorest
African nations convert the debt into grants. As of 1996, Africa's
external debts totaled dlrs 323 billion and were a major obstacle
to growth, he said.
	   Annan acknowledged that reducing poverty in Africa was ``an
enormous task.''
	   ``But we should not be daunted, and we must start somewhere,''
he said in a speech at the closing ceremony.
	   During the conference, Japan promised to help set up centers in
Kenya and Ghana for training and research into the treatment of
diseases. Of the 31 million adults and children living with HIV or
AIDS worldwide, 21 million live in Africa.
	   Tokyo also said it will help to attract investments, expand rice
production, and promote tourism in Africa.
	   The conference, which followed one held five years ago in Tokyo,
also discussed the need for agricultural development, regional
cooperation and equality for African women.
	   The event was jointly sponsored by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

Russian defense minister calls Vietnam visit a success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Only the weather could put a damper on a
visit to Vietnam by Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
	   Sergeyev had been scheduled to visit Cam Ranh air base, a former
U.S. naval base rented to the Soviet navy in 1979, on Wednesday to
wrap up his two-day visit.
	   Bad weather at the base forced cancellation of the trip, but
Sergeyev still was upbeat about his meetings with top Vietnamese
military officials and Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu.
	   ``The sides discussed the present state of Russian-Vietnamese
military cooperation and general prospects for its development, as
well as bilateral interaction within the framework of the Asian
Pacific region,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Sergeyev as
saying.
	   ``Our positions are close, and we outlined the ways of
settlement of all controversial issues.''
	   He signed an agreement with Vietnamese Defense Minister Pham Van
Tra on military-technological cooperation between the two
countries.
	   ``We have mapped out all the future prospects,'' Sergeyev said.
``The main thing at present is to concentrate all our efforts on
the implementation of the intergovernmental agreement signed by
both sides.''
	   Phieu held a reception Tuesday night for Sergeyev and said
Vietnam never would forget the valuable support from the former
Soviet Union and Russia to the country's national liberation and
construction.
	   The Soviet Union was a key supporter of the former North
Vietnam, which defeated the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam
in a bloody, protracted war. The country was reunited in 1975.
	   Russia and Vietnam signed an agreement in 1993 allowing the
Russian navy to continue using Cam Ranh until 2004. Hanoi wants to
renegotiate the deal, saying Russia has reduced the amount of arms
it gives Vietnam as compensation for using the base.
	   ``It is still much time left before the year 2004 when the
agreement will expire,'' Sergeyev said. ``We will discuss all
issues connected with this problem, including financial issues.
	   ``We will set up a working group to conduct talks on
preservation of the Cam Ranh based used by the Russian navy.''
	   The Vietnamese are interested in Russian weaponry to modernize
their military, along with spare parts. ITAR-Tass says Hanoi is
planning to buy up to 24 Su-27 jet fighters worth about dlrs 800
million, along with MiG-29s, patrol and torpedo boats and
Molnia-class missile-firing vessels.
	   Sergeyev was to leave later Wednesday for stops in China and
India.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Former New York Jets defensive end Mark
Gastineau will be spared jail time for allegedly assaulting a
girlfriend _ who is now his wife _ but must undergo drug, alcohol
and violence counseling, according to his lawyer.
	   Gastineau was expected to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge
of assault or contempt for violating an order of protection and for
failing to show up for a court date, attorney Amelio Marino said
Tuesday.
	   Gastineau surrendered to police Monday after a judge issued a
warrant for his arrest. He had failed to appear in Manhattan
Criminal Court on charges of assaulting Patricia Schorr.
	   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Schorr, who added that she has no
intention of pressing charges against the former football star.
	   Gastineau, 41, was arrested Sept. 2 on charges of beating Schorr
in her East 60th St. apartment on Aug. 25. He slapped her face four
or five times, threw her against a wall and choked her while
threatening to kill her, said a court complaint.
	   Gastineau was charged with misdemeanor assault, menacing and
criminal possession of a weapon, a glass cocktail table with which
he threatened to hit Schorr, said the complaint.
	   Schorr and Gastineau married Sept. 28, she said.
	   Prosecutors, saying Gastineau was violent with his last four
girlfriends, including actress Brigitte Nielsen, asked the judge to
sentence him to four months.
	   After his planned release Wednesday, Gastineau and Schorr were
to go to the Domestic Violence Program's offices to arrange a
counseling schedule for drugs, alcohol and violence, his attorney
said.
	   Schorr, a former gym membership sales manager, said she and
Gastineau would live for the near future in her father's home in
Queens.
	   Gastineau set a record for quarterback sacks when he played for
the Jets in the 1980s. He now earns money from personal
appearances, said Schorr.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, President Slobodan Milosevic said Wednesday
he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement despite what he
called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   The Yugoslav leader's comments came after talks in Belgrade in
which Gen. Wesley Clark and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill laid out
what Milosevic still has to do in order to fully comply with the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. He faces a Tuesday deadline to do so or face the
renewed threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   A statement issued Wednesday by the official news agency Tanjug
said Milosevic told the American officials that ``despite armed
provocations by the terrorist groups ... Serbia and Yugoslavia
stand firm in their determination for a peaceful solution of the
Kosovo problem by political means.''
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes.
	   A recent increase in violence has raised fears about the
agreement, under which Milosevic pledged to meet U.N. demands,
including withdrawals, halting the crackdown, allowing
international agencies to help refugees and agreeing with ethnic
Albanians on a timetable for restoring self-rule.
	   But Western officials have been quick to point out progress
toward compliance in recent days, adding to speculation that the
Tuesday deadline _ already extended by 10 days _ will again be
pushed back.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday that
despite small-arms fire in several Kosovo towns, the cease-fire is
generally holding.
	   And Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said conditions
were improving for tens of thousands of refugees who fled into the
hills and forests to escape the fighting.
	   Bacon said about half the 50,000 to 70,000 refugees living
outdoors now have some sort of shelter.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the rebels issued a list of their
own demands, chief among them the complete withdrawal of government
forces from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and an investigation by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands of ``crimes against humanity.''
.
	   Meanwhile, international efforts to aid refugees continues. As
winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if the
estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting _ including
thousands still living outdoors _ are not allowed to return home.
	   Many fear they will be attacked if they return, while the houses
of others have been destroyed.

Third test of troubled Ariane 5 before commercial service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be updated after launch scheduled between 1600 and 1730 GMT

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ European space officials were holding their breath
Wednesday that the third launch of an Ariane 5 will confirm the new
rocket's viability and help maintain their lead in the world's
commercial launch market.
	   After the first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and another launch
was less-than-perfect since then, the third was to be launched
Wednesday from Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, on the
northern tip of South America.
	   ``Flight 503 is the final qualification flight,'' the
French-based European consortium said in a statement. But officials
also said that a failure would only mean more development and
testing.
	   ESA said in June that trouble with the Ariane 5, with twice and
power and payload capacity of the Ariane 4, forced officials to
switch a Eutelsat satellite to an Ariane 4.
	   Flight 503 will instead carry a mockup of Eutelsat's W2
satellite and an ``Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator,'' ESA said.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the second launch of the
rocket last Oct. 30 experienced a spin problem.
	   Arianespace, the business arm of the European Space Agency,
dominates the world's commercial launch market, competing with
U.S., Russian and Chinese firms.

Game 3 of Japan Series rained out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKOROZAWA, Japan (AP) _ The third game of the Japanese
professional baseball championship series between the Yokohama
BayStars and the Seibu Lions was postponed Wednesday because of
rain.
	   Game 3 of the best-of-seven series was rescheduled for Thursday
at the Lions' home ground, Seibu Dome, and the remaining games will
be delayed by one day each.
	   The BayStars, who had won their only other Central League
pennant 38 years ago, took the first two games, 9-4 and 4-0, at
their home stadium.
	   The opener between the BayStars and the Pacific League champion
Lions also had been postponed because of rain.
	   It was the first time since 1967 that the postponements had
occurred during the series.
	   In the 1961 series, there were four postponements before the
Yomiuri Giants beat the Nankai Hawks, now the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks,
four games to two.

Far East regional governor: Kurils cannot be traded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The governor of Russia's Sakhalin region said
Wednesday that the Kuril Islands must not be traded away as part of
an overall peace treaty between Russia and Japan, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The islands, located off Russia's Pacific Coast, were captured
by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, but are still
claimed by Japan. The territorial dispute has prevented the two
countries from concluding a peace treaty following the war, though
their overall relations have improved in the past several years.
	   The islands ``cannot be small change in the negotiations over a
peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo,'' Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov was
quoted as saying.
	   He said that the Russian government had not come through with
funds for the federal program for social and economic development
of the islands this year, but that local authorities had pressed
ahead with construction of roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
	   ``All these facilities did not exist 10 years ago and this shows
that we have returned to the Kurils for good,'' he said.
	   Farkhutdinov said that his region had high hopes for the summit
meeting in Moscow between Japanese Premier Keizo Obuchi and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, which is scheduled for November.
	   ``It is very important for the Sakhalin region _ Japan's closest
neighbor _ that our states have business relations,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted Farkhutdinov as saying.
	   In particular, he said Sakhalin was counting on progress in
joint economic development and the rational use of sea resources.
He suggested his region could work with Japan to prevent poaching,
``which undermines both the Russian and Japanese economies.''

Four-party talks resume with little hope of progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Peace talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to
the Korean peninsular resumed Wednesday after a six-month break,
with little sign of early progress.
	   The meeting groups South and North Korea, the United States and
China.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsular,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both as
the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman of
the session.'' Each side takes it in turns to chair the talks.
	   Park refused to give details of the agenda. Nobody else spoke.
	   The four delegations seemed in a jovial mood as they smiled for
the cameras in the conference room.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North North Korea reiterated its demands that pulling
U.S. troops out of South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the
United States should form the main agenda.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and April, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of American troops from South Korea can be an agenda
item. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   But the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang,
excluding Seoul. Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty
should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   A resumption of the four-party Korean peace talks is part of a
package deal struck between the United States and North Korea in a
series of negotiations in New York last month.
	   The Korean Peninsula was partitioned into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   The talks are scheduled to last the rest of the week.

Main northern nuclear power plant lacks money for full operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The main energy provider in northwestern Russia
will have to operate at half-capacity during the winter because of
a lack of funds, an official said Wednesday.
	   The Sosnovy Bor plant, located near St. Petersburg, is owed
about 400 million rubles (dlrs 24 million) by six energy
distributors in the region, said Valery Lebedev, a manager at the
plant.
	   Only two of the plant's four reactors are likely to be operating
during the winter because the plant cannot afford to buy enough
fuel, Lebedev said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The plant administration cannot scrape together even the 250,000
rubles (dlrs 14,800) needed to pay for a license and insurance for
the third reactor, which has recently been overhauled, the report
said.
	   The plant is a key source of energy for St. Petersburg _
Russia's second-largest city _ and the surrounding region.
	   Also known as the Leningrad plant, it is equipped with RBMK-1000
reactors, a modified version of the reactor that exploded at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in 1986.

Malaysia's budget likely to show deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's latest economic
blueprint is expected to include a large deficit as the government
pumps public funds into the economy to combat the worst recession
in decades.
	   The annual budget, to be unveiled Friday by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in Parliament, will follow his general economic
philosophy of spending more to boost corporate health, spur
recovery and create employment.
	   Since 1993, Malaysia's budgets have always shown a surplus, and
revenues have been substantially higher than expenditure during the
boom years when the economy grew by between 8 and 10 percent
annually.
	   Mahathir took over as Malaysia's finance minister in September
after he fired Anwar Ibrahim from the position. Mahathir had been
unhappy with Anwar's policies, which he said followed inappropriate
International Monetary Fund austerity prescriptions.
	   Unlike in other years, the budget is not likely to be watched
for new measures, since government plans have mostly been outlined
recently by an economic fire-fighting unit headed by Mahathir's
chief economic aide.
	   The economy has shrunk by nearly 5 percent this year as Malaysia
suffered from the Asian currency and stock market crisis. Mahathir
has said he expects 1 percent growth in gross domestic product in
1999.
	   Analysts say the budget is expected to continue the National
Economic Recovery Plan announced in August.
	   ``You can expect formulaic stuff, more fiscal expenditure,''
said Simon Mahadevan Flint, an economist at the Singapore-based
Independent Economic Analysis research company.
	   ``There will be some increase in spending and potential cuts in
corporate and personal income tax rates, but this may be offset by
increases in sin taxes,'' predicted Prasenjit Basu, senior
economist at Singapore's Credit Suisse First Boston.
	   Sin taxes could include levies on gambling, alcohol and tobacco,
he said.
	   But it remains unclear how the cash-strapped treasury will fund
many of the ambitious projects to revive a banking sector
staggering under the weight of bad loans and big corporations owned
by politically influential Malaysians.
	   Earlier this month, Daim Zainuddin, Mahathir's chief economic
aide, said Malaysia needs around 60 billion ringgit (dlrs 15.8
billion) to revive banks and pay for fiscal stimulus measures.
	   Daim said that sum was too much for the government to bear
alone, and other sources of funding were being sought.
	   Some analysts say the government may introduce new taxes or
raise rates to increase revenue.
	   They say the government could raise import and excise duties on
its cash cows _ the gaming, brewing and tobacco sectors.
	   In addition, a windfall export tax of about 5 percent is likely
to be imposed on plantation companies. Indonesia, analysts note,
currently has a 60 percent tax on crude palm oil exports.

Russian leaders focus on short-term ways to halt economic slide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government is focused on short-term
measures to stabilize the economy and see the country through the
winter, and a comprehensive recovery plan is not the top priority,
a senior official was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   The government is facing growing criticism for not producing an
economic blueprint to deal with the worst financial crisis since
the Soviet Union imploded seven years ago. The crisis hit two
months ago, and the government has so far implemented only stop-gap
measures.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, said the government's emphasis was on preventing
potential disasters, such as food shortages, this winter.
	   ``The (long-term) program is still absent because we need time
to make it sound,'' Maslyukov was quoted as saying in the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda. ``Moreover, it's still unclear how we can
stabilize the economy.''
	   The government is broke and the crisis has made it even more
difficult than usual to collect taxes. Also, foreign lenders have
frozen additional loans to Russia until the government produces a
program to address the long list of economic problems.
	   ``We should first take a series of emergency steps that would
allow us to stabilize the situation, live through the winter and
avert hunger,'' Maslyukov added.
	   The country presently has plenty of food, but a bad fall harvest
and sharp drops in imported foods have raised concerns. No serious
food shortages are expected this winter, but the government has
created a dlrs 600 million emergency food reserve that could feed
one-third of the population for two weeks.
	   Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, and has been counting on disbursement of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package negotiated before the latest economic
crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   An IMF delegation is visiting Russia to review economic
conditions, but it's not expected to recommend the release of
additional loan installments.
	   The government plans to spend 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6
billion) in the final quarter of the year, but expects revenues of
only around 70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion), Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov said Tuesday.
	   If the government does not receive foreign help, it may have to
make up the shortfall by printing money, a move that would stoke
inflation.
	   Prices have gone up about 50 percent this year and could rise by
200 or 300 percent by year's end, the government has forecast.
	   Maslyukov said the government wanted to limit the amount of
money printed.
	   ``Printing money that is not properly backed is dangerous for
the economy and may push it into hyperinflation and chaos,'' he
said. ``Even rumors about unbacked money-printing are harmful,
since they incite panic.''

Hungry Cambodian farmers flock to capital in search of food

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Faced with failing crops after
seasonal rains arrived late, about 200 hungry farmers have flocked
to a Buddhist pagoda near the Royal Palace in hopes King Norodom
Sihanouk or the government will provide them with food.
	   Several of the farmers camping at the pagoda said Wednesday they
had used up their rice stocks trying to replace seedlings lost in a
drought that struck much of Cambodia early in the growing season.
	   When monsoon rains finally came in early September, they arrived
with such a fury that his rice seedlings drowned, leaving him with
nothing, said Cheam Suong, a 45-year-old farmer from Kompong
Chhnang.
	   ``The long drought killed our first batch of seedlings and when
the rain started to fall we made a second attempt, but all those
plants were washed under water by flooding,'' he said.
	   Several areas in Cambodia suffer food shortages almost every
year, an official from the U.N.'s World Food Program said
Wednesday, but it is still too early to tell whether a substantial
portion of this year's harvest will fail.
	   WFP representative Henning Scharpff said almost 1 million
Cambodians are receiving assistance this year through the aid
agency's ``food-for-work'' program, which exchanges rice for manual
labor on community development projects.
	   Scharpff said lack of rain had forced farmers to transplant
their seedlings late this year, which could cause yields to be 20
to 30 percent lower than normal.
	   But farmers running out of food now are more likely being
affected by a poor harvest from the last growing season, Scharpff
explained.
	   ``If these farmers are having a problem right now, it couldn't
have anything to do with the weather this year,'' he said.
	   Many farmers migrate to the capital every year after they finish
transplanting their seedlings to look for extra work. They return
to their fields before harvest time late in the year.
	   Cheam Suong said the lack of food in his village has contributed
to the deaths of four people. Most already suffered from illness
and became further weakened by hunger, he said.
	   Other farmers at the pagoda said many of the hungry have
resorted to foraging for bamboo shoots and manioc tubers, which can
be poisonous if they are not properly prepared.
	   A local newspaper reported Tuesday that food shortages were
particularly severe in the northern province of Kompong Thom.
	   Quoting a report from the province's agriculture department,
Rasmei Kampuchea (The Light of Cambodia) reported that 24,000
families in Kompong Thom faced severe food shortages, and that
reports of desperate farmers selling their children at the
provincial capital's market were on the rise.
	   Children sold into the thriving human trafficking rings of
Southeast Asia usually wind up in brothels, where they are forced
to slowly pay off their parents' debt through sex.
	   The Cambodian government appealed to aid agencies in August to
provide 250,000 tons of rice to alleviate food shortages, but
donors said the request appeared greatly inflated, perhaps because
of partisan motives in an election year.

IMF to provide loan to Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will provide dlrs
80 million in loans to Kyrgyzstan to counteract losses the Central
Asian nation has suffered as a result of Russia's economic crisis,
a news report said Wednesday.
	   The decision to provide the economic restructuring loan was
reached at an IMF meeting last week, said Kyrgyz National Bank
chairman Marat Sultanov, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a rural nation of some 4 million people, has a weak
economy based on agriculture and sheep-farming. It is one of the
poorest of the former Soviet republics.
	   When Russia's crisis hit on Aug. 17, the Kyrgyz national bank
had to spend one-tenth of its dlrs 196 in reserves in one day to
prop up the national currency, the som, Sultanov said.
	   But the som still has lost 29.5 percent of its value since the
start of the crisis, and stood at 23.5 to the dollar on Tuesday, he
said.
	   The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development has also said it may provide loans to help Kyrgyzstan's
small and medium businesses, Sultanov said.

France won't recognize euros with pope on them; EU to rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France is refusing to recognize euro coins the
Vatican is stamping with Pope John Paul II on them, on the grounds
of separation between church and state, a French newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The coins, with the face of the pope surrounded by stars
representing the European Union, will be accepted throughout Italy
when the single currency replaces 11 European moneys in 2002, the
leftist daily Liberation said.
	   But France won't accept the coins because of ``the republican
idea Paris has about currency,'' Liberation said.
	   The tiny principality of Monaco, which lies inside France on the
Mediterranean, will stamp its own coins but they won't necessarily
be recognized outside its borders, the newspaper said.
	   The dispute erupted during an EU monetary committee meeting last
week and is to be arbitrated by EU finance ministers on Nov. 23,
Liberation said.
	   The French Finance Ministry had no immediate comment on the
report.

Indonesian group urges parliamentary action on Suharto wealth
</HEADLINE>
probe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An anti-corruption group urged
Indonesian legislators Wednesday to bolster an investigation of the
wealth of former President Suharto.
	   The group, Indonesian Corruption Watch, said lawmakers who will
meet in a special assembly next month should issue a decree
authorizing a thorough investigation of Suharto's assets.
	   Lawmakers will meet to implement guidelines ahead of a May
general election designed to leave behind Suharto's authoritarian
legacy.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May amid riots and protests, and
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised investigations
of the business dealings of associates of the former leader.
	   The attorney general's office is already investigating the
wealth of Suharto, who has denied corruption or stashing cash
overseas. His denials have been greeted with disbelief by many
Indonesians struggling with the nation's worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Critics say a parliamentary decree backing the investigation
would thwart Suharto allies who may be trying to slow probes of
their wealth.
	   ``Suharto used his power to accumulate wealth for his family and
cronies,'' said Teten Masduki, a member of Indonesian Corruption
Watch, a private organization.
	   He said Suharto and his children amassed riches through
government contracts and siphoned off wealth from projects
involving state oil company Pertamina and other corporations. The
U.S. magazine Forbes estimates the former president's wealth at
dlrs 4 billion.
	   One of Suharto's three sons, Bambang Trihatmodjo, is under
investigation in connection with an insolvent bank that he partly
owns.

Milosevic reiterates commitment to Kosovo peace after new NATO

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, President Slobodan Milosevic said Wednesday
he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement despite what he
called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   The Yugoslav leader's comments came after talks in Belgrade in
which Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's American supreme commander, and
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill laid out what Milosevic still has to do
in order to fully comply with the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. He faces a Tuesday deadline to do so or face the
renewed threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   A statement issued Wednesday by the official news agency Tanjug
said Milosevic told the American officials that ``despite armed
provocations by the terrorist groups ... Serbia and Yugoslavia
stand firm in their determination for a peaceful solution of the
Kosovo problem by political means.''
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes.
	   A recent increase in violence has raised fears about the
agreement, under which Milosevic pledged to meet U.N. demands,
including withdrawals, halting the crackdown, allowing
international agencies to help refugees and agreeing with ethnic
Albanians on a timetable for restoring self-rule.
	   But Western officials have been quick to point out progress
toward compliance in recent days, adding to speculation that the
Tuesday deadline _ already extended by 10 days _ will again be
pushed back.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday that
despite small-arms fire in several Kosovo towns, the cease-fire is
generally holding.
	   And Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said conditions
were improving for tens of thousands of refugees who fled into the
hills and forests to escape the fighting.
	   Bacon said about half the 50,000 to 70,000 refugees living
outdoors now have some sort of shelter.
	   International efforts to aid the refugees continues. Many have
returned to their villages but leave them at night for their
temporary settlements, fearing shelling attacks.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the rebels issued a list of their
own demands, chief among them the complete withdrawal of government
forces from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and an investigation by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands of ``crimes against humanity.''
	   Meanwhile, efforts are moving ahead to establish the
international ground verification force in Kosovo to verify the
status of Yugoslavia's pledges.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is putting together the monitoring force, will set it
into motion on Thursday with a formal vote of approval at its
headquarters in Vienna, Austria.
	   The action by OSCE's Permanent Council will instantly create the
first of as many as 2,000 ``verifiers'' _ about 50 people who are
already in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission. Those American, European Union and Russian observers will
subsequently report to the OSCE, spokesman Mons Nyberg said
Wednesday in Vienna.
	   American diplomat William Walker, the mission chief, will head
to Pristina next week to officially launch the mission, Nyberg
said.
	   The verification force will still take weeks to fully establish
and it's not clear whether it will consist of the maximum 2,000
monitors. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the countries
involved have volunteered about 1,500 so far.
	   Four OSCE staffers were headed to Kosovo later Wednesday to meet
with an advance team of technical specialists who will brief the
Vienna council Thursday on their findings.

	   TERPEZA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The shooting usually comes at night,
when it's the most terrifying.
	   Five or six mortars explode in the early evening. A dozen or
more just before midnight. Even when there are no deaths or
injuries, pure fear is enough to drive people from their homes.
	   ``The problem with leaving is we didn't know which way to go,
because we didn't know from which way (Serb police) would come,''
said Kastriot Zogaj, an ethnic Albanian in a mountain refugee camp
southwest of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. ``Some just fled into
the forest.''
	   The conflict in Kosovo is supposed to have halted. President
Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to stop fighting and reduce the
levels of police and military in this southern province of Serbia,
the largest of the two Yugoslav republics, and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army has declared a cease-fire.
	   Nonetheless, the shooting continues. New refugees are being
created even as a trickle is beginning to return home in other
areas. And a humanitarian disaster is still building, with
thousands of ethnic Albanians camped out in the open as winter
approaches.
	   The Serbs say the ethnic Albanian rebels are carrying out
ambushes and attacks to provoke a response that will lead to NATO
intervention. The Albanians say the Serbs are deliberately
provoking them by shelling their villages.
	   Hundreds have died in since President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a military offensive against separatists in February.
	   Myrtez Krasniqi said nearly the entire village of Terpeza, which
the Serbs call Trpeza, fled Monday morning _ 1,200 residents plus
500 refugees who had taken shelter there.
	   Among those who stayed, a woman and her 6-month-old son were
reported wounded in shelling Monday night, the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center reported Tuesday.
	   ``Nobody slept, from fear,'' said Tahir Gashi, who walked all
night over the mountain to a refugee camp on the eastern slope.
	   An angry young man shouted out: ``I have 30 members of my family
here. I am not moving them. If they kill them, they kill them.
There is no place to go anymore. There are police all around.''
	   He declined to identify himself, saying he already had enough
problems.
	   Kadri Krasniqi of the local safety committee was back in Terpeza
with a few other men examining the damage to buildings.
	   ``There was panic,'' he said. ``Ninety percent of the people
fled.''
	   Nobody was wounded, he said, but a number of farm animals were
hit, houses were damaged and a tractor was blown up.
	   From this mountainside village it's possible to see the Serb gun
positions in the valley below, dug-in armored vehicles that pose a
permanent menace to any who dare stay.
	   From here one can also see the road that leads to the village of
Orlate a few miles (kilometers) away. It was there that three Serb
policemen were killed with a grenade last weekend.
	   That and other attacks, generally blamed on the KLA, have led to
a strengthening of Serb forces here, and perhaps to a revenge
shelling of Terpeza. It's no secret the KLA operates freely in and
around this village. For that matter, this whole central mountain
area is a guerrilla stronghold and one of the reasons it's
virtually surrounded by army and police.
	   None of this is any comfort to the villagers, simple farmers for
the most part.
	   While deals in Belgrade fill the headlines of newspapers around
the world, the people of Terpeza know only that they have joined
the estimated 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced
to flee.

Turkish tycoon caught in mob scandal to sell off media holdings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish media baron will sell off his
newspapers and TV stations because of a scandal linking him to a
mob boss, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Korkmaz Yigit only recently acquired dailies Milliyet, Yeni
Yuzyil, Posta and Ates and television channels Kanal E and Kanal 6.
	   Milliyet said Wednesday Yigit is canceling his purchase of the
paper from the Dogan media group. Milliyet and the Anatolia news
agency said he also planned to sell off his other media holdings.
	   A lawmaker earlier this month released a tape of a conversation
between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici about Yigit's bid in the
sale of a state-run bank. The bank sale was canceled as a result.
	   On the tape, Cakici, who was recently arrested in France, is
heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders. Yigit
admitted the conversation, but insisted he was just trying to keep
Cakici out of the bank deal.
	   A growing investigation has revealed that other businessmen,
politicians and banks may have been entangled in shady dealings and
even murder for privatization bids and profitable bank credits.
	   In the past few days police detained dozens of businessmen,
including the manager of a recently privatized state bank, for
questioning in the 1995 killing of loan shark.
	   Last month a government minister resigned after a similar tape
revealed he was in contact with the same mobster.

Apartheid victims get first reparations payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Victims of apartheid's torturers
received the first reparations payments to help atone for the
crimes of the past, government officials said on Wednesday.
	   A compensation plan for those who suffered during white rule was
one of the key aims of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a
panel set up to probe atrocities by all sides in the fight against
apartheid.
	   Now the first ``urgent interim relief'' payments of 2,000 rand
(dlrs 350) each have been sent to victims who need emergency help
ahead of the full reparations plan, which still needs to be
discussed in Parliament.
	   Farouk Hoosen, deputy director of the President's Fund which
administers reparations cash, said he could not reveal details of
those getting the payments. But he said they included people who
had suffered torture at the hands of brutal apartheid security
officials.
	   Since Monday more than 600 payments had been made and hundreds
more are expected to follow in the weeks ahead, Hoosen said. More
than 13,000 application forms for urgent relief have been
distributed.
	   ``This is a very important step. These payments will help people
who have suffered gross violations of human rights in the past,''
he said.
	   The emergency payments are part of a wider plan aimed at
compensating those who suffered during white rule.
	   Not only those who were victims of state brutality qualify.
People wounded in attacks by the black liberation movements can
also ask for help.
	   At the core of the Truth Commission's reparations project is a
program to pay victims from 17,000 rand to 23,000 rand (dlrs 2,928
to 4,035) a year for six years. A higher figure would go to people
living in isolated rural areas and with larger families.
	   The cash is provided by a mix of state funding and private
donations. Truth Commission officials acknowledge that
cash-strapped South Africa can provide only token reparations.
	   About 25,000 people qualify for the final reparations plan from
among those who made statements at any of the commission's public
hearings on apartheid-era abuses.
	   Compensation also can come from tuition reductions, cheaper
health care and psychiatric counseling.
	   People unfairly convicted under apartheid would get help wiping
their criminals records clean, while relatives of people killed
would be aided in buying tombstones or reburying remains.
	   The Truth Commission was set up a year after 1994's all- race
elections ended apartheid. Commission Chairman and Nobel laureate
Desmond Tutu will present President Nelson Mandela with the panel's
final report at the end of the month.
	   At the time the plan was announced last year, Tutu said: ``None
of us labors under any illusions. You cannot put a monetary value
to a person's suffering.''

Jewish settlers try to block West Bank roads in protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Jewish settlers on Wednesday tried to
block several West Bank roads to show their opposition to an
emerging Israeli-Palestinian deal on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Settlers, some draped in white prayer shawls and waving Israeli
flags, took up positions along three West Bank junctions. Some
protesters would walk across the roads to try and force cars to
slow down, but were prodded along by Israeli troops.
	   Some settlers held their morning prayers at the roadside,
carrying holy books and swaying rhythmically back and forth, as is
customary among observant Jews.
	   ``We are here to show this is a Jewish country and should not be
given away to non-Jews,'' said one settler, Shai Ben-Tekoa as he
stood by the side of a road near the town of Hebron.
	   The settlers have led the opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian
autonomy accords and vehemently oppose handing any land to the
Palestinians. When Israel withdraw from two-thirds of the Gaza
Strip and one-third of the West Bank under the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, thousands of settlers joined street protests.
	   Israeli hardliners who helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996
have warned that they will return to the streets if he transfers
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has been meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Wye Plantation, Maryland, for
the past week to try and reach agreement on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against militants.
	   In response to reports from Maryland of an emerging deal,
hardline members of Netanyahu's government renewed warnings
Wednesday that they would bring down the prime minister's coalition
if he made any concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Education Minister Yitzhak Levy told Israel army radio that his
National Religious Party will topple the government if Netanyahu
gives in on an Israeli demand that the Palestinians extradite
suspects in anti-Israeli attacks.
	   The NRP holds nine seats and could rob Netanyahu of his slim
parliamentary majority.
	   In a related development, Palestinian security officials
confirmed Wednesday that 15 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas were arrested by Palestinian police in the Hebron area.
	   The detainees had ties to Salem Rajab Sarsour, a 29-year-old
Hebron man who threw two hand grenades near a bus stop in the
southern Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday. The attack injured 64
Israelis.
	   In Israeli detention, Sarsour told his interrogators that he
also stabbed to death an elderly rabbi in Hebron in August and
threw hand grenades at Israeli troops in the city in September.

Hong Kong share prices edge higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices ended slightly higher Wednesday as
late profit-taking helped erase early gains.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 19.37 points, or 0.2 percent,
closing at 9,662.12. It had gained 0.5 percent Tuesday.
	   Turnover slipped to 7.09 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
909 million) from 7.35 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 942
million) Tuesday.
	   The Hang Seng had hit a high of 9,894.73 points in early
trading, bolstered by overseas gains on Wall Street and in Tokyo.
	   Antony Mak, dealing director at Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.,
said investors began to take profits in late morning and remained
on the sidelines ``when there was no clear factor to move the
market.'' The index continued to drift down in the afternoon.
	   Lennon Chan, executive director at Tai Fook Securities Ltd.,
said many investors who had cashed in are hoping to buy back shares
later at lower prices.
	   ``They don't want to get out of the market (altogether) now''
following a 27 percent gain in the key index in the past 10
sessions, he said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 39.40 points Tuesday,
closing at 8,505.05, while in Japan, the Nikkei 225 average surged
408.28 points to 14,216.33 Wednesday.
	   Among gainers, British banking giant HSBC Holdings rose 2.00
Hong Kong dollars to 177.50, property developer Henderson Land rose
60 cents to 35.40, and conglomerate Swire Pacific gained 60 cents
to 43.90.
	   Among losers, property developer Cheung Kong Holdings lost 1.20
to 49.81, Hong Kong Telecom lost 55 cents to 15.50, and Hong Kong
Electric lost 80 cents to 26.50.

Milosevic reiterates commitment to Kosovo peace after new NATO
</HEADLINE>
warning &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OSCE ground verification mission to formally
begin Thursday, details &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said
Wednesday he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement
despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   The Yugoslav leader's comments came after talks in Belgrade in
which Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's American supreme commander, and
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill laid out what Milosevic still has to do
in order to fully comply with the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. He faces a Tuesday deadline to do so or face the
renewed threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   A statement issued Wednesday by the official Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug said Milosevic told the American officials that
``despite armed provocations by the terrorist groups ... Serbia and
Yugoslavia stand firm in their determination for a peaceful
solution of the Kosovo problem by political means.''
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes.
	   A recent increase in violence has raised fears about the
agreement, under which Milosevic pledged to meet U.N. demands,
including troop withdrawals, halting the crackdown, allowing
international agencies to help refugees and agreeing with ethnic
Albanians on a timetable for restoring self-rule.
	   But Western officials have been quick to point out progress
toward compliance in recent days, adding to speculation that the
Tuesday deadline _ already extended by 10 days _ will again be
pushed back.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday that
despite small-arms fire in several Kosovo towns, the cease-fire is
generally holding.
	   And in Washington, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said conditions were improving for tens of thousands of refugees
who fled into the hills and forests to escape the fighting.
	   Bacon said about half the 50,000 to 70,000 refugees living
outdoors now have some sort of shelter.
	   International efforts to aid the refugees continues. Many have
returned to their villages but leave them at night for their
temporary settlements, fearing shelling attacks.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the rebels issued a list of their
own demands, chief among them the complete withdrawal of government
forces from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and an investigation by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, of ``crimes against humanity.''
.
	   Meanwhile, efforts were moving ahead to establish the
international ground verification force in Kosovo to verify the
status of Yugoslavia's pledges.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is putting together the monitoring force, will set it
into motion on Thursday with a formal vote of approval at its
headquarters in Vienna, Austria.
	   The action by OSCE's Permanent Council will instantly establish
the first of as many as 2,000 ``verifiers'' _ about 50 people who
are already in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission. Those American, European Union and Russian observers will
subsequently report to the OSCE, spokesman Mons Nyberg said
Wednesday in Vienna.
	   American diplomat William Walker, the mission chief, will head
to Pristina next week to officially launch the mission, Nyberg
said.
	   The verification force will still take weeks to fully establish
and it's not clear whether it will consist of the maximum 2,000
monitors. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the countries
involved have volunteered about 1,500 so far.
	   Four OSCE staffers were headed to Kosovo later Wednesday to meet
with an advance team of technical specialists who will brief the
Vienna council Thursday on their findings.

Four-party talks resume with little hope of progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss comment, FIXES spelling peninsula, EDITS
throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Peace talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to
the Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than
six months, with little sign of early progress.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made the proposal for a
humanitarian corridor across the line of North-South demarcation to
ease distribution of humanitarian aid.
	   Jacob Kellenberger, a senior Swiss foreign ministry official,
also proposed there should be a ``continent-wide security
dialogue'' in Asia _ similar to the Organization for Cooperation
and Security in Europe.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both as
the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman of
the session,'' Park said.
	   The meeting groups South and North Korea, the United States and
China. Each side takes it in turns to chair the talks. The current
session is meant to last the rest of the week.
	   Diplomats seemed in a jovial mood as they smiled for the cameras
in the conference room.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North North Korea reiterated its demands that pulling
U.S. troops out of South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the
United States should form the main agenda.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and March, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be one of the agenda
items.
	   But the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang,
excluding Seoul. Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty
should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   After the talks broke down in March, Pyongyang said the United
States was to blame. It only agreed to resume the negotiations as
part of a package deal with Washington last month.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly
2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   ``I would like to take this opportunity to launch the idea of a
humanitarian corridor across the line of demarcation, the aim of
which would be to facilitate the direct distribution of
humanitarian aid to North Korea,'' said Switzerland's Kellenberger
in an opening statement.
	   He said such a scheme would offer logistical support to relief
goods passing from South to North through the border village of
Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

Japan to resume nuclear reactor aid to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan planned to sign an agreement Wednesday to
resume payments for a project to build nuclear reactors in North
Korea, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Japan froze its dlrs 1 billion contribution to the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization after North Korea fired a
rocket over Japan on Aug. 31.
	   Tokyo says the launch was a ballistic missile test, while North
Korea claims it put a satellite into orbit. Nonetheless, the firing
caused alarm in Tokyo by demonstrating the communist country's
ability to strike any part of Japan.
	   Chief government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka announced the decision
to resume funding, saying the KEDO project is the best way to keep
North Korea from developing its own nuclear weapons, a Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman said.
	   Japan would sign a resolution on funding the consortium later
Wednesday, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Members of the organization _ Japan, South Korea, the United
States and the European Union _ had been scheduled to adopt a
resolution on funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion project in August
before the rocket launch prompted Japan to freeze its contribution.
	   The KEDO consortium was formed under a 1994 agreement in which
North Korea promised to halt its own nuclear program, suspected of
developing weapons, in exchange for two Western-built light-water
civilian reactors and fuel-oil shipments.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's latest economic
blueprint is expected to include a large deficit as the government
pumps public funds into the economy to combat the worst recession
in decades.
	   The annual budget, to be unveiled Friday by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in Parliament, will follow his general economic
philosophy of spending more to boost corporate health, spur
recovery and create employment.
	   Since 1993, Malaysia's budgets have always shown a surplus, and
revenues have been substantially higher than expenditure during the
boom years when the economy grew by between 8 and 10 percent
annually.
	   Mahathir took over as Malaysia's finance minister in September
after he fired Anwar Ibrahim from the position. Mahathir had been
unhappy with Anwar's policies, which he said followed inappropriate
International Monetary Fund austerity prescriptions.
	   Unlike in other years, the budget is not likely to be watched
for new measures, since government plans have mostly been outlined
recently by an economic fire-fighting unit headed by Mahathir's
chief economic aide.
	   The economy has shrunk by nearly 5 percent this year as Malaysia
suffered from the Asian currency and stock market crisis. Mahathir
has said he expects 1 percent growth in gross domestic product in
1999.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank chief said
Wednesday he expects inflation and interest rates to fall by year's
end, and that the economy will start growing again next year.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said he
expects gross domestic product to grow 1 percent in 1999.
	   In 1998, most analysts expect Thailand's recession-ravaged
economy to contract by about 7 percent.
	   Inflation will be 8 percent for 1998, lower than International
Monetary Fund estimates of 9.2 percent, Chat Mongkol told a news
conference.
	   He added that it won't exceed 5 percent in 1999, which would
mark a return to levels common before an economic crisis hit the
country in 1997.
	   Unlike some previous central bank governors who routinely made
overly optimistic economic forecasts for political reasons, Chatu
Mongkol is regarded as independent and one of the country's most
skilled technocrats.
	   The IMF is overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the Thai
economy. As part of the package, it has demanded economic reforms
and set targets on spending, inflation and other indicators for the
country's planners.
	   Chatu Mongkol cited the declining purchasing power of Thai
consumers, and the stability of the country's currency, the baht,
as the reasons for improved inflation figures.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Senior central bankers from the United
States and Australia Wednesday urged banks not to shut their doors
to lending during the current volatility in global financial
markets, though they warned banks should be careful about their
level of risk.
	   ``I think at the present time ... unusually, our role as bank
supervisors is to remind especially the most senior officers of
banking institutions that they do have an important social role as
financial intermediaries and ... they should be taking (on) a
reasonable amount of risk,'' New York Federal Reserve Bank
President William McDonough told an international conference.
	   Earlier, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane said
bank supervisors should be ``extremely careful not to inadvertently
encourage banks to become even more risk averse than they currently
are.
	   ``This will require great sensitivity on the part of
supervisors,'' he added.
	   Both men were speaking at the International Conference of
Banking Supervisors in Sydney.
	   McDonough also warned that the recent sharp widening in credit
spreads is an indication that bankers, ``at least in the case of
many of the large banks, are already showing a risk aversion that
could, if it continues, spread to the medium- and smaller-sized
banks and lead to that most dreaded of all consequences _ a credit
crunch.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 45.6
percent in September for the 18th straight month of increase, the
government said Wednesday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.548 trillion yen (dlrs 13.3 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus is measured as goods pass customs but before
adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
also continued to climb, rising 41.4 percent to 731.05 billion yen
(dlrs 6.30 billion). It was the 24th straight month of increase.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan increasingly relies
on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The weak
domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   Analysts said the recent fall of the dollar against the yen,
which tends to make Japanese exports more expensive overseas, will
prevent a further surge in exports in the long run.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A former head of bankrupt Kia Motors
Co. was sentenced to seven years in prison Wednesday for embezzling
52.3 billion won (dlrs 37 million) in company funds.
	   Kim Sun-hong, 66, who headed Kia until last October, was found
guilty of using the money to bribe government officials,
politicians and bankers to get preferential bank loans to keep his
company afloat.
	   Kim also was convicted of illegally arranging for Kia to lend
1.1 trillion won (dlrs 814 million) to several troubled
subsidiaries and guaranteeing 2.8 trillion won (dlrs 2 billion) in
debt incurred by other units.
	   Prosecutors had sought a 12-year sentence for Kim.
	   Two other former Kia executives were given prison terms of up to
3 1/2 years for their part in the scandal. Two more were given
suspended terms.
	   ``The defendants ... deceived stockholders and weakened
financial institutions,'' judge Sohn Ji-yeol of the Seoul Criminal
Court said.
	   Kia collapsed under 11.7 trillion won (dlrs 8.4 billion) in debt
in the summer of last year. Its failure eroded foreign investor
confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.
	   South Korea was forced to accept dlrs 58 billion from the
International Monetary Fund in December to bail out its faltering
economy.
	   Kia, once the nation's second largest automaker, was sold to
industry leader Hyundai Motors Co. in an auction on Monday.

Kabila backs out of plan to meet with military allies after rebel

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila
backed out of talks Wednesday with his southern African military
allies over the civil war in his vast mineral-rich country.
	   Kabila was feeling unwell and sent an aide instead, said
Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba.
	   Congo was expected to ask its allies to deploy troops in the
eastern jungles, where rebels have made rapid advances.
	   Attending the talks were President Sam Nujoma of Namibia,
Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos and Kabila aide Victor Mpoyo,
officials said.
	   No other details were given, but the state controlled Herald
newspaper said the leaders will ``review their military position in
the wake of rebel advances'' in the eastern Congo.
	   Zimbabwe on Tuesday acknowledged that 16 of its soldiers were
captured by Congolese rebels in the eastern town of Kabalo.
	   Their capture followed the fall 11 days ago to rebels of Kindu,
a strategically important town 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest
of Goma, the rebels' eastern headquarters.
	   Mugabe told state television late Tuesday the Zimbabwean troops
taken prisoner were on a reconnaissance mission in the east.
	   ``When you get into a war, you expect death and losses. But we
are fighting with determination that in spite of the setbacks, we
will achieve victory,'' he said.
	   It was the first admission that soldiers from the allied forces
from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe had deployed in the east and was
a signal Mugabe is determined to commit troops there.
	   Rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, have been making steady
gains in eastern Congo since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   The allied intervention force helped fend off a rebel onslaught
on the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them
of being backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``Ugandan and Rwandese troops have not withdrawn as demanded by
the allies but continue to escalate fighting in the eastern part of
the country despite international calls for a cease fire,'' the
Zimbabwe foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday's
summit.
	   It said a peace initiative launched by the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity will resume with a meeting in the
Zambian capital of Lusaka on Saturday of allied defense and foreign
ministers joined by officials from Gabon, Mozambique, Tanzania and
South Africa.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has begun a series of
separate meetings to revive efforts to broker a peaceful end to the
Congo conflict.
	   Mandela met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday and
planned talks with the Rwandan military strongman and vice
president, Gen. Paul Kagame, and with the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition.

Jewish settlers try to block West Bank roads in protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Jewish settlers on Wednesday tried to
block several West Bank roads to show their opposition to an
emerging Israeli-Palestinian deal on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Settlers, some draped in white prayer shawls and waving Israeli
flags, took up positions along three West Bank junctions. Some
protesters would walk across the road to try and force cars to slow
down, but were prodded along by Israeli troops.
	   Some settlers held their morning prayers at the roadside,
carrying holy books and swaying rhythmically back and forth, as is
customary among observant Jews.
	   ``We are here to show this is a Jewish country and should not be
given away to non-Jews,'' said one settler, Shai Ben-Tekoa, as he
stood by the side of a road near the town of Hebron.
	   The settlers have led the opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian
autonomy accords and vehemently oppose handing any land to the
Palestinians. When Israel withdraw from two-thirds of the Gaza
Strip and one-third of the West Bank under the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, thousands of settlers joined street protests.
	   Israeli hardliners who helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996
have warned that they will return to the streets if he transfers
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has been meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye Plantation on Maryland's
Eastern Shore for the past week to try and reach agreement on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in
exchange for a Palestinian campaign against militants.
	   In response to reports from Maryland of an emerging deal,
hard-line members of Netanyahu's government renewed warnings
Wednesday that they would bring down the prime minister's coalition
if he made any concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Education Minister Yitzhak Levy told Israel army radio that his
National Religious Party would topple the government if Netanyahu
gives in on an Israeli demand that the Palestinians extradite
suspects in anti-Israeli attacks.
	   The NRP holds nine seats and could strip Netanyahu of his slim
parliamentary majority.
	   In a related development, Palestinian security officials
confirmed Wednesday that 15 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas were arrested by Palestinian police in the Hebron area.
	   The detainees had ties to Salem Rajab Sarsour, a 29-year-old
Hebron man who threw two hand grenades near a bus stop in the
southern Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday. The attack wounded 64
Israelis.
	   In Israeli detention, Sarsour told his interrogators that he
also stabbed to death an elderly rabbi in Hebron in August and
threw hand grenades at Israeli troops in the city in September.

Rain worries cricket organizers in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Harried organizers braced to meet the
challenge posed by unexpected rains with a nine-nation cricket
tournament scheduled to begin in the Bangladesh capital this
weekend.
	   A downpour over the past two days flooded the three practice
grounds for the participating teams. There are no indoor training
facilities for the players since Bangladesh is hosting an
international cricket event for the first time.
	   World champions Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Australia, England, South
Africa, Zimbabwe, India, Pakistan and New Zealand will be
contesting the Wills International Cup.
	   Alam Choudhury, an organizer, said: ``The main playing ground is
still wet following rains over the last few days and all efforts
were being made to dry it in time for the tournament.''
	   Asif Iqbal, former Pakistan cricket captain, said: ``We are
hoping and praying for the weather to improve and the games to be
held as per schedule.''
	   Meteorologists brought some cheers saying that no further rains
were expected later this week.
	   Bangladesh is still recovering from a devastating monsoon flood
which claimed 1,500 lives and affected more than 35 million people.
It is now experiencing unseasonal rains and high humidity.

Tokyo stocks rally, dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rallied Wednesday for the fourth
consecutive trading day on optimism that Japan's banks can escape
financial crisis and more economic stimulus measures are in store.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 116.36 yen in late afternoon, up 1.22 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but lower than its level of 116.83 yen in
late New York trading overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
408.28 points, or 2.96 percent, closing at 14,216.33.
	   It was the Nikkei's first finish above 14,000 since Sept. 24. In
four days, the average has gained a total of 1,220.96 points,
including Tuesday's climb of 240.85 points, or 1.78 percent.
	   The latest push for stock buying came from a report in the
newspaper Nihon Keizai quoting Industrial Bank of Japan President
Masao Nishimura as saying his bank would apply for public funds
under a government plan.
	   IBJ was the first bank to publicly say it would seek public
money under laws adopted earlier this month allowing the government
to take over foundering banks and to pump up to 60 trillion yen
(dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer money into the cash-strapped
financial system.
	   The aim is to avoid a crisis in the nation's financial system
that could further harm other economies in Asia and elsewhere.
	   Meanwhile, there were growing expectations that Parliament will
hold an extra session in December to pass additional economic
stimulus steps, traders said.
	   Among gainers, IBJ rose 92 yen (dlrs 79 cents), or 18 percent,
to 592 (dlrs 5.10) per share, and Fuji Bank climbed 57 yen (49
cents), or 14 percent, to 455 (dlrs 3.90).
	   But the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Wednesday's
volume leader, fell 3 yen (dlrs 2.6 cents) to 2 yen (1.7 cents) on
turnover of 117 million shares. The LTCB is expected to formally
apply for temporary nationalization as early as Friday, when the
new bank laws take effect.
	   Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities, said IBJ's move would lead to more financial stability
and ``is raising hopes that banks will ease their restrictive
lending policies, alleviating the credit crunch.''
	   Trading was heavy, with about 861 million shares changing hands
on the first section, up from Tuesday's 422 million. Advances
outnumbered declines 966 to 228, with issues 101 unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section added 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, to 1,071.83. It
had climbed 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency trading, the dollar ranged between 115.65 yen and
116.65 yen in Wednesday's trading.
	   The dollar got some support from remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin in New York Tuesday, traders said.
	   Asked by a reporter if the strong dollar policy still stands,
Rubin said the U.S. administration's dollar policy remains
``absolutely unchanged.''
	   The yen, meanwhile, was supported by the IBJ president's
comments on public funds, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.845 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.52 from 108.81 yen.

EU economic forecasts to show impact of international turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after release of forecasts, expected at 1200
GMT
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union releases economic
forecasts Wednesday which should give a clear indication of how
hard the crisis sweeping through emerging markets is hitting the
15-nation bloc.
	   The EU issues its forecasts every six months, giving estimates
for growth, unemployment, inflation and other key economic
indicators.
	   The last figures, released in March, were upbeat, showing the EU
economy expanding 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 1999.
	   Since then, EU officials have repeatedly stated the bloc's
economy will be sheltered from the worst of the world turbulence
thanks in part to tough budgetary policies imposed in recent years
to prepare for the launch of the euro, the EU's common currency, on
Jan. 1.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy has hinted the
new data will not show any sharp downturn of the bloc's economic
fortunes.
	   However, fears persist that the economic crisis spreading
through Asia, Russia and Latin America will stifle European growth.
	   Any hints of a slowdown will increase calls for European nations
to do more to boost their economies by increasing investment or
cutting interest rates.
	   EU leaders are expected to discuss their response to the global
turmoil at a summit this weekend in the Austrian lakeside resort of
Poertschach.
	   Governments will also be looking hard at the new forecast for
unemployment which has remained stubbonly high at over 10 percent
throughout the 1990s. The March figures predicted the jobless rate
would dip to 9.8 percent in 1999.

EU presidency says leaders must renew efforts to reform union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ When they meet this weekend, the EU
leaders must signal their single currency is not the end of the
line but vow to pursue reforms enabling newcomers to join the
European Union, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said Wednesday.
	   Klima, whose country holds the EU presidency, said the leaders
must show to have a firm hand on the rudder at a time of financial
crises around the globe, when they get ready to launch the euro on
Jan. 1 and EU governments are shifting leftward.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's incoming social democratic
chancellor, will join the talks Saturday, but not Sunday, at a
lakeside hotel in Poertschach, an alpine resort.
	   In a State of a the Union address to the European Parliament,
Klima sidestepped the emergence of a more liberal government in
Bonn.
	   Schroeder has answered calls at home for greater political
control over monetary policy by picking Lafontaine, an old-style
leftist, as finance minister. Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl
championed an ECB free from political meddling.
	   Ursula Stenzel, a German Christian Democratic member of the EU
assembly, urged Klima to invite Lafontaine to Poertschach ``so he
can tell who will run the European Central Bank (and) give signal
of a sustained, sound monetary policy'' in Germany.
	   Another new face in Poertschach will be Massimo D'Alema, an
ex-communist, who has formed a coalition government in Italy that
runs the gamut from Marxist hardliners to center-right Christian
Democrats.
	   In his address, Klima sidestepped the shifting politics in EU
capitals where most governments now have a social democratic tint.
He made one exception by thanking Kohl ``for everything he has done
for Europe'' in his 16 years as German leader.
	   With the imminent launch of the euro, Klima said the EU leaders
wil meet this weekend at a time when the EU ``can be seen as a pole
of stability in the international monetary system.''
	   Yet he and European Commission President Jacques Santer said the
leaders must recommit to completing politically sensitive reforms
of EU institutions and finances needed if Cyprus and a dozen East
European nations are to join the union in the decade ahead.
	   ``We must ensure that this process (of enlargement) remains
open,'' said Klima.
	   ``Enlargement of the European Union is to our mutual benefit. A
signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market and a
single currency is not the end of the (EU's) journey.''
	   The EU governments are at odds over how to devise more equitable
budget payments with Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden
insisting on a new funding formula.
	   These countries pay far more into the EU budget than they get
back in benefits but countries such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal
and Spain which are net beneficiaries are wary of tinkering with
the budget for fear of losing income.
	   Also left unresolved so far have been negotiatins on a new power
sharing arrangement within the EU by ``re-weighting'' votes for big
and small countries.

Police arrest 68 after killing spree in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they have
arrested 68 people in connection with a killing spree in which the
severed heads of some victims were carried on poles through village
streets.
	   Vigilante groups formed in the eastern end of the main island of
Java after more than 150 people, many of them Muslim clerics and
others accused of witchcraft, were mysteriously murdered.
	   Maj. Djoko Hartanto, deputy police chief in the town of Malang,
said 54 people were arrested for allegedly killing nine suspected
murderers in an outburst of mob violence.
	   Local residents have turned over to police another 14 people,
including one woman, who are also suspected of being murderers.
Hartanto said many of the detainees had mental disorders and that
police and psychiatrists were examining them.
	   On Sunday and Monday, vigilantes beheaded murder suspects and
paraded their heads on sticks. The killings in revenge attacks
began Friday in Malang and surrounding areas, about 650 kilometers
(400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Many of the victims in the mysterious killings that began in
August in the regency of Banyuwangi were alleged black-magic
practitioners and preachers or members of the 30 million-member
Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization.
	   Its leaders have called for calm and have condemned revenge
killings by vigilantes.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.

Russian soldier released from captivity in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian army soldier was released from captivity
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   Private Alexander Mikhailov, taken hostage along with another
soldier on Oct. 5, was handed over to police in neighboring
Dagestan on Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Mikhailov and the other soldier had been kept in Gudermes, a
town in eastern Chechnya.
	   The report provided no other details about the other soldier,
and did not say whether a ransom had been paid for Mikhailov's
release.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, has seen a sharp rise in violent crime and
hostage-taking, usually for ransom.
	   A number of hostages have been freed recently, including 24
Russian soldiers and an English couple. Most of the releases have
been facilitated through the help of Russian financier Boris

	   More than 100 people are still being held, including three
Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to the Interfax news

Prime Minister to drop objection to European Union defense arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday that the
European Union needed ``fresh thinking'' about developing a defense
capability, The Times reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper also said that at a special European Union summit
this weekend in Austria, Blair will propose that EU military forces
act together in peacekeeping and combat operations.
	   ``All I am saying is that we need to allow fresh thinking in
this, and it is important for Britain to be part of that thinking
and not simply to stand there and say we are not part of this,''
the newspaper quoted Blair as saying.
	   The prime minister reiterated that European forces should work
under NATO's auspices.
	   ``We are not talking about European armies or the European
Commission having a security role,'' The Times quoted him as
saying. ``We are not in any way talking about undermining NATO.
That remains the absolute necessity, and pillar of our defense
policy.''
	   The prime minister was speaking in an interview with The Times
and continental European newspapers.
	   Blair's spokesman, Alaistair Campbell, said that the prime
minister wanted European countries to have the capability to mount
peacekeeping or combat roles such as those in Bosnia or Kosovo,
without having to reach agreement with NATO's other members.
	   ``We could put together an operation with, say, France, Belgium,
Italy and Spain, in a way that meant we did not have to rely the
whole time on the Americans,'' said Campbell. ``It would be
consistent with us being members of NATO, but would not necessarily
rely on everything being decided by the Americans.''
	   The Western European Union, Europe's embryonic defense arm, was
created in 1948 by Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg, with Germany joining in 1954.
	   Despite a revival over the past decade, the organization still
stands deep in the shadows of NATO.

Four-party talks resume with little hope of progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean Peninsula resumed Wednesday after a six-month break, with
little sign of early progress.
	   The peace talks group South and North Korea, the United States
and China.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean Peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both as
the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman of
the session.'' Each side takes turns chairing the talks.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, proposed establishing a
humanitarian corridor across the border between the two Koreas to
ease distribution of aid to North Korea.
	   Jacob Kellenberger, a senior Swiss foreign ministry official,
said such a corridor would offer logistical support to enable more
relief goods to pass from the South to the North through the border
village of Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.
	   In an opening statement, Kellenberger also proposed that there
should be a ``continent-wide security dialogue'' in Asia _ similar
to the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe.
	   The four delegations seemed in a jovial mood as they smiled for
the cameras in the conference room.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week, North Korea reiterated its demands that pulling U.S.
troops out of South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the
United States should form the main agenda.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and April, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of American troops from South Korea can be an agenda
item. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   But the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang,
excluding Seoul. Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty
should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   A resumption of the four-party Korean peace talks is part of a
package deal struck between the United States and North Korea in a
series of negotiations in New York last month.
	   The Korean Peninsula was partitioned into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   The talks are scheduled to last the rest of the week.

Belarusian President Lukashenko visits Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko began a
three-day tour of Russia's Siberian regions Wednesday for talks on
trade in coal and wheat, and a game of hockey, news reports said.
	   Lukashenko is to sign an agreement on trade, economic,
scientific and cultural cooperation with the Omsk region, about
2250 kilometers (1,400 miles) east of Moscow, where he arrived
Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He will meet with Omsk governor Leonid Polezhayev, chiefs of
local defense plants, business leaders, and members of the
Belarusian community.
	   Lukashenko also plans to join a team of Belarusian ``ice-hockey
veterans'' during a friendly match Wednesday with an Omsk team,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   On Thursday, Lukashenko will travel further east, to the
coal-mining Kemerovo region, about 3000 kilometers (1,850 miles)
east of Moscow. He is scheduled to meet with Gov. Aman Tuleyev and
local business leaders.
	   Lukashenko, an autocratic leader nostalgic for the Soviet Union,
has said he wants to expand direct ties with individual regions in
Russia to accelerate economic integration between the two
countries. Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the
former Soviet Union.
	   The two Slavic neighbors signed a union treaty in April 1997,
but stopped short of creating a single state.

Italian premier-designate D'Alema announces Cabinet choices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with D'Alema announcing Cabinet choices; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema on Wednesday
announced a center-left government which includes eight holdovers
from his predecessor and doubles the number of women in the Cabinet
to six.
	   The Cabinet was to be sworn in later in the day.
	   The highly respected Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will stay on as
treasury and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco continues as
finance minister. The two are key figures in pushing through a1999
budget maintaining Italy's economic commitments to the European
Monetary Union.
	   Another respected figure, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, will
also stay on.
	   D'Alema's Cabinet will have 25 ministers, six more than outgoing
Premier Romano Prodi's.
	   Parliament is expected to take a vote of confidence Friday so
that D'Alema will be premier in time to attend the European Union
summit in Austria on Saturday.
	   D'Alema, an ex-Communist turned social democrat, is putting
together a government that includes members of Prodi's coalition
buttressed by new backing from the center and the left.
	   In return for the support of ex-President Francesco Cossiga,
D'Alema gave Cossiga's centrist party the defense, and post and
telecommunications ministries and a new portfolio: relations with
parliament.
	   The Italian Communists got the justice ministry, the Greens kept
environment, and D'Alema's own party, the Democratic Left, got
seven posts. Among them is labor, which went to Naples high-profile
mayor, Antonio Bassolino.
	   D'Alema also appointed a special minister, ex-Premier Guiliano
Amato, to push through reforms in Italy's electoral system, which
is blamed for the country's ``revolving door'' governments.
	   Prodi's center-left government, Italy's 55th since the war, fell
on Oct. 9 when hard-line Communists withdrew their support in a
dispute over the budget. The president then turned to D'Alema,
leader of the largest party in Prodi's coalition, to form a new
government.

Two soldiers arrested in grisly bell tower killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Two soldiers have been arrested on
suspicion of slaying two men and dumping their disfigured corpses
in a tunnel beneath a church bell tower, a police officer said
Wednesday.
	   Brothers Florin and Vasile Doreata were arrested Tuesday, said
Stefan Marcu, a spokesman for Bucharest police.
	   The mutilated corpses of Cristel Ghita 18, and Willy Butte, 25,
were found Monday in Bucharest in an underground tunnel which
linked an Orthodox seminary to a bell tower where the victims
lived.
	   The men, who repaired television sets and washed car windows,
had been repeatedly stabbed and dragged from their room to the
underground tunnel.
	   Robbery was said to be the motive for the killing, newspapers
reported. Violence is sharply on the rise in formerly communist
Romania.

Social Democrats deny power struggle in Germany's new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Social Democrats sought Wednesday to
quash reports of clashes between their chancellor-elect and the
powerful party chairman amid persistent speculation over who is
really calling the shots in the incoming government.
	   ``It's a false impression if one thinks there are heavy power
struggles between (future chancellor) Gerhard Schroeder and Oskar
Lafontaine,'' the party's new parliamentary leader, Peter Struck,
told Berlin's InfoRadio.
	   ``We wouldn't have achieved this great election victory if the
two hadn't worked very closely together.''
	   Schroeder relied on Lafontaine's tight control over the party to
help him unseat Helmut Kohl last month. Last week Schroeder named
Lafontaine to head one of the most important Cabinet posts, the
Finance Ministry.
	   But Lafontaine has been seen as exercising broader influence
over the new government's shape. He forced a political rival out as
parliamentary faction leader and squeezed Schroeder's choice for
the economics ministry _ an outside free-marketeer unpopular with
the party's old-style leftist wing _ into turning down the job.
	   Lafontaine also won new powers over European affairs for his
ministry, poaching them from Economics.
	   Germany's mass-market Bild newspaper led its Wednesday editions
with the question: ``Lafontaine: How dangerous will he be for
Schroeder?''
	   ``Oskar has to know that he mustn't step over the line,''
longtime Social Democratic lawmaker Hermann Rappe said.
	   Schroeder has repeatedly denied reports of infighting with
Lafontaine, saying the two were working well together.
	   In an interview Tuesday night on German television, Schroeder
stressed that he was in charge.
	   ``I have the responsibility for setting the government's
direction and intend to do so,'' he said. ``Oskar Lafontaine knows
that.''

Strong peso pushes Philippine stocks higher; index up 1.8 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rebounded Wednesday
as investors, encouraged by a stronger peso, hunted for bargains
following the market's fall the previous day, traders said.
	   The peso was buoyed by substantial dollar inflows from stock
investors and by positive sentiment over gains by the Indonesian
rupiah, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 26.93 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 1,494.62 after falling 21.66 points Tuesday.
	   Russell Ong, research manager for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities
Inc., said concrete efforts to address financial woes in Japan have
bolstered regional currencies, thereby boosting Asian stock
markets.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone topped the list of actively
traded stocks, though it failed to ride Wednesday's market rally.
Its shares closed 20 pesos, or 2.1 percent, lower at 920 pesos.
	   Mounting opposition to PLDT's planned call metering program may
be hurting the company's prospects, traders said. Currently,
subscribers pay a flat rate for local telephone service.
	   Ong said Manila shares are expected to sustain investor interest
over the next few sessions, with the main index seen testing the
1,600-point resistance level.
	   ``The improving sentiment within the region has helped the
market a lot,'' he said.
	   Foreign investors, however, have yet to take an active role in
the market, with local players dominating much of the market action
Wednesday, he said.
	   Gainers trounced decliners 81 to 29, while 19 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 42.754 pesos for the
day, down from Tuesday's average of 42.923 pesos. It was last
traded at 42.605 pesos, near its intrasession low of 42.600 pesos.
	   A trader at a foreign bank said there were ample dollar inflows,
presumably from investors buying shares on the Philippine Stock
Exchange.
	   An expected influx of remittances from Filipinos working
overseas is also expected to keep the peso appreciating in coming
months. The bulk of these remittances usually enter the country in
the last quarter of the year.
	   Last year, official remittances from Filipinos working overseas
totaled dlrs 5.74 billion.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market. It
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.75 percent and
15.75 percent, respectively.

Investigative judge cites grim cases in arrest order against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In Judge Baltasar Garzon's arrest order
against Augusto Pinochet, the words are terse but chilling.
	   Men vanish from city streets in front of their wives and
children. People are dragged from their homes in the dead of night.
A pregnant woman is hauled off to a police station and never heard
from again.
	   With these abuses, the Spanish judge makes a case for
extraditing the former Chilean dictator from Britain, where he was
arrested Friday, and trying him in Spain on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism.
	   In an initial arrest warrant, Garzon cited only one specific
case. But in an addendum released Tuesday and sent to Britain, he
outlined how 94 people died or disappeared at the hands of Chile's
military junta leaders and Argentine cohorts from 1976-1983.
	   They fell victim to Operation Condor, a campaign by South
American juntas to help each other crush dissent. Victims came from
a variety of countries, including Argentina, the United States,
Britain and others, Garzon's order states.
	   All but a few of the 94 victims cited in the new document were
Chilean living in Argentina, like Jose Luis Appel de la Cruz. He
was kidnapped by armed civilians on Jan. 10, 1977, as he walked
down a street in the Argentine town of Cipolletti with his wife,
Carmen Delard, and their daughter.
	   ``Carmen Delard disappeared at the police station in that town
when she went to report her husband's disappearance,'' Garzon's
order says.
	   A week later in Buenos Aires, Delard's sister Gloria Delard was
arrested at her home along with her husband Roberto Cristi and
their two children.
	   ``Gloria Delard was pregnant with her third child. Federal
Police agents took them to the Navy School of Mechanics, where they
disappeared,'' the order says. That school was one of the most
notorious torture centers run by Argentina's military juntas.
	   The evidence in Garzon's order was based on the report produced
by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed by
former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. Known as the Rettig
Report, it was published in 1991 and identified nearly 3,000
victims of state-sanctioned killings, torture, disappearances and
other abuses committed under the Pinochet regime.
	   Pinochet, who relinquished power in 1990 to a civilian regime
after 17 years of authoritarian rule, cannot be prosecuted at home
because he has immunity as a senator for life.
	   Private human rights lawyers who helped Garzon prepare the
arrest order chose the cases of Chileans who died in Argentina
because they believe it makes it easier to charge Pinochet with
genocide.
	   Garzon says Spanish law allows him to prosecute genocide no
matter where it occurred, even outside Spain.
	   The lawyers say Pinochet and the Argentine generals made a
systematic, organized attempt to wipe out political opponents
because of their ideological beliefs and that this amounts to
genocide.
	   The key is that there was collaboration between the countries'
security forces. ``Criminal organization is the basis of
genocide,'' said Gregorio Dionis, who is connected to a human
rights group called Nizkor and works with the lawyers.
	   ``It is important to be able to show that were there was
criminal organization,'' he said. ``Killing lots of people without
criminal organization is not genocide.''

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A miner was killed in a rock collapse in
eastern Ukraine, bringing the total number of coal industry workers
killed on the job to at least 303 so far this year, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The fatal accident occurred Tuesday at a mine in the city of
Zhdanivka in the Donetsk region, the ministry reported.
	   Ukraine's troubled coal industry lacks the funds needed to
modernize mine equipment and improve safety conditions, and
work-related fatalities have been increasing steadily in recent
years.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than six
months, with little sign of early progress.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made the proposal for a
``humanitarian corridor'' across the line of North-South
demarcation to ease distribution of humanitarian aid.
	   Jacob Kellenberger, a senior Swiss foreign ministry official,
also proposed there should be a ``continent-wide security
dialogue'' in Asia _ similar to the Organization for Cooperation
and Security in Europe.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both as
the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman of
the session,'' Park said.
	   Emerging at the end of the morning session, Park said it had
proceeded smoothly. He did not elaborate.
	   The meeting groups South and North Korea, the United States and
China. Each side takes it in turns to chair the talks. The current
session is meant to last the rest of the week.
	   Park and the other three delegation leaders _ North Korea's Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, U.S. ambassador at large Charles
Kartman and Chinese ambassador Qian Yong Nian _ seemed in a jovial
mood as they smiled for the cameras.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North North Korea reiterated its demands that pulling
U.S. troops out of South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the
United States should form the main agenda.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and March, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However,
Seoul doesn't want it to be a formal agenda item.
	   And the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang,
excluding Seoul. Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty
should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   After the talks broke down in March, Pyongyang said the United
States was to blame. It only agreed to resume the negotiations as
part of a package deal with Washington last month.
	   South Korean diplomats said their delegation would propose the
talks take place every three months.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly
2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   ``I would like to take this opportunity to launch the idea of a
humanitarian corridor across the line of demarcation, the aim of
which would be to facilitate the direct distribution of
humanitarian aid to North Korea,'' said Switzerland's Kellenberger
in an opening statement.
	   He said such a scheme would offer logistical support to relief
goods passing from South to North through the border village of
Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

Thai opposition trying to capitalize on farmer's suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's main opposition party
charged Wednesday that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's uncaring
attitude toward the poor led to the suicide outside Government
House of an elderly farmer.
	   ``I don't know why the government turned a blind eye to this
farmer's plight. He had enough evidence to make a case'' that he
had been cheated out of his land, said Chingchai Mongkolthom,
secretary-general of the opposition New Aspiration Party.
	   Other NAP members were quoted in Wednesday's papers as saying
that if the farmer had approached opposition leader and former
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, his problems would have been
solved.
	   The suicide of Chum Sakhorn, a 62-year-old farmer from the
northeastern province of Sa Kaew, has mushroomed into a public
relations debacle for the prime minister, and the opposition is
attempting to take full advantage.
	   Chum had traveled to Bangkok several times seeking government
help to recover land, saying he had been cheated out of it by
unscrupulous businessmen and corrupt bureaucrats.
	   On Monday, he hanged himself from a tree outside Government
House, the executive office building.
	   The last words in his suicide letter were addressed to Chuan,
telling the prime minister he was dying a desperate man, the
newspaper The Nation reported Wednesday.
	   The paper quoted Chum's widow, Ob, as saying he went to Bangkok
because he saw Chuan promise in a televised speech earlier this
year that he would help farmers cheated out of their land.
	   The opposition has frequently sought to portray Chuan as a prime
minister who cares more about pleasing the International Monetary
Fund and bailing out the country's bankrupt elites than helping the
poor.
	   Chuan's government, however, has secured World Bank loans to aid
farmers and passed several laws on social security and unemployment
designed to strengthen the social safety net, which is fairly weak
in Thailand.
	   But his reserved manner and aloof personal style have helped the
opposition portray him as uncaring.
	   His predecessor, Chavalit, earned the support of many
northeasterners because he frequently met personally with farmers
groups that came to Bangkok protesting over land issues during his
administration.
	   Chavalit's government, however, was regarded as extremely
corrupt by most Thais and conditions for farmers worsened during
his term of office.
	   On Tuesday, Chuan met with Ob at his office. A lawyer by
training, Chuan examined contracts Chum and Ob had signed to sell
their land and told her they appeared to be legal.
	   Government House staff raised more than 15,000 baht (dlrs 400)
to pay for Chum's funeral, which was held Wednesday.
	   Chingchai said NAP members had raised 10,000 baht (dlrs 266) for
the farmer's widow, and sent a black wreath that was laid on the
farmer's coffin.

British companies seek stake in Philippine state power company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ British companies are interested in
bidding for a share of the Philippine state-owned power generating
company when it is privatized, British Trade Minister Brian Wilson
said Wednesday.
	   Wilson, who arrived Sunday to promote British investment in the
Philippine power industry, said the Philippines is still ``a place
with a big future'' despite Asia's currency crisis.
	   The Philippine government is selling many of its assets,
including energy holdings, to help fill a yawning budget deficit
and further liberalize the economy.
	   Wilson said he was told the government plans to privatize 40
percent of the National Power Corp. Philippine officials expect a
law privatizing the power company will be passed by mid-1999, he
said.
	   Wilson said British power companies will ``take on as much as
they could'' of the state-owned power company.
	   The British power companies, once public companies themselves,
could also share their experiences in privatization, he said.
	   Wilson is traveling with nine officials from British power
companies National Power, Powergen, National Grid, ALSTOM, AMEC,
Balfour Beatty, British Gas, Rolls Royce and Cinergy.
	   James A. Carmichael, general manager for Asia-Pacific of
Powergen, expressed ``very high optimism'' that Asia will recover
from its financial turmoil and will be a ``major growth area within
the next decade.''
	   ``You cannot be a serious international player without being in
the region,'' he said.
	   Because of a power generating overcapacity in the Philippines
and Indonesia, he said his company is interested in acquiring power
generation and distribution companies rather than building new
plants.
	   It hopes to acquire the Philippine government's 31 percent stake
in electricity distributor Manila Electric Co.
	   ``We will not be a passive investor. We have to be active,'' he
said, adding that his company wants a ``significant'' investment of
between 25 and 50 percent in any company.

Ukraine's agricultural producers slow in repaying debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian agricultural companies owe the
government 3.5 million metric tons (3.85 million short tons) of
grain in return for machinery and seeds received on credit in
1997-98, the agriculture minister said Wednesday.
	   The companies are reluctant to pay the debt, worth 812.4 million
hryvna (dlrs 237 million), Agriculture Minister Borys Supykhanov
told a Cabinet meeting.
	   He also said agricultural producers were slow in repaying the
government for foreign-made combine harvesters and other machinery
bought with the help of government-guaranteed foreign loans.
	   In 1998, producers had to provide about 1 million metric tons
(1.1 million short tons) as payment for these loans, Supykhanov
noted.
	   The Cabinet decided Wednesday to reprimand the head of the
state-run Khlib Ukrainy bread company and four regional
administration chiefs for their failure to control and account in
time for cash and other credits to the country's agricultural
sector, the Interfax news agency reported.

Palestinian police intercept letter from Hamas leader in Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - Palestinian security officials said
Wednesday they have intercepted a letter from a Hamas leader in
Jordan that contained information leading to the arrest of more
than a dozen members of the group's military wing.
	   The letter was written by Khalid Mashaal, a Hamas political
leader in Jordan who was the target last year of a botched
assassination attempt by Israel's Mossad spy agency.
	   In his letter to Mohammed Natche, a Hamas activist in Hebron,
Mashaal outlined the activities of the group's military wing,
Izzedine al Qassam, and referred to Qassam members by their
initials, said a Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   As a result, 16 members of the Hamas military wing were arrested
in the past two weeks. Arrests continued Tuesday when 15 Hamas
members were rounded up because they apparently had ties to Salem
Rajab Sarsour, a Hebron man who threw two hand grenades in the
Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday, injuring 64 people.
	   The Mashaal letter was found in Natche's possessions. Natche was
arrested by Palestinian police last month after a bomb factory was
discovered in his home.
	   Palestinian security officials also said they have begun
following the Hamas money trail. Bank account numbers have been
collected and the financial transactions are being watched, said a
Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians crack down on
Hamas by arresting and disarming militants and stopping the flow of
money from Hamas leaders abroad to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ How bad are things in Russia? So bad that
criminals are even stealing the mud.
	   Thieves used a tractor and shovels to make off with eight tons
of therapeutic, lakeside mud that belonged to a health spa near the
southern city of Volgograd, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Spa director Svetlana Gnutova said the soothing mud, which was
hauled away in a truck, was worth about 19,000 rubles (1,100
dollars) and had left the spa without enough to service its 200
clients. A criminal investigation was underway, she added.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Workers on strike at a broadcasting center in
eastern Siberia have cut off television and radio transmissions to
their region, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The workers at the Radio and Television Broadcasting Center in
Chita, about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, stopped
broadcasts because they haven't received their wages since
February, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   More than a million people have been affected by the action,
which is blocking the transmission of three national television
channels, one local TV channel, and radio broadcasts.
	   Regional leaders have tried to persuade the protesters to end
their strike or take different action, but no compromise has been
reached yet.
	   The government's chronic inability to pay salaries on time has
led to frequent, mostly small-scale strikes across the country.
Protesters have blocked railways and roads, held their bosses
hostage, and threatened to kill themselves to dramatize their
demands for back wages.

War crimes investigation mission to begin next month

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A delegation of U.N. war crimes
investigators and prosecutors plans to visit Kosovo early next
month, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said
Wednesday.
	   The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and
her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports
of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Gavin Ruxton, a senior legal adviser in Arbour's office, would
give no details of the alleged war crimes the team would be
investigating.
	   He confirmed that Arbour would leave for Yugoslavia on Nov. 5,
although he added that Yugoslav officials have not yet granted the
team visas to visit the region.
	   Belgrade authorities recently began refusing to issue visas to
tribunal investigators planning to visit the province, where Serb
forces have been engaged in a seven-month crackdown of secessionist
ethnic Albanian rebels.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's designated finance minister,
Oskar Lafontaine, will meet on Thursday with his French
counterpart, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Lafontaine aide said
Wednesday.
	   No agenda was detailed for the meeting, to be held in the
western German city of Saarbruecken, Lafontaine's political base.
	   But the men were expected to discuss forging a European position
on ways to ward off global financial crises.
	   Strauss-Kahn and Lafontaine have floated similar ideas for a
system to ensure stable exchange rates between the world's major
currencies.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila
failed to attend talks Wednesday with his southern African military
allies over the civil war in his vast mineral-rich country.
	   Kabila was feeling unwell and sent an aide instead, said
Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba.
	   Congo was expected to ask its allies to deploy more troops in
the eastern jungles, where rebels have made rapid advances.
	   Attending the talks hosted by President Robert Mugabe were
President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Angola's President Eduardo dos
Santos and Kabila aide Victor Mpoyo, officials said.
	   No other details were given, but the state controlled Herald
newspaper said the leaders will ``review their military position in
the wake of rebel advances'' in the eastern Congo.
	   Zimbabwe on Tuesday acknowledged that 16 of its soldiers were
captured by Congolese rebels in the eastern town of Kabalo.
	   Their capture followed the fall 11 days ago to rebels of Kindu,
a strategically important town 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest
of Goma, the rebels' eastern headquarters.
	   Mugabe told state television late Tuesday the Zimbabwean troops
taken prisoner were on a reconnaissance mission in the east.
	   ``When you get into a war, you expect death and losses. But we
are fighting with determination that in spite of the setbacks, we
will achieve victory,'' he said.
	   It was the first admission that soldiers from the allied forces
from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe had deployed in the east and was
a signal Mugabe is determined to commit troops there.
	   Rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, have been making steady
gains in eastern Congo since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   The allied intervention force helped fend off a rebel onslaught
on the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them
of being backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``Ugandan and Rwandese troops have not withdrawn as demanded by
the allies but continue to escalate fighting in the eastern part of
the country despite international calls for a cease fire,'' the
Zimbabwe foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday's
summit.
	   It said a peace initiative launched by the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity will resume with a meeting in the
Zambian capital of Lusaka on Saturday of defense and foreign
ministers of Congo-backing countries joined by officials from
Gabon, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has begun a series of
separate meetings to revive efforts to broker a peaceful end to the
Congo conflict.
	   Mandela met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday and
planned talks with the Rwandan military strongman and vice
president, Gen. Paul Kagame, on Thursday and with the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition in the coming days.

Norsk Hydro profits plunge on low oil and fertilizer prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norsk Hydro ASA on Wednesday announced a 24
percent decline in its net profits for the first nine months of
this year, due mainly to lower prices for crude oil and
fertilizers.
	   The 51-percent state-owned concern reported net profits of 3.291
billion kroner (dlrs 435.9 million) for January through September,
compared with 4.34 billion kroner for the same period of 1997.
	   Norsk Hydro is one of Norway's largest companies, with divisions
for petroleum, petrochemicals, light metals and agricultural
fertilizers.
	   ``Turbulence in the global economy led to difficult market
conditions for several of Hydro's main products,'' president and
chief executive Egil Myklebust said. ``The oil and gas results were
hit by low prices, and in agriculture pressure on prices and lower
deliveries produced a much weaker result.''
	   Despite a slight increase in its nine-month operating revenues
to 72.093 billion kroner (dlrs 9.56 billion) from 71.323 billion
kroner for the same period of last year, operating income for the
same periods plunged 41 percent to 5.070 billion kroner (dlrs 670.9
million).
	   Myklebust said that since there is little the company can do
about market prices, it must concentrate on cutting costs and
increasing competitiveness.
	   Norsk Hydro has 38,000 employees worldwide, and is active in
more than 100 countries.

Former East Berlin commander fails to show for Wall deaths trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German border patrol commander
charged with the deaths of four people trying to escape across the
Berlin Wall failed to appear in court Wednesday and was believed to
have left the country.
	   The court-appointed lawyer for Walter Schulze, 51, said she had
not been able to speak with him. He ran a restaurant in
Fuerstenwalde, outside Berlin, until last year, when he
disappeared.
	   Police say he notified the post office to forward his mail to an
address in Spain, but there were also rumors that he was living in
Russia. The court reserved decision on whether to issue an arrest
warrant.
	   Schulze and a co-defendant, Reinhard Gentzsch, are charged with
four counts of manslaughter stemming from four deaths, including
the February 1989 shooting of Chris Gueffroy, the last person
killed trying to flee over the Berlin Wall.
	   Prosecutors say they were involved in drawing up and issuing
basic orders for guards at the Berlin Wall between 1985 and 1989,
when it fell.
	   The trial against Gentzsch, 45, began as scheduled.

Philippine president won't apologize to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada will not
apologize to Malaysia for his criticisms of the treatment of that
nation's ousted deputy prime minister, an official said Wednesday.
	   Malaysian protesters demonstrated in front of the Philippine
Embassy in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday, demanding that Estrada apologize
for allegedly meddling in their country's domestic affairs.
	   Asked if the Philippine leader was considering an apology,
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said, ``The president had
already said his piece. There is nothing more that needs to be
explained.''
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have both spoken
out against the arrest and treatment in jail of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Estrada has described Anwar as a personal
friend.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, 51, as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2
after the two differed on economic policy. Anwar began rallying
opposition to Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared at
court hearings with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace, saying
he was beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Estrada initially said he was considering boycotting a summit in
Malaysia next month of leaders of countries belonging to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to protest Anwar's
treatment. He later announced he would attend.
	   Estrada said Tuesday he has decided to reduce his criticism of
Malaysia on the advice of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   ``I have to follow the advice of the president, to go slow, and
we have to be friendly with Malaysia,'' Estrada said. ``I've
expressed my feelings and that's enough.''
	   Malaysia also clarified that it postponed a defense meeting with
the Philippines scheduled this month because of financial and time
constraints and not because of the rift over Anwar, Barican said.
	   Malaysia's defense ministry has reset the meeting in the
Philippines to Nov. 8-10, Barican said.
	   A serious rift between Malaysia and the Philippines, both
founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
could destroy harmony in the grouping at a time when it is trying
to work cohesively to overcome Asia's financial turmoil.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos also work in Malaysia, which
is an important trading partner of the Philippines.
	   Estrada, however, stressed he would continue advocating that
Anwar be accorded due process of law and be treated humanely.
	   ``I'm not wavering in my position that the former deputy prime
minister should be given due process,'' Estrada told reporters.

	   PHU NOI CAMP, Thailand (AP) _ As Olympic medalists, Australian
rower Kate Slatter and swimmer Daniel Kowalski could be expected to
be resting on their laurels or training for their next
competitions.
	   Instead, along with paraplegic shot putter Hamish MacDonald,
they are serving this week as special ambassadors, visiting two
refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodia border where thousands live
without the simple joy of sport.
	   Their mission is a joint initiative by the International Olympic
Committee and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to
use sport to raise awareness of the struggle for human dignity
around the world.
	   It is the first such venture in the run-up to the Olympics in
Sydney in 2000.
	   The refugees at Phu Noi camp fled their homes in May. They had
been living in a pocket of northern Cambodia controlled by the
notoriously harsh Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement. A government
offensive swept them across the Thai border.
	   Today, the camp houses more than 15,000 people. With continuing
political instability in their homeland, it's not known when they
will return.
	   In this tightly disciplined camp, organized fun is unknown. But
the athletes received an enthusiastic welcome Tuesday, although it
took several minutes before the children overcame their shyness.
	   Slatter, 26, won a gold medal in rowing pairs at the 1996
Olympics. She said she found her visit an emotional and revealing
experience.
	   ``They're just people like you and me,'' she said. ``They're
just trying to get by from day to day, and find a way to enjoy
life. They love seeing each other play sport, and just get amongst
it.''
	   A doctor from the Australian state of Tasmania who has worked in
the camp almost since it opened knows how special the visit is for
the refugees.
	   ``They live from day to day,'' said Frances Daily. ``They aren't
allowed to roam freely, do what they like, so for most of them
their lives are on hold.''
	   Many refugees are disabled. Land mines from decades of war have
taken their toll. So the presence of Hamish MacDonald, who won a
gold medal in the Atlanta Paraplegic Olympics, was meant to convey
a message of hope.
	   ``In the future there are other opportunities for them, despite
their predicament,' he said. ``If I can leave them with that
impression, then that's a positive thing.''
	   At Huay Cherng camp, home to 7,000 people, the reception was
just as warm.
	   ``They're out there, they're playing together, they're having a
lot of fun and it's brought a smile to their faces, and I remember
saying before I left if I can just bring a smile to one of their
faces then the trip's been worthwhile, and we've had hundreds of
smiles today and that's great,'' said swimmer Kowalski, a star of
the Olympic and Commonwealth Games.
	   A 13-year-old boy playing with a donated soccer ball agreed.
	   ``This is great,'' said Nee. `` In Cambodia we can't do this. We
don't have things like this to play with.''
	   With their firsthand knowledge of the refugees' situation, the
athlete-ambassadors will try to use their standing to generate
awareness of refugee issues among the general public, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said.

Jordan, Britain hold joint military maneuvers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Britain are holding joint war
games involving about 1,200 soldiers in infantry drills lasting
more than a month, a British Embassy statement said Wednesday.
	   It said ``Exercise Saffron Sands'' began in early October and
will run until mid-November but gave no exact dates.
	   Jordanian army officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The statement said the exercise, part of annual drills between
the two countries, involves a British force of nearly 600 men and a
similar number of Jordanians.
	   ``Training by British military units is regularly carried out in
Jordan due to the excellent links between the two countries' armed
forces and ... the excellent facilities for training'' in Jordan,
the statement said.
	   It did not give the site of the exercise, but similar drills
with Britain last October were held in the desert town of Qatrana,
100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Amman.
	   Jordan also holds military exercises with the United States and
Turkey aimed at improving the defense tactics of its 100,000-strong
army, which has suffered in the last decade because of the state's
dlrs 6.1 billion foreign debts.

Italian premier-designate D'Alema announces Cabinet choices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds another Communist minister, corrects number of ministers &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema on Wednesday
announced a center-left government which includes eight holdovers
from his predecessor and doubles the number of women in the Cabinet
to six.
	   The government was to be sworn in later in the day.
	   The highly respected Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will stay on as
treasury and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco continues as
finance minister. The two are key figures in pushing through a1999
budget maintaining Italy's economic commitments to the European
Monetary Union.
	   Another respected figure, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, will
also stay on.
	   D'Alema's Cabinet will have 25 ministers, four more than
outgoing Premier Romano Prodi's.
	   Parliament is expected to take a vote of confidence Friday so
that D'Alema will be premier in time to attend the European Union
summit in Austria on Saturday.
	   D'Alema, an ex-Communist turned social democrat, is putting
together a government that includes members of Prodi's coalition
buttressed by new backing from the center and the Communists.
	   In return for the support of ex-President Francesco Cossiga,
D'Alema gave Cossiga's centrist party the defense, and post and
telecommunications ministries and a new portfolio: relations with
parliament.
	   The Italian Communists got the justice ministry and regional
affairs, the Greens kept environment, and D'Alema's own party, the
Democratic Left, got seven posts. Among them is labor, which went
to Naples' high-profile mayor, Antonio Bassolino.
	   D'Alema also appointed a special minister, ex-Premier Guiliano
Amato, to push through reforms in Italy's electoral system, which
is blamed for the country's ``revolving door'' governments.
	   Prodi's center-left government, Italy's 55th since the war, fell
on Oct. 9 when hard-line Communists withdrew their support in a
dispute over the budget. The president then turned to D'Alema,
leader of the largest party in Prodi's coalition, to form a new
government.

Ukraine's gas supplier cuts off thousands of debtors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Facing mounting consumer debts, Ukraine's
Naftogas company has cut off gas to thousands of industries, state
institutions and distributors catering to public needs, the
company's deputy chairman said Wednesday.
	   Taras Freiuk told a Cabinet meeting that various consumers have
paid his state-run company 2.8 million hryvna (dlrs 816 million at
the current rate) for gas supplied so far in 1998.
	   But they owe another 3.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 991 million) for
1998 gas supplies and a total of 11.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.44
billion), including debts from previous years, Freiuk said.
	   He said his company already has cut off 13,700 debtors, thus
reducing recent gas consumption by 12 percent, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   But the measure might be short-lived when it comes to public
consumption, which amounts to about 25 percent of the total. The
government has pledged to issue an order forbidding suppliers to
cut gas to distributors serving the general public during the
winter.
	   Also Wednesday, First Deputy Premier Anatoliy Holubchenko
suggested that the government would pay its debts to
state-supported regions with gas _ not cash.

Next Slovak government pushing for municipal elections to be

rescheduled &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The opposition alliance that won
Slovakia's elections last month is pushing to reschedule Nov. 13-14
nationwide municipal balloting for a few weeks later, media reports
said Wednesday.
	   Opposition leaders are against holding the municipal vote,
scheduled long ago by the outgoing government of Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar, during the country's political transition period.
	   The alliance won't take power until after Oct. 29 when the newly
elected Slovak Parliament convenes. Its leaders are already
preparing electoral law amendments in order to postpone the mayoral
elections, the campaign for which officially began Monday.
	   ``We think that the elections have to be rescheduled. We will
try for an early date, maybe even in December,'' Pavol Hamzik, vice
chairman of the opposition Party of Civic Understanding, told
reporters Tuesday.
	   Ivan Simko, a member of the leadership of the largest opposition
party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said it will be impossible
for elections to take place on schedule.

Russia seeks help for truckers stranded across Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry has ordered its
ambassadors in several West European capitals to help Russian
truckers stranded by the country's economic crisis, a news agency
said Wednesday.
	   Russian truckers are stuck, with no money to come home, in
Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland,
Interfax said.
	   Many have not received the goods they were sent to collect and
bring back to Russia, said Lev Shoikhet, the head of the Land Road
Transport Department of the Russian Transport Ministry.
	   Russia's financial crisis, which erupted in mid-August, caused
the ruble to plunge, making imports more expensive. It also
paralyzed the banking system, especially transactions involving
foreign transactions and foreign currencies.
	   Russian ambassadors have been ordered to collect information
about Russian truckers and trucks stuck in foreign countries
because they have no money to return home, and give them financial
assistance, Interfax said.
	   The International Transport Federation said that 10,000 truckers
from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia, Bulgaria and other East
European countries have been stranded in Western Europe while
sorting out their financial problems.
	   The Russian financial crisis had a spillover effect on other
former Soviet republics and on Russia's East European neighbors.
	   Most of the truckers have been abandoned by their companies, the
federation said, according to Interfax.
	   Shoikhet estimated about 500 to 600 Russian trucks are stuck in
Western Europe.

Volvo's nine-month profit falls 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker Volvo reported
Wednesday that its nine-month pre-tax profit dropped 27 percent
from the same period a year earlier, largely due to significantly
weaker demand in Southeast Asia.
	   The company recorded pre-tax proft for the period ending Sept.
30 of 7.79 billion kronor (dlrs 993 million), compared with 10.72
billion kronor for the first nine months in 1997.
	   Sales in Asia fell by 27 percent, to 8.64 billion kronor (dlrs
1.1 billion) while sales in other areas grew, up 31 percent in
North America to 46.87 billion (dlrs 5.97 billion) and up 14
percent in Western Europe to 82.44 billion kronor (dlrs 10.5
billion).
	   But the company said its profits were affected not only by the
decline in Asian sales but also by a shift in demand to products
with lower profit margins.
	   In addition, Volvo has endured higher costs for product
development, start-up of production and the launch of new products.
	   Volvo has matched the growth strategy that was presented in
1997, but the global scenario that formed the basis for that
strategy didn't include the current turbulence in financial markets
and the deep crisis in certain geographical markets, Volvo's Chief
Executive Leif Johansson said in a written comment.
	   ``If the turbulence and crises continue and result in a
declining total market, measures will have to be taken to adapt the
Group's level of costs to smaller volumes,'' Johansson said.

Jordan TV plans Hebrew subtitles on political programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ State-run Jordan Television is considering
using Hebrew subtitles on political programs to acquaint the
Israeli public with the Jordanian perspective, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Abdul-Halim Arabiyat, director of JTV's news department, said no
date has been set for starting the service whose feasibility and
technical aspects were being studied.
	   ``We are thinking of Hebrew subtitles to our political programs,
like debates on current affairs and talk shows,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Another TV official said the translations would aim at making
Israelis aware of Jordanian views on such topics as the Mideast
peace process. The translation will be done by Jordanian Hebrew
speakers, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   During the state of war between the two neighbors over the last
five decades, television signals from the two countries beamed
across the frontier to reach audiences in most parts of Jordan and
Israel.
	   In the 1970s, Jordan introduced a news bulletin in Hebrew, also
with the aim of presenting Jordanian political views. Similarly,
Israeli TV still has a daily Arabic program meant for Palestinians
as well as citizens of nearby Arab countries.
	   Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

Russian leaders focus on short-term ways to halt economic slide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 4 final grafs with additional economic developments
Wednesday. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government is focused on short-term
measures to stabilize the economy and see the country through the
winter, and a comprehensive recovery plan is not the top priority,
a senior official was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   The government is facing growing criticism for not producing an
economic blueprint to deal with the worst financial crisis since
the Soviet Union imploded seven years ago. The crisis hit two
months ago, and the government has so far implemented only stop-gap
measures.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, said the government's emphasis was on preventing
potential disasters, such as food shortages, this winter.
	   ``The (long-term) program is still absent because we need time
to make it sound,'' Maslyukov was quoted as saying in the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda. ``Moreover, it's still unclear how we can
stabilize the economy.''
	   The government is broke and the crisis has made it even more
difficult than usual to collect taxes. Also, foreign lenders have
frozen additional loans to Russia until the government produces a
program to address the long list of economic problems.
	   ``We should first take a series of emergency steps that would
allow us to stabilize the situation, live through the winter and
avert hunger,'' Maslyukov added.
	   The country presently has plenty of food, but a bad fall harvest
and sharp drops in imported foods have raised concerns. No serious
food shortages are expected this winter, but the government has
created a dlrs 600 million emergency food reserve that could feed
one-third of the population for two weeks.
	   Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, and has been counting on loans from a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package negotiated with the International Monetary Fund
before the economic crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   An IMF delegation is visiting Russia to review economic
conditions, but is not expected to recommend the release of
additional loan installments.
	   If the government does not receive foreign help, it may have to
print more money, a move that would stoke inflation. Prices have
gone up about 50 percent this year and could rise by 200 or 300
percent by year's end, the government has forecast.
	   Maslyukov said the government wanted to limit the amount of
money printed.
	   ``Printing money that is not properly backed is dangerous for
the economy and may push it into hyperinflation and chaos,'' he
said.
	   In other developments Wednesday:
	   _ The State Tax Service has drawn up a tax payment schedule for
14 of the country's biggest companies. The tax service will release
frozen accounts and confiscated property when the companies pay
their tax bills, Russian news agencies said.
	   _ The Russian ruble should be in a range of 17 to 20 against the
U.S. dollar for the rest of the year, government officials said.
The ruble was trading Wednesday at about 17, compared to six when
the crisis hit in August.
	   _ Parliament's lower house passed a bill that would guarantee
the savings accounts of individuals who had their accounts frozen
by ailing banks. However, it was not clear where the government
would get the money to cover the costs.

category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ The CIA would supervise the jailing
and disarming of suspected Palestinian terrorists in a
land-for-security deal President Bill Clinton is pressing hard to
seal between Israelis and Palestinians, officials at the talks
said. The two sides, expected to meet for a seventh day Wednesday,
were engaged in ``hard bargaining'' that could produce a broad
agreement this week designed to move the Middle East peace process
to its final stage, U.S. officials said. They noted the key
assistance of Jordan's King Hussein, who attended at the Clinton
administration's request. ``It's certainly the most intensive phase
yet,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said late Tuesday
as the leaders and negotiators worked into early Wednesday to
overcome ``significant gaps.'' He said some obstacles were overcome
and at this stage, ``An inch is as good as a mile.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said
Wednesday he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement
despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it. The
Yugoslav leader's comments came after talks in Belgrade in which
Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's American supreme commander, and U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill laid out what Milosevic still has to do in
order to fully comply with the Oct. 12 agreement. U.S. and NATO
officials complain that Milosevic has still not withdrawn all the
special police units sent to Kosovo in February when he attacked
ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army. He faces
a Tuesday deadline to do so or face the renewed threat of NATO
airstrikes. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean Peninsula resumed Wednesday after a six-month break, with
little sign of early progress. The peace talks group South and
North Korea, the United States and China. ``The four-party talks
have great importance for the peace and stability in and around the
Korean Peninsula,'' said South Korean delegation leader Park
Kun-woo. ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both
as the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman
of the session.'' Each side takes turns chairing the talks.
Switzerland, hosting the meeting, proposed establishing a
humanitarian corridor across the border between the two Koreas to
ease distribution of aid to North Korea. (KOREAN TALKS)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila
failed to attend talks Wednesday with his southern African military
allies over the civil war in his vast mineral-rich country. Kabila
was feeling unwell and sent an aide instead, said Zimbabwean
government spokesman George Charamba. Congo was expected to ask its
allies to deploy more troops in the eastern jungles, where rebels
have made rapid advances. Attending the talks hosted by President
Robert Mugabe were President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Angola's
President Eduardo dos Santos and Kabila aide Victor Mpoyo,
officials said. No other details were given, but the state
controlled Herald newspaper said the leaders will ``review their
military position in the wake of rebel advances'' in the eastern
Congo. (ZIMBABWE-CONGO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Caught in a race against time, the chairman of
the House impeachment inquiry says the first meeting between his
panel and the White House is key to determining whether the probe
can be finished this year. White House lawyers were meeting with
House Judiciary Committee investigators Wednesday in what both
sides have described as a getting-to-know-you session focused on
logistics. But the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, an
Illinois Republican, and White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
their lawyers also would try to get a feel for each other's
strategy as the clock winds down to Hyde's end-of-the-year
deadline. (US-CONGRESS-IMPEACHMENT)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher
Wednesday, spurred by strong rallies in Tokyo and New York, as well
as the global downward trend in interest rates. Japanese share
prices rallied for a fourth consecutive session on optimism that
the country's troubled banks were moving closer to seeking public
funds to boost their depleted capital. The benchmark Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues rose 408.28 points, or 2.96 percent,
to close at 14,216.33. It was the Nikkei's first finish above
14,000 points since Sept. 24. In four days, blue chip shares on
Asia's biggest market have gained a total of 1,220.96 points.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Playing host to an international conference on
African development, Tokyo on Wednesday pledged aid to the
continent totaling 90 billion yen (dlrs 776 million), mostly grants
for educational and health facilities. ``The ultimate objective of
development is to improve living conditions for every human
being,'' Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said in
announcing the aid that will span the next five years. Komura said
the assistance will allow 2 million African children to study in
new schools and provide better medical services and cleaner water
to improve the lives of more than 15 million people. (JAPAN-AFRICA

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank chief said
Wednesday he expects inflation and interest rates to fall by year's
end, and that the economy will start growing again next year. Chatu
Mongkol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said he expects
gross domestic product to grow 1 percent in 1999. In 1998, most
analysts expect Thailand's recession-ravaged economy to contract by
about 7 percent. Inflation will be 8 percent for 1998, lower than
International Monetary Fund estimates of 9.2 percent, Chat Mongkol
told a news conference. As part of the package, it has demanded
economic reforms and set targets on spending, inflation and other
indicators for the country's planners. (THAILAND-ECONOMIC GROWTH)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Talks toward liberalizing international investment
appeared dead in the water, with no new date announced, after
France pulled out to defend its culture and audiovisual industries.
French resistance forced a six-month delay in the talks on a
Multilateral Agreement on Investment, or MAI, and Tuesday's
resumption was little more than a formality. Representatives at the
talks at the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, or OECD, said that even France supported continued
efforts at the Paris-based world club of industrialized countries.
``There is broad support (among negotiating parties) to continue
consultation,'' Joanna Shelton, OECD deputy secretary general, told
a news conference Tuesday night. But she added: ``We do have to
take a new look'' at the negotiations. (FRANCE-MAI TALKS)

Government lifts controversial decree after bringing media law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government Wednesday lifted a
ban of several independent newspapers, a day after it imposed a law
restricting their work.
	   The move means that Danas, Dnevni Telegraf and Nasa Borba
dailies, shut down last week, can publish, although some of the
editors warned that the new law makes it impossible to work, B-92
radio reported.
	   ``Whoever wants to keep one's journalistic integrity will have
enormous problems,'' said Slavko Curuvija, editor of the banned
Dnevni Telegraf daily.
	   Curuvija called on his colleagues from other independent papers
not to resume publishing, thus protesting the media law passed by
the Serbian parliament on Tuesday.
	   The lifting of the ban has to be published in the state official
gazette before the papers can publish again.
	   Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has used the possibility of NATO intervention
on military targets to clamp down against opponents at home.
	   The new information law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media and calls for huge fines against media
editors and owners who disobey the decree.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
report is against the law, and places further restrictions on
working permits for media organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law is highly
restrictive and again introduces censorship which was formally
abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s.
	   The law superseded a decree imposing censorship in the media.
The three papers were banned last week after the government said
they had worked against the interests of the state. The government
also evicted a popular Belgrade radio station from their premises
and shut down a number of provincial media.
	   Throughout the nearly eight-month-old Kosovo crisis, state
officials have accused the media of betraying Serbia's national

Most Asian markets close higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher
Wednesday, spurred by strong rallies in Tokyo and New York and the
global downward trend in interest rates.
	   Japanese share prices rallied for a fourth consecutive session
on optimism that the country's troubled banks were moving closer to
seeking public funds to boost their depleted capital.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
408.28 points, or 2.96 percent, closing at 14,216.33.
	   It was the Nikkei's first finish above 14,000 points since Sept.
24. In four days, blue chip shares on Asia's biggest market have
gained a total of 1,220.96 points.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 116.36 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.22 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but lower than
its level of 116.83 yen in Tuesday's late New York trading.
	   Traders were encouraged to buy shares following a report in the
newspaper Nihon Keizai that quoted Industrial Bank of Japan
President Masao Nishimura as saying his bank would apply for public
funds under a government plan.
	   IBJ was the first bank to publicly say it would seek taxpayer
money under Japanese laws adopted earlier this month allowing the
government to take over foundering banks and to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) into the cash-strapped financial
system.
	   ``The move will lead to more financial stability and is raising
hopes that banks will ease their restrictive lending policies,
alleviating the credit crunch,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   In Hong Kong, the gains were less impressive as an early rally
fizzled. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent, closing at
9,662.12.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed higher Tuesday for the
fifth consecutive session. It was up 39.40 points at 8,505.85, the
first close above 8,500 since late August.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index climbed 2.9 percent,
closing at 1,140.91 points, as the developments in Japan encouraged
traders.
	   Markets in Taiwan and Australia rose with help from recent
interest rate cuts or anticipation of further cuts.
	   Taiwan's key Weighted Price Index rallied 2.5 percent, closing
at 7,021.42, after several major banks announced interest rate cuts
this week, matching the U.S. rate cut from last week.
	   In Australia, expectations that the central bank also would cut
interest rates before the end of the month spurred stock buying.
The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,543.0, up 1.0 percent.
	   Indonesia bucked the regional trend, with the key JSX index
falling 4.2 percent to 322.321 points in what traders described as
a correction to recent rises. Dealers said some investors had been
overly enthusiastic about signals of a turnaround in Indonesia's
battered economy.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended lower after two days of gains.
The SET index lost 2.5 percent, closing at 323.05.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended higher on bargain-hunting. The
key PSE index closed 1.8 percent higher at 1,494.62.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed, with
last-minute buying in selected blue chips erasing earlier losses.
The key Composite index closed 1.4 points higher at 424.37.
	   SEOUL: Share prices ended mixed, with the key Kospi index
closing down 1.9 percent at 380.30 points. Analysts said market
sentiment was improving.
	   WELLINGTON: Share prices finished higher, led by a rise in key
forestry sector stocks. The key NZSE-40 capital index rose 2.1
percent to 1,841.58, its highest since Aug. 28.

Australia hopes to clinch series after 39 years

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia launches its campaign
Thursday to win a Test series on Pakistan soil ending a 39-year
drought.
	   The third Test will be played at the National Stadium in the
southern port city of Karachi. Pakistan has won 16 previous
contests against Australia including a historic one-wicket win over
Mark Taylor's Australia in 1994. It eventually cost Taylor the
series in his debut series as Australia's captain.
	   ``They haven't lost here and it's a bit of a worry for us,''
said Taylor, who will go into the final Test with a 1-0 lead.
Australia won the first Test in Rawalpindi by an innings and 99
runs while the second Test in Peshawar ended in a draw with Taylor
equaling Sir Don Bradman's 334-run mark.
	   ``This time my boys are playing very good cricket and there is
no reason why we should not perform well here,'' he said. ``We will
do our best to clinch the series. I think we can certainly beat
them here.''
	   If Taylor succeeds in either drawing or winning the Test here,
he will be the first Australian captain to win a series after
Richie Benaud in the 1959-60 season.
	   ``Toss will be vital as whosoever wins it will definitely bat,''
predicted the 33-year-old Australian captain after seeing a flat
and dry wicket at the National Stadium.
	   ``It will definitely help spinners,'' he said and ``the pitch
might start helping the slow bowlers from day one.''
	   Although Taylor did not announce his final playing eleven, it is
likely that Darren Lehmann will be back in place of Ricky Ponting.
Lehmann has fully recovered from his groin injury which he
aggravated during the four-day game before the second Test. He made
successive centuries against Rawalpindi before he was retired due
to groin problem in the second innings.
	   Pakistan has dropped leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed for the final
Test. However its star all-rounder Wasim Akram has now fully
recovered from influenza and throat infection which prevented him
from playing in the second Test.
	   ``We will play positively and our aim is to stop Australian from
winning the series,'' said skipper Aamir Sohail.
	   Team line ups:
	   Pakistan: Aamir Sohail (captain), Saeed Anwar, Ijaz Ahmed,
Inzamamul Haq, Salim Malik, Yousuf Youhanna, Moin Khan, Azhar
Mahmood, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar, Saqlain Mushtaq, Arshad Khan,
Shakeel Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Shahid Nazir and Muhammad Akram.
	   Australia: Mark Taylor (captain), Justin Langer, Michael Slater,
Steve Waugh, Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy,
Stuart MacGill, Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath, Collin Miller,
Michael Kasprowicz, Gavin Robertson.

British team leads emergency repairs at Herod's Masada palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Conservationists led by a British team are
doing emergency repairs on one of Israel's best-known
archaeological sites, King Herod's Masada palace.
	   The location of the 2000-year-old palace on a desert mountaintop
near the Dead Sea makes it vulnerable to the destructive forces of
wind, sand, water and salt, Mazy Magnazi, a spokeswoman for
Israel's Nature Reserves Authority, said Wednesday.
	   The conservationists are trying to combat the effects of the
weather on the soft limestone. Many of the stones have been
hollowed out by the weather and some have collapsed, Magnazi said.
	   Rather than replacing the stones, the conservationists are
trying to maintain the original facade of the palace by filling in
the damaged stones with slices of similar limestones.
	   The British team will leave Israel on Saturday, but an Israeli
team will continue the repairs, Magnazi said.
	   Frescoes, decorative plaster work and Herod's private bathhouse
_ which is in danger of sliding off the eastern edge of the cliff _
are also slated for emergency repairs.
	   Masada was the last outpost of zealots during the Jewish revolt
against Rome that began in A.D. 66. The zealots held off Roman
legions for three years and committed mass suicide to avoid
enslavement.

U.S. ambassador visits Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Richard Celeste, the U.S. ambassador to
India, ended a two-day visit to troubled Kashmir on Wednesday,
saying his government was keen to see an ongoing sustained dialogue
between India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes.
	   The India-Pakistan talks should attempt to resolve differences,
Celeste told reporters in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kahmir state.
	   During his stay, Celeste met with government leaders as well as
representatives of the separatist groups and visited a hospital
treating victims of violence unleashed by the insurgency war since
1989.
	   Apart from Gov. Gary Saxena Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, he
also met with opposition Congress Party and Communist Party of
India (Marxist) leaders.
	   Celeste met Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Shabir Shah and other
separatist leaders. Geelani and Shah refused to say anything about
the meetings.
	   India accuses Pakistan of backing an Islamic-led insurgency in
Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. India
controls two-thirds of the Himalayan territory and Pakistan the
rest.

Yeltsin has medical checkup

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Yeltsin going for medical checkup, trip
to Austria still planned. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin had a ``regular checkup''
on Wednesday to see how he is recovering from a cold, his press
secretary said.
	   Yeltsin's exam at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, also
known as the Kremlin hospital, included an X-ray, Dmitry Yakushkin
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Doctors said Yeltsin's recovery was ``normal.''
	   Yeltsin's latest illness, described as a respiratory infection,
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last week, and he
has spent most of his time since then at his country residences.
	   He canceled a trip to Malaysia scheduled for next month, but
Yakushkin said his trip to Vienna for a summit with the European
Union next week is still on.
	   However, the Kommersant business daily reported Tuesday that
according to its sources, Yeltsin's chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev said that Yeltsin is unlikely to make any more foreign
trips during his presidency. Other Russian media quoted
unidentified Yeltsin aides as saying the same thing.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. He has kept an
increasingly low political profile, briefly venturing into the
Kremlin two or three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and staunchly deny
speculation that the president has serious health problems _ a
suggestion that is repeated every time Yeltsin catches a cold.
	   After his doctor's appointment on Wednesday, Yeltsin returned to
his Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow, his press secretary
said. Yeltsin had no working meetings scheduled, but may make some
telephone calls, including one with German Chancellor-elect
Gerhardt Schroeder, Yakushkin said.

Murder of Indian bride sparks protests, suspects beaten in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Jail inmates beat three Sri Lankan men
arrested for the rape and murder of an Indian bride on her
honeymoon, police and jail officials said Wednesday.
	   No motive was immediately established for Tuesday's assault, but
last week's attack on the woman, Rita John Manoharan, aroused
outrage and protests in Colombo.
	   An official at the Welikada prison near Colombo said the beating
was being investigating. The three suspects were hospitalized.
	   ``Rape and murder is not uncommon in our country, but many Sri
Lankans get a feeling of shame when a foreigner is attacked,'' said
another official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The state-run Observer denounced the murder in a front-page
editorial. ``The grisly murder unveils frightening possibilities in
our society. What is terrifying about this crime is the sheer
cold-bloodedness of it all.''
	   Social organizations have asked the government to revive the
death penalty for such heinous crimes. Capital punishment is on the
statute books, but no one has been executed since 1973.
	   An association of women's volunteer groups was sponsoring a
demonstration in Colombo Wednesday asking the police to be more
vigilant.
	   ``Enough is not being done to safeguard the interest of women in
the country,'' Sepali Kottegoda, head of the group, said in a
statement.
	   Last week, police found the mutilated body of Bombay-born
Manoharan who had come to Colombo on honeymoon with her Sri Lankan
husband, a marine engineer.
	   ``The motive was rape and it was the work of sex maniacs,'' said
police spokesman Riency Perara.
	   Manoharan, 29, was kidnapped while walking by the sea on Oct.
11. She was married about a month ago.

Cambodian opposition wants U.S. ambassador post left vacant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's two opposition parties
want the U.S. ambassador's post in Phnom Penh left vacant to show
displeasure with alleged corruption, election fraud and violence by
the nation's leader.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy made the request in a
letter Sept. 11 to Jesse Helms, chairman of the U.S. Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations. A copy of the letter was obtained
Wednesday.
	   ``We urge you not to replace Ambassador Kenneth Quinn after his
term expires in Phnom Penh, and certainly not with Kent Wiedemann,
who we believe may be less than supportive of the cause of
democracy in Cambodia,'' they wrote.
	   Wiedemann now heads the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar as charge
d'affaires.
	   ``The position should be left vacant as a message to Hun Sen
that there are no rewards for corruption, manipulation of elections
and violence,'' the opposition leaders said.
	   Their letter also calls on the U.S. Congress to condemn
post-election violence and suspend official assistance to Cambodia
until a new government is agreed upon between Hun Sen's ruling
party and the opposition.
	   ``It is imperative that the United States continue to take a
principled stand in Cambodia,'' the opposition leaders wrote.
	   They contend that Hun Sen's party won the July election through
fraud and intimidation. But that party does not have enough seats
in parliament to form a new government on its own, and is
negotiating with the opposition.
	   Most international observers certified the Cambodian election as
broadly representative of the will of the people, but said the
National Election Committee, which was stacked with Hun Sen
loyalists, should have more thoroughly investigated the
opposition's fraud allegations.
	   After its allegations were dismissed by Cambodia's highest
court, the opposition rallied its supporters and led large
anti-government demonstrations through Phnom Penh's streets.
	   Hun Sen ordered the demonstrations broken up on Sept. 7 after an
alleged attempt on his life.
	   Four people were confirmed killed in the crackdown, but the
discovery by human rights workers of more than 20 bodies in its
aftermath has prompted speculation that the death toll could be
higher.
	   Both Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh left Cambodia after the ceremonial
opening of parliament on Sept. 24 and have not returned, saying
they feel unsafe negotiating inside the country with Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy flew to Washington and lobbied U.S. congressmen to
support the opposition's position as negotiations to form a new
government stalled in Phnom Penh.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding
resolution earlier this month calling for an international tribunal
to investigate Hun Sen for alleged violations of international
humanitarian law.
	   An identical resolution is now being considered by the Senate's
Committee on Foreign Relations.
	   A spokesman for Hun Sen's government said Wednesday he was
unconcerned by the recent actions of the U.S. Congress, and that
the government still has a good relationship with the U.S. State
Department.
	   Asked about the opposition's letter to Helms, spokesman Khieu
Kanharith said: ``We think it is the right of the U.S. government
to decide who should be the ambassador.''

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police and FBI agents have
located and occupied the house where they believe the bomb that
killed 11 people and destroyed the U.S. Embassy was assembled, a
senior government official said Wednesday.
	   Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed said the house was
located in the sprawling Ilala district of Dar es Salaam.
	   Ameir also said detectives and FBI agents were making what he
termed ``very good progress'' in the investigation of the Aug. 7
blast. He said more FBI agents are expected to join the
investigation soon.
	   A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring Kenya killed 213
people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection with the
Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth is a
fugitive.
	   An Egyptian and a Tanzanian have been formally charged in the
Tanzanian bombing and are being held without bail in Dar es Salaam.
	   Police are searching for two fugitives in connection with the
Dar es Salaam bombing whom a senior official identified as Kenyan
of Yemini origin known as Fahad and a Tanazanian of Omani origin
named Ahmad Khalfan.
	   The official spoke only on condition that he not be further
identified.
	   Both men, who reportedly left Dar es Salaam several days before
the Aug. 7 bombings, had business dealings with one of the two
suspects held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed.
	   Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the
United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan
where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad
Khalfan was a member of the group that planned the attack in Dar es
Salaam.
	   According to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified
Farad as being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing.

Opposition rocket hits Kabul airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket fired by the opposition
northern alliance hit the combined military and civilian airport in
the beleaguered capital Kabul on Wednesday, said witnesses.
	   There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties.
	   The attack came as dozens of Taliban aircraft took off from the
airport apparently headed toward opposition positions north of the
capital and in northern Takhar province, where the Taliban are
trying to retake the provincial capital of Taloqan.
	   The relentless rocket attacks on the airport has forced the
International Red Cross to suspend its flights to Kabul.
	   The Taliban, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan including
Kabul, is waging a ferocious battle against its enemies on several
fronts.
	   The opposition alliance says dozens of people, including
civilians, have been killed in bombing raids by Taliban jet
fighters.
	   The Taliban follows a strict version of Islam that bars women
from work and education, bans music and arts and forces men to wear
beards. They are Sunni Muslims and belong to the majority Pashtun
ethnic group.
	   The opposition alliance comprise mainly of ethnic and religious
minorities including the Shiites, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.

Popular Dutch poet Vasalis is dead at 89
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch poet Vasalis, whose lucid
style and poignant commentary on everyday life made her one of the
Netherlands' most popular poets, has died. She was 89.
	   Vasalis, whose real name was Margaretha Droogleever
Fortuyn-Leenmans, died Oct. 16 in her hometown of Roden in the
northern Netherlands, a spokeswoman for her publisher Van Oorschot
said Wednesday.
	   The cause of death was not disclosed, said spokeswoman Gamma
Nefkens.
	   Vasalis' oeuvre comprises about 100 poems depicting the
endeavors and emotions of everyday life such as pain, grief, love
and death. Among her books are ``Parks and Deserts,'' published in
1940, and ``The Bird Phoenix'' in 1947.
	   ``Her poems are not very difficult to understand. She didn't use
difficult words,'' Nefkens said.
	   ``That direct, that instant understanding and poignancy is a
quality of Vasalis' verses which characterize most of the poems in
her three collections,'' the daily De Volkskrant wrote in a
tribute.
	   Some of her poems also have been translated into English and
published in literary magazines.
	   In 1982, she won the P.C. Hooft Prize, the Netherlands' top
literary award.
	   She was buried on Tuesday in Amstelveen, a town just outside
Amsterdam. Family details were not released.

New agriculture minister ahead of tough EU subsidy talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The appointment of Jean Glavany as France's new
agriculture minister was seen Wednesday as a move to reinforce the
post ahead of tough negotiations on cutting European farm
subsidies.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Tuesday named the
49-year-old Glavany to the post vacated by Louis Le Pensec, who was
only ``moderately impassioned by his subject,'' the leftist daily
Liberation said.
	   Le Pensec, who quit after being elected to the Senate, had ``put
an end to co-management'' Liberation said, noting the minister had
ended monthly meetings with farmers' unions that stage sometimes
violent protests.
	   Compared to Le Pensec's tougher stance, Glavany was seen as
having better negotiating skills. Glavany takes over as France
negotiates with other members of the 15-nation EU to reform the
Common Agricultural Policy.
	   CAP subsidies make up more than half the total EU budget,
requiring reform before the EU takes on new members. As Europe's
largest agricultural producer, France stands to lose the most and
it will be Glavany's job to get farmers to accept the reform.
	   Glavany was one of the best and brightest who President Francois
Mitterrand brought to Elysee Palace after his election in 1981.
Mitterrand named him chief of staff when he was 32 and kept him in
the post for seven years.
	   Glavany served as a junior minister for technical instruction
from 1992 to 1993 when he was elected to the National Assembly, the
same year the left was booted from power. Jospin brought the left
back in June last year.
	   Most recently, Glavany headed a parliamentary study of Corsica
that found a ``pre-mafia-like'' system of corruption and
intimidation on the French Mediterranean island racked by
nationalist violence.

Singapore stocks close 2.9 percent up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A global easing of interest rates and spillover
from the buoyant Japanese market pushed Singapore's benchmark index
to close 2.9 percent higher Wednesday.
	   The Straits Times Index closed at 1,140.91, up 32.16 points from
Wednesday's finish, as a weeklong rally continued.
	   Japan's Nikkei index soared for the fourth consecutive day
Wednesday. Investors are optimistic that its huge banking sector is
about to benefit from government measures to correct balance sheets
and stimulate lending.
	   However, dealers said most of the funds that have come back into
Singapore are short-term. Long-term investments are waiting for
more signs of regional stabilization.
	   Hit by Asian financial turmoil that began last year, Singapore
is among countries that expect their economies to shrink before a
turnaround comes.
	   The U.S. interest rate cut last week is seen as a positive sign
that triggered Singapore's rally and allowed room for local banks
to cut their rates further.

Russia's economic crisis halts plans for mortgage system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis has halted an attempt to
bring part of the American dream _ the creation of a mortgage
system _ to Moscow, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Earlier this year, the Harvard University developed a plan
calling for loans and credits of about dlrs 500 million in 1998 to
create a mortgage system in Moscow. The plan would have helped
thousands of home buyers in the city.
	   But after Russia's crisis hit in mid-August, the plan was off,
the daily Vremya reported, citing the program's coordinator with
the Moscow city government, Vladimir Shternfeld.
	   ``The outlines for work with Harvard University experts and the
plans for getting the money have not succeeded,'' Shternfeld told a
city government session Tuesday.
	   ``As soon as trouble started in Russia, they stepped aside,'' he
said.
	   Many Muscovites were given ownership of their apartments
following the Soviet breakup. But the development of a
Western-style property market has been slowed by difficulties in
obtaining mortgages and drawing up enforceable contracts.
	   Under the current system, the city pays contractors who build
housing and then sells homes through official realtors without
financing. Only the wealthiest residents can afford new homes and
apartments, which must be paid for in one lump sum.
	   The Moscow city government is still looking for other sources of
money to finance the plan, but it remains unclear when any new
funding could become available.

Alleged knife-throwing incident under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW (AP) _ The Polish club Wisla Krakow moved Wednesday on
reports that Parma player Dino Baggio was injured by a knife thrown
from the stands with UEFA promising to deal with the incident.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of Tuesday's UEFA Cup
second-round match _ a 1-1 draw at Wisla _ by an object that
Italian reports initially identified as a flick knife.
	   However, Poland's largest circulation newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta
said two Wisla players suggested that Baggio was hit with some
``small metal object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife.
	   The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr
_ after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck
by an unidentified object.
	   In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said no action was
planned until a match report was in hand. He said the matter would
be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting in November.
	   ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' Gonnella
said.

Former Justice Minister Gerhard Jahn dies at 71
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Jahn, justice minister under
former Chancellor Willy Brandt, died in Marburg where he lived for
most of his life. He was 71.
	   A life-long Social Democrat born in Kassel and first elected to
parliament in 1957, Jahn worked under then-Foreign Minister Brandt
as an undersecretary from 1967-69.
	   Jahn played a key role in helping the Social Democrats negotiate
a coalition agreement with the Free Democrats after the 1969
elections, with Brandt as chancellor.
	   Brandt brought him into the Cabinet as justice minister, a post
he held until 1974.
	   Jahn remained in parliament until 1990, representing his adopted
home of Marburg where he had studied law as young man.
	   Jahn is survived by his wife and three children.

War crimes investigation mission to begin next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A delegation of U.N. war crimes
investigators and prosecutors plans to visit Kosovo early next
month, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said
Wednesday.
	   The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and
her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports
of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Gavin Ruxton, a senior legal adviser in Arbour's office, would
give no details of the alleged war crimes the team would be
investigating.
	   He confirmed that Arbour would leave for Yugoslavia on Nov. 5,
although he added that Yugoslav officials have not yet granted the
team visas to visit the region.
	   Belgrade authorities recently began refusing to issue visas to
tribunal investigators planning to visit the province, where Serb
forces have been engaged in a seven-month crackdown of secessionist
ethnic Albanian rebels.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Relations between Russia and the Western European
Union are an important element of European security, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday.
	   ``We are bent on a very serious dialogue between Russia and the
Western European Union,'' Ivanov said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   ``We believe that relations between Russia and the WEU should
develop in the same direction as relations between Russia and the
EU or NATO. The Western European Union is a reality on the European
continent,'' he said.
	   The Western European Union is the fledgling defense arm of the
European Union.
	   Ivanov's comments were made during a meeting of Western European
Union officials in Moscow.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's 56th government since World War II took
office Wednesday with the swearing in of new Premier Massimo
D'Alema and a center-left government which includes eight holdovers
from his predecessor and twice the number of women.
	   The 49-year-old D'Alema announced his government earlier in the
day.
	   The highly respected Carlo Azeglio Ciampi stays on as treasury
and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco continues as finance
minister. The two are key figures in pushing through a1999 budget
maintaining Italy's economic commitments to the European Monetary
Union.
	   Another respected figure, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, also
stays on.
	   D'Alema's Cabinet has 25 ministers, four more than outgoing
Premier Romano Prodi's. Prodi did not attend the swearing-in
ceremony at the presidential palace.
	   Parliament is expected to take a required vote of confidence
Friday, and D'Alema plans to attend the European Union summit
Saturday in Austria.
	   D'Alema, an ex-Communist turned social democrat, put together a
government that includes members of Prodi's coalition buttressed by
new backing from the center and the Communists.
	   ``I think we've found a good balance,'' D'Alema said afterward.

Saturday left as many as 500 people dead.
	   ``It is indeed a tragedy of immense proportions, and I am

Turkish Kurds faces terror-related charges in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An alleged leader of the banned
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Germany went on trial Wednesday on
charges of participating in a terrorist organization and attempted
arson.
	   Halit Y., 41, has been jailed since April.
	   Prosecutors charge he directed arson attacks in southern Germany
against Turkish businesses and other targets after Kurdish
prisoners in Turkish jails went on a hunger strike in the summer of
1996.
	   He also is charged with fraud for allegedly collecting about
5,100 marks (dlrs 3,200) in German welfare while actually living in
Paris. Prosecutors say he used the money to support the PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for a homeland in
Kurdish-populated southeast Turkey. About 500,000 Kurds live in
Germany.

Ethiopia expels another 2,500 Eritreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia has expelled another 2,500
Eritreans, bringing the total number of Eritreans cast out of its
neighbor to 30,000 since border hostilities erupted in May, the
Eritrean government said Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it was informed Monday that the new
batch of deportees would arrive Wednesday at five crossing points
along the common border with Ethiopia.
	   The statement said the short notice made logistics difficult.
	   Ethiopia says it has deported 8,000 Eritreans, either for spying
for Eritrea or raising money for the Eritrean war effort.
	   Ethiopia also accuses Eritrea of deporting 27,000 Ethiopians, a
claim the Eritrean government denies.
	   The Eritrean statement Wednesday said Ethiopia was also holding
1,316 Eritrean youths in Blaiten in what it called ``a
concentration camp ... for the preposterous reason that these
people could be potential soldiers in Eritrea.''
	   The allegation could not be independently confirmed.
	   The simmering border conflict erupted into full scale war in
May.
	   Since mid-June there have been no reports of fighting, but both
countries have massed troops and weapons along the border.

England leaves for Ashes Test series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Beating South Africa is one thing. But winning the
Ashes in Australia is another.
	   With that in mind, England's cricket side left Wednesday for its
11-week tour, hoping to win the Ashes for the first time since the
1986-87 series in Australia.
	   ``It's because they (Australia) are best side that it is the
biggest challenge you are going to come up against,'' said England
captain Alec Stewart. ``I like challenges and I'd like to think as
a team and as a squad were are capable of accepting that.
	   ``They are probably the toughest side mentally along with South
Africa, with Australia probably a little tougher, but you have to
be tough to play at international level.''
	   The five-Test series begins Nov. 20 in Brisbane with the final
Test set for Jan. 2-6 in Sydney.
	   Stewart is putting the emphasis on a tough mental game and Tour
manager Graham Gooch is calling for similar discipline.
	   ``Test cricket is a hard game,'' Gooch said. ``The last two
Ashes tours did not start well and it's difficult to drag a series
back from that.''
	   ``We have got to play well in the first Test.''
	   Gooch also warned player against heavy drinking on the Tour. He
said a glass of beer or wine after play was acceptable but warned
that players ``have to act like grownups.''
	   Stewart is hopeful the historic win this summer over South
Africa _ England's first five-Test home series win over major
opposition in 13 years _ will help England lose its ``soft''
reputation.
	   ``It was pretty intense against South Africa at times, and we
were certainly up for that and stood our ground when we had to _ it
will be very similar to that this winter,'' Stewart said.
	   Just in case, England is also taking along sports psychologist
Steve Bull.
	   ``Steve is different and his strength for me is that he gets
everyone talking,'' Stewart explained. ``That's very important
because you know how the bloke over the other side of the room is
feeling. He is not going to go and bat or bowl for you, but if he
can help just a little bit that would be great.''

At least three dead as boat capsizes in Gulf of Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least three people died when a ferry
boat carrying more than 20 passengers to an island in the Gulf of
Thailand capsized early Wednesday, marine police said.
	   The bodies of two foreign women and one pregnant Thai woman were
recovered and 15 passengers had been rescued, said a police officer
in the southern province of Surat Thani, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The nationalities of the foreign women were not known.
	   An unknown number of passengers were missing and presumed dead.
	   ``We know for sure that at least three passengers are not
accounted for but it is very likely that the rest could have
drowned,'' said the officer.
	   Recovery operations were suspended because of heavy storms in
the gulf, he said.
	   The ferry left Don Sak town, 530 kilometers (330 miles) south of
Bangkok, at 11 p.m. Tuesday for Koh Tao, an island popular with
young Western travelers.
	   It capsized at 4 a.m. Wednesday, said the police officer.
	   Thai TV Channel 7 reported Wednesday night that 18 passengers
had been rescued, including two Americans and two Swiss. It said at
least eight people were believed missing.

Government allows newspapers to reopen, but restrictions remain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav government announced
Wednesday it had lifted a ban on several independent newspapers, a
day after all media were informed of new restrictions.
	   The move means that Danas, Dnevni Telegraf and Nasa Borba
dailies, shut down last week, can publish, although some of the
editors warned that a new law announced Tuesday makes it impossible
to work, B-92 radio reported.
	   The law announced Tuesday bans broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media imposing huge fines for offenders.
	   It also allows authorities to rule which reports are against the
law, and restricts work permits for media organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law is highly
restrictive and introduces censorship, abandoned in Serbia in the
late 1980s.
	   ``Whoever wants to keep one's journalistic integrity will have
enormous problems,'' said Slavko Curuvija, editor of the banned
Dnevni Telegraf daily.
	   Curuvija called on his colleagues from other independent papers
not to resume publishing, thus protesting the media law passed by
the Serbian parliament on Tuesday.
	   The lifting of the ban has to be published in the state official
gazette before the papers can publish again.
	   Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has used the possibility of NATO intervention
on military targets to clamp down against opponents at home.
	   The law superseded a decree imposing censorship in the media.
The three papers were banned last week after the government said
they had worked against the state. The government also evicted a
popular Belgrade radio station from their premises and shut down
some provincial media.
	   Throughout the nearly eight-month-old Kosovo crisis, state
officials have accused the media of betraying Serbia's national
interests by reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or
carrying foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   A U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, on Tuesday expressed
``outrage'' at the media crackdown at a meeting with editors of
Serbia's independent media.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union economy will expand
slower than expected next year because of the world financial
turmoil, but growth will remain robust this year and recover in
2000, the EU forecast Wednesday.
	   The EU's said the economy of the 15-nation bloc would expand 2.4
percent next year, down from the 3 percent predicted in the Union's
last economic forecast released in March.
	   ``In 1999, the international crisis will take a toll, albeit
limited,'' the EU said in a statement. ``With the renewed pick up
of growth and trade at the world level in 2000, there is again
scope for a reacceleration of economic expansion in the EU.''
	   The EU economy will remain sheltered from the worst of the
international turbulence this year, and grow 2.9 percent, the
highest rate this decade, the EU said.

Senior U.N. official expresses admiration for Anwar's wife

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior United Nations official
visited the wife of Malaysia's jailed dissident leader Wednesday
and described her as ``a courageous lady.''
	   Abib Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression
and opinion of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, did not say,
however, whether he had come to Malaysia specifically to meet
Azizah Ismail.
	   Azizah, the wife of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim,
said earlier she hoped she would not be arrested on charges of
encouraging protests against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Her comments came after rumors of her arrest swept across Kuala
Lumpur. Reporters and photographers rushed to her home.
	   ``I'm very encouraged that he came to visit me,'' Azizah said of
Hussain, who was India's ambassador to the United Nations in the
early 1990s.
	   Fears of her arrest were fueled by comments by Mahathir Tuesday
just before he concluded a five-day visit to Tokyo.
	   ``I hope the police won't arrest (her), but I don't know. That
is the police business,'' Mahathir reportedly said.
	   Soon after Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest following a mammoth public
rally demanding Mahathir's resignation, police warned Azizah she
would face the same fate if she led the campaign her husband
started.
	   She drove up to a street protest for the first time Saturday,
waving at the slogan-shouting demonstrators and shaking hands with
many of them.
	   Azizah said Wednesday the prime minister seemed to be directing
his wrath toward her.
	   ``I implore Dr. Mahathir to be more responsible and not be so
arrogant,'' she said, denying that she had joined the protest. She
had driven to the demonstration out of curiosity, she said.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli declined to give an assurance
in Parliament on Wednesday that Azizah would not be arrested under
the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention
without trial. The ISA was used against Anwar and many of his
allies.
	   The law would be used only against those who threaten public
security and national stability, the minister said.
	   Of the nearly two dozen people arrested under the ISA in recent
weeks, four are still in jail and will remain there until they
renounce the street protests, Tajol Rosli said.
	   Many of those arrested have come out of prison and made public
statements saying they were not part of the anti-government
campaign.
	   The campaign began after Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2. The
two had differed over economic policy, but Mahathir said he had
acted because Anwar was morally unfit to lead. Anwar since has been
charged with sexual misconduct and corruption _ charges he says are
false and politically motivated.
	   On Wednesday, the government warned the editor of an opposition
newspaper, which has increased its circulation since the pro-Anwar
campaign began, not to sell at newsstands.
	   The editor of the publication run by the Parti Islam SeMalaysia,
or PAS, was summoned to the Home Ministry to explain why the party
newsletter was being sold publicly as a daily newspaper, an
official said. He did not say when the editor was called in.
	   The Harakah daily and other fringe publications by opposition
activists on the Internet have become increasingly popular among
Malaysians jaded by pro-government coverage in the nation's major
newspapers.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 100 Serbian journalists
held a protest march Wednesday through downtown Belgrade and
appealed to U.S. diplomats to help gain the release of their two
colleagues missing in Kosovo.
	   Two Serbian journalists working for the state-run Tanjug news
agency went missing Sunday while on assignment in Kosovo province,
where fighting between government troops and ethnic Albanian rebels
recently subsided due to U.S.-led peace efforts.
	   Counting on American influence on the ethnic Albanians, the
protesters handed a petition to an unidentified diplomat at the
U.S. Embassy, appealing for help from Washington ``as guarantor of
peace in this region.''
	   No one has claimed responsibility for abducting the missing
reporters, Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricic, but the
protesters firmly believe that the ethnic Albanian guerrillas took
them them.
	   ``We demand that human rights be respected first of all,'' said
protest organizer Dragan Micic, adding that two other Serbian
journalists who disappeared in Kosovo last month are also still
unaccounted for.

Taiwan's Nationalists gain kudos for China talks, gains unclear

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalists gained praise
over talks with China, but it may not help much in upcoming
elections because real results were sparse and voters might be more
concerned about domestic problems, analysts said Wednesday.
	   Taiwan's envoy Koo Chen-fu has just returned from his first
face-to-face talks with Chinese officials in three years, and most
Taiwanese are supportive, although political observers are raising
questions about the timing and the ultimate impact at the polls.

achieved a lot even if it was largely symbolic,'' said Joseph Wu,
an associate research fellow at Taipei's Institute of International
Relations. ``But China ties have never been a major issue at this
level of elections.''
	   President Lee Teng-hui is set to remain in power for another 18
months, but Taiwan's voters go to the polls Dec. 5 to choose the
national legislature and mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung, along with
their councils.
	   Some experts wonder whether China agreed to the talks in Beijing
_ less than two months before Taiwan's Dec. 5 elections _ just in
time to give an electoral boost to the Nationalists.
	   They are facing serious political problems among an electorate
weary of corruption, crime and economic woes, but the talks with
top Chinese officials increased their public stature _ at least in
the short run.
	   Any help for the Nationalists could prove harmful in the
election to Taiwan's main opposition group, the Democratic
Progressive Party, made up of more confrontational politicians who
favor formal and permanent independence from China.
	   The Nationalists insist on maintaining sovereignty but continue
to remain open to the idea of reunification after democracy comes
to the mainland.
	   The election may be too far away to read much into polls, but a
survey taken early this week showed the Nationalists gaining the
support of 42 percent of the voters _ backing similar to the number
of seats they now hold in the legislature.
	   The DPP got support from just 9 percent of the 1,105 survey
respondents, compared with their control of about 30 percent of the
legislative seats. The Gallup poll, conducted for the Far Eastern
Economic Review and released Wednesday, had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Belarusian President Lukashenko visits Siberia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with comments by Lukashenko, Belarusian
ambassador. Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko began a
three-day tour of Russia's Siberian regions Wednesday for talks on
trade in coal and wheat, and a game of hockey, news reports said.
	   Lukashenko, an autocratic leader nostalgic for the Soviet Union,
has said he wants to expand direct ties with individual regions in
Russia to accelerate economic integration between the two
countries.
	   The two Slavic neighbors signed a union treaty in April 1997,
but stopped short of creating a single state.
	   Lukashenko said Wednesday that if the union is efficient, the
third Slavic former Soviet republic, Ukraine, ``will join
tomorrow.''
	   The three countries would be able to ``alter the geo-political
situation in the world,'' the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
	   Ukraine, however, has not indicated it is considering any such
move.
	   Lukashenko is to sign an agreement on trade, economic,
scientific and cultural cooperation with the Omsk region, about
2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) east of Moscow, where he arrived
Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Belarus is offering to restart the production of Kvarts
television sets at an Omsk plant, which has been virtually idled in
recent years, Belarusian Ambassador Russia Vladimir Grigoryev said,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Grigoryev said Russia's eight television plants produced only
8,000 sets last year, while Belarus' two television plants produced
700,000 sets.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, and the government tightly controls industry.
	   Belarus wants to supply trolley-buses, shoes, knit-wear and
furniture to Siberia in exchange for tires, An-3 and An-74
airplanes, aircraft engines, communication equipment and farm
machinery, Grigoryev said.
	   Echoing his president, Grigoryev said that direct cooperation
with regions is the best way to restore ``the single homeland and
erstwhile might,'' ITAR-Tass reported.

	   ``In 1999, the international crisis will take a toll, albeit
limited,'' the EU said in a statement. ``With the renewed pickup of
growth and trade at the world level in 2000, there is again hope
for a reacceleration of economic expansion in the EU.''
	   The EU economy will remain sheltered from the worst of the
international turbulence this year, and grow 2.9 percent, the
highest rate this decade, the EU said.

	   Assuming the world economy bounces back in 2000, the EU said its

	   ROME (AP) _ Alberto Tomba, who announced the end of his
remarkable skiing career earlier this month, called Wednesday for
more out-of-competition drug testing.
	   There should be ``more tests ... even during the periods when
there aren't races,'' Tomba said at a news conference promoting his
acting debut in a made-for-television film.
	   The five-time Olympic medalst also suggested that officials
should rely on blood samples rather than urine to catch drug

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than six
months, with little sign of early progress.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made the proposal for a
``humanitarian corridor'' across the line of North-South
demarcation to ease distribution of humanitarian aid.
	   Jacob Kellenberger, a senior Swiss foreign ministry official,
also proposed there should be a ``continent-wide security
dialogue'' in Asia _ similar to the Organization for Cooperation
and Security in Europe.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   ``I will do my utmost to move forward in this session both as
the representative of the Republic of Korea and as the chairman of
the session,'' Park said.
	   Emerging at the end of the morning session, Park said it had
proceeded smoothly. He did not elaborate.
	   The meeting groups South and North Korea, the United States and
China. Each side takes it in turns to chair the talks. The current
session is meant to last the rest of the week.
	   Park and the other three delegation leaders _ North Korea's Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, U.S. ambassador at large Charles
Kartman and Chinese ambassador Qian Yong Nian _ seemed in a jovial
mood as they smiled for the cameras.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North North Korea reiterated its demands that pulling
U.S. troops out of South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the
United States should form the main agenda.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and March, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However,
Seoul doesn't want it to be a formal agenda item.
	   And the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang,
excluding Seoul. Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty
should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   After the talks broke down in March, Pyongyang said the United
States was to blame. It only agreed to resume the negotiations as
part of a package deal with Washington last month.
	   South Korean diplomats said their delegation would propose the
talks take place every three months.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly
2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   ``I would like to take this opportunity to launch the idea of a
humanitarian corridor across the line of demarcation, the aim of
which would be to facilitate the direct distribution of
humanitarian aid to North Korea,'' said Switzerland's Kellenberger
in an opening statement.
	   He said such a scheme would offer logistical support to relief
goods passing from South to North through the border village of
Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

Four Jordanians killed in 1967 war to be buried with military
</HEADLINE>
honors

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The remains of four Jordanian soldiers
killed in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War will be buried in the West Bank
on Oct. 27 with full military honors in a ceremony by the Jordanian
armed forces.
	   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad said Wednesday the remains
of the four were uncovered during archaeological excavations in the
eastern part of Jerusalem.
	   ``The four bodies have been identified as bodies of four
Jordanian soldiers,'' Gilad said.
	   He declined to give details, but he stressed that it was
determined ``without any reasonable doubt'' that the remains were
of Jordanian soldiers who fought against Israel in the Six Day War
that began June 5, 1967.
	   The names of the four dead have not been released, though the
bodies have apparently been identified. The Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty of 1994 allows for the exchange of soldiers' remains by the
two countries.
	   Jordan's information minister, Nasser Judeh, was quoted in a
Jordanian newspaper as saying the four will be buried in a cemetery
in the village of Nabi Samuel northwest of Jerusalem.
	   He said the ceremony by a Jordanian army unit is in honor of the
soldiers ``and the blood they shed in the battle for Jerusalem.''
	   Jordan ruled Arab east Jerusalem along with the West Bank for 17
years ending with Israel's seizure of the territories in the 1967
war.
	   Jordan lost more than 6,000 dead in the fighting, and about 770
Israelis were killed.
	   In 1988, Jordan renounced administrative and legal links to the
West Bank and Jerusalem, but maintained custodianship of Muslim
shrines in the holy city. Jordan's King Hussein is a descendent of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Russia and Tajikistan will change
the way they guard the former Soviet border with Afghanistan only
if events in Afghanistan warrant it, a Tajik official said
Wednesday.
	   If the situation in Afghanistan changes, Russian and Tajik
troops will respond, Col.-Gen. Konstantin Totsky, director of
Russia's Federal Border Service, said after meeting with Tajik
President Emomaly Rakhmonov, according to Rakhmonov's press
secretary Zafar Saidov.
	   Russia maintains 20,000 border guards along Tajikistan's border
with Afghanistan, mainly to block heroin traffickers and any
spillover of violence.
	   Meanwhile, the ITAR-Tass news agency said there were three
attempts to cross the Tajik-Afghan border illegally on Tuesday. One
person was killed by border guards who had first fired warning
shots, ITAR-Tass said.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Thousands of villagers were evacuated
in the central Philippines Wednesday as a powerful typhoon began
battering the coast with driving rain and winds reaching 235 kph
(147 mph).
	   Typhoon Babs was centered 55 kilometers (35 miles) east of
Catanduanes Island, 360 kilometers (225 miles) southwest of Manila,
and was expected to move overland late Wednesday, weather
forecaster Susan Dampog said.
	   The typhoon came only a week after parts of the northern
Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least
74 people in the country.
	   Babs was already bringing heavy rains and surging waves
Wednesday, forcing a halt to ferry service at several ports in
Albay and Sorsogon provinces and stranding more than 2,000
passengers, said disaster official Jason Aragon.
	   Severe typhoon warnings were in effect for parts of the central
Philippines, and officials cut electricity to Catanduanes and
portions of Albay province to prevent electrocutions, Aragon said.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of rivers overflowing and
landslides, he said. Authorities lost contact with many remote
areas because of downed telephone lines and were calling on amateur
radio operators for help.
	   Congressman Francis Joseph Escudero of Sorsogon said thousands
of people were evacuated from several coastal villages and taken to
temporary shelters.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   In Manila, military rescue units, including air force
helicopters and navy vessels, were on standby.
	   Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this season, had
sustained winds of 195 kph (122 mph) and gusts of up to 235 kph
(147 mph), Dampog said.
	   Typhoon Zeb struck last week. In addition to the 74 deaths, 129
people were injured and 37 were missing in the storm. About 415,000
Filipinos fled their homes at the height of the typhoon.
	   Zeb then struck Taiwan, killing 31 people and injuring 19,
before cutting across Japan, where it killed at least 12 people.

Alleged knife-throwing incident under investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from Wisla spokesman disputing it was knife;
adds details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish club Wisla Krakow on Wednesday
disputed claims by Parma player Dino Baggio that he was struck by a
knife thrown from the stands in a UEFA Cup match.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of Tuesday's UEFA Cup
second-round match, first-leg tie _ a 1-1 draw at Wisla _ by an
object that Baggio said was a knife.
	   ``I felt a blow to my head, then I saw a knife on the ground and
I realized that that was what had hit me,'' Baggio told the sports
daily Corriere dello Sport.
	   ``I can't believe there are people who come to stadiums with
knives,'' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I only just missed it but
thinking back to it gives me the shivers. Just think what would
have happened if it had got me in the eye.''
	   However, Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr, disputed Baggio's claim
and said police were questioning players and fans about the
incident.
	   ``Nobody has seen anything like that, including the referees,
the UEFA observers, Krakow or Parma officials,'' he said Wednesday.
	   ``We are not saying that Baggio is lying, but in our opinion it
could not have been a knife.''
	   He suggested Baggio was hit by a stone hurled by fans. Italian
reports initially identified the object as a flick knife.
	   Bobr questioned why _ if a knife were involved _ the incident
wasn't reported immediately after it happened. He said Parma
officials waited until after the match to inform UEFA officials. He
said they did not bring it up during a post-game news conference
	   He said Wilsa expressed regret to Parma over the incident but
suggested the Italians could be trying to divert attention from
their 1-1 draw against the underdog Poles.
	   ``This is certainly not a success for Parma,'' he said.
	   Poland's largest circulation newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta said two
Wisla players suggested that Baggio was hit with some ``small metal
object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife.
	   The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr
_ after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck
by an unidentified object.
	   In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said no action was
planned until a match report was in hand. He said the matter would
be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting in November.
	   ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' Gonnella
said.

EU presidency says leaders must renew efforts to reform union

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rosy economic forecast for 1998; TRIMS pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ When they meet this weekend, the EU
leaders must signal their single currency is not the end of the
line but vow to pursue reforms enabling newcomers to join the
European Union, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said Wednesday.
	   Klima, whose country holds the EU presidency, said the leaders
must show to have a firm hand on the rudder at a time of financial
crises elsewhere when they launch the euro Jan. 1 even as EU
governments are shift leftward.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's incoming social democratic
chancellor, will join the talks Saturday, but not Sunday, at a
lakeside hotel in Poertschach, an alpine resort in southern
Austria.
	   On Wednesday, the European Commission gave the leaders something
to cheer about: forecasts showing economic growth will remain
strong in 1998-2000, ``driven essentially by internal consumption
and investment.''
	   ``In 1998, EU growth is expected to be 2.9 percent, slightly
above the spring forecasts'' despite financial turmoil in Asia and
Russia, EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said.
	   Yet, citing the ``marked deterioration'' in Asia and Russia, he
cut his growth prediction for 1999 to 2.4 percent, down from 3
percent forecast last March. ``EU growth should pick up again to
2.8 percent in 2000,'' he added.
	   In a State of a the Union address to the European Parliament
here, Klima stressed the EU leaders must not feel too comfortable
about the economic outlook but press ahead with reforms to make EU
enlargement possible.
	   He said nothing about the emergence of a more liberal government
in Bonn and its effect on monetary policy.
	   Schroeder has answered calls at home for greater political
control over monetary policy by picking Lafontaine, an old-style
leftist, as finance minister. Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl
championed an ECB free from political meddling.
	   Ursula Stenzel, a German Christian Democratic member of the EU
assembly, urged Klima to invite Lafontaine to Poertschach ``so he
can tell who will run the European Central Bank (and) give signal
of a sustained, sound monetary policy'' in Germany.
	   Another new face in Poertschach will be Massimo D'Alema, an
ex-communist, who has formed a coalition government in Italy that
runs the gamut from Marxist hardliners to center-right Christian
Democrats.
	   With the imminent launch of the euro, Klima said the EU leaders
will meet this weekend at a time when the EU ``can be seen as a
pole of stability in the international monetary system.''
	   Yet he and European Commission President Jacques Santer said the
leaders must recommit to completing sensitive reforms of EU
institutions and finances needed if Cyprus and a dozen East
European nations are to join in the decade ahead.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the (EU's) journey.''
	   The EU governments disagree about making the EU budget _ worth
about dlrs 100 billion this year _ fairer to all. Germany, the
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden insisting on a new funding formula
complaining they pay far more to the EU than they get back in
benefits. But Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain which are net
beneficiaries are wary of tinkering with the budget for fear of
losing income.
	   Also left unresolved have been negotiations on a new power
sharing arrangement within the EU by ``re-weighting'' votes for big
and small countries.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Coastguards launched a rescue operation Wednesday
after a Dutch sailing ship with 52 people on board ran aground off
the southern English port of Newhaven.
	   Authorities said a total of 38 people had been rescued, many of
them winched to safety by helicopter from the Eendracht, a training
ship. Some essential crew members remained on board, and a lifeboat
and tug were on standby.
	   Several people suffered minor injuries during the rescue
operation and were taken to hospital, authorities said.
	   The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the coastal weather was
rough, with heavy winds.

Popular Dutch poet Vasalis is dead at 89
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch poet Vasalis, whose lucid
style and poignant commentary on everyday life made her one of the
Netherlands' most popular poets, has died. She was 89.
	   Vasalis, whose real name was Margaretha Droogleever
Fortuyn-Leenmans, died Oct. 16 in her hometown of Roden in the
northern Netherlands, a spokeswoman for her publisher Van Oorschot
said Wednesday.
	   The cause of death was not disclosed, said spokeswoman Gamma
Nefkens.
	   Vasalis' work comprises about 100 poems depicting the endeavors
and emotions of everyday life such as pain, grief, love and death.
Among her books are ``Parks and Deserts,'' published in 1940, and
``The Bird Phoenix'' in 1947.
	   ``Her poems are not very difficult to understand. She didn't use
difficult words,'' Nefkens said.
	   ``That direct, that instant understanding and poignancy is a
quality of Vasalis' verses which characterize most of the poems in
her three collections,'' the daily De Volkskrant wrote in a
tribute.
	   Some of her poems also have been translated into English and
published in literary magazines.
	   In 1982, she won the P.C. Hooft Prize, the Netherlands' top
literary award.
	   She was buried on Tuesday in Amstelveen, a town just outside
Amsterdam. Family details were not released.

Indonesian currency climbs, Cabinet minister warns it could hurt
</HEADLINE>
exports &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian currency surged 8.7
percent against the dollar Wednesday, prompting the chief economics
minister to warn that a stronger rupiah could hurt exports.
	   After months of desperate efforts to revive the weak rupiah, it
was unusual for the government to fret that the currency might
climb too far. Indonesia's economy has been battered by the worst
financial crisis in decades.
	   Officials hope the export sector, which includes textiles and
manufacturing, will haul the country out of economic ruin. But if
the rupiah gains more ground against other currencies, it would
make those products more pricey for foreign buyers.
	   ``If the rupiah strengthens too much, then our products won't be
competitive,'' said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the Cabinet minister in
charge of Indonesia's economic reform program.
	   Dealers said the rupiah rose because of orders to sell dollars
by hedge funds in offshore markets. State banks have also joined in
the selling, but structural problems remain in the economy and it
is unclear whether the rupiah surge can be sustained.
	   The rupiah, which has lost as much as 80 percent of its value
since the Asian currencies began tumbling last year, has also been
bolstered by the rising Japanese yen.
	   The rupiah rose from more than 10,000 against the dollar in late
September to 7,175 at the close of Jakarta trading Wednesday. It is
still far from its pre-crisis high of 2,500.
	   On Wednesday, President B.J. Habibie urged exporters to work
harder to provide high-quality goods and seek out new markets, and
said Indonesia was turning the corner in the crisis.
	   ``Indonesians have to be grateful that in the last few weeks the
national currency has begun to strengthen, while the supply and
distribution of essential goods have in stages been overcome, with
prices tending to decrease,'' Habibie said.
	   One factor that could hurt the rupiah is the political
uncertainty surrounding Habibie's efforts to implement democracy in
the wake of the May ouster of his authoritarian predecessor,
Suharto. Protests and riots over price rises have been frequent.
	   Local newspapers said the Association of Indonesian Airlines may
scrap a plan to raise domestic airfares by 14.5 percent in December
if the rupiah maintains its strength.
	   The Jakarta Post cited the association's secretary-general,
Benny Rungkat, as saying that the increase is under review.

British team leads emergency repairs at Herod's Masada palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Conservationists led by a British team are
doing emergency repairs on one of Israel's best-known
archaeological sites, King Herod's Masada palace.
	   The location of the 2000-year-old palace on a desert mountaintop
near the Dead Sea makes it vulnerable to wind, sand, water and
salt, Mazy Magnazi, a spokeswoman for Israel's Nature Reserves
Authority, said Wednesday.
	   The conservationists are trying to combat the effects of the
weather on the soft limestone. Many of the stones have been
hollowed out by the weather and some have collapsed, Magnazi said.
	   Rather than replacing the stones, the conservationists are
trying to maintain the original facade of the palace by filling in
the damaged stones with slices of similar limestones.
	   The British team will leave Israel on Saturday, and an Israeli
team will continue the repairs, Magnazi said.
	   Frescoes, decorative plaster work and Herod's private bathhouse
_ which is in danger of sliding off the eastern edge of the cliff _
are also slated for emergency repairs.
	   Masada was the last outpost of zealots during the Jewish revolt
against Rome that began in A.D. 66. The zealots held off Roman
legions for three years and committed mass suicide to avoid
enslavement.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with report no ransom paid for recent
releases, predictions that Britons and New Zealanders be released
soon. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No ransom was paid for any of the more than two
dozen hostages recently freed from secessionist Chechnya, the
Russian financier who helped secure their release said Wednesday.
	   Boris Berezovsky said that he and others have been sending
humanitarian and medical aid, computers and school textbooks to
Chechnya, and in return, senior Chechen officials have put more
emphasis on identifying and locating kidnappers.
	   Kidnappers have taken hundreds of people hostage in Chechnya and
surrounding areas, usually for ransom, since the region's two-year
war for independence ended in 1996.
	   About 100 people are still held, including three Britons, a New
Zealander and a Turk.
	   A number of hostages have been freed recently, including 24
Russian soldiers and an English couple. A Russian army soldier was
released Wednesday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Most of the releases have been facilitated through the help of
Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky said the release of hostages ``is a very complex
issue,'' Interfax said.
	   ``I and other people who are really interested in stabilizing
the situation in Chechnya have been providing various humanitarian
assistance to the republic, sending computers and textbooks to
schools, ensuring medical care for Chechen children, sending
doctors and medicines,'' Berezovsky said.
	   ``This has been taken into account. (Chechen officials) are
trying to return the favor in this difficult situation.''
	   Berezovsky said he believes in the Chechen government's resolve
to end kidnappings in the region, ``but I know that there is a long
distance between promises and abilities.''
	   The first deputy director of Chechnya's National Security
Service predicted Wednesday that the three Britons and a New
Zealander kidnapped on Oct. 3 would soon be released, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Ismail Dadugalov said the number of suspects believed to be
involved in the kidnapping has been narrowed due to the efforts of
Chechen police and the Chechentelekom company for which the
foreigners were working.
	   They were installing telephone line across Chechnya under a
contract with Granger Telecom, a British telephone company.

Group launches broadside against homosexuals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Private citizens on Wednesday
launched Malaysia's first organized attack against gays by
demanding stiffer legislation against homosexuality.
	   The launch of the anti-gay movement came two weeks before the
scheduled trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
faces 10 charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister on Sept. 2, calling him ``immoral'' and unfit to
rule Muslim-dominated Malaysia, where homosexual acts are banned.
Anwar says the charges are false and politically motivated.
	   ``Sodomy is absolutely despicable,'' Tamrin Tun Ghafar, deputy
chairman of the Anti-Homosexual Volunteers' Movement, told a news
conference. ``The people of Malaysia must be shielded from such a
disgusting practice.''
	   To stamp out homosexuality, the fledgling committee of lawyers,
teachers and businessmen said they would call for the government to
legislate stiffer laws against homosexual behavior and to crack
down on transvestites, gays and lesbians found loitering in public
places.
	   They also plan to mobilize volunteer groups to counter
homosexuality through road rallies and religious speeches.
	   Other measures include T-shirts and lapel pins calling for
Malaysians to shun sodomy, said Tamrin, a businessman and former
member of Parliament. The group also intends to supervise the
construction of boys' toilets in boarding schools to prevent them
from having sex with other boys.
	   The group said it feared immoral Western practices were seeping
into Malaysian culture.
	   ``You don't want to see your brother going to church to marry
another man,'' said Tamrin. ``Despite laws against it, homosexual
acts have become a widespread social disease. If left alone, it
will fester and become serious, like smoking marijuana.''
	   The group didn't provide any estimates of the number of
homosexuals in Malaysia, where 60 percent of the 22 million people
are Malays who follow Islam.

EU forecasts international turmoil will slow 1999 growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous. EDITS quote in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union economy will expand
slower than expected next year because of the world financial
turmoil, but growth will remain robust this year and recover in
2000, according to an EU forecast Wednesday.
	   The EU said the economy of the 15-nation bloc would expand 2.4
percent next year, down from the 3 percent predicted in the union's
last economic forecast released in March.
	   ``In 1999, the international crisis will take a toll, albeit
limited,'' the EU said in a statement. Assuming trade and economic
growth increase in 2000, the EU predicts an increase in its
economic expansion.
	   The EU economy will remain sheltered from the worst of the
international turbulence this year, and grow 2.9 percent, the
highest rate this decade, the EU said.
	   Assuming the world economy bounces back in 2000, the EU said its
economic growth should recover to 2.8 percent.
	   ``The overall picture is favorable. Economic growth in the EU is
expected to remain strong over the period 1998-2000, driven
essentially by internal consumption and investment,'' the report
said.
	   The forecast showed Europe's stubbornly high unemployment rate
falling slightly faster than predicted in March. The jobless rate
is forecast at 9.5 percent next year, dipping below 10 percent for
the first time in the 1990s.
	   Despite the slowdown seen next year, the report from the EU's
executive body, the European Commission, remained upbeat.
	   ``The main message is that the EU economy is sound, although not
isolated from the effects of economic instability in other parts of
the world, particularly Asia and Russia,'' the Commission said.
	   Tough budgetary policies imposed in recent years to prepare for
the launch next Jan. 1 of the euro as the common currency of 11 EU
nations helped protect the bloc from international economic woes.
	   ``The euro zone forms an island of stability.''
	   However the glitch seen next year is likely to increase calls
for European nations to boost their economies by increasing
investment or cutting interest rates. EU leaders are expected to
discuss their response to the global turmoil at a summit this
weekend in the Austrian lakeside resort of Poertschach.
	   The EU report pointed out that interest rates were already at
record low levels and that inflation, at 1.6 percent this year and
predicted at 1.7 percent in 1999, is ``historically low.''
	   Among the 11 nations that plan to switch to the euro on New
Year's Day, growth is seen at 3 percent this year slowing to 2.6
percent in 1999.
	   In Germany, the EU's largest economy, growth is expected to peak
at 2.8 percent this year then dip to 2.2 percent in 1999 and 2.6
percent in 2000.
	   Ireland is set to remain the EU's fastest-expanding economy with
growth at 11.4 percent this year, almost four-times the EU average,
and slowing to 8.2 percent next year.

Dutch airline arms crew against unruly passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ As the number of unruly passengers
on flights rises, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is fighting back _
nicely.
	   On Wednesday, the airline began training its 11,000 crew members
who work with the public to calmly handle passengers who become
belligerent, hostile or violent on the ground or in the air.
	   ``We noticed that unruly passengers have been increasing in the
last couple of years,'' said KLM spokesman Youssef Eddini. ``It's
an increasing issue for the international air industry.''
	   During KLM's ``Dealing with Aggression'' classes _ one day for
ground employees, two days for flight attendants _ actors
demonstrate responses to passengers who disobey crew orders. The
skits cover techniques ranging from a polite refusal to serve
alcohol to handcuffing.
	   KLM, which carries 15 million passengers a year, encounters
about 100 unruly passengers a month, Eddini said. Alcohol, which is
complimentary on many flights, is the main cause of rowdiness, he
said.
	   But problems occasionally become more serious when passengers
threaten flight attendants with physical violence. Last year, 10
passengers had to be handcuffed, Eddini said.
	   Last March, a man had to be physically restrained on a KLM
flight when he tried to force his way into the cockpit as the plane
tried to land, forcing the pilot to abort the landing.
	   ``Aggression is a problem in society,'' Eddini said, ``and the
increase in aggression affects the airline industry.''

EU forecasts international turmoil will slow 1999 growth

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union economy will expand
slower than expected next year because of the world financial
turmoil, but growth will remain robust this year and recover in
2000, the EU forecast Wednesday.
	   The EU's said the economy of the 15-nation bloc would expand 2.4
percent next year, down from the 3 percent predicted in the Union's
last economic forecast released in March.
	   ``In 1999, the international crisis will take a toll, albeit
limited,'' the EU said in a statement. ``With the renewed pick up
of growth and trade at the world level in 2000, there is again
scope for a reacceleration of economic expansion in the EU.''
	   The EU economy will remain sheltered from the worst of the
international turbulence this year, and grow 2.9 percent, the
highest rate this decade, the EU said.
	   Assuming the world economy bounces back in 2000, the EU said its
economic growth should then recover to 2.8 percent.
	   ``The overall picture is favorable. Economic growth in the EU is
expected to remain strong over the period 1998-2000, driven
essentially by internal consumption and investment,'' the EU's
report said.
	   The forecast showed Europe's stubbornly high unemployment

	   It said tough budgetary policies imposed in recent years to

	   ``The euro zone forms an island of stability.''
	   However the glitch seen next year is likely to increase calls

U.N. envoy visits troubled East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ An envoy of the United Nations arrived
Wednesday in disputed East Timor for talks with government
officials and prominent opposition figures, including Nobel
laureate Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   Samuel Tamrath, an Eritrean diplomat, met first with Gov. Abilio
Jose Osorio Soares to discuss ways of bringing peace to the former
Portuguese colony. Indonesia invaded in 1975 and has been trying to
quell separatist guerrillas ever since.
	   Espedito Ximenes, a spokesman for Soares, said Tamrath's visit
was prompted by media reports that Indonesian troops have stepped
up operations against rebels in the half-island territory.
	   ``These reports were not true, they were baseless,'' Ximenes
quoted Soares as telling the U.N. envoy.
	   Indonesia recently withdrew 1,000 troops from East Timor in a
highly publicized event designed to show it was serious about peace
in the territory. President B.J. Habibie has eased his hold on East
Timor since the resignation of his authoritarian predecessor,
Suharto.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976. The United Nations,
however, does not recognize Indonesian rule, and still considers
Portugal the administrative power.
	   The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between Portugal
and Indonesia, while President Habibie has offered autonomy to the
territory in exchange for recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty.

Israeli security tried to recruit assailant as double agent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Hamas activist who hurled hand grenades at
Israeli soldiers earlier this week was asked shortly before the
attack to become an informer for Israel's Shin Bet security
service, Israeli newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The dailies cited unidentified Shin Bet officials who confirmed
earlier Palestinian claims that the Hamas activist, 29-year-old
Salem Rajab Sarsour, was a double agent. The officials said the
recruiting plan did not go beyond the initial stages.
	   The Palestinians' West Bank security chief, Jibril Rajoub,
charged that by approaching Sarsour, the Shin Bet was indirectly
responsible for Monday's hand grenade attack in in the southern
Israeli town of Beersheba in which 64 Israelis were wounded.
	   Rajoub suggested that Sarsour carried out the attack because he
wanted to clear himself of suspicions that he collaborated with
Israel. ``There are documents and evidence that his (Sarsour's)
response to the attempt to recruit him was to throw grenades and
carry out terrorist attacks,'' Rajoub told Israel army radio.
	   The new reports may prove embarrassing to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu who said the Beersheba attack furnished more
proof that the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to fight
Islamic militants and prevent attacks in Israel.
	   Israel's security demands are a key issue in the weeklong
Mideast summit talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Sarsour, a father of five from the West Bank town of Hebron, was
arrested on Monday morning at the scene of the grenade attack.
	   The army said Sarsour also confessed to his interrogators that
he killed an elderly rabbi, Shlomo Raanan, in Hebron on Aug. 20 and
that he hurled hand grenades at Israeli troops in the city on Sept.
30. In that attack, two dozen Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were injured.
	   The Maariv daily quoted senior Shin Bet officials as saying that
at the end of September, before the Hebron grenade attack, an agent
met with Sarsour in hopes of recruiting him as an informer. Maariv
said Sarsour told the agent that collaboration ``could be a good
idea'' and agreed to meet with the agent again.
	   At the time, security officials thought Sarsour was a minor
Hamas activist and were unaware he had killed Rabbi Ranaan, Maariv
said.
	   Maariv had the most detailed account, but the Haaretz daily also
quoted unidentified Shin Bet agents as saying there were attempts
to recruit Sarsour as an informer.

Philippine president won't apologize to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippine lawmakers approving resolution backing
Estrada's stand on Anwar, grafs 16-17 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada will not
apologize to Malaysia for his criticisms of the treatment of that
nation's ousted deputy prime minister, an official said Wednesday.
	   Malaysian protesters demonstrated in front of the Philippine
Embassy in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday, demanding that Estrada apologize
for allegedly meddling in their country's domestic affairs.
	   Asked if the Philippine leader was considering an apology,
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said, ``The president had
already said his piece. There is nothing more that needs to be
explained.''
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have both spoken
out against the arrest and treatment in jail of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Estrada has described Anwar as a personal
friend.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, 51, as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2
after the two differed on economic policy. Anwar began rallying
opposition to Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared at
court hearings with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace, saying
he was beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Estrada initially said he was considering boycotting a summit in
Malaysia next month of leaders of countries belonging to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to protest Anwar's
treatment. He later announced he would attend.
	   Estrada said Tuesday he has decided to reduce his criticism of
Malaysia on the advice of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   ``I have to follow the advice of the president, to go slow, and
we have to be friendly with Malaysia,'' Estrada said. ``I've
expressed my feelings and that's enough.''
	   Malaysia also clarified that it postponed a defense meeting with
the Philippines scheduled this month because of financial and time
constraints and not because of the rift over Anwar, Barican said.
	   Malaysia's defense ministry has reset the meeting in the
Philippines to Nov. 8-10, Barican said.
	   A serious rift between Malaysia and the Philippines, both
founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
could destroy harmony in the grouping at a time when it is trying
to work cohesively to overcome Asia's financial turmoil.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos also work in Malaysia, which
is an important trading partner of the Philippines.
	   Estrada, however, stressed he would continue advocating that
Anwar be accorded due process of law and be treated humanely.
	   ``I'm not wavering in my position that the former deputy prime
minister should be given due process,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   On Wednesday, a Philippine congressional committee approved a
resolution backing Estrada's concern over Anwar.
	   Congresswoman Lualhati Antonino, who heads the House of
Representatives' committee on foreign affairs, said it is also
asking the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs to assist 14
Filipino lawmakers planning to observe Anwar's trial in Malaysia,
which starts next month.

Music division posts sharp gain, but film division slipping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PolyGram NV's third-quarter net
profit soared 95 percent on strong growth in its music division,
but the Dutch entertainment group said Wednesday its film section
continued to slip.
	   PolyGram's Chief Executive Officer Jan Cook also said the sale
of the company to Canada's Seagram Co. has received approval from
U.S. regulatory authorities, and is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter of this year.
	   Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled 166
million guilders (dlrs 90 million), up from 85 million guilders
(dlrs 46 million) in the same period a year ago, PolyGram said.
	   In its music division, PolyGram posted a sharp third-quarter
operating profit rise of 44 percent to 248 million guilders (dlrs
135 million), up from 172 million guilders (dlrs 93 million) in the
year-ago period.
	   The company attributed the increase to stronger international
and local releases, lower marketing costs and restructuring.
	   PolyGram's shares jumped on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on news
of the strong earnings and were trading up 5.7 percent at midday.
	   The company's best-selling album came from Sheryl Crow, whose
release `` The Globe Sessions'' has sold 1.5 million copies. For
the remainder of 1998, Polygram's music highlights will include
releases from Bryan Adams and Metallica and greatest hits albums
from U2 and Dire Straits.
	   Blaming ``higher provisions'' for non-performing films, PolyGram
said operating loss at its film division swelled to 77 million
guilders (dlrs 42 million) from 42 million guilders (dlrs 23
million) in the third quarter of 1997.
	   PolyGram added that while overall sales in trouble-ridden Asia
plunged 21 percent from the third quarter of 1997, the region has
remained profitable due to sustained profitability in Japan and
Taiwan.
	   In the film division, upcoming attractions include ``Very Bad
Things,'' starring Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz, and the
international release of ``Elizabeth'' and ``What Dreams May
Come.''
	   Premieres slated for 1999 include ``The Green Mile,'' starring
Tom Hanks, and ``Notting Hill'' which showcases Julia Roberts and
Hugh Grant.

Dutch airline arms crew against unruly passengers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES reference in 2nd graf to classes beginning Wednesday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ As the number of unruly passengers
on flights rises, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is fighting back _
nicely.
	   The airline said Wednesday it has begun training its 11,000 crew
members who work with the public to calmly handle passengers who
become belligerent, hostile or violent on the ground or in the air.
	   ``We noticed that unruly passengers have been increasing in the
last couple of years,'' said KLM spokesman Youssef Eddini. ``It's
an increasing issue for the international air industry.''
	   During KLM's ``Dealing with Aggression'' classes _ one day for
ground employees, two days for flight attendants _ actors
demonstrate responses to passengers who disobey crew orders. The
skits cover techniques ranging from a polite refusal to serve
alcohol to handcuffing.
	   KLM, which carries 15 million passengers a year, encounters
about 100 unruly passengers a month, Eddini said. Alcohol, which is
complimentary on many flights, is the main cause of rowdiness, he
said.
	   But problems occasionally become more serious when passengers
threaten flight attendants with physical violence. Last year, 10
passengers had to be handcuffed, Eddini said.
	   Last March, a man had to be physically restrained on a KLM
flight when he tried to force his way into the cockpit as the plane
tried to land, forcing the pilot to abort the landing.
	   ``Aggression is a problem in society,'' Eddini said, ``and the
increase in aggression affects the airline industry.''

State radio: death toll in Nigeria blast rises to 700

details. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ The death toll in the weekend fire that
tore through this southern Nigerian town has reached 700 people,
state radio said Wednesday, while flames continued to shoot from
the charred site of the pipeline explosion.
	   The Lagos-based newspaper the Daily Express also said at least
700 people had died, quoting police officials who said there had
been some 200 deaths since the Saturday fireball.
	   Authorities say up to 1,000 people were trying to scavenge
gasoline spilling from the pipeline when the gasoline explosion.
	   At least 400 people have been buried in mass graves dug near the
scene of Saturday's explosion, authorities said.
	   Hospitals, most with few doctors and nurses and little medicine,
were overwhelmed by burn victims. With little in the way of burn
care, the future for many victims appeared extremely bleak.
	   ``Every home in this town of Jesse has lost either a friend, a
son, a daughter, a brother, a mother or a father,'' said Jacob
Emogho, a Jesse resident. ``No home has been left untouched.''
	   Adding to their woes, panicked family members pulled some of the
injured out of hospitals because they feared they may be arrested
for theft, medical workers said.
	   Hundreds were believed to be suffering from burns at home
without painkillers.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
in the weekend incident in Jesse, 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, one medical worker said
patients at a number of hospitals were withdrawn, particularly when
people heard that Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigeria's head of
state, was coming to visit Monday.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the blaze and were waiting
for the fire to burn itself out. But thousands of gallons of fuel
remained in the Jesse section of the pipeline, which runs nearly
600 kilometers (380 miles) from the southeastern city of Warri to
the northern city of Kaduna.
	   It is not clear what caused the blast. Government officials have
said they believe scavengers' tools set it off, while some news
reports have blamed the conflagration on a lit cigarette.
	   Abubakar said Monday that the government would pay for medical
care but no compensation would be paid to the families of the dead,
apparently because many were believed to be scavenging fuel.
	   In the southeastern Niger River delta region, an oil-rich area
scarred by poverty, scooping up buckets of gasoline from a spilling
pipeline could offer quick gains.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, but its
petroleum industry, crippled by corruption and mismanagement,
barely functions.
	   Most of the nation's refineries don't work and much of Nigeria's
gasoline is imported. Lineups at gas pumps can last days and black
market prices are often marked up 1,000 percent.
	   In other parts of southeastern Nigeria, ethnic Ijaw youths have
attacked Western oil installations in recent weeks, demanding oil
companies and the government supply them with schools, better roads
and political representation. The fire in Jesse, though, was not
believed related to those incidents.

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Martin O'Neill said Wednesday he's
staying at Leicester after the club offered him a new, lucrative
contract to stave off a bid by Leeds to land him.
	   O'Neill had been rumored going to Leeds ever since George Graham
left the team Sept. 30 for Tottenham, but Leicester chairmam John
Elsom countered with a new contract into 2002.
	   ``Mr. Elsom has offered me a substantially improved contract
that would take me to the year 2002. It would be ridiculous of me
not to sign it,'' O'Neill said Wednesday.
	   ``It's on the table. It may not be there after three successive
defeats but at least's it's there for the time being.''
	   ``I've decided to stay at Leicester City football club and I
made this decision myself. I spoke to John yesterday at great
length and his stance remained exactly the same.''
	   Elsom steadfastly denied O'Neill permission to talk with Leeds.
	   O'Neill said the crowd reaction after Leicester's 2-1 win Monday
over Tottenham was crucial.
	   ``Monday night's reaction of the crowd was very influential and
I have to say as well that the players played a part in that.''

Deutsche Welle announces expanded Serb-language programming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Reacting to a new Yugoslav law
forbidding foreign broadcasts in Yugoslavia, Germany's
government-run radio announced Wednesday it has extended its
Serbian-language broadcasts from 15 minutes to 120 minutes a day.
	   Deutsche Welle director Dieter Weirich called the curbs ``a
flagrant attack on the freedom of the media, information and
thought,'' which further isolate the Yugoslav regime.
	   The law passed Tuesday specifically prohibits Yugoslav media
from picking up reports produced abroad. Deutsche Welle, however,
broadcasts direct, via shortwave.
	   Outgoing Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel sharply criticized ``the
growing oppression of free reporting'' in Yugoslavia.
	   In a remark aimed at Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Kinkel said that whoever ``closes newspapers in his country and
silences the foreign press is showing that he has something to
hide.''

Hong Kong eases visa requirements for tourists from Japan, United
</HEADLINE>
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an apparent attempt to boost the badly hit
tourism industry, the government said Wednesday it would relax visa
requirements for citizens from several wealthy Western countries.
	   Visitors from Japan, the United States, Germany, Greece and
Finland can stay in Hong Kong visa-free for up to three months,
instead of just one, a government statement said.
	   Asia's protracted financial crisis has harmed the territory's
tourism business, as Hong Kong has become unaffordable for many
travelers in the region. The number of Japanese tourists, who used
to make up one-third of the total, is now down by half.
	   The Hong Kong dollar, which is linked to the U.S. dollar at a
fixed exchange rate, has maintained its value in recent months
while currencies elsewhere in the region have collapsed, creating
vacation bargains in many countries.
	   Even if some Western tourists can get into Hong Kong more
easily, the government announced it would cancel visa-free entry
arrangements for citizens from Angola, Nepal, Nigeria and Sierra
Leone.

Nasdaq may team up with Hong Kong stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Nasdaq has held preliminary talks with the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange about a possible alliance, even though Asia's
financial crisis has put a damper on public share listings in the
region, a top executive said Wednesday.
	   ``It's clear to us the future of the financial world is going to
be depending on better interconnection between the markets around
the world,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the
National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., parent of the U.S.
Nasdaq market.
	   Zarb told reporters that while Nasdaq is holding formal talks
with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany, its discussions with
the Hong Kong market are not nearly as far along.
	   Nasdaq now lists shares of 18 companies based in Hong Kong. Zarb
said many companies from Hong Kong and mainland China would do well
to have their shares listed in the United States as well as at
home, but the serious financial troubles in Asia are hindering the
process for now.
	   ``The turmoil in the region has virtually shut down the IPOs
(initial public offerings),'' Zarb said. ``Surely we are
disappointed. But once the turmoil is over, we expect they'll come
back more quickly than people think.''
	   Zarb would not elaborate about how a Hong Kong-Nasdaq alliance
might work.

Turkish Kurds faces terror-related charges in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense denying charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An alleged leader of the banned
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Germany went on trial Wednesday on
charges of participating in a terrorist organization and attempted
arson.
	   Halit Y., 41, who has been jailed since April, denied the
charges.
	   Prosecutors charge he directed arson attacks in southern Germany
against Turkish businesses and other targets after Kurdish
prisoners in Turkish jails went on a hunger strike in the summer of
1996.
	   He also is charged with fraud for allegedly collecting about
5,100 marks (dlrs 3,200) in German welfare while actually living in
Paris. Prosecutors say he used the money to support the PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for a homeland in
Kurdish-populated southeast Turkey. About 500,000 Kurds live in
Germany.

Parliamentary committee backs attempt to try Pinochet in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of Parliament's human rights committee
Wednesday backed an attempt by Amnesty International to have Gen.
Augusto Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on torture charges if
Chile's former dictator escapes extradition to Spain.
	   ``We should seize this chance to bring to justice one of the
most evil dictators alive,'' Ann Clwyd, a lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party who heads the House of Commons' all-party committee,
said in a letter to Attorney General John Morris.
	   Pinochet, 82, remained sequestered in the expensive London
clinic where police arrested him Friday at the instigation of a
Spanish magistrate, who is seeking the general's extradition on
charges of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet seized power in 1973 and, as part of compromises during
Chile's successful return to democracy, remained commander-in-chief
of the country's army until March.
	   His arrest, while undergoing back surgery, has sharply divided
political parties both in Britain and Chile.
	   Britain's opposition Conservative Party, which lost power 18
months ago, accuses Prime Minister Tony Blair's government of
``gesture politics'' and pandering to Labor's left-wing.
	   In Chile on Tuesday, pro-Pinochet demonstrators hurled garbage
at the British and Spanish embassies. Two municipalities withdrew
parking privileges for British and Spanish diplomats and said they
would refuse to collect their garbage.
	   Tony Benn, a veteran leftist Labor lawmaker, said Wednesday that
the U.S. government and the British Conservative Party were
reluctant to see a trial for Pinochet, who violently overthrew the
leftist government of Salvador Allende, because it would spotlight
their links with him.
	   ``The British government supported Pinochet, the American
government financed the coup, and therefore if this comes into
court, Pinochet will reveal the support he had from the
Conservatives ... (and) from the Americans, and that will open that
a huge issue,'' Benn said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview.
	   Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former foreign secretary in the
Conservative government, retorted, ``There will be months and
months of haggle and then they will realize this is an absurdity.''
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.
	   On Tuesday, Amnesty International and two other British-based
human rights groups wrote to London's police chief seeking _ if the
extradition fails _ to have Pinochet tried in Britain on grounds
that the victims also included Britons and Chileans who live here.
Police have not yet responded.
	   Meanwhile, diplomats from the Chilean embassy returned to the
Foreign Office to argue that Britain has violated Pinochet's
diplomatic immunity because he arrived last month on a diplomatic
passport and is a Chilean senator. The Foreign Office says that
does not confer diplomatic immunity.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's 56th government since World War II took
office Wednesday with the swearing in of new Premier Massimo
D'Alema and a center-left government which includes the first
Communist Cabinet ministers in half a century.
	   D'Alema himself is an ex-Communist and many political observers
here say his rise to the post of premier signals an end to Italy's
long ``cold war'' _ a decades-long battle to keep the left out of
power.
	   The beginning of the end of that war was the collapse of the
Christian Democrats, one of Europe's more conservative parties,
amid the corruption scandals of the 1980s. The Christian Democrats
had held power for decades, keeping the left at bay.
	   D'Alema's predecessor, Romano Prodi, presided over a center-left
government, the first of the postwar era. But Prodi himself was not
a leftist.
	   The 49-year-old D'Alema, in contrast, came up through the ranks
of the old Italian Communist Party before becoming a social
democrat after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   Like Prodi, D'Alema hammered together a coalition drawing on the
center and the left, but he reached farther in both directions than
Prodi.
	   In assembling his majority, D'Alema courted a centrist party
headed by a former Christian Democratic president, Francesco
Cossiga. He also won the support of the new Italian Communist
Party.
	   The new government has two ministers from the Italian
Communists. Oliviero Diliberto is justice minister, the same post
held half a century ago by Palmiro Togliatti, who led the old
Italian Communist party. Katia Belillo is the minister of regional
affairs.
	   Justice is an especially sensitive ministry because of ongoing
corruption investigations by the judiciary into the leader of the
conservative opposition, media mogul and ex-premier Silvio
Berlusconi.
	   Berlusconi has long maintained that the charges against him are
politically motivated and a justice minister from the far left, his
ideological nemesis, will only intensify his complaints.
	   D'Alema's alliance with Cossiga also raised eyebrows because of
the long enmity between the left and the Christian Democrats.
Cossiga's new centrist party got three posts in the new government:
the defense, and post and telecommunications ministries and a new
portfolio called parliamentary relations.
	   The new government, which D'Alema announced early Wednesday,
also includes eight holdovers from the Prodi government.
	   The highly respected Carlo Azeglio Ciampi stays on as treasury
and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco continues as finance
minister. The two are key figures in pushing through a1999 budget
meeting Italy's economic commitments to the European Monetary
Union.
	   Another respected figure, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, also
stays on.
	   D'Alema named a special minister, ex-Premier Giuliano Amato, to
push through reforms in Italy's electoral system, which is blamed
for the country's ``revolving door'' governments.
	   The new Cabinet has 25 ministers, four more than that of Prodi,
and six women, twice the number in Prodi's government.
	   Two ministers are from the Green Party and D'Alema's own
Democratic Left, which was the largest party in Prodi's coalition,
got seven posts. Among them is labor, which went to Naples'
high-profile mayor, Antonio Bassolino.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell on Oct. 9 when hard-line
Communists withdrew their support in a dispute over the budget.
Parliament is expected to take a required vote of confidence on the
new government on Friday.

Tony Blair denies Pinochet arrest is government decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair denied Wednesday
that the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was a
politically motivated decision on the part of his Labor government.
	   In an interview published in the respected daily Le Monde, Blair
said Pinochet's arrest last Friday was the ``result of a judicial
process initiated by a Spanish magistrate and transmitted to our
metropolitan police via Interpol.''
	   Blair's government has said the matter will be handled in the
British courts, but the interview marks Blair's first personal
comments on the arrest.
	   Blair called the arrest ``simply the result of two judicial
systems, Spanish and British, joined together by an extradition
treaty.''
	   ``It can't be a government decision because that would be
tantamount to interfering in our judiciary system, which we can't
do, '' he was quoted as telling Le Monde.
	   Blair said that the final decision whether to extradite Pinochet
lies with British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has said he will
treat it as a ``quasi-judicial manner.''
	   Straw ``will have to act as a magistrate, not as a politician,
and judge the facts, nothing else,'' Blair was quoted as telling Le
Monde.
	   Asked about Pinochet's past, Blair said he ``condemned
everything he did during the period.''

year, barely meeting the country's domestic needs, an industry
official said Wednesday.
	   The figure is based on an ``optimistic forecast,'' said
Volodymyr Kodnev, deputy chief of Ukrtsukor, the national
association of sugar producers.
	   As of Monday, sugar plants had produced 936,000 metric tons
(1.03 million short tons) of sugar, using 7.8 million metric tons
(8.6 million short tons) of the 11.3 million metric tons (12.43
million short tons) of sugar beets at their disposal, Kodnev told
the Interfax news agency.
	   Sugar production is down largely because of the lack of sugar
beets and fuel. Of the country's 192 sugar refineries, only 127 are
working at present, Kodnev said.
	   Last year, Ukraine produced about 2 million metric tons (2.2
million short tons) of sugar, while the country's annual domestic
consumption amounts to about 1.5 million to 1.7 million metric tons
(1.65 million to 1.87 million short tons), Interfax said.
	   Ukraine had hoped to sell some of its sugar to Russia this year
following a 1997 deal allowing tax-free imports of up to 600,000
metric tons (660,000 short tons) of Ukrainian sugar to Russia, the
Fakty newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   But because of Russia's financial crisis, the country may buy
only up to 300,000 metric tons (330,000 short tons) of Ukrainian
sugar this year, Fakty quoted Volodymyr Shevchenko, who is in
charge of economic cooperation with Russia at the Foreign Trade
Ministry, as saying.
	   Still, the newspaper said Russia might use its tax-free quota in
full, which could cause sugar shortages in Ukraine.

Sudanese employees to return to U.S. Embassy in Khartoum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese employees of the U.S. Embassy
are to reopen the building Thursday but _ in a mark of still tense
relations between the two countries _ Sudan declared the employees
cannot engage in any diplomatic activity.
	   The embassy has been closed since April 7 when its grounds were
briefly taken over by rioting Sudanese after a U.S. missile attack
on a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum to avenge the bombings of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Sudanese newspapers reported Wednesday that the Sudanese staff
was returning to the building. No U.S. diplomats have been based in
Khartoum since 1966, but an American official in neighboring Kenya
confirmed the move.
	   Chris Scharf, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, said
American concerns about the safety of the 80 workers had been met.
But he said the move ``was a logistical decision rather than a move
of particular diplomatic significance.''
	   Following reports the building would reopen, the Foreign
Ministry issued a statement Wednesday saying the Sudanese employees
could not engage in diplomacy in the building until Sudan's Embassy
in Washington was allowed to operate fully.
	   The statement, attributed to an authoritative source, said talks
were being conducted between Sudan and the United States to settle
the two governments' disagreements.
	   Relations between the two countries have been difficult since
Gen. Omar el-Bashir staged a coup in 1989 and formed an Islamic
government. Washington pulled its diplomats out of Khartoum in
1996, saying it could not guarantee their safety.
	   The United States said the el-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in
Khartoum was attacked because it had links to Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi dissident it blames for the Kenya and Tanzania bombings. It
also said the factory made agents for chemical weapons. Sudan
denies the factory made weapons products or was linked to bin
Laden.

At least three dead as boat capsizes in Gulf of Thailand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, grafs 2-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least three people died when a ferry
boat carrying more than 20 passengers to an island in the Gulf of
Thailand capsized early Wednesday, marine police said.
	   The bodies of two foreign women and one pregnant Thai woman had
been recovered, said a police officer in the southern province of
Surat Thani, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   An unknown number of passengers were missing and presumed dead.
	   The police chief for Koh Samui, an island to which the survivors
and the bodies were taken, said one of the two dead foreign women
was Australian.
	   Col. Kriran Intrakaew said 18 or 19 people had been rescued, and
10 of them remained hospitalized, including one American.
	   He said he believed 10 people were still missing, including two
foreigners whose nationalities he did not specify.
	   Other details about the foreigners were not known.
	   ``We know for sure that at least three passengers are not
accounted for but it is very likely that the rest could have
drowned,'' said the marine police officer.
	   Recovery operations were suspended because of heavy storms in
the gulf, he said.
	   The ferry left Don Sak town, 530 kilometers (330 miles) south of
Bangkok, at 11 p.m. Tuesday for Koh Tao, an island popular with
young Western travelers.
	   It capsized at 4 a.m. Wednesday, said the police officer.
	   Thai TV Channel 7 reported Wednesday night that 18 passengers
had been rescued, including two Americans and two Swiss. It said at
least eight people were believed missing.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, President Slobodan Milosevic said Wednesday
he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement despite what he
called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   The Yugoslav leader's statement came after talks in Belgrade in
which Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's American supreme commander, and
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill laid out Tuesday night what Milosevic
still must do to fully comply with the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   A statement issued Wednesday by the official news agency Tanjug
said Milosevic told the American officials that ``despite armed
provocations by the terrorist groups ... Serbia and Yugoslavia
stand firm in their determination for a peaceful solution of the
Kosovo problem by political means.''
	   Western officials have given him until Tuesday to comply fully
or face the renewed threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said during a
visit to neighboring Macedonia. ``We will be watching very
carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes.
	   Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces
have raised fears about the agreement, under which Milosevic
pledged to meet U.N. demands, including withdrawals, a halt to the
crackdown, cooperating in refugee returns and agreeing with ethnic
Albanians on a timetable for restoring self-rule.
	   Western officials have been quick to point out his progress
toward compliance in recent days, adding to speculation that the
Tuesday deadline _ already extended by 10 days _ will again be
pushed back.
	   Washington says that despite the nightly small-arms fire in
several Kosovo towns, the cease-fire is generally holding.
	   International deliveries of humanitarian aid for tens of
thousands of refugees continue. The U.N. refugee agency sent a
first shipment of shoes Wednesday for refugees in Djinovce, 65
kilometers (40 miles) south of Pristina.
	   Many refugees have returned to their villages but leave them at
night for their temporary settlements, fearing shelling attacks.
	   Meanwhile, efforts moved forward on setting up the ground force
in Kosovo to verify the status of Yugoslavia's pledges.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said it will formally approve the monitoring force on
Thursday.
	   OSCE spokesman Mons Nyberg said Wednesday the vote will
authorize the first of the verifiers _ about 50 Americans,
Europeans and Russians who are already in Kosovo as part of a
diplomatic mission.
	   American diplomat William Walker, the mission chief, will head
to Pristina next week to officially launch the mission, Nyberg
said.
	   U.S. officials say the countries involved have volunteered about
1,500 monitors toward a maximum force of 2,000.
	   In Belgrade, more than 100 Serbian journalists held a protest
march through downtown and appealed to Washington, as the
``guarantor of peace in this region,'' to help obtain the release
of two missing colleagues.
	   The two Tanjug journalists, who disappeared Sunday in Kosovo,
are suspected to have been kidnapped by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.

Dallas-based Caltex moves global headquarters to Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Caltex Petroleum Corp. is moving its global
corporate headquarters from Dallas, Texas, to Singapore following
reorganization of worldwide operations, the company announced
Thursday.
	   When the new operation gears up by next March, Caltex will be
the first multinational corporation to establish its global
corporate headquarters in Singapore.
	   Caltex, which employs 7,700 people, will remain a
U.S.-registered corporation, refining and marketing petroleum and
other products through 13 refineries and 8,500 retail service
stations in more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle
East.
	   Caltex Chairman David law-Smith said the move to Singapore
``will position us centrally in the area where we do most of our
business and allow us to be closer to our customers and serve them
more effectively.''
	   Singapore's Economic Development Board said Caltex's decision is
testimony to the company's long-term confidence in Singapore
despite the current economic volatility in Asia.
	   Responding to growing worldwide deregulation of the petroleum
products market, Caltex extensively reorganized its operations in
June to focus primarily on specific lines of business rather than a
geographic structure.
	   Caltex units for trading, marketing, lubricants and new business
development will all be based in Singapore.
	   Caltex Trading is already the largest private company in
Singapore, with a 1997 turnover of 14 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 8.7 billion) said Leo G. Lonergan, the new corporate vice
president and head of worldwide trading.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In Judge Baltasar Garzon's arrest order
against Augusto Pinochet, the words are terse but chilling.
	   Men vanish from city streets in front of their wives and
children. People are dragged from their homes in the dead of night.
A pregnant woman is hauled off to a police station and never heard
from again.
	   With these abuses, the Spanish judge makes a case for
extraditing the former Chilean dictator from Britain, where he was
arrested Friday, and trying him in Spain on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism.
	   In an initial arrest warrant, Garzon cited only one specific
case. But in an addendum released Tuesday and sent to Britain, he
outlined how 94 people died or disappeared at the hands of Chile's
military junta leaders and Argentine cohorts from 1976-1983.
	   They fell victim to Operation Condor, a campaign by South
American juntas to help each other crush dissent. Victims came from
a variety of countries, including Argentina, the United States,
Britain and others, Garzon's order states.
	   All but a few of the 94 victims cited in the new document were
Chilean living in Argentina, like Jose Luis Appel de la Cruz. He
was kidnapped by armed civilians on Jan. 10, 1977, as he walked
down a street in the Argentine town of Cipolletti with his wife,
Carmen Delard, and their daughter.
	   ``Carmen Delard disappeared at the police station in that town
when she went to report her husband's disappearance,'' Garzon's
order says.
	   A week later in Buenos Aires, Delard's sister Gloria Delard was
arrested at her home along with her husband Roberto Cristi and
their two children.
	   ``Gloria Delard was pregnant with her third child. Federal
Police agents took them to the Navy School of Mechanics, where they
disappeared,'' the order says. That school was one of the most
notorious torture centers run by Argentina's military juntas.
	   The evidence in Garzon's order was based on the report produced
by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed by
former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. Known as the Rettig
Report, it was published in 1991 and identified nearly 2,300
victims of state-sanctioned killings, torture, disappearances and
other abuses committed under the Pinochet regime.
	   Pinochet, who relinquished power in 1990 to a civilian regime
after 17 years of authoritarian rule, cannot be prosecuted at home
because he has immunity as a senator for life.
	   Private human rights lawyers who helped Garzon prepare the
arrest order chose the cases of Chileans who died in Argentina
because they believe it makes it easier to charge Pinochet with
genocide.
	   Garzon says Spanish law allows him to prosecute genocide no
matter where it occurred, even outside Spain.
	   The lawyers say Pinochet and the Argentine generals made a
systematic, organized attempt to wipe out political opponents
because of their ideological beliefs and that this amounts to
genocide.
	   The key is the existence of collaboration between the countries'
security forces.
	   ``Organization is the basis of genocide,'' said Gregorio Dionis
from Nizkor, a Spanish-based group formed five years ago to support
efforts to bring human rights violators to trial.
	   Dionis has been advising the lawyers that proving that the
violations were systematically carried out is essential. ''Killing
lots of people without criminal organization is not genocide'' he

Swiss authorize use of army to cope with refugee influx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government authorized the use
of the army Wednesday to help house and feed an increasing flood of
refugees from Kosovo.
	   An estimated 5,000 Kosovo Albanians are expected to arrive in
Switzerland this month, pushing the number of asylum seekers to an
all-time high by the end of the year.
	   With reception centers overwhelmed by the unexpectedly large
influx, hundreds of refugees have been forced to fend for
themselves, embarrassing a country which prides itself for its
humanitarian traditions.
	   At its weekly session, the cabinet decided that, with effect
from Nov. 9, soldiers would help with emergency accommodation, food
and medical care for new arrivals, as well as carrying out security
duties.
	   However, Justice Minister Arnold Koller said the government had
no plans to issue blanket approval to all ethnic Albanians to stay
in the country temporarily _ as it did in the case of Bosnians
fleeing their earlier civil war. Each individual must still go
through standard asylum procedures.
	   The Swiss fear that unless other European countries relax their
controls, it will face an even bigger flood of refugees.
	   Switzerland is home to a large population of ethnic Albanians
and so has acted as a magnet to people fleeing the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year. Most are smuggled in via Italy and France,
or from eastern Europe through Germany.
	   Swiss officials maintain that the small Alpine country is
shouldering an unfairly big burden of Albanian refugees and that
its neighbors should do more to help out.
	   The Kosovo refugees pose more headaches than Bosnians who fled
their earlier civil war. In particular, whereas there was
widespread public sympathy for Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians have
traditionally had a bad reputation for drug dealing and crime.
	   However, newspaper and television images in recent days of gaunt
refugees turned away from reception centers and shivering in front
of wire fences has led to an upsurge of indignation that civil war
victims should be treated so badly.

Greece accuses Turkey of being `regional troublemaker'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece accused Turkey on Wednesday of
being a ``regional troublemaker,'' claiming Turkish fighter planes
violated Greek airspace while Greek forces conducted war games.
	   Ankara denied the claim.
	   Turkey ``constantly remains the regional troublemaker which in a
provocative and aggressive way disrupts its relations with the
European Union and Greece,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said.
	   According to the Greek Air Force, 26 Turkish fighter planes
violated Greek national airspace on Tuesday, flying as close as two
nautical miles from the eastern Aegean islands of Psara, Symi,
Agios Efstratios and Karpathos.
	   Greece also claimed other Turkish jets violated air traffic
regulations in the Athens Flight Information Region, the area
controlled by Greek civil aviation authorities.
	   But Turkish officials denied any violations had taken place.
``Turkish Air Force jets have been conducting their routine flights
in international airspace over the Aegean,'' said Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli. ``The Greeks claims are totally
baseless.''
	   Greek forces began military exercises in the Aegean this week.
Greece is also conducting war games with Cypriot forces in Cyprus.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following the latest warning from
NATO's military chief, President Slobodan Milosevic said Wednesday
he remains committed to the Kosovo peace agreement despite what he
called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   The Yugoslav leader's statement came after talks in Belgrade in
which Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's American supreme commander, and
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill laid out Tuesday night what Milosevic
still must do to fully comply with the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   A statement issued Wednesday by the official news agency Tanjug
said Milosevic told the American officials that ``despite armed
provocations by the terrorist groups ... Serbia and Yugoslavia
stand firm in their determination for a peaceful solution of the
Kosovo problem by political means.''
	   Western officials have given him until Tuesday to comply fully
or face the renewed threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said during a
visit to neighboring Macedonia. ``We will be watching very
carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes.
	   Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces
have raised fears about the agreement, under which Milosevic
pledged to meet U.N. demands, including withdrawals, a halt to the
crackdown, cooperating in refugee returns and agreeing with ethnic
Albanians on a timetable for restoring self-rule.
	   Western officials have been quick to point out his progress
toward compliance in recent days, adding to speculation that the
Tuesday deadline _ already extended by 10 days _ will again be
pushed back.
	   Washington says that despite the nightly small-arms fire in
several Kosovo towns, the cease-fire is generally holding.
	   International deliveries of humanitarian aid for tens of
thousands of refugees continue. The U.N. refugee agency sent a
first shipment of shoes Wednesday for refugees in Djinovce, 65
kilometers (40 miles) south of Pristina.
	   Many refugees have returned to their villages but leave them at
night for their temporary settlements, fearing shelling attacks.
	   Meanwhile, efforts moved forward on setting up the ground force
in Kosovo to verify the status of Yugoslavia's pledges.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said it will formally approve the monitoring force on
Thursday.
	   OSCE spokesman Mons Nyberg said Wednesday the vote will
authorize the first of the verifiers _ about 50 Americans,
Europeans and Russians who are already in Kosovo as part of a
diplomatic mission.
	   American diplomat William Walker, the mission chief, will head
to Pristina next week to officially launch the mission, Nyberg
said.
	   U.S. officials say the countries involved have volunteered about
1,500 monitors toward a maximum force of 2,000.
	   In Belgrade, more than 100 Serbian journalists held a protest
march through downtown and appealed to Washington, as the
``guarantor of peace in this region,'' to help obtain the release
of two missing colleagues.
	   The two Tanjug journalists, who disappeared Sunday in Kosovo,
are suspected to have been kidnapped by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.

Malaysian prime minister rules out snap elections

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Wednesday he won't be pressured into calling early
elections despite weekly street protests demanding his resignation.
	   ``I do not see why I should be pushed into an earlier election
because that will have the effect of undermining our economic
programs,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted him as saying.
	   Since former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was arrested on
Sept. 20, once-dormant opposition groups have become more strident
in urging that Parliament be dissolved and general elections held.
	   Demonstrations against Mahathir's 17-year leadership have become
commonplace, even in rural areas, despite stern police warnings and
hundreds of arrests.
	   General elections do not have to be held before April 2000.
Meanwhile, Mahathir said, he was ready to weather the barrage of
demonstrations aimed at toppling his administration.
	   He stressed that Malaysia would continue its recent plans to
revive its flagging economy by aggressively lowering interest
rates, imposing broad capital controls and pegging the currency
against the dollar.
	   Anwar had disagreed with the prime minister on economic policy
before Mahathir fired him on Sept. 2, saying he was morally unfit
to lead.
	   Anwar is to go on trial Nov. 2 on 10 charges of sodomy and
corruption. He says the charges against him have been trumped up to
block any challenge to Mahathir.

Police arrest 68 after killing spree in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president to seek clarification of allegation
against Cabinet minister, last two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they have
arrested 68 people in connection with a killing spree in which the
severed heads of some victims were carried on poles through village
streets.
	   Vigilante groups formed in the eastern end of the main island of
Java after more than 150 people, many of them Muslim clerics and
others accused of witchcraft, were mysteriously murdered.
	   Maj. Djoko Hartanto, deputy police chief in the town of Malang,
said 54 people were arrested for allegedly killing nine suspected
murderers in an outburst of mob violence.
	   Local residents have turned over to police another 14 people,
including one woman, who are also suspected of being murderers.
Hartanto said many of the detainees had mental disorders and that
police and psychiatrists were examining them.
	   On Sunday and Monday, vigilantes beheaded murder suspects and
paraded their heads on sticks. The killings in revenge attacks
began Friday in Malang and surrounding areas, about 650 kilometers
(400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Many of the victims in the mysterious killings that began in
August in the regency of Banyuwangi were alleged black-magic
practitioners and preachers or members of the 30 million-member
Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization.
	   Its leaders have called for calm and have condemned revenge
killings by vigilantes.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.
	   An official said Wednesday, however, that President B.J. Habibie
planned to seek clarification from Wahid about the allegation.
	   After meeting with Habibie, State Secretary Akbar Tandjung said
the president would seek the clarification after Wahid recovers
from illness. The Muslim leader was admitted to a hospital
Saturday, hours after making the allegation.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Construction on a new
international arrivals terminal at Cape Town International Airport
will start by the middle of November, the Airports Company of South
Africa said Wednesday.
	   The new terminal building will be able to handle nearly 1,000
passengers an hour in comparison with the current 350 an hour.
Completion is set for April 2000.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan police have released on bail the
remaining four of two dozen people detained on suspicion of being
involved in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy and other targets in
Uganda, police spokesman Bob Ngobi said Wednesday.
	   The men, Ugandans of Somali origin, are three businessmen and a
student. They are still being investigated, Ngobi said. He said he
was not in a position to say when the men were freed.
	   The men had been picked up by Ugandan security officials working
in conjunction with the FBI late last month. The others were freed
Oct. 2.
	   The detentions followed several grenade attacks on passenger
buses in Uganda in which 30 people died as well as reports of a
foiled attempt to bomb the U.S. diplomatic mission.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A South African company which has
invested millions of dollars in Uganda's telecommunications market
Wednesday began offering cellular services.
	   Mobile Telephone Network has so far invested dlrs 35 million out
of a planned dlrs 70 million.
	   ``We are beginning with mobile radio services, and we shall
embark on fixed phones by next year. By Christmas, we shall have
extended the mobile phone services to upcountry towns,'' Eric Van
Veen, MTN marketing manager, said at the opening ceremony
Wednesday.
	   In a contract with the Ugandan government, MTN plans to connect
80,000 lines all over the country.
	   ``Our switchboard at the moment is enough to start off with
50,000 customers. By the beginning of next year, we shall also open
up telephone booths,'' he said.
	   MTN, which operates in South Africa and Swaziland, also plans to
begin offering services in Rwanda.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A religious sect has sued former President
Kenneth Kaunda, alleging he ordered massacres of its followers in
northern Zambia more than three decades ago, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The Jerusalem Church was seeking compensation and an apology
from Kaunda, who led the nation to independence in 1964 and ruled
for 27 years, the state-controlled Times of Zambia said.
	   The sect was founded by Alice Lenshina, and originally was
called the Lumpa Church.
	   Lenshina's daughter, Jennifer Bwalya Bubile, and three other
church members filed the suit in the Ndola High Court in the
central Copperbelt province.
	   They claim Kaunda ordered attacks on the sect after it resisted
attempts to disband it. The suit alleges 60,000 members were killed
by troops and militants from Kaunda's ruling party.
	   Kaunda, who could not immediately be reached for comment, has
acknowledged he was forced to end what he described as a rebellion
by the sect. He acknowledges lives were lost, but no casualty
figures have been given. Several hundred estimated to have died.
	   --
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Over 80 percent of the nation's
electorate have registered for upcoming presidential elections
being boycotted by the opposition, the government said Wednesday.
	   More than 4 million people have registered, the security
ministry said.
	   Observers say the turnout will be a further boost to President
Blaise Campaore, who is seeking re-election for another seven-year
term.
	   Opposition leaders have said they will boycott the Nov. 15 vote,
saying the country's electoral commission is not truly independent.
	   Only two virtually unknown candidates will run against the
president.
	   Campaore, running as the sole candidate, won the last elections
in 1991. He seized power in a bloody coup in 1987.

Japan to resume nuclear reactor aid to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with signing of the agreement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan signed an agreement Wednesday to resume
payments for a project to build nuclear reactors in North Korea,
the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Japan froze its dlrs 1 billion contribution to the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization after North Korea fired a
rocket over Japan on Aug. 31.
	   Tokyo says the launch was a ballistic missile test, while North
Korea claims it put a satellite into orbit. Nonetheless, the firing
caused alarm in Tokyo by demonstrating the communist country's
ability to strike any part of Japan.
	   Chief government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka announced the decision
to resume funding, saying the KEDO project is the best way to keep
North Korea from developing its own nuclear weapons.
	   Terusuke Terada, Japan's ambassador to KEDO, signed the
resolution on funding for the consortium in Tokyo, said a Foreign
Ministry official who asked not to be identified by name.
	   Members of the organization _ Japan, South Korea, the United
States and the European Union _ had been scheduled to adopt a
resolution on funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion project in August
before the rocket launch prompted Japan to freeze its contribution.
	   The KEDO consortium was formed under a 1994 agreement in which
North Korea promised to halt its own nuclear program, suspected of
developing weapons, in exchange for two Western-built light-water
civilian reactors and fuel-oil shipments.

Moldova urges Russia to withdraw its troops from Trans-Dniester
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Four years after Moldova and Russia
agreed that Russian soldiers should withdraw from this former
Soviet republic, Moldova on Wednesday urged Russia to honor the
treaty.
	   Only a few soldiers have left the eastern breakaway region of
Trans-Dniester, where they were sent in 1992 for peacekeeping.
	   ``The absence of any essential progress in the withdrawal of
Russian troops could affect'' relations between the two countries,
said a statement from the Moldovan Foreign Ministry urging Russia's
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to approve the treaty.
	   Moldova's government adopted the treaty in November 1994, but
Russian legislators have not passed it. Moldovan lawmakers say
Russia is holding out because it wants autonomy for Trans-Dniester.
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Slavs, declared independence in
1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, would
seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in
troops, led by Alexander Lebed, now governor of a vast Russian
region. Relations have remained tense.
	   Moldova asked Russian troops to withdraw with all their
ammunition, fearing weapons, grenades and tanks could fall into
separatists' hands.

U.S. determined to make Turkish Caspian oil route a reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with statements of U.S. Undersecretary Eizenstat,
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The United States is determined to see
Caspian oil transported through Turkey and will continue efforts to
make the Baku-Ceyhan route a reality, Undersecretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday.
	   ``Overall, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from
environmental, economic and strategic standpoints,'' Eizenstat told
reporters.
	   Eizenstat's statements followed an announcement that the U.S.
Export-import Bank has offered a dlrs 827,000 loan to help finance
a pipeline linking the Azeri capital of Baku to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
	   Another dlrs 823,000 grant from a U.S. trade and development
agency for consultant services will be signed shortly, said
Eizenstat, who was in Turkey for a meeting of the U.S.-Turkey Joint
Economic Commission.
	   ``No one should underestimate our determination to make
Baku-Ceyhan a reality,'' he said.
	   Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to
make a final decision on the pipeline route on October 29.
	   According to some reports, the companies may favor shorter and
cheaper routes, including pipelines already being built from
Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, or
an enlarged pipeline along the same route.
	   Turkey strongly objects to the proposals because they would
require the oil to be loaded into tankers and shipped through
Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, which would increase the risk of
oil tanker accidents.
	   ``We cannot turn our straits into a virtual pipeline just
because some oil companies want to make more money,'' Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday.
	   The Turkish proposal for a 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline
would cost dlrs 2.5 billion dlrs. Turkey has said it would
construct part of the pipeline on its own but it was not clear if
the offer would help tip the balance in Turkey's favor.
	   Eizenstat also praised the preliminary agreement reached Tuesday
between Turkey and Turkmenistan to build a pipeline to carry
Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.

Senior U.N. official expresses admiration for Anwar's wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Mahathir, grafs 12-15; EDITS to
tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior United Nations official
visited the wife of Malaysia's jailed dissident leader Wednesday
and described her as ``a courageous lady.''
	   Abib Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression
and opinion of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, did not say,
however, whether he had come to Malaysia specifically to meet
Azizah Ismail.
	   Azizah, the wife of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim,
said earlier she hoped she would not be arrested on charges of
encouraging protests against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Her comments came after rumors of her arrest swept across Kuala
Lumpur. Reporters and photographers rushed to her home.
	   ``I'm very encouraged that he came to visit me,'' Azizah said of
Hussain, who was India's ambassador to the United Nations in the
early 1990s.
	   Fears of her arrest were fueled by comments by Mahathir Tuesday
just before he concluded a five-day visit to Tokyo.
	   ``I hope the police won't arrest (her), but I don't know. That
is the police business,'' Mahathir reportedly said.
	   Soon after Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest following a mammoth public
rally demanding Mahathir's resignation, police warned Azizah she
would face the same fate if she led the campaign her husband
started.
	   She drove up to a street protest for the first time Saturday,
waving at the slogan-shouting demonstrators and shaking hands with
many of them.
	   Azizah said Wednesday the prime minister seemed to be directing
his wrath toward her.
	   ``I implore Dr. Mahathir to be more responsible and not be so
arrogant,'' she said, denying that she had joined the protest. She
had driven to the demonstration out of curiosity, she said.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir said Wednesday he won't be pressured into
calling early elections although demonstrations against his 17-year
leadership have become commonplace, even in rural areas.
	   ``I do not see why I should be pushed into an earlier election
because that will have the effect of undermining our economic
programs,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted him as saying.
	   General elections do not have to be held before April 2000.
	   Mahathir said he was ready to weather the barrage of
demonstrations aimed at toppling his administration. Thousands of
supporters of Anwar continue to take to the streets every week
despite stern police warnings and hundreds of arrests.
	   The campaign against Mahathir began after he fired Anwar on
Sept. 2. The two had differed over economic policy, but Mahathir
said he had acted because Anwar was morally unfit to lead. Anwar
since has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption _
charges he says are false and politically motivated.
	   On Wednesday, the government warned the editor of an opposition
newspaper, which has increased its circulation since the pro-Anwar
campaign began, not to sell at newsstands.
	   The editor of the publication run by the Parti Islam SeMalaysia,
or PAS, was summoned to the Home Ministry to explain why the party
newsletter was being sold publicly as a daily newspaper, an
official said. He did not say when the editor was called in.
	   The Harakah daily and other fringe publications by opposition
activists on the Internet have become increasingly popular among
Malaysians jaded by pro-government coverage in the nation's major
newspapers.

Moscow mayor blames Russian government for economy collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov blamed Russian economic
policies for the country's financial collapse, but promised
potential investors Wednesday that the new government would not
turn back free-market reforms.
	   Speaking on the opening day of the Moscow International Business
Association conference, Luzhkov said investors should not fear the
new Russian Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _
even though it includes Communist Party members.
	   ``Many people actively functioning today have in the past been
over there _ all of us have,'' he said. ``We have to be fair. ... I
am not concerned that this government will return our economy
back.''
	   The conference is seeking to interest foreign businesses in more
than 200 investment opportunities in the Russian capital.
	   The popular Moscow leader, who plans to run for president in
2000, tried to reassure his audience that Moscow remains a safe and
stable market.
	   In August, the Russian economy collapsed when President Boris
Yeltsin's government allowed the ruble to fall against Western
currencies and declared a moratorium on payments of loans.
	   Calling the collapse ``inevitable,'' Luzhkov blamed the
``erroneous policy of the Russian federal government'' for the
problems.
	   He said the country rushed to transform its economy, which led
to privatized businesses that did not improve efficiency and added
nothing to the country's coffers.
	   Luzhkov also said the ``radical reformers'' who demanded zero
inflation encouraged an economy based on bartering rather than the
exchange of cash.
	   And he criticized the West and the International Monetary Fund
for giving Russia aid and loans without monitoring how it was being
spent.
	   ``The aid did not go to industry,'' he said. ``Some was eaten
up, some was lost. This is a soft way of saying what you all know I
am thinking.''
	   It was that foreign aid, Luzhkov contended, that made the
country ``high for a little while'' and created an atmosphere where
the leaders could ignore the economy because ``we seemed to be
muddling through.''
	   While Luzhkov did not single out any Russian leaders for
specific criticism, he went to great lengths to distance Moscow
from the rest of Russia.
	   Saying he disagreed with Russia's decision to call a moratorium
on the repayment of loans, he pledged that Moscow would fulfill its
obligations to foreign investors.
	   ``Moscow is an independent entity. We have an independent
government with independent authority,'' he said. ``It has its own
budget which does not depend on anyone and is not accountable to
anyone except our Moscow city parliament.''

Ukrainian parliament more than doubles minimum wage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday raised
the minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) a month to 148 hryvna
(dlrs 43) a month.
	   Although nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage,
the figure is used as a base to calculate various payments
throughout the country.
	   The increase, approved by a vote of 243-12, will cost the
government an additional 8 million hryvna (dlrs 2.33 million) by
the end of 1998, Labor Minister Ivan Sakhan told parliament.
	   Ukraine's leftist-dominated legislature long has favored extra
spending for social needs. The country has also been hit by
residual effects of Russia's economic crisis.
	   Last year, the parliament approved a law under which the minimum
wage is to be raised every three months to correspond to the
official poverty level, which was set by lawmakers Wednesday at
118.6 hryvna (dlrs 34.6) a month. The minimum wage was last raised
in July.
	   The average monthly wage in Ukraine was about 170 hryvna (dlrs
49.6 at the current rate) in the first half of 1998.

Israeli security tried to recruit assailant as double agent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Hamas activist who hurled hand grenades at
Israeli soldiers earlier this week was asked shortly before the
attack to become an informer for Israel's Shin Bet security
service, Israeli newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The dailies cited unidentified Shin Bet officials who confirmed
earlier Palestinian claims that the Hamas activist, 29-year-old
Salem Rajab Sarsour, was a double agent. The officials said the
recruiting plan did not go beyond the initial stages.
	   The Palestinians' West Bank security chief, Jibril Rajoub,
charged that by approaching Sarsour, the Shin Bet was indirectly
responsible for Monday's hand grenade attack in in the southern
Israeli town of Beersheba in which 64 Israelis were wounded.
	   Rajoub suggested that Sarsour carried out the attack because he
wanted to clear himself of suspicions that he collaborated with
Israel. ``There are documents and evidence that his (Sarsour's)
response to the attempt to recruit him was to throw grenades and
carry out terrorist attacks,'' Rajoub told Israel army radio.
	   The new reports may prove embarrassing to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu who said the Beersheba attack furnished more
proof that the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to fight
Islamic militants and prevent attacks in Israel.
	   Israel's security demands are a key issue in the weeklong
Mideast summit talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Sarsour, a father of five from the West Bank town of Hebron, was
arrested on Monday morning at the scene of the grenade attack.
	   The army said Sarsour also confessed to his interrogators that
he killed an elderly rabbi, Shlomo Raanan, in Hebron on Aug. 20 and
that he hurled hand grenades at Israeli troops in the city on Sept.
30. In that attack, two dozen Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were injured.
	   The Maariv daily quoted senior Shin Bet officials as saying that
at the end of September, before the Hebron grenade attack, an agent
met with Sarsour in hopes of recruiting him as an informer. Maariv
said Sarsour told the agent that collaboration ``could be a good
idea'' and agreed to meet with the agent again.
	   At the time, security officials thought Sarsour was a minor
Hamas activist and were unaware he had killed Rabbi Ranaan, Maariv
said.
	   Maariv had the most detailed account, but the Haaretz daily also
quoted unidentified Shin Bet agents as saying there were attempts
to recruit Sarsour as an informer.

After new nationwide protest, govt announces new measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with minister announcing new measures
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pressed by nationwide student demonstrations,
France's education minister on Wednesday announced new funding and
more personnel to improve shoddy and overcrowded high schools.
	   ``The students said clearly that high school reform should take
place as quickly as possible,'' Claude Allegre told the National
Assembly.
	   Allegre said the government would hire 25,000 more adults and
3,000 more youths to improve instruction and security in high
schools across the country.
	   Paris was setting aside 4 billion francs (dlrs 730 million) in
tax-free loans to regional governments to build and improve schools
over the next four years, he said.
	   Allegre said a ``students' charter'' would establish minimum
conditions that all high schools would have to conform to within
two months, and that by the next school year no class will have
over 35 students.
	   The Education Ministry would also seek to ease heavy courseload
by next year, fill missing teaching posts and boost foreign
language instruction.
	   There was no immediate reaction from students. Allegre unveiled
the plan after meeting again with students earlier Wednesday, a day
after nearly 300,000 youths took to the streets across the country.
	   Tuesday's marches were smaller than ones last week that drew an
estimated half million students across the country. French media on
Wednesday read that as giving the leftist government more time to
seek a solution.
	   ``The students half-protest,'' headlined the leftist daily
Liberation. ``It feels like the end,'' said the front page of the
popular tabloid France-Soir, noting the weeklong Toussaint vacation
begins at the end of the week.
	   The Paris march that drew an estimated 25,000 students was
marred by hooligans despite the deployment of about 4,500 police
who conducted thousands of body searches.
	   Helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from aerosol cans to
disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a posh Left Bank
neighborhood and set fire to a subway car, temporarily interrupting
service on one line.
	   Police said 85 people were lightly injured in Paris. Some 110
young people were arrested nationwide, they said, and 90 of them
were taken into custody.
	   Many of the hooligans were older than the high school students,
who insist the troublemakers have no connection to their movement.
	   But the violence was also an indicator of deeper problems. High
unemployment as well as school neglect in poor suburbs around Paris
have been blamed for chronic and rising youth violence. Recent
crippling strikes by transit drivers attacked by youths pay
testament.
	   Allegre faces a tough budget hold-down by a government under
pressure to keep the budget deficit within 3 percent of the gross
domestic product, as required by the euro single currency that
takes effect at the end of the year.

Dutch sailing ship runs aground off southern England

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coastguards launched a rescue operation Wednesday
after a Dutch sailing ship with 51 people on board ran aground in
high winds and seas off the southern English port of Newhaven.
	   Authorities said the entire crew was winched in pairs off the
Eendracht, a 115-foot (35-meter) training ship, by a coastguard
helicopter after initial attempts to refloat the ship failed.
	   Coastguard manager Kerry Woodard said the ship had suffered
engine failure shortly after leaving Newhaven port.
	   ``The weather caught hold of her and she went side-on to the
sea. She was broached onto the beach,'' he said. ``There was a
definite danger of capsizing early on. All it would have needed was
the right wave and the wind in the right direction and she would
have been over.''
	   Several people suffered minor injuries during the rescue
operation and were treated on shore. One person was taken to
hospital.
	   Initially, a skeleton crew remained on the boat to help lift it
from the beach, but they were evacuated after a coastguard tug
failed to steady the vessel.
	   ``She was getting battered. The decision was made between the
skipper and coastguards to get everybody off and leave it to later
on this evening on another rising tide,'' Woodard said.

Turkey still suspicious despite deal with Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday
Turkey was remaining cautious towards neighboring Syria despite a
deal with Damascus to crack down on a Kurdish rebel group.
	   Turkey and Syria stuck the deal Tuesday, ending a weeks-long
standoff. Under the deal, Syria agreed to brand the Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK, a ``terrorist'' group and to clamp down its activity
in Syria.
	   ``These results are very important,'' Cem told a group of
businessmen.''But we have to be careful about their applications.
We shall be observing developments with caution.''
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
had left Syria for Russia, which would be a sign Damascus was
meeting Turkish demands. Sabah newspaper he was hiding in
Odintsovo, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow. Russian
officials, however, said they had no information on Ocalan entering
Russia.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984
in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.

Moldova urges Russia to withdraw its troops from Trans-Dniester
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in 2nd graf that 5,000 troops estimated in Moldova. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Four years after Moldova and Russia
agreed that Russian soldiers should withdraw from this former
Soviet republic, Moldova on Wednesday urged Russia to honor the
treaty.
	   Only a few soldiers have left the eastern breakaway region of
Trans-Dniester, where they were sent in 1992 for peacekeeping.
About 5,000 troops are estimated to remain.
	   ``The absence of any essential progress in the withdrawal of
Russian troops could affect'' relations between the two countries,
said a statement from the Moldovan Foreign Ministry urging Russia's
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to approve the treaty.
	   Moldova's government adopted the treaty in November 1994, but
Russian legislators have not passed it. Moldovan lawmakers say
Russia is holding out because it wants autonomy for Trans-Dniester.
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Slavs, declared independence in
1990 fearing that Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, would
seek to reunite with neighboring Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in
troops, led by Alexander Lebed, now governor of a vast Russian
region. Relations have remained tense.
	   Moldova asked Russian troops to withdraw with all their
ammunition, fearing weapons, grenades and tanks could fall into
separatists' hands.

Spanish and British governments seek distance from Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
controversy &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish and British governments
appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm
brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
	   ``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a
decision for the British government or the Spanish government,''
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by
a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.
	   In a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin
Perez said Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion
about the extradition.''
	   British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back
surgery.
	   The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain
to stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his
17-year dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists
worldwide.
	   But it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears
it could damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after
Pinochet left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in
Chile, followed closely by Britain.
	   Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that Pinochet's
detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator.
	   ``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition
treaty but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said.
	   Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only
strictly legal criteria and act ``as if he were a judge,'' should
he be required to make a decision on an extradition request from
Spain.
	   The tone of the British Prime Minister's first public comment on
the issue contrasted sharply with Sunday's emotional statement from
influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons
would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.''
	   The European extradition convention gives Garzon 40 days to
present a formal extradition request to the British authorities via
the Spanish government.
	   But while Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised
his government would rubber stamp the process if it reaches his
desk, he appears to be hoping he will never have to do so.
	   Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appealed the
judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and
Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant.
	   ``Depending on the result of the appeals it is possible that it
(the extradition request) will never reach the government so
perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar
was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper
El Pais.
	   The appeals argue that crimes committed during Pinochet's
1973-1990 dictatorship are none of Spain's business, and should be
left to the Chilean or international courts.
	   A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision in
their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt.

Poland to sell food worth dlrs 200 million to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A private trading company Bartimpex has
signed a dlrs 200 million contract to sell food to Moscow in
1999-2000, a company official said Wednesday.
	   Bartimpex, which buys natural gas from Russia's giant Gazprom,
agreed with Moscow authorities and food importer Exima that the
money Poland pays for gas supplies will be spent on food, said the
financial director of the Polish company, Jan Antosik.
	   The structure of the deal should protect the company against
turbulence in Russia's banking sector, Antosik said. ``We are in a
comfortable situation because those payments are guaranteed by gas
supplies'' he said.
	   Antosik advocated Polish subsidies on food exports to Russia to
allow Polish food manufacturers to compete with subsidized exports
from western Europe.
	   Experts estimate that Polish exports to Russia, which in 1997
amounted to dlrs 2.2 billion, could be down by as much as 20
percent because of the Russian financial turmoil, the
Rzeczpospolita newspaper reported.
	   Russia is Poland's second largest export market, after Germany,
and food comprises half of Polish exports to Moscow.

Former communist officials banned from public office for 5 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Former Communist Party and state
officials and those who worked for the regime's secret police will
be banned from taking office in the state administration in the
next 5 years under a law Bulgaria's parliament passed Wednesday.
	   The chamber voted 133-79 to adopt the ban. Deputies of the
Socialist Party of renamed communists said it violated human rights
and boycotted the rest of the session.
	   The Socialists said they would ask the Constitutional Court to
throw out the ban. The 12-judge court is empowered to revoke
legislation.
	   The law takes effect a month after President Petar Stoyanov
signs it.
	   It was not immediately known how Stoyanov would react. He can
suspend enactment and ask parliament to review it as he did with
two previous laws on radio and TV and on a judiciary reform. But
parliament can override suspension, and then only the court is able
to invalidate the legislation.
	   ``The aim (of the law) is to create a depoliticized and
responsible state administration,'' Minister of State
Administration Mario Tagarinski said.
	   He said the law would separate the political from nonpolitical
part of the administration and guarantee that the latter won't be
replaced with every change of government.
	   ``If somebody causes a road accident he is deprived of his
driving license for some time,'' Tagarinski told Socialist
lawmakers in parliament. ``You used to run a whole state which
badly crashed.''
	   The law is a centerpiece of a public service reform that the
government is implementing to finally break with Bulgaria's
communist past.
	   Paying lip service to democracy and market economy, the former
communists have dominated most ot Bulgaria's governments after
ousting late strongman Todor Zhivkov in a party coup in 1989.
Mismanagement and rampant crime and corruption brought Bulgaria to
the brink of economic collapse in early 1997.

US threatens withdrawing trade concessions in banana war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV107 &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Wednesday told the European
Union it would impose trade sanctions next year unless the
Europeans reform their banana import regime to its satisfaction.
	   ``We feel like we have been rebuffed,'' said U.S. trade
representative Rita Hayes told a news conference after a WTO
meeting. European Union officials warned that if the sanctions are
imposed, the EU would react ``very strongly.''
	   ``If that's the way the Americans are going to go, there is
going to be a major explosion,'' EU trade representative Roderick
Abbott said, without specifying what action the Europeans would
take.
	   The threats and counter threats represent perhaps the most
bitter exchanges yet in a long-running trade war over the EU's
controversial banana policy.
	   The European Union approved new import regulations after the
United States and five Latin American banana producing nations
complained to the WTO that previous EU regulations discriminate
against them in favor of the EU's traditional banana suppliers in
former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean.
	   A WTO dispute panel backed the complaint and told the EU to
modify its regime. The Europeans have until Jan. 1 to comply with
the banana ruling.
	   The European Union say the changes they have made to their
policy bring it into line with WTO regulations. But the United
States and Latin Americans claim it is still discriminatory.
	   Earlier this month and under pressure from Congress, the Clinton
administration published a letter outlining possible retaliation
against the European Union if it refuses to make further changes to
its policy satisfactory to the United States, Ecuador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Mexico and Panama.
	   After going through a process of public comment, the
administration will announce on Dec. 15 its plans for retaliatory
action, a White House official said. If the EU doesn't comply,
those sanctions would go into effect no later than March 3.
	   WTO rules state that countries can take temporary measures such
as requesting compensation and suspending trade concessions if WTO
recommendations and rulings are not enforced in a set period of
time.
	   At a news conference, EU trade representative Roderick Abbott
branded as ``nonsense'' U.S. claims that the Europeans had failed
to properly implement the dispute settlement body's rulings.
	   Unilateral action such as that proposed by the United States
would be illegal and completely unacceptable, he said.
	   The United States and Latin Americans claim the European import
rules discriminate against them via a complex system of tariffs,
quotas and import licenses.
	   They have said the EU regime is costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.

Alleged knife-throwing incident under investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Parma officials maintaining it was a knife &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish club Wisla Krakow on Wednesday
disputed claims by Parma player Dino Baggio that he was struck by a
knife thrown from the stands in a UEFA Cup match.
	   At the same time, Parma officials stuck to Baggio's claim that
it was a knife that hit him in the 80th minute of Tuesday's UEFA
Cup second-round match, first-leg tie _ a 1-1 draw at Wisla.
	   ``You can see pretty well from the (television) tape that a
metal object flew out of the stands,'' managing director Michele
Uva told The Associated Press. ``According to our players it was a
knife, and I think that there was some confirmation from the
Poles.''
	   Baggio's wound required five stitches, Uva said, and Italy's
World Cup starter will be examined again Thursday to determine if
he can play in Parma's Serie A game Sunday.
	   ``It landed on his head, but it could just have easily hit an
eye or another part of the body. It is unfortunate that these
things happen,'' Uva said.
	   The Parma official said the Italian team would not contest the
results with UEFA. ``The important thing is that UEFA examines what
happened and its gravity.''
	   Baggio told the sports daily Corriere dello Sport felt a blow to
his head and ``then I saw a knife on the ground and I realized that
that was what had hit me.''
	   ``I can't believe there are people who come to stadiums with
knives,'' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I only just missed it but
thinking back to it gives me the shivers. Just think what would
have happened if it had got me in the eye.''
	   However, Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr, disputed Baggio's claim
and said police were questioning players and fans about the
incident.
	   ``Nobody has seen anything like that, including the referees,
the UEFA observers, Krakow or Parma officials,'' he said Wednesday.
	   ``We are not saying that Baggio is lying, but in our opinion it
could not have been a knife.''
	   He suggested Baggio was hit by a stone hurled by fans. Italian
reports initially identified the object as a flick knife.
	   Bobr questioned why _ if a knife were involved _ the incident
wasn't reported immediately after it happened. He said Parma
officials waited until after the match to inform UEFA officials. He
said they did not bring it up during a post-game news conference
	   He said Wilsa expressed regret to Parma over the incident but
suggested the Italians could be trying to divert attention from
their 1-1 draw against the underdog Poles.
	   ``This is certainly not a success for Parma,'' he said.
	   Poland's largest circulation newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta said two
Wisla players suggested that Baggio was hit with some ``small metal
object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife.
	   The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr
_ after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck
by an unidentified object.
	   In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said no action was
planned until a match report was in hand. He said the matter would
be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting in November.
	   ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' Gonnella
said.

Protesters occupy Mexico's embassy in Oslo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A group calling itself Zapata occupied
Mexico's embassy in Oslo on Wednesday, demanding the release of
political prisoners in the Chiapas region, the Norwegian news
agency NTB reported.
	   Oslo police confirmed an incident at the embassy, but said they
had no other immediate details about the incident or the group. The
Mexican embassy refused to comment, and referred all queries to the
police.
	   NTB said the group sent a news release in which they demanded
the immediate release of prisoners in the troubled southern Mexico
province. The state radio network NRK said the embassy did not
immediately ask police to remove the roughly 30 demonstrators.

 &UR; HARARE: eastern Congo. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   No details on the proposed offensive were immediately available.
	   Kabila failed to attend the talks in Harare Wednesday. He was
feeling unwell and sent his aide instead, said Zimbabwean
government spokesman George Charamba.
	   Zimbabwe on Tuesday acknowledged that 16 of its soldiers were
captured by Congolese rebels in the eastern town of Kabalo, the
first sign of allied involvement in that region.
	   Their capture followed the fall 11 days ago to rebels of Kindu,
a strategically important town 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest
of Goma, the rebels' eastern headquarters.
	   ``When you get into a war, you expect death and losses. But we
are fighting with determination that in spite of the setbacks, we
will achieve victory,'' Mugabe said Tuesday.
	   The allied intervention force helped fend off a rebel onslaught
on the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them
of being backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``Ugandan and Rwandese troops have not withdrawn as demanded by
the allies but continue to escalate fighting in the eastern part of
the country despite international calls for a cease fire,'' the
Zimbabwe foreign ministry said in an earlier statement on
Wednesday's summit.
	   It had said a peace initiative launched by the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity would resume in Lusaka, the Zambian
capital, on Saturday.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has begun a series of
separate meetings to revive efforts to broker a peaceful end to the
Congo conflict.
	   Mandela met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday and
planned talks with the Rwandan military strongman and vice
president, Gen. Paul Kagame, on Thursday and with the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition in the coming days.

Australia hopes to clinch first series in 39 years
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia can end a 39-year test
series skin starting Thursday, and it doesn't even have to win.
	   Having won the opener, a draw in the third and final test that
in Karachi will be good enough to become the first Australian team
to leave Pakistan with a series victory since 1959.
	   ``They haven't lost here and it's a bit of a worry for us,''
Australian captain Mark Taylor said.
	   Australia won the first test in Rawalpindi by an innings and 99
runs while the second test in Peshawar ended in a draw after Taylor
equalled Don Bradman's record for an Australian innings with an
unbeaten 334.
	   ``This time my boys are playing very good cricket and there is
no reason why we should not perform well here,'' he said. ``We will
do our best to clinch the series. I think we can certainly beat
them here.''
	   Getting the early lead will be critical according to Taylor.
	   ``Toss will be vital as whosoever wins it will definitely bat,''
predicted the 33-year-old Australian captain after seeing a flat
and dry wicket at the National Stadium.
	   ``It will definitely help spinners,'' he said. ``The pitch might
start helping the slow bowlers from day one.''
	   Although Taylor did not announce his 11, it is likely that
Darren Lehmann will be back in place of Ricky Ponting. Lehmann has
fully recovered from his groin injury which he aggravated during
the four-day match before the second test. He made successive
centuries against Rawalpindi before he retired due to groin problem
in the second innings.
	   Pakistan has dropped leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed for the final
test. However all-rounder Wasim Akram has fully recovered from
influenza and a throat infection which prevented him from playing
in the second test.
	   ``We will play positively and our aim is to stop Australian from
winning the series,'' Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail said.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Teams &QC; 
	   Pakistan: Aamir Sohail, Saeed Anwar, Ijaz Ahmed, Inzamamul Haq,
Salim Malik, Yousuf Youhanna, Moin Khan, Azhar Mahmood, Wasim

Alleged knife-throwing incident under investigation

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish club Wisla Krakow on Wednesday
disputed claims by Parma's Dino Baggio that he was struck by a
knife thrown from the stands in a UEFA Cup match.
	   At the same time, Parma officials stuck to Baggio's story that
it was a knife that glanced off his head in the 80th minute of
Tuesday's UEFA Cup second-round match, first-leg tie _ a 1-1 draw
at Wisla.
	   ``You can see pretty well from the (television) tape that a
metal object flew out of the stands,'' managing director Michele
Uva told The Associated Press. ``According to our players it was a
knife, and I think that there was some confirmation from the
Poles.''
	   Baggio's wound required five stitches, Uva said, and Italy's
World Cup starter will be examined again Thursday to determine if
he can play in Parma's Serie A game Sunday.
	   ``It landed on his head, but it could just have easily hit an
eye or another part of the body. It is unfortunate that these
things happen,'' Uva said.
	   Uva said the Italian team would not contest the results with
UEFA. ``The important thing is that UEFA examines what happened and
its gravity.''
	   Baggio told the sports daily Corriere dello Sport felt a blow to
his head and ``then I saw a knife on the ground and I realized that
that was what had hit me.''
	   ``I can't believe there are people who come to stadiums with
knives,'' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I only just missed it but
thinking back to it gives me the shivers. Just think what would
have happened if it had got me in the eye.''
	   However, Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr, disputed Baggio's claim
and said police were questioning players and fans about the
incident.
	   ``Nobody has seen anything like that, including the referees,
the UEFA observers, Krakow or Parma officials,'' he said Wednesday.
	   ``We are not saying that Baggio is lying, but in our opinion it
could not have been a knife.''
	   He suggested Baggio was hit by a stone hurled by fans. Italian
reports initially identified the object as a flick knife.
	   Bobr questioned why _ if a knife were involved _ the incident
wasn't reported immediately after it happened. He said Parma
officials waited until after the match to inform UEFA officials. He
said they did not bring it up during a post-game news conference
	   He said Wilsa expressed regret to Parma over the incident but
suggested the Italians could be trying to divert attention from
their 1-1 draw against the underdog Poles.
	   ``This is certainly not a success for Parma,'' he said.
	   Poland's largest circulation newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta said two
Wisla players suggested that Baggio was hit with some ``small metal
object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife.
	   The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr
_ after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck
by an unidentified object.
	   In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said no action was
planned until a match report was in hand. He said the matter would
be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting in November.
	   ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' Gonnella
said.

EU Commission seeks dlrs 180 million to repair tattered ties with
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The European Commission _ trying to
mollify Turkey after it was snubbed as an EU candidate _ proposed
on Wednesday to spend dlrs 180 million for industrial development
projects in Turkey and enable Ankara to make full use of a 1996
customs union with the European Union.
	   The funds, worth 150 million European currency units, would
underpin a strategy, adopted by the EU leaders in June, to pull
Turkey closer without giving it EU membership any day soon.
	   The commission asked the money be approved under an EU treaty
article requiring only a majority vote to prevent Greece from
vetoing the measure. In 1996, Athens blocked an aid package worth
375 million ecus (dlrs 450 million) accompanying the EU-Turkey
customs union.
	   The latest proposal would fund projects in the amount of 15
million ecus (dlrs 18 million) to improve Turkey's chances of
benefiting from a customs union by helping it to make its
industrial and commercial standards, laws and practices compatible
with those in the EU.
	   Another 135 million ecus (dlrs 162 million) would be for help
and know-how in energy, telecommunications, industrial
diversification, transport, private sector restructuring and
cooperation to promote democracy and human rights.
	   Greece's veto of the 1996 aid package has soured its relations
with the other 14 EU governments.
	   And their inability to get Athens to lift that veto coupled with
the refusal to consider Turkey as an EU candidate, led Ankara this
year to put relations with the EU in the freezer.
	   Though Turkey got a perspective of membership through a 1963
association accord, today's EU governments consider the country
politically and economically unready for membership in the
foreseeable future.
	   At a summit in Luxembourg last December, the EU leaders snubbed
Turkey citing its poor human rights record, territorial disputes
with Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus where it maintains
30,000 troops.
	   In stead, they have opened fast-track membership talks with
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
and ``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania
and Bulgaria.

A French court rules rape limited to sexual penetration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note content

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In a landmark ruling, a Paris court ruled Wednesday
that only sexual penetration can constitute rape.
	   The court overturned a previous decision, saying a woman was
innocent of rape because her relationship with her teen-age stepson
did not involve penetration.
	   The woman, identified only as 34-year-old Catherine M., instead
faced only aggravated sexual attack.
	   ``The material element of rape does not exist unless the author
of the crime sexually penetrates the victim,'' said the court,
presided by Judge Paul Gomez.
	   A woman can only be charged with rape if she sodomizes a man
with an object, the court added. The decision also signifies that
forced fellatio, whether given or received, is not rape, reversing
a 1997 decision.

Guinea-Bissau gov't launches offensive against rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau government forces launched
a heavy artillery barrage Wednesday against rebel positions near
the capital of the tiny west African nation, news reports said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira's troops used rocket-launchers
and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been advancing on the
center of the capital Bissau, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   A curfew was introduced late Tuesday, according to Lusa, while
thousands of residents tried to flee Bissau, heading inland or to
the Bissagos islands, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The former Portuguese colony's conflict reignited Sunday when
Mane's rebels clashed with loyalist troops near the presidential
palace, ending a three-month truce.
	   Portuguese defense analysts said both sides were trying to gain
more ground before further negotiations.
	   ``The rebels might also have wanted to eliminate (Vieira), to
settle the dispute once and for all,'' said Ana Paula Fernandes of
Lisbon's Institute of Strategic and International Studies.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by west African and Portuguese-speaking negotiators.
	   The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force
and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was reached.
	   Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent hundreds of troops to
the neighboring country to back Vieira shortly after the conflict
began in early June.
	   Citing local reports, Fernandes said Senegal has been readying
the small Bissagos airfield to receive warplanes, possibly to
launch airstrikes against rebel positions.
	   Fighting spread to the interior Tuesday, raising the possibility
of renewed civil war and increasing the plight of hundreds of
thousands of refugees throughout the country of 1 million.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

Finnish opposition calls for no-confidence vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - The main opposition Center Party on
Wednesday called a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen's government over the handling of a bank affair last year.
	   The vote, expected to be held Friday, is seen as very unlikely
to succeed. The parties in the government coalition total 145 of
the parliament's 200 seats.
	   The Center Party believes that Lipponen and a former taxation
minister, who resigned over the issue, have misled lawmakers.
	   Former Taxation Minister Arja Alho came under fire last year
when she revealed that she had lowered a 9-million-markkaa (dlrs
1.83 million) fine imposed by the Supreme Court on bank manager Ulf
Sundqvist for negligence in granting loans.
	   She approved an arrangement to cut the fine to 1.2 million
markkaa (dlrs 245,000) on the grounds that Sundqvist would likely
be unable to pay the full sum.
	   Opposition members accused Alho of giving preferential treatment
to Sundqvist, a former chairman of the Social Democratic Party now
led by Lipponen.
	   Alho, who consulted Lipponen in the matter and maintained she
acted legally, resigned on Oct. 7 after the opposition and some of
her own Social Democratic Party lawmakers demanded her ouster.
	   Recently, Finnish media have reported that according to taped
conversations acquired by them, Alho says that Lipponen was not
speaking the truth when he told lawmakers he was not behind
Sundqvist's fine reduction.
	   Lipponen maintains that he spoke the truth.
	   In October, the opposition failed to gain support for a similar
vote of no confidence when lawmakers approved _ by 136 to 57 _
Lipponen's handling of the case.

Guinea-Bissau government launches offensive against rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau government forces launched
a heavy artillery barrage Wednesday against rebel positions near
the capital of the tiny west African nation, news reports said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira's troops used rocket-launchers
and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been advancing on the
center of the capital Bissau, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   A curfew was introduced late Tuesday, according to Lusa, while
thousands of residents tried to flee Bissau, heading inland or to
the Bissagos islands, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The former Portuguese colony's conflict reignited Sunday when
Mane's rebels clashed with loyalist troops near the presidential
palace, ending a three-month truce.
	   Portuguese defense analysts said both sides were trying to gain
more ground before further negotiations.
	   ``The rebels might also have wanted to eliminate (Vieira), to
settle the dispute once and for all,'' said Ana Paula Fernandes of
Lisbon's Institute of Strategic and International Studies.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by west African and Portuguese-speaking negotiators.
	   The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force
and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was reached.
	   Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent hundreds of troops to
the neighboring country to back Vieira shortly after the conflict
began in early June.
	   Citing local reports, Fernandes said Senegal has been readying
the small Bissagos airfield to receive warplanes, possibly to
launch airstrikes against rebel positions.
	   Fighting spread to the interior Tuesday, raising the possibility
of renewed civil war and increasing the plight of hundreds of
thousands of refugees throughout the country of 1 million.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

Spanish and British governments seek distance from Pinochet

controversy &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish and British governments
appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm
brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
	   ``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a
decision for the British government or the Spanish government,''
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by
a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.
	   In a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin
Perez said Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion
about the extradition.''
	   British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back
surgery.
	   The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain
to stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his
17-year dictatorship was welcomed by human rights activists
worldwide.
	   But it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears
it could damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after
Pinochet left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in
Chile, followed closely by Britain.
	   Blair, quoted in El Mundo newspaper, said Pinochet's detention
was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical Foreign Policy,
apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within his Labor party
to support a prosecution of the former dictator.
	   ``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition
treaty but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said.
	   Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only
strictly legal criteria and act ``as if he were a judge,'' should
he be required to make a decision on an extradition request from
Spain.
	   The tone of the British Prime Minister's first public comment on
the issue contrasted sharply with Sunday's emotional statement from
influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons
would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.''
	   The European extradition convention gives Garzon 40 days to
present a formal extradition request to the British authorities via
the Spanish government.
	   But while Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised
his government would rubber stamp the process if it reaches his
desk, he appears to be hoping he will never have to do so.
	   Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appealed the
judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and
Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant.
	   ``Depending on the result of the appeals it is possible that it
(the extradition request) will never reach the government so
perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar
was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper
El Pais.
	   The appeals argue that crimes committed during Pinochet's
1973-1990 dictatorship are none of Spain's business, and should be
left to the Chilean or international courts.
	   A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision in
their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt.

Police arrest 68 after killing spree in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president's comment on killings, last 3 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they have
arrested 68 people in connection with a killing spree in which the
severed heads of some victims were carried on poles through village
streets.
	   Vigilante groups formed in the eastern end of the main island of
Java after more than 150 people, many of them Muslim clerics and
others accused of witchcraft, were mysteriously murdered.
	   Maj. Djoko Hartanto, deputy police chief in the town of Malang,
said 54 people were arrested for allegedly killing nine suspected
murderers in an outburst of mob violence.
	   Local residents have turned over to police another 14 people,
including one woman, who are also suspected of being murderers.
Hartanto said many of the detainees had mental disorders and that
police and psychiatrists were examining them.
	   On Sunday and Monday, vigilantes beheaded murder suspects and
paraded their heads on sticks. The killings in revenge attacks
began Friday in Malang and surrounding areas, about 650 kilometers
(400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Many of the victims in the mysterious killings that began in
August in the regency of Banyuwangi were alleged black-magic
practitioners and preachers or members of the 30 million-member
Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization.
	   Its leaders have called for calm and have condemned revenge
killings by vigilantes.
	   The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader
Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind
the killings.
	   Earlier, State Secretary Akbar Tandjung said President B.J.
Habibie planned to seek clarification from Wahid about the
allegation.
	   After meeting with Habibie, Tandjung said the president would
seek the clarification after Wahid recovers from illness. The
Muslim leader was admitted to a hospital Saturday, hours after
making the allegation.
	   Meanwhile, Habibie expressed his distress over the killings.
	   ``I am very concerned about what is happening,'' he said in an
interview with the state-run TVRI.
	   ``I have received reports and information regarding the killings
from BAKIN (the National Intelligence Board) as well as the
military,'' he said without elaborating.

 &UR; Robin Cook warns Milosevic, praises Macedonia's cooperation
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
had warm words for his hosts and a warning for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Macedonia Wednesday on the second leg of his
Balkan tour.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia agree to let NATO station spy
planes on its territory as part of the operation to ensure
Yugoslavia complies with an Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis
in Kosovo province.
	   Cook praised Macedonia for offering ground for the aerial
verification mission, but said it was too early to determine
whether NATO would also station troops in the region.
	   According to the agreement, signed by Milosevic and U.S.
negotiator Richard Holbrooke, the mission is to include a 2,000-men
strong verification team of unarmed observers and non-combat NATO
surveillance flights to check whether Milosevic was keeping his
promises.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' said Cook in the capital Skopje. ``We will be
watching very carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   Cook said NATO ``still hasn't reached the decision whether there
will be a need for establishing rapid reaction force.'' Until that
decision has been made, he said it would be ``premature'' to
discuss the issue.
	   Whether Macedonia agrees to offer ground to troops, already
cooperation with NATO could raise tensions in the former Yuguslav
republic _ with its own restive ethnic Albanians minority _ where
many people are opposed to the idea.
	   An opposition coalition which seems poised to win Macedonia's
two-round parliamentary elections has been against the country's
involvement in NATO actions in Kosovo. Last summer many parties
objected to hosting NATO exercise in a warning to Milosevic.
	   It was not clear whether a change of government in Macedonia
could affect its relations with NATO. Cook said ``we will work in
partnership with whichever government is chosen by the people of
Macedonia.''
	   From Macedonia Cook is to travel to Romania. Later Wednesday, in
the capital Skopje, the British minister is to meet leaders of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians who seek independence from Serb-led
Yugoslavia.

EU presidency says leaders must renew efforts to reform union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ When they meet this weekend, the EU
leaders must signal their single currency is not the end of the
line but vow to pursue reforms enabling newcomers to join the
European Union, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said Wednesday.
	   Klima, whose country holds the EU presidency, said the leaders
must show to have a firm hand on the rudder at a time of financial
crises elsewhere when they launch the euro Jan. 1 even as EU
governments are shifting leftward.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's incoming social democratic
chancellor, will join the talks Saturday at a lakeside hotel in
Poertschach, an alpine resort in southern Austria.
	   On Wednesday, the European Commission gave the leaders something
to cheer about: forecasts showing economic growth will remain
strong in 1998-2000, ``driven essentially by internal consumption
and investment.''
	   ``In 1998, EU growth is expected to be 2.9 percent, slightly
above the spring forecasts'' despite financial turmoil in Asia and
Russia, EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said.
	   Yet, citing the ``marked deterioration'' in Asia and Russia, he
cut his growth prediction for 1999 to 2.4 percent, down from 3
percent forecast last March. ``EU growth should pick up again to
2.8 percent in 2000,'' he added.
	   In a State of a the Union address to the European Parliament
here, Klima stressed the EU leaders must not feel too comfortable
about the economic outlook but press ahead with reforms to make EU
enlargement possible.
	   He said nothing about the emergence of a more liberal government
in Bonn and its effect on monetary policy.
	   Schroeder has answered calls at home for greater political
control over monetary policy by picking Lafontaine, an old-style
leftist, as finance minister. Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl
championed an ECB free from political meddling.
	   Ursula Stenzel, a German Christian Democratic member of the EU
assembly, urged Klima to invite Lafontaine to Poertschach ``so he
can tell who will run the European Central Bank (and) give signal
of a sustained, sound monetary policy'' in Germany.
	   Another new face in Poertschach will be Massimo D'Alema, an
ex-communist, who has formed a coalition government in Italy that
runs the gamut from Marxist hardliners to center-right Christian
Democrats.
	   With the imminent launch of the euro, Klima said the EU leaders
will meet this weekend at a time when the EU ``can be seen as a
pole of stability in the international monetary system.''
	   Yet he and European Commission President Jacques Santer said the
leaders must recommit to completing sensitive reforms of EU
institutions and finances needed if Cyprus and a dozen east
European nations are to join in the decade ahead.
	   ``A signal must be sent from Poertschach that a single market
and a single currency is not the end of the (EU's) journey.''
	   The EU governments disagree about making the EU budget _ worth
about dlrs 100 billion this year _ fairer to all. Germany, the
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden are insisting on a new funding
formula, complaining they pay far more to the EU than they get back
in benefits. But Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, which are net
beneficiaries, are wary of tinkering with the budget for fear of
losing income.
	   Also left unresolved have been negotiations on a new
power-sharing arrangement within the EU by ``re-weighting'' votes
for big and small countries.

Swiss authorize use of army to cope with refugee influx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government authorized the use
of the army Wednesday to help house and feed an growing flood of
refugees from Kosovo.
	   An estimated 5,000 Kosovo Albanians are expected to arrive in
Switzerland this month, pushing the number of asylum seekers to an
all-time high by the end of the year.
	   With reception centers overwhelmed, hundreds of refugees have
been forced to fend for themselves, embarrassing a country that
takes prides in its humanitarian traditions.
	   At its weekly session, the cabinet decided that from Nov. 9
soldiers would help with emergency accommodation, food and medical
care for new arrivals, as well as carrying out security duties.
	   However, Justice Minister Arnold Koller said the government had
no plans to issue blanket approval to all ethnic Albanians to stay
in the country temporarily _ as it did in the case of Bosnians
fleeing their earlier civil war. Each individual must still go
through standard asylum procedures.
	   The Swiss fear that unless other European countries relax their
controls, it will face an even bigger flood of refugees.
	   Switzerland is home to a large population of ethnic Albanians
and so has acted as a magnet to people fleeing the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year. Most are smuggled in via Italy and France,
or from eastern Europe through Germany.
	   Swiss officials maintain that the small Alpine country is
shouldering an unfairly big burden of Albanian refugees and that
its neighbors should do more to help out.
	   The Kosovo refugees pose more headaches than Bosnians who fled
their earlier civil war. In particular, whereas there was
widespread public sympathy for Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians have
traditionally had a bad reputation for drug dealing and crime.
	   However, newspaper and television images in recent days of gaunt
refugees turned away from reception centers and shivering in front
of wire fences has led to an upsurge of indignation that civil war
victims should be treated so badly.

Trial starts for retired naval officer accused of treason

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Both prosecutors and defense
lawyers expressed cautious optimism Wednesday that a retired
Russian naval officer will receive a fair trial on charges he
committed treason by exposing information about the Russian navy's
disposal of nuclear waste.
	   Alexander Nikitin pleaded that he was ``not in any way guilty,''
when his trial opened Tuesday, more than three years after he was
first charged. But he also told the judge he did not understand the
charges against him, said Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer working on
Nikitin's defense team.
	   The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking
have never been published and were shown to his lawyers for the
first time Tuesday.
	   Pavlov said that some parts of the decrees were old and not
valid under Russia's Constitution, but provided no other details
about them. The judge evicted most observers a half-hour after the
trial began.
	   Nikitin's lawyers argue that under the constitution, criminal
charges cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws.
	   Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a Norwegian
environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, which compiled a 1996
report criticizing the handling of nuclear waste and reactors in
Russia's Northern Fleet.
	   Nikitin and Bellona maintain that the information used in
compiling their report came from public records.
	   Judge Sergei Golets went through the indictment and questioned
Nikitin when the trial resumed Wednesday, said Diederik Lohman,
director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch.
	   Pavlov was positive about the day's proceedings. ``The judge
asked questions very calmly and professionally,'' he said.
	   ``The trial was held under normal working conditions,'' Nikitin
said Wednesday night. ``Nothing has actually happened yet. The
judge questioned me, and he did his job in a professional manner.''
	   ``It is hard for me to evaluate the judge's attitude, but my
lawyers said he was quite professional,'' said Nikitin, speaking by
telephone from his home.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Three southern African military allies
of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila agreed Wednesday to
mount an offensive against rebel strongholds in the east of the
vast mineral-rich country.
	   ``The east is where the sun rises and that's where we are going
militarily,'' Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe told reporters.
	   The announcement could lead to a major escalation of the
conflict that began on Aug. 2 with rebel advances aimed at toppling
Kabila. Rwanda has sent troops in support of the rebels, and Uganda
denies charges it is also backing them.
	   Mugabe acknowledged fighting in the eastern jungles familiar to
the rebels could be prolonged, costly and difficult.
	   But Kabila's allies aimed to stop the Congo conflict from
threatening the region, he said.
	   ``We will not allow ... (Congo) to fall into the hands of those
who have invaded it. Never, never. We are committed truly to this
position,'' Mugabe said.
	   Mugabe spoke after chairing a three-hour meeting with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and top Kabila
aide Victor Mpoyo.
	   No details on the proposed offensive were immediately available,
but Mugabe said the allies will fight to counter rebel gains in the
east.
	   Kabila failed to attend the talks in Harare Wednesday. He was
feeling unwell and sent his aide instead, said Zimbabwean
government spokesman George Charamba.
	   Zimbabwe on Tuesday acknowledged that 16 of its soldiers were
captured by Congolese rebels in the eastern town of Kabalo, the
first sign of allied involvement in that region.
	   Their capture followed the fall 11 days ago to rebels of Kindu,
a strategically important town 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest
of Goma, the rebels' eastern headquarters.
	   ``When you get into a war, you expect death and losses. But we
are fighting with determination that in spite of the setbacks, we
will achieve victory,'' Mugabe said Tuesday.
	   The allied intervention force helped fend off a rebel onslaught
on the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them
of being backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``Ugandan and Rwandese troops have not withdrawn as demanded by
the allies but continue to escalate fighting in the eastern part of
the country despite international calls for a cease fire,'' the
Zimbabwe foreign ministry said in an earlier statement on
Wednesday's summit.
	   It had said a peace initiative launched by the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity would resume in Lusaka, the Zambian
capital, on Saturday.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has begun a series of
separate meetings to revive efforts to broker a peaceful end to the
Congo conflict.
	   Mandela met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday and
planned talks with the Rwandan military strongman and vice
president, Gen. Paul Kagame, on Thursday and with the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition in the coming days.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday
Turkey was remaining cautious towards neighboring Syria despite a
deal with Damascus to crack down on a Kurdish rebel group.
	   Turkey and Syria stuck the deal Tuesday, ending a weeks-long
standoff. Under the deal, Syria agreed to brand the Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK, a ``terrorist'' group and to clamp down its activity
in Syria.
	   ``These results are very important,'' Cem told a group of
businessmen.''But we have to be careful about their applications.
We shall be observing developments with caution.''
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
had left Syria for Russia, which would be a sign Damascus was
meeting Turkish demands. Sabah newspaper he was hiding in
Odintsovo, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow. Russian
officials, however, said they had no information on Ocalan entering
Russia.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984
in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The wing of a passenger jet sliced a
minibus on the runway at Armenia's main airport on Wednesday,
killing four army troops in the bus.
	   The Yak-40 jetliner, bound for Krasnodar in southern Russia with
30 passengers on board, was taking off from Yerevan when it hit the
minibus, the Armenian government's press service said.
	   It was unclear why the bus was on the runway.
	   Two people on the bus were killed instantly and another two
later died in a hospital. Five other troops on the bus have been
hospitalized with light wounds.
	   No one aboard the plane was injured. An official investigation

German industry, chancellor-elect consider slave-labor fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder was
to meet Wednesday evening with German bank and industry leaders to
discuss setting up a foundation to settle back-wage claims from
World War II-era slave laborers.
	   Neither Schroeder's office nor the companies would comment ahead
of the meeting. A spokeswoman for Schroeder described the talks as
``absolutely confidential.''
	   Among the businesses represented were electronics giant Siemens
and Deutsche and Dresdner banks.
	   A Greens lawmaker close to the issue, Volker Beck, said the fund
would seek to ``satisfy the right to compensation for unpaid wages
of all forced laborers, and in return offer legal security to the
industry'' against future lawsuits.
	   Schroeder announced plans for joint government-industry fund
Tuesday in a break with long-standing Germany policy.
	   The German government has paid billions in compensation to
Holocaust victims for health damage and imprisonment. But it had
rejected claims for back wages from slave laborers, saying the
companies involved were responsible.
	   Most German firms, though, argued the workers were forced on
them by the Nazis and so the current government, as legal successor
to the Nazi regime, should be responsible.
	   Yet lawsuits pending in the United States and threats of more at
home prompted suggestions this year from some for an industry-wide
fund to settle the claims.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The United States is determined to see
Caspian oil transported through Turkey and will continue efforts to
make the Baku-Ceyhan route a reality, Undersecretary of State
Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday.
	   ``Overall, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from
environmental, economic and strategic standpoints,'' Eizenstat told
reporters.
	   Eizenstat's statements followed an announcement that the U.S.
Export-import Bank has offered a dlrs 827,000 loan to help finance
a pipeline linking the Azeri capital of Baku to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
	   Another dlrs 823,000 grant from a U.S. trade and development
agency for consultant services will be signed shortly, said
Eizenstat, who was in Turkey for a meeting of the U.S.-Turkey Joint
Economic Commission.
	   ``No one should underestimate our determination to make
Baku-Ceyhan a reality,'' he said.
	   Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to
make a final decision on the pipeline route on October 29.
	   According to some reports, the companies may favor shorter and
cheaper routes, including pipelines already being built from
Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, or
an enlarged pipeline along the same route.
	   Turkey strongly objects to the proposals because they would
require the oil to be loaded into tankers and shipped through
Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, which would increase the risk of
oil tanker accidents.
	   ``We cannot turn our straits into a virtual pipeline just
because some oil companies want to make more money,'' Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday.
	   The Turkish proposal for a 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline
would cost dlrs 2.5 billion dlrs. Turkey has said it would
construct part of the pipeline on its own but it was not clear if
the offer would help tip the balance in Turkey's favor.
	   Eizenstat also praised the preliminary agreement reached Tuesday
between Turkey and Turkmenistan to build a pipeline to carry
Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.

Cyprus supports Syria in its conflict with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Visiting Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides on Wednesday reiterated his country's support for Syria
in its conflict with Turkey over Kurdish rebels, Egypt's news
agency reported.
	   Kasoulides, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, met
with Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
	   The Middle East News Agency quoted Kasoulides as saying after
the meetings that Cyprus supports Syria's stance and rejects the
language of threats and force as a method to solve problems between
countries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria ran high during the past weeks
after Ankara threatened to use military force to stop what it
called Syria's sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Cyprus also has been at loggerheads with Turkey since 1974 when
Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied the northern third of the
island.
	   The Turkey-Syria dispute appears to be waning now after Turkey
said Syria has signed an agreement to ensure that Kurdish
guerrillas do not stage cross-border attacks on Turkey.
	   The Syrian government has not acknowledged signing the agreement
but its official news agency, SANA, on Wednesday branded Kurdish
rebels as terrorists and said Syria has pledged to deny them access
to Turkish territories.
	   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between Turkey and
Syria to help ease the tensions. Kasoulides is scheduled to meet
with Mubarak later.
	   ``We are happy that we were able to participate and contribute
in easing tension between the two countries,'' Moussa, the foreign
minister, said.

Malaysia's top editors voice support for government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The editors of Malaysia's biggest
English-language dailies said Wednesday they needed to provide
glowing coverage of the government to help the country pull out of
its economic doldrums.
	   Wong Chun Wai, editor of the widely-read newspaper Star, said
the local media must help develop the country by providing
``positive information which would create harmony,'' the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   When asked why the Malaysian print and electronic media appeared
docile, Wong told reporters at an editors forum in northern
Malaysia that such coverage would enable the government to
``overcome economic problems.''
	   The Malaysian media are severely circumscribed by a law against
sedition, which forbids reporting on issues that the government
considers a threat to national security.
	   Most big newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by the
government and are required to obtain an operating license annually
under a law dating from British colonial days. The government can
revoke the license at any time.
	   Rather than face the prospect of being shuttered, many dailies
in recent weeks have muted their coverage of the tumult surrounding
jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked after opposing his
former boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   As public dissent against Mahathir grows, the government has
repeatedly accused the foreign press of bias, scheming to overthrow
Mahathir's 17-year rule and giving favorable coverage to his bitter
foe, Anwar.
	   Kadir Jasin, an influential columnist and editor of the New
Straits Times daily, said that although most of the major media
groups were independent or publicly listed companies, all of them
backed Mahathir's administration.
	   ``Although we are independent and not beholden to the
government, most of the time we want to support the government,''
he said. ``The government may not be too perfect but it is not too
bad either.''
	   Malaysians looking for the opposition viewpoint can read
publications by activists on the Internet or Harakah, the newspaper
of the Parti Islam SeMalaysia.
	   On Wednesday, the government warned the editor of Harakah, which
has increased its circulation since the pro-Anwar campaign began,
not to sell at newsstands.
	   The editor of the publication was summoned to the Home Ministry
to explain why the party newsletter was being sold publicly as a
daily newspaper, an official said. He did not say when the editor
was called in.

Ukraine's gas supplier cuts off thousands of debtors

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS figure in 2nd graf to 2.8 billion hryvna sted

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Facing mounting consumer debts, Ukraine's
Naftogas company has cut off gas to thousands of industries, state
institutions and distributors catering to public needs, the
company's deputy chairman said Wednesday.
	   Taras Freiuk told a Cabinet meeting that various consumers have
paid his state-run company 2.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 816 million at
the current rate) for gas supplied so far in 1998.
	   But they owe another 3.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 991 million) for
1998 gas supplies and a total of 11.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.44
billion), including debts from previous years, Freiuk said.
	   He said his company already has cut off 13,700 debtors, thus
reducing recent gas consumption by 12 percent, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   But the measure might be short-lived when it comes to public
consumption, which amounts to about 25 percent of the total. The
government has pledged to issue an order forbidding suppliers to
cut gas to distributors serving the general public during the
winter.
	   Also Wednesday, First Deputy Premier Anatoliy Holubchenko
suggested that the government would pay its debts to
state-supported regions with gas _ not cash.

British minister warns Milosevic, praises Macedonia's cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
had warm words for his hosts and a warning for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Macedonia Wednesday on the second leg of his
Balkan tour.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia permitted NATO to station spy
planes on its territory as part of efforts to ensure Yugoslavia
complies with an Oct. 12 agreement to defuse violence between
Yugoslav forces and separatist Albanians in its Kosovo province.
	   Cook praised Macedonia for its cooperation, and said it was too
early to say whether NATO also would seek to station troops in the
region.
	   The Kosovo agreement, signed by Milosevic and U.S. negotiator
Richard Holbrooke, calls for 2,000 unarmed observers in Kosovo as
well as NATO surveillance flights to check whether Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' Cook said in the capital, Skopje. ``We will be
watching very carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   Whether or not Macedonia offers ground for NATO troops, its
cooperation already with NATO could raise tensions in the former
Yugoslav republic, which has its own restive ethnic Albanian
minority. An opposition coalition which seems poised to win
Macedonia's parliamentary elections has opposed involvement in NATO
actions in Kosovo.
	   Cook said ``we will work in partnership with whichever
government is chosen by the people of Macedonia.''
	   Cook also was to meet with Kosovo Albanian leaders in Skopje
before traveling to Romania.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Alberto Tomba will appear next month
before a magistrate who must decide whether the former skiing star
will stand trial on charges of tax fraud, the ANSA news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Tomba's sister and spokeswoman, Alessia, told The Associated
Press she did not know about the Nov. 26 court date.
	   Court officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Tomba, a three-time Olympic champion who retired earlier this
month, has long been under investigation for hiding income. In
July, a Bologna prosecutor asked for indictments of Tomba and his
parents, alleging a failure to pay taxes on 23 billion lire (dlrs
14 million) in income between 1990-96. Franco Tomba is his son's
business manager.
	   Tax fraud is punishable in Italy by up to five years in prison
and fines.

Premier vows `not a step back' from EMU goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's socialist premier vowed Wednesday
his government will not back down from its goal of joining European
economic and monetary union by 2001, despite his party losing
ground in local and municipal elections last week.
	   ``For us the message of the election outcome is clear: not a
step back, not even a compromise,'' Premier Costas Simitis told his
parliamentary group. ``We have undertaken the commitment that in
2000 we will have met targets for EMU and we will succeed.''
	   In a vote widely interpreted as a referendum on government
policies, the ruling socialist party emerged wounded in Sunday's
run-off elections for municipal and provincial leaders, losing
ground to the conservative opposition.
	   All major cities elected conservative candidates while the
opposition also outran socialists in the total number of provincial
governors elected.
	   The result has been interpreted as reflecting disenchantment
with the government's economic austerity measures designed to earn
the European Union's poorest country a spot in the bloc's single
currency group.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU which failed to
qualify for the first round of EMU. Britain, Denmark and Sweden
opted out of joining.
	   Dismissing mounting pressure from party dissidents to soften his
platform, Simitis said his policies have shielded the country from
repercussions of global financial turmoil.
	   ``Our policy bears fruit, which is evident for the whole of
society,'' he said. ``That's why there isn't going to be any change
in the program the Greek people approved in 1996 and which we will
complete in 2000. Not even a millimeter of my political stance will
change.''
	   The next national election is scheduled for September 2000, when
Simitis's four-year term in power ends.
	   ``We will not jeopardize the Greek people's sacrifices to be
liked,'' Simitis said.

Earl Spencer's former wife says ``I'm an addict''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Opening an addiction treatment
center, Countess Spencer, the former wife of the late Princess
Diana's brother, has admitted she is a drug addict and suffered
from an eating disorder, a newspaper reported on Wednesday.
	   Former model Victoria Lockwood, 32, was making her first public
appearance in Cape Town since her bitter divorce from Earl Charles
Spencer at the city's High Court last year.
	   ``I'm an addict, an alcoholic and an anorexic,'' she said at the
opening of the Stepping Stones treatment center Tuesday, the Cape
Times newspaper reported.
	   ``Addiction is a disease,'' she said ``It is not a respecter of
age, color, class or creed and it causes your loved ones despair
and pain.''
	   Lady Spencer, who has acknowledged suffering from eating
disorders and drug and alcohol problems in the past, had four
children by Charles Spencer before they divorced.
	   The case was eventually settled out of court in Cape Town and
Lady Spencer received 1.8 million pounds (dlrs 3 million).
	   However, she is suing the law firm in Britain that advised her
before her divorce, saying she missed out on a much bigger figure
by reaching the agreement in South Africa rather than in London.
	   The couple moved to Cape Town in 1995.

Bosnia needs NATO-led troops more than ever, Westendorp says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The international envoy to Bosnia said
Wednesday the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia should remain
at least at current levels throughout next year.
	   ``It is impossible to evaluate exactly how many troops are
needed in Bosnia ... but a drastic cutdown is not an option,''
Carlos Westendorp told reporters at NATO headquarters.
	   He said over the next two years an ``important'' troop presence
will be vital in Bosnia. ``The situation in Bosnia is improving but
there are still many problems to be overcome,'' Westendorp said.
	   There are currently 30,000 international troops in Bosnia. Since
the NATO-led force was first deployed in Bosnia in December 1995,
the number of troops has been cut by half.
	   NATO ambassadors are currently reviewing the troop situation as
part of an agreement last June to have an assessment every six
months.
	   Westendorp said the force will be crucial to help Bosnian
refugees feel secure enough to return to their homes, particularly
those returning to areas where they represent an ethnic minority.
	   The return of these refugees to their homes will be ``the main
test of reconciliation'' in Bosnia, he said.
	   Other priorities include a reform of the judiciary, the military
and the police system.
	   Asked whether he thinks the conflict in the Serb province of
Kosovo has an influence on Bosnia, Westendorp said some 10,000
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo have arrived in Bosnia via Montenegro.
Most of them are near Sarajevo.
	   The repercussions so far are relatively minor but the Kosovo
conflict ``may have serious repercussions in the future,''
Westendorp warned.

Islamic satellite channel aims to combat Western fare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An Islamic satellite
television channel was launched Wednesday with the aim of
countering the dominance of ``decadent'' Western TV programs in the
Gulf.
	   The channel Iqra is owned by the Arab Radio and Television
company and is the brainchild of the Saudi millionaire, Saleh
Kamel. It will be broadcast free to dish-owners in the Middle East,
Africa and Europe.
	   ``We aim to present entertaining programs that are devoid of
decadence and impropriety and are appropriate for viewing by Muslim
families,'' said a company statement.
	   The statement said Iqra wanted to combat corruptive television
fare and be a force for unity among Muslims.
	   Iqra, which means `read' in Arabic, was the first word that the
arch-angel Gabriel is said to have spoken to Islam's Prophet
Mohammed. Muslims believe that Islam's first miracle happened when
Mohammed, who was illiterate, suddenly began to read.
	   Islam and Christianity have many of the same saints and Gabriel
is known by Muslims as Jibril.
	   Iqra's director, Abdul-Qader Tash, said the channel hoped
eventually to reach all of the world's one billion Muslims.
	   ``We have a message we want to spread and our aim is to make
Iqra available to as many people as possible,'' Tash told The
Associated Press. ``Our aim is not commercial gain.''
	   Arab Radio and Television operates a satellite pay cable network
with six Arabic language entertainment and news channels. Kamel
owns 70 percent of the company while another Saudi tycoon, Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal, owns 30 percent.
	   Tash said Iqra would promote a moderate brand of Islam.
	   It would also address the concerns of Muslims who want to
maintain their religious identity while navigating the 21st
century, the statement said.
	   Iqra will initially broadcast eight hours a day of children's
programs, game shows, soap operas, economic programs and religious
talk shows, a spokesman said.
	   The children's programs will include animated cartoons with an
Islamic theme produced at ART's studios in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan, said the spokesman. The cartoons will recount the lives of
historic Islamic figures and some will be set in the time of the
prophet, the 7th century.
	   Satellite dishes dot millions of rooftops in the conservative
oil-rich Gulf and other Middle Eastern countries, receiving Western
broadcasts that feature lifestyles contrary to Islamic teaching,
which bans alcohol, nudity and mixing among the sexes.

Volvo's nine-month profit falls 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker Volvo reported
Wednesday that its nine-month pre-tax profit dropped 27 percent
from the same period a year earlier, largely due to significantly
weaker demand in Southeast Asia.
	   The company recorded pre-tax profit for the period ending Sept.
30 of 7.79 billion kronor (dlrs 993 million), compared with 10.72
billion kronor for the first nine months in 1997.
	   Sales in Asia fell by 27 percent, to 8.64 billion kronor (dlrs
1.1 billion) while sales in other areas grew, up 31 percent in
North America to 46.87 billion (dlrs 5.97 billion) and up 14
percent in Western Europe to 82.44 billion kronor (dlrs 10.5
billion).
	   But the company said its profits were affected not only by the
decline in Asian sales but also by a shift in demand to products
with lower profit margins.
	   In addition, Volvo has endured higher costs for product
development, start-up of production and the launch of new products.
	   Volvo has matched the growth strategy that was presented in
1997, but the global scenario that formed the basis for that
strategy didn't include the current turbulence in financial markets
and the deep crisis in certain geographical markets, Volvo's Chief
Executive Leif Johansson said in a written comment.
	   ``If the turbulence and crises continue and result in a
declining total market, measures will have to be taken to adapt the
Group's level of costs to smaller volumes,'' Johansson said.

New plan: If kids skip school, send parents to classes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Parents could wind up back in
school if their kids regularly skip class as part of a new
government plan to tackle youth crime.
	   Parents of children who constantly play hooky can be fined under
Dutch law. But with about 30,000 reports of truancy each year, the
government is looking for a more effective solution.
	   One suggestion is for courts to slap parents with a schooling
order _ the equivalent of unpaid community service _ the Dutch
daily NRC Handelsblad reported Wednesday, citing unidentified civil
servants at the Justice Ministry.
	   The classes for parents, being put together by education experts
at Leiden University, would include lessons on how the school
system works, keeping track of your child's timetable and a class
called ``puberty psychology.''
	   Three Dutch cities plan to offer the courses on a voluntary
basis to parents of truants. If the classes help to reduce truancy,
they may be used as a form of sanction by the courts, the newspaper
said.

Music division posts sharp gain, but film division slipping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PolyGram NV's third-quarter net
profit soared 95 percent on strong growth in its music division,
but the Dutch entertainment group said Wednesday its film section
continued to slip.
	   PolyGram's Chief Executive Officer Jan Cook also said the sale
of the company to Canada's Seagram Co. has received approval from
U.S. regulatory authorities, and is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter of this year.
	   Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled 166
million guilders (dlrs 90 million), up from 85 million guilders
(dlrs 46 million) in the same period a year ago, PolyGram said.
	   In its music division, PolyGram posted a sharp third-quarter
operating profit rise of 44 percent to 248 million guilders (dlrs
135 million), up from 172 million guilders (dlrs 93 million) in the
year-ago period.
	   The company attributed the increase to stronger international
and local releases, lower marketing costs and restructuring.
	   PolyGram's shares jumped on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on news
of the strong earnings and were trading up 5.7 percent at midday.
	   The company's best-selling album came from Sheryl Crow, whose
release `` The Globe Sessions'' has sold 1.5 million copies. For
the remainder of 1998, Polygram's music highlights will include
releases from Bryan Adams and Metallica and greatest hits albums
from U2 and Dire Straits.
	   Blaming ``higher provisions'' for non-performing films, PolyGram
said operating loss at its film division swelled to 77 million
guilders (dlrs 42 million) from 42 million guilders (dlrs 23
million) in the third quarter of 1997.
	   PolyGram added that while overall sales in financially troubled
Asia plunged 21 percent from the third quarter of 1997, the region
has remained profitable due to sustained profitability in Japan and
Taiwan.
	   In the film division, upcoming attractions include ``Very Bad
Things,'' starring Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz, and the
international release of ``Elizabeth'' and ``What Dreams May
Come.''
	   Premieres slated for 1999 include ``The Green Mile,'' starring
Tom Hanks, and ``Notting Hill'' which showcases Julia Roberts and
Hugh Grant.

Bold general, brash goalkeeper play political `futbol' in Paraguay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PEDRO SERVIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Squaring off with opponents comes
naturally for world renown goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert of
Paraguay. Now, he's been playing ``political futbol'' with a
controversial general.
	   Chilavert has threatened to sit out next year's Copa America in
his homeland and even talked of quitting the national team _ if
former Gen. Lino Oviedo isn't replaced as the chief organizer of
the South American championship.
	   ``For now, I'm not sure if I will continue with the team,''
Chilavert said after Oviedo's appointment. ``I'm very disappointed
with the selection of Oviedo. Everyone knows he's not exactly a
democrat.''
	   A former presidential candidate, Oviedo was jailed last year,
convicted of trying to overthrow Paraguay's young democracy during
an April 1996 political crisis. When new President Raul Cubas
overturned the conviction in August, Oviedo went free.
	   Cubas, a close friend and Oviedo's former running mate, named
him the Copa America coordinator shortly after his controversial
release.
	   In volatile Paraguay, few people inspire outright passion or
disdain like the 54-year-old Oviedo _ except for perhaps Chilavert
himself.
	   Many see the former general as a holdover from a troubled past,
when Paraguay had the region's longest running dictatorship. For
others, Chilavert is a loudmouth star who plays professionally in
neighboring Argentina but has a tendency to meddle all over.
	   ``If it was up to me, both of them would stay out of the Copa
America,'' said sales clerk Maria Eugenia Martinez. She called
Chilavert ``arrogant'' and Oviedo ``a man of broken promises.''
	   Chilavert is known to fire off opinions with the force of his
powerful free kicks on everything from opposing players and team
strategies to politics.
	   Paraguayan soccer officials insist that losing Chilavert, whom
many consider the world's best goalkeeper, wouldn't trouble them.
	   ``His decision doesn't worry us because we have three excellent
goalkeepers to replace him,'' said Jose Medina, an official with
the Paraguayan Football League _ the national federation.
	   Luis Escobar, a truck driver, seconded that emotion, saying if
Chilavert stays away, it won't make much difference to most
Paraguayans.
	   ``He plays in Argentina and almost nobody here has seen him
play,'' he said. ``If he doesn't come, fine.''
	   Oviedo shows no signs of backing down: he joked that if
Chilavert decides not to wear the country's red and green jersey,
he just might throw it on.
	   ``If Chilavert doesn't want to keep playing goalkeeper for
Paraguay, then I'll play,'' Oviedo told a crowd in Ciudad del Este
during a stadium inspection there. ``I don't know why he insists on
criticizing me.''
	   Since his release, Oviedo has returned to the countryside where
he ran a short-lived presidential campaign. But instead of seeking
votes, he's pushing Copa America.
	   With the tournament tentatively scheduled for July 1-18,
officials of CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, are
worried that Paraguay's effort may not come together in time.
CONMEBOL has threatened to move the tournament to Colombia,
scheduled to host the tournament in 2001.
	   Oviedo has a difficult task: organizers are grappling with a
shortage of funds, an array of decrepit stadiums, not to mention
Paraguay's highly underdeveloped infrastructure.
	   But Oviedo is only half the goalkeeper's problem with Copa
America. Chilavert insists the billions of guaranies (millions of
dollars) needed for the tournament could be better spent rebuilding
one of South America's poorest countries.
	   Paraguay emerged from the 35-year dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner only a decade ago, but is struggling to raise living
standards. Per capita income is just over dlrs 1,500 annually.
	   ``Instead of building stadiums, the government should be
building schools and hospitals to help the poor,'' said Chilavert,
sounding like he one day might run for office.
	   ``There are no hospitals or medicine. These are things they
should be tending to.''
	   Meanwhile, Oviedo insists he's not playing politics.
	   In Ciudad del Este, he was met by over 600 people, many seeking
work on stadium renovation projects.
	   ``My work with the Copa Amrica will be limited to seeing that
we're able to have good stadiums, roads, and an efficient
communications system,'' he said.
	   And Oviedo says he'll take credit for Chilavert being able to
speak his mind.
	   ``If he talks too much it's because I helped bring liberty and
democracy to Paraguay,'' Oviedo boasted, referring to his role in
the 1989 overthrow of Stroessner.

an interview published Wednesday that the authorities are planning
to kill him, and insisted that allegations of corruption against
him were unfounded.
	   ``As the youngest prime minister of independent Ukraine, I've
committed mistakes, of course,'' opposition lawmaker Pavlo
Lazarenko told the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   ``But I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me.''
	   Lazarenko, who leads the centrist opposition Hromada party in
parliament, is at the center of a corruption probe focusing on his
time as prime minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine.
	   They claim Lazarenko gave preferential status to a private gas
and energy trader, Unified Energy Systems (UES), headed at the time
by Julia Tymoshenko, now a Hromada ally.
	   The company recently lost an appeal in the Supreme Arbitration
Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine imposed by
tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally transferring abroad
dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   Last month, authorities also charged a prominent Hromada
activist and former senior government official, Mykola Syvulskiy,
with abusing his position and embezzlement for transferring more
than dlrs 5 million from the accounts of state gas company
Ukrgazprom to UES.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and the tax
fine have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically
motivated and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close
supporters. Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later
fired him.
	   In his interview, Lazarenko said he was dismissed by Kuchma in
1997 for refusing to take part in ``introducing an economic measure
that would have cost the taxpayers dearly but could bring serious
dividends to some people.'' Lazarenko did not elaborate.
	   He said the campaign against him became more intense after
Hromada and the Communist-led opposition in parliament tried
unsuccessfully last week to bring down the Cabinet.
	   ``The plans of the authorities are first to discredit me as a
politician and then to eliminate me physically,'' Lazarenko told
Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   Lazarenko said he had evidence to back up his allegations, but
gave no details.
	   Lazarenko recalled a 1996 incident in which a bomb exploded near
his car in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. At the time, Lazarenko
blamed leaders of the large coal industry for trying to assassinate
him.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the case, but the investigation is still
underway.

Islamic satellite channel aims to combat Western fare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An Islamic satellite
television channel was launched Wednesday with the aim of
countering the dominance of ``decadent'' Western TV programs in the
Gulf.
	   The channel Iqra is owned by the Arab Radio and Television
company and is the brainchild of Saudi millionaire Saleh Kamel. It
will be broadcast free to dish-owners in the Middle East, Africa
and Europe.
	   ``We aim to present entertaining programs that are devoid of
decadence and impropriety and are appropriate for viewing by Muslim
families,'' said a company statement.
	   The statement said Iqra wanted to combat corruptive television
fare and be a force for unity among Muslims.
	   Iqra, which means `read' in Arabic, was the first word that the
arch-angel Gabriel is said to have spoken to Islam's Prophet
Mohammed. Muslims believe that Islam's first miracle happened when
Mohammed, who was illiterate, suddenly began to read. Islam and
Christianity have many of the same saints and Gabriel is known by
Muslims as Jibril.
	   Iqra's director, Abdul-Qader Tash, said the channel hoped
eventually to reach all of the world's one billion Muslims.
	   ``We have a message we want to spread and our aim is to make
Iqra available to as many people as possible,'' Tash told The
Associated Press. ``Our aim is not commercial gain.''
	   Arab Radio and Television operates a satellite pay cable network
with six Arabic language entertainment and news channels. Kamel
owns 70 percent of the company while another Saudi tycoon, Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal, owns 30 percent.
	   Tash said Iqra would promote a moderate brand of Islam.
	   It would also address the concerns of Muslims who want to
maintain their religious identity while navigating the 21st
century, the statement said.
	   Iqra will initially broadcast eight hours a day of children's
programs, game shows, soap operas, economic programs and religious
talk shows, a spokesman said.
	   The children's programs will include animated cartoons with an
Islamic theme produced at ART's studios in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan, the spokesman said. The cartoons will recount the lives of
historic Islamic figures and some will be set in the time of the
prophet, the 7th century.
	   Satellite dishes dot millions of rooftops in the conservative
oil-rich Gulf and other Middle Eastern countries, receiving Western
broadcasts that feature lifestyles contrary to Islamic teaching,
which bans alcohol, nudity and mixing among the sexes.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two leaders in the militant Palestinian group
Hamas were found guilty Wednesday and sentenced to life in prison
for the killing of an Israeli soldier and plotting a suicide
bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe.
	   Abdel Rahman Ghenimat received five consecutive life sentences
plus an additional 20 years and Jamal Hor received five consecutive
life sentences plus an additional 18 year sentence.
	   The two men ran a Hamas cell from their West Bank village of
Zurif, north of Hebron. The group has been blamed for three
drive-by shootings, the abduction and slaying of an Israeli
soldier, and a March 1997 suicide bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that
killed three women.
	   Ghenimat and Hor were captured by Israeli troops last November
while Palestinian police were transferring them from one West Bank
jail to another. The Palestinian Authority had previously refused
requests to hand the two over to Israel.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and has claimed
responsibility for scores of deadly attacks on Israelis including a
grenade attack earlier this week which injured 64 people in a
southern Israeli city.

EU to decide whether Vatican can issue euros
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French, Vatican and EU comment

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As it prepares to launch the euro, the European
Union is trying to decide what to do about small states that issue
their own coins, including whether Pope John Paul II can be on a
Vatican euro.
	   A French newspaper reported Wednesday that Paris would not
recognize any euro coins stamped with the pope when the single
currency hits the streets in 2002.
	   A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she was not aware of
the dispute reported by the daily Liberation, and the Vatican
denied it had any immediate plans to stamp pope euros.
	   But at the EU finance directorate, spokesman Patrick Child said
the Vatican is only one of the states at issue. The EU must also
decide what to do about San Marino, also inside Italy, and Monaco,
which uses French francs.
	   ``It's true there's ongoing work on how to treat specific
cases,'' Child said in a telephone interview.
	   ``What sort of monetary relation should they have with the EU,
and whether they should use the euro as a currency, what sort of
designation will they have?'' he said.
	   Child said the issue has on the agenda for a past finance
officials' meeting but has yet to be resolved. He did not say when
he expected a decision.
	   Liberation said the issue was expected to be taken up at an EU
finance ministers' meeting on Nov. 23. Child said that was up to
Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   The euro takes effect among 11 of the 15 EU nations at the end
of the year but does not replace national paper and coin currency
until 2002.

Finnish opposition calls for no-confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads thoruhgout to CORRECT that Alho resignation and previous
no-confidence vote took place last year. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - The main opposition Center Party on
Wednesday called a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen's government over the handling of a bank affair last year.
	   The vote, expected to be held Friday, is seen as very unlikely
to succeed. The parties in the government coalition total 145 of
the parliament's 200 seats.
	   The Center Party believes that Lipponen and a former taxation
minister, who resigned over the issue, have misled lawmakers.
	   Former Taxation Minister Arja Alho came under fire last year
when she revealed that she had lowered a 9-million-markkaa (dlrs
1.83 million) fine imposed by the Supreme Court on bank manager Ulf
Sundqvist for negligence in granting loans.
	   She approved an arrangement to cut the fine to 1.2 million
markkaa (dlrs 245,000) on the grounds that Sundqvist would likely
be unable to pay the full sum.
	   Opposition members accused Alho of giving preferential treatment
to Sundqvist, a former chairman of the Social Democratic Party now
led by Lipponen.
	   Alho, who consulted Lipponen in the matter and maintained she
acted legally, resigned last October after the opposition and some
of her own Social Democratic Party lawmakers demanded her ouster.
	   Recently, Finnish media have reported that according to taped
conversations acquired by them, Alho says that Lipponen was not
speaking the truth when he told lawmakers he was not behind
Sundqvist's fine reduction.
	   Lipponen maintains that he spoke the truth.
	   In October 1997, the opposition failed to gain support for a
similar vote of no confidence when lawmakers approved _ by 136 to
57 _ Lipponen's handling of the case.

False sexual rumours still haunt Keating, former colleague says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australian (AP) _ Australia's former most senior
public official gave evidence to a court Wednesday about false
rumors that former Prime Minister Paul Keating had had an
extramarital affair and liked young boys.
	   Former Governor-General Bill Hayden said the rumors were untrue
and showed the kind of damage that could be done to politicians'
reputations by sex rumors.
	   Hayden, who before becoming governor-general was a politician of
the same party as Keating, the Labor Party, appeared as a witness
in a defamation case launched by two ministers in the now
conservative government.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello, his wife Tanya, and Employment
Services Minister Tony Abbott and his wife, Margaret, are suing
publisher Random House over the book ``Good-bye Jerusalem'' by
Labor Party author and speechwriter Bob Ellis.
	   The book falsely accused the two ministers of changing their
political allegiances to the Liberal Party after they slept with a
woman whom one of them later married.
	   The book was withdrawn from sale and Ellis has offered an
apology.
	   Hayden told the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court that
despite Ellis' acknowledgment the claims were false, the lies would
continue to haunt Abbott and Costello throughout their political
lives.
	   ``I thought that they had been extraordinarily damaged as a
result of this book,'' Hayden said.
	   The allegations may be resurrected if Costello challenges Prime
Minister John Howard for the leadership of the Liberal Party in the
future, he said.
	   Hayden said he had recently reheard false sexual smears against
Keating that had earlier circulated about him.
	   ``These stories still go on. I had a call not long ago ...
unfortunate rumors about Paul Keating when he was defeated, that he
was having an affair with a prominent woman of this country,'' he
said.
	   The rumors became so widespread the woman had to issue a public
statement denying them, he said.
	   He said that Keating being seen having lunch with his teen-age
son had sparked further false allegations ``that something had
happened to him, that he had a predilection for young men.''
	   Hayden was called to give evidence because he spoke to the
Abbotts about the rumors last year, after reading the offending
passage.
	   Abbott told the court his desire to ensure no one ever placed
any credence in the lies was behind his determination to seek
substantial damages from the publisher, and not just an apology.
	   Keating's office said he would not comment on Hayden's remarks.
	   The governor-general is the queen's representative and the
titular head of state in Australia.

Outgoing chancellor Helmut Kohl to stay on in official residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will
stay on in the official bungalow he has occupied for 16 years even
after he leaves office next week, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The new tenant, Gerhard Schroeder, doesn't mind. With the
government returning to its prewar capital Berlin by the middle of
next year, he's not planning to make a home in the Rhine River city
anyway.
	   Kohl will pay 2,600 marks (dlrs 1,620) a month rent to stay on
with his wife, Hannelore, in the residential half of the
chancellor's bungalow indefinitely. The other half will be
available for Schroeder for official meetings and entertaining.
	   The bungalow has only one kitchen, and it wasn't immediately
clear if the political rivals will bump into each other during late
night refrigerator raids; Schroeder hasn't said where he plans to
live while in Bonn.
	   In any case, Kohl and his wife will use a separate entrance.
	   Schroeder's wife Doris plans to remain in Hanover to minimize
disruption for her 7-year-old daughter Klara. Until Schroeder moves
the government and his family to Berlin, he will be splitting time
between the family apartment in Hanover and a bachelor retreat in
Bonn.
	   A spokesman cautioned, however, that comments by Schroeder that
he planned to set up a temporary commune in Bonn for his ministers
was strictly a joke.

'Spywatcher' would monitor Britain's intelligence agencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A government committee on Wednesday said it
planned to appoint a ``spywatcher'' to monitor and investigate
wrongdoing by Britain's intelligence and security forces.
	   The annual report from Parliament's Intelligence and Security
Committee, which oversees the work of the MI5 and MI6 intelligence
agencies, said it would establish its own investigative arm next
year.
	   The investigative arm also would monitor the Government
Communications Headquarters, Britain's top secret
intelligence-gathering facility.
	   The committee's chairman, former Conservative Cabinet Minister
Tom King, said appointing investigators would be an ``important
element'' in establishing public confidence.
	   The move comes at a time of heightened concern about the
agencies following allegations by two ``whistleblowers'' alleging
widespread incompetence and illicit activity. One claimed the MI6
attempted to assassinate Libya's President Moammar Gaddafi.
	   King said the new ``spywatcher'' would investigate cases at the
committee's request and have access to all relevant files and
documents.
	   ``We believe that enhancement of the present arrangements can be
achieved by extending the committee's reach with an additional
investigative arm,'' he said. ``This would reinforce the authority
of any findings we make and be an important element in establishing
public confidence in the oversight system.''

Political voodoo dolls a hit at Croatian art show

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When a young Croatian artist designed a
voodoo doll emblazoned with the portrait of President Franjo
Tudjman, he just wanted to turn some heads at a local art fair. Now
he's considering mass production.
	   Initially Srecko Strahinja had no plans to sell the dolls. But
almost a month before the official close of the exhibition, all the
Tudjman effigies are sold out.
	   ``My work is the result of an inexorable frustration,''
Strahinja told the Associated Press Wednesday, alluding to mounting
social ills, from high unemployment to corruption at the top
government level.
	   Made of plain white fabric and bearing the faces of the
president and three members of his cabinet, some critics and fellow
artists have hailed the dolls a smashing success. Strahinja said
he's sold nearly 50 of the sponge-stuffed dolls and given 100 away.
	   Only the faces of moderate Foreign Affairs Minister the recently
resigned Minister of Defence and Premier Zlatko Matesa, still hang
in transparent plastic bags on the wall of the art show that opened
Oct. 12.
	   Both Tudjman and Finance Minister Boris Skegro sold like
hotcakes.
	   Pricking at this conservative society, leery of radical and
outspoken art forms, Strahinja's effigies were one of the most
frequented and talked about displays at the annual exhibition which
is organized to promote up-and-coming local artists.
	   A spate of recent scandals involving senior politicians of the
ruling party seemed to have only further whetted interest in
Strahinja's dolls, that come with three large pins and colorful
instructions on how to best use them.
	   So do the dolls really work?
	   ``Chant an incantation, prick the doll and watch the reactions
in the media,'' the illustrated instructions read. ``Repeat if
needed.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors who examined President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday said he has recovered from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a foreign trip and limit other activities,
his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin had a checkup at the Central Clinical Hospital in
Moscow, also known as the Kremlin hospital, Dmitry Yakushkin said.
The exam included an X-ray, he said, without giving any other
details.
	   Doctors reported that Yeltsin's health had returned to normal,
he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   After his checkup, Yeltsin returned to his Gorky-9 country
residence outside of Moscow. He had no meetings planned, but he
spoke by telephone to German Chancellor-elect Gerhardt Schroeder,
Russian news agencies said.
	   Yeltsin's latest illness, described as a respiratory infection,
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last week. He
canceled a trip to an Asian summit in Malaysia next month, but
still plans to attend a European Union meeting in Vienna next week,
Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been weakened by recurring health problems in
recent years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. He has kept
an increasingly low political profile, briefly venturing into the
Kremlin two or three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and staunchly deny
speculation that he has serious health problems _ a suggestion that
is repeated every time Yeltsin catches a cold.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would hold several working meetings later
this week, including talks Friday with the speaker of the
Federation Council upper house of parliament, Yegor Stroyev.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Three southern African military allies
of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila agreed Wednesday to
mount an offensive against rebel strongholds in the east of the
vast mineral-rich country.
	   ``The east is where the sun rises and that's where we are going
militarily,'' Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe told reporters.
	   The announcement could lead to a major escalation of the
conflict that began on Aug. 2 with rebel advances aimed at toppling
Kabila.
	   Mugabe acknowledged fighting in the eastern jungles familiar to
the rebels could be prolonged, costly and difficult.
	   But Kabila's major allies _ Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola _ aimed
to stop the Congo conflict from threatening the region, he said.
	   ``We will not allow ... (Congo) to fall into the hands of those
who have invaded it. Never, never. We are committed truly to this
position,'' Mugabe said.
	   Mugabe spoke after chairing a three-hour meeting with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and top Kabila
aide Victor Mpoyo.
	   Kabila's allies say they are bound by mutual membership along
with Congo in the 14-nation Southern African Development community
to protect a fellow government in trouble and maintain security in
the region.
	   Chad, on Congo's northern border, is also backing Kabila.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels, but
Uganda denies the charges.
	   Kabila took over the government of the former Zaire last year,
after mounting an offensive against the late President Mobutu Sese
Seko.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ About 10 unarmed demonstrators, calling
themselves the Zapatas, occupied Mexico's embassy in Oslo on
Wednesday, demanding the release of political prisoners in the
Chiapas region, police said.
	   Police spokesman Vidar Hjulstad said the small group of
Norwegians were members of the local left-wing Blitz youth group,
which routinely demonstrates for a variety of causes.
	   Police surrounded the embassy in downtown Oslo, but took no
immediate action because the Mexican ambassador wanted to wait,
Hjulstad said by telephone.
	   ``The ambassador has to give us permission to remove them, and
he said 'no,' '' said Hjulstad. ``So the protesters are on the
inside and we are on the outside.''
	   The group issued a statement demanding the immediate release of
prisoners and the withdrawal of government troops from the troubled
southern Mexico province.
	   The state radio network NRK said all embassy staff left the
building, except for one employee who stayed to keep an eye on the
protesters

Investigative judge cites grim cases in arrest order against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In Judge Baltasar Garzon's arrest order
against Augusto Pinochet, the words are terse but chilling.
	   Men vanish from city streets in front of their wives and
children. People are dragged from their homes in the dead of night.
A pregnant woman is hauled off to a police station and never heard
from again.
	   With these abuses, the Spanish judge makes a case for
extraditing the former Chilean dictator from Britain, where he was
arrested Friday, and trying him in Spain on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism.
	   In an initial arrest warrant, Garzon cited only one specific
case. But in an addendum released Tuesday and sent to Britain, he
outlined how 94 people died or disappeared at the hands of Chile's
military junta leaders and Argentine cohorts from 1976-1983.
	   They fell victim to Operation Condor, a campaign by South
American juntas to help each other crush dissent. Victims cam from
several countries, including Argentina, the United States and
Britain, Garzon's order states.
	   All but a few of the 94 victims cited in the new document were
Chileans living in Argentina, like Jose Luis Appel de la Cruz. He
was kidnapped by armed civilians on Jan. 10, 1977, as he walked
down a street in the Argentine town of Cipolletti with his wife,
Carmen Delard, and their daughter.
	   ``Carmen Delard disappeared at the police station in that town
when she went to report her husband's disappearance,'' Garzon's
order says.
	   A week later in Buenos Aires, Delard's sister Gloria Delard was
arrested at her home along with her husband Roberto Cristi and
their two children.
	   ``Gloria Delard was pregnant with her third child. Federal
Police agents took them to the Navy School of Mechanics, where they
disappeared,'' the order says. That school was one of the most
notorious torture centers run by Argentina's military juntas.
	   The evidence in Garzon's order was based on the report produced
by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed by
former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin.
	   Known as the Rettig Report, it was published in 1991 and
identified nearly 2,300 victims of state-sanctioned killings,
torture, disappearances and other abuses committed under the
Pinochet regime.
	   Pinochet, who relinquished power in 1990 to a civilian regime
after 17 years of authoritarian rule, cannot be prosecuted at home
because he has immunity as a senator for life.
	   Private human rights lawyers who helped Garzon prepare the
arrest order chose the cases of Chileans who died in Argentina
because they believe it makes it easier to charge Pinochet with
genocide.
	   Garzon says Spanish law allows him to prosecute genocide no
matter where it occurred, even outside Spain.
	   The lawyers say Pinochet and the Argentine generals made a
systematic, organized attempt to wipe out political opponents
because of their ideological beliefs and that this amounts to
genocide.
	   The key is the existence of collaboration between the countries'
security forces.
	   ``Organization is the basis of genocide,'' said Gregorio Dionis
from Nizkor, a Spanish-based group formed five years ago to support
efforts to bring human rights violators to trial.
	   Dionis has been advising the lawyers that proving that the
violations were systematic is essential to the case. ``Killing lots
of people without criminal organization is not genocide'' he said.

Iraq says U.N. nuclear agency goes beyond inspections mandate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials complained Wednesday that
U.N. nuclear officials were demanding wide-ranging information
about Iraq's water resources that went beyond their mandate and
bordered on espionage.
	   Iraq's arms monitoring chief and the head of its dams declared
such information was confidential and would by no means be provided
to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The comments came in interviews arranged by Iraqi authorities
and followed previous efforts to discredit U.N. inspectors for
other types of lethal weapons as spies rather than neutral United
Nations employees.
	   Iraq has blocked U.N. nuclear inspectors and those in charge of
investigating chemical and biological weapons from visiting new
suspected arms sites and limited them to monitoring sites already
inspected.
	   The inspectors must verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, in trying to verify Iraq
is not trying to build nuclear weapons, monitors atomic facilities
and takes samples from rivers and lake waters for radioactive
analysis.
	   On Wednesday, the director of Iraq's National Monitoring
Directorate, Maj. Gen. Hussam Mohammed Ameen, said new requests by
the IAEA for information on Iraq's water resources bordered on
espionage.
	   He said the IAEA inspectors asked questions unrelated to their
mandate and added: ``All of those questions are intelligence
questions and if we answer them it means we help our enemies to get
information on our military capabilities.''
	   He also said the demand runs contrary to commitments made by the
inspectors to avoid matters that encroach ``on Iraq's dignity and
sovereignty.''
	   IAEA officials have not made public its questions about Iraq's
water resources, and officials at the agency's headquarters in
Vienna declined comment on Iraq's accusations.
	   Waleed Saleh, director general of dams in Iraq, said that IAEA
had surprised the government with a demand for ``huge details on
water resources, water levels in dams, cross sections, gauging
methods.''
	   ``This we cannot allow because it is very restricted,'' he said,
referring to Iraq's secrecy rules about both military and natural
resources.
	   Iraq has long maintained it has eliminated its lethal weapons
system and has been in a long-running dispute with the United
Nations over the inspections. The inspectors charge that Iraq has
persistently hidden weapons programs and has not proved it has
destroyed its arms facilities.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Jahn, justice minister under
former Chancellor Willy Brandt, died of cancer Tuesday night at a
treatment center in Baden-Wuerttemberg state, party members said
Wednesday. He was 71.
	   A life-long Social Democrat born in Kassel and first elected to
parliament in 1957, Jahn worked under then-Foreign Minister Brandt
as an undersecretary from 1967-69.
	   Jahn played a key role in helping the Social Democrats negotiate
a coalition agreement with the Free Democrats after the 1969
elections, with Brandt as chancellor.
	   Brandt brought him into the Cabinet as justice minister, a post
he held until 1974.
	   Jahn remained in parliament until 1990, representing his adopted
home of Marburg where he had studied law as young man and spent
most of his life.
	   Jahn is survived by his wife and three children. Funeral
arrangements were to be announced Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two leaders in the militant Palestinian group
Hamas were found guilty Wednesday and sentenced to life in prison
for the killing of an Israeli soldier and plotting a suicide
bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe.
	   Abdel Rahman Ghenimat received five consecutive life sentences
plus an additional 20 years and Jamal Hor received five consecutive
life sentences plus an additional 18-year sentence.
	   The two men ran a Hamas cell from their West Bank village of
Zurif, north of Hebron. The group has been blamed for three
drive-by shootings, the abduction and slaying of an Israeli
soldier, and a March 1997 suicide bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that
killed three women.
	   Ghenimat and Hor were captured by Israeli troops last November
while Palestinian police were transferring them from one West Bank
jail to another. The Palestinian Authority had previously refused
requests to hand the two over to Israel.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and has claimed
responsibility for scores of attacks on Israelis, including a
grenade attack earlier this week which injured 64 people in a
southern Israeli city.

World crisis seen slowing growth, but EU stays upbeat on economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes from EU finance commissioner
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Wednesday forecast
its economy will ride out the worst of the global financial
turmoil, despite estimates showing a deceleration of growth in the
15-nation bloc next year.
	   ``Europe is not isolated and it will not be immune from the
worldwide trend,'' said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de
Silguy, presenting the EU's economic forecasts in Strasbourg,
France.
	   But he predicted EU growth would outstrip that of the United
States and Japan over the next two years, insisting ``Europe is
becoming a pillar of stability and growth in the world.''
	   In its twice-yearly economic predictions, the EU said its
economy would grow 2.4 percent in 1999, down from the 3 percent
predicted in the Union's last economic forecast released in March.
	   De Silguy warned deeper falls of the U.S. dollar against
European currencies could have further negative impact by hitting
EU exports.
	   However, for the most part, the EU was upbeat that its economy
would remain ``an island of stability'' in a troubled world.
	   It forecast the EU economy would expand faster than expected
this year, with the 2.9 percent growth rate the highest this
decade. And assuming the world economy bounces back in 2000, the EU
said its economic growth should then recover to 2.8 percent.
	   ``The overall picture is favorable. Economic growth in the EU is
expected to remain strong over the period 1998-2000, driven
essentially by internal consumption and investment,'' said a report
drawn up by the EU's executive Commission.
	   The report said confidence the euro will be a strong currency
after its launch on Jan. 1 had cushioned Europe from market
volatility. De Silguy added that governments should stick to the
tough budgetary policies imposed in recent years to prepare for the
common EU currency.
	   But the predicted slowdown next year is likely to increase
pressure for European nations to do more to boost their economies
by increasing investment in public works or further cutting
interest rates.
	   EU leaders are expected to discuss their response to the turmoil
at a summit this weekend in the Austrian lakeside resort of
Poertschach.
	   The EU report pointed out that interest rates are already at
record low levels and that inflation at 1.6 percent this year, and
1.7 percent in 1999, is ``historically low.''
	   The forecast also showed Europe's stubbornly high unemployment
falling slightly faster than predicted in March. The jobless rate
is seen at 9.5 percent next year, dipping below 10 percent for the
first time in the 1990s.
	   Among the 11 nations that plan to switch to the euro on New
Year's Day, growth is seen at 3 percent this year, slowing to 2.6
percent in 1999.
	   In Germany, the EU's largest economy, growth is seen peaking at
2.8 percent this year then dipping to 2.2 percent in 1999 and 2.6
percent in 2000.
	   Ireland is set to continue as the EU's fastest-expanding economy
with growth at 11.4 percent this year, almost four-times the EU
average, before slowing to 8.2 percent next year.

Russian soccer team will be World Cup contender in 2002, says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's beleaguered soccer team will be a World
Cup contender in 2002, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the
southern Russian republic of Kalmykia, predicted Wednesday.
	   Ilyumzhinov isn't just another fan dreaming up fantasies about
Russia's soccer team, which didn't even qualify for the 1998 World
Cup. He's also in the running for the presidency of the Russian
Soccer Federation. The body will vote on its new leader Thursday.
	   ``We're not losing hope,'' said Ilyumzhinov, who already heads
the Switzerland-based World Chess Federation and has said he will
run for president of Russia in 2000. ``Four years is enough.''
	   If elected head of the Soccer Federation, Ilyumzhinov will have
the unenviable task of resurrecting Russian soccer, which has been
hobbled by shortages in federal funding and a demoralizing loss to
Iceland last week in the qualifying rounds of the European
Championships.
	   Ilyumzhinov already has a number of ideas for boosting Russia's
chances.
	   ``What's important is that (our players) must be willing to die
on the soccer field for Russia, then we'll receive results,'' he
said. ``We must look from the moral side, then from the financial
one.''
	   He said raising money for Russian soccer shouldn't be difficult
once the ``psychological climate'' is worked out, including
improving morale.
	   Liberal Russian media have assailed Ilyumzhinov for ruling
impoverished Kalmykia like a medieval baron, flaunting his wealth
while ignoring the republic's social woes and crushing dissent.
	   But at a news conference Wednesday, Ilyumzhinov shied away from
politics, and would not say whether his candidacy for the
influential soccer post was tied to the 2000 presidential
elections.
	   ``I am going ... step by step,'' he said. ``Right now I'm going
to put all my strength into soccer, and if it works out, we'll see.
Maybe next I'll do basketball or hockey.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Jewish settlers demonstrating against
an emerging Israeli-Palestinian deal on a West Bank troop pullback,
blocked several West Bank highways Wednesday, forcing Palestinians
to use side roads.
	   Settlers, some draped in white prayer shawls and waving Israeli
flags, took up positions along three West Bank junctions. At first
police kept the demonstrators from interfering with traffic but
later allowed the settlers onto the roadways and diverted
Palestinian traffic to backroads.
	   Some settlers held their morning prayers at the roadside,
carrying holy books and swaying rhythmically back and forth, as is
customary among observant Jews.
	   ``We are here to show this is a Jewish country and should not be
given away to non-Jews,'' said one settler, Shai Ben-Tekoa as he
stood by the side of a road near the town of Hebron.
	   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinians held a similar protest, busing
in dozens to block roads used by Israeli military and Jewish
settlers there.
	   Sitting and even lying on the ground amid Palestinian flags and
pictures of jailed loved ones, Palestinian demonstrators blocked
demanded that Israel release Palestinian prisoners held in its
jails.
	   At one point, several Palestinian demonstrators sat down in
front of a a white van driven by a uniformed soldier and refused to
move. Palestinian police eventually removed the protesters from the
road.
	   Jewish settlers have led Israel's opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords and vehemently oppose handing
any land to the Palestinians. When Israel withdrew from two-thirds
of the Gaza Strip and one-third of the West Bank under the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, thousands of settlers joined street
protests. Rabin was later assassinated by a religious Jew who
opposed his land-for-peace policies.
	   Israeli hardliners who helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996
have warned that they will return to the streets if he transfers
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has been meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Wye Plantation, Maryland, for
the past week to try and reach agreement on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against militants.
	   In response to reports from Maryland of an emerging deal,
hardline members of Netanyahu's government renewed warnings
Wednesday that they would bring down the prime minister's coalition
if he made any concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Education Minister Yitzhak Levy told Israel army radio that his
National Religious Party will topple the government if Netanyahu
gives in on an Israeli demand that the Palestinians extradite
suspects in anti-Israeli attacks.
	   The NRP holds nine seats and could rob Netanyahu of his slim
parliamentary majority.
	   In a related development, Palestinian security officials
confirmed Wednesday that 15 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas were arrested by Palestinian police in the Hebron area.
	   The detainees had ties to Salem Rajab Sarsour, a 29-year-old
Hebron man who threw two hand grenades near a bus stop in the
southern Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday. The attack injured 64
Israelis.
	   In Israeli detention, Sarsour told his interrogators that he
also stabbed to death an elderly rabbi in Hebron in August and
threw hand grenades at Israeli troops in the city in September.

German, Austrian leaders meet before EU summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder met
his Austrian counterpart Wednesday ahead of a European Union summit
this weekend.
	   Schroeder will attend the session in Poertschach on Saturday as
a ``guest,'' since he doesn't get sworn in as chancellor until next
week. He said he had cleared his plan with outgoing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who is staying home.
	   Austria currently holds the EU presidency, and will be replaced
by Germany on Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder said he looked forward to completing work started by
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima on the EU's Agenda 2000, a plan to
overhaul EU rules in preparation for the eventual entry of new
members from eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's beleaguered soccer team will be a World
Cup contender in 2002, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the
southern Russian republic of Kalmykia, predicted Wednesday.
	   Ilyumzhinov isn't just another fan dreaming up fantasies about
Russia's soccer team, which didn't even qualify for the 1998 World
Cup. He's also in the running for the presidency of the Russian
Soccer Federation. The body will vote on its new leader Thursday.
	   ``We're not losing hope,'' said Ilyumzhinov, who already heads
the Switzerland-based World Chess Federation and has said he will
run for president of Russia in 2000. ``Four years is enough.''
	   If elected head of the Soccer Federation, Ilyumzhinov will have
the unenviable task of resurrecting Russian soccer, which has been
hobbled by shortages in federal funding and a demoralizing loss to
Iceland last week in the qualifying rounds of the European
Championships.
	   Ilyumzhinov already has a number of ideas for boosting Russia's
chances.
	   ``What's important is that (our players) must be willing to die
on the soccer field for Russia, then we'll receive results,'' he
said. ``We must look from the moral side, then from the financial
one.''
	   He said raising money for Russian soccer shouldn't be difficult
once the ``psychological climate'' is worked out, including
improving morale.
	   Liberal Russian media have assailed Ilyumzhinov for ruling
impoverished Kalmykia like a medieval baron, flaunting his wealth
while ignoring the republic's social woes and crushing dissent.
	   But at a news conference Wednesday, Ilyumzhinov shied away from
politics, and would not say whether his candidacy for the
influential soccer post was tied to the 2000 presidential
elections.
	   ``I am going ... step by step,'' he said. ``Right now I'm going
to put all my strength into soccer, and if it works out, we'll see.
Maybe next I'll do basketball or hockey.''

Alleged knife-throwing incident under investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in 10th graf police fail to find object &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish club Wisla Krakow on Wednesday
disputed claims by Parma's Dino Baggio that he was struck by a
knife thrown from the stands in a UEFA Cup match.
	   At the same time, Parma officials stuck to Baggio's story that
it was a knife that glanced off his head in the 80th minute of
Tuesday's UEFA Cup second-round match, first-leg tie _ a 1-1 draw
at Wisla.
	   ``You can see pretty well from the (television) tape that a
metal object flew out of the stands,'' managing director Michele
Uva told The Associated Press. ``According to our players it was a
knife, and I think that there was some confirmation from the
Poles.''
	   Baggio's wound required five stitches, Uva said, and Italy's
World Cup starter will be examined again Thursday to determine if
he can play in Parma's Serie A game Sunday.
	   ``It landed on his head, but it could just have easily hit an
eye or another part of the body. It is unfortunate that these
things happen,'' Uva said.
	   Uva said the Italian team would not contest the results with
UEFA. ``The important thing is that UEFA examines what happened and
its gravity.''
	   Baggio told the sports daily Corriere dello Sport felt a blow to
his head and ``then I saw a knife on the ground and I realized that
that was what had hit me.''
	   ``I can't believe there are people who come to stadiums with
knives,'' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I only just missed it but
thinking back to it gives me the shivers. Just think what would
have happened if it had got me in the eye.''
	   However, Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr, disputed Baggio's claim
and said police were questioning players and fans about the
incident.
	   Krakow police said Wednesday they had failed to find a knife.
They acknowledged Wisla player Ryszard Czerwiec had picked up an
object and tossed it off the field ``instinctively'' without
examining it.
	   ``Nobody has seen anything like that, including the referees,
the UEFA observers, Krakow or Parma officials,'' he said Wednesday.
	   ``We are not saying that Baggio is lying, but in our opinion it
could not have been a knife.''
	   He suggested Baggio was hit by a stone hurled by fans. Italian
reports initially identified the object as a flick knife.
	   Bobr questioned why _ if a knife were involved _ the incident
wasn't reported immediately after it happened. He said Parma
officials waited until after the match to inform UEFA officials. He
said they did not bring it up during a post-game news conference
	   He said Wilsa expressed regret to Parma over the incident but
suggested the Italians could be trying to divert attention from
their 1-1 draw against the underdog Poles.
	   ``This is certainly not a success for Parma,'' he said.
	   Poland's largest circulation newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta said two
Wisla players suggested that Baggio was hit with some ``small metal
object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife.
	   The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr
_ after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck
by an unidentified object.
	   In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said no action was
planned until a match report was in hand. He said the matter would
be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting in November.
	   ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' Gonnella
said.

Norwegian town may be blue about the milennium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Some people might paint the town red when
the year 2000 rolls around, but people in Sortland might paint the
town blue, literally.
	   The small community in the Vesteraalen Islands off northern
Norway is considering a proposal by four local artists to mark the
new milennium by painting everything some shade of blue _ including
the church, sidewalks and streets, according to the national
newspaper Aftenposten.
	   ``It is a lively idea that really engages local people,''
Sortland Mayor Ingolf Markussen was quoted as telling the
newspaper. He said the town council was positive to the idea.
	   The report did not say whether Sortland - which means Black Land
in Norwegian _ might also change its name to reflect the proposed
color.

Congolese rebels vow to fight Kabila and his allies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Zimbabwe-Congo
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Congolese rebel leader on Wednesday said
his forces will continue fighting for the liberation of the whole
country, and warned President Laurent Kabila's allies to back off.
	   Arthur Ngoma, a leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition, said the announcement of an offensive in the east of the
country by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia left little choice for the
rebels but to fight back.
	   ``They must know they cannot stop our struggle. This will be a
long war,'' Ngoma told The Associated Press from the eastern rebel
stronghold of Goma.
	   The plan to deploy more troops announced in the Zimbabwean
capital followed a rebel victory at Kindu, 380 kilometer (275
miles) southwest of Goma. The capture of the strategic town and its
airport has opened routes for the rebels to the southern province
of Katanga, Kabila's home, and Mbuji-Maji, capital of diamond-rich
Eastern Kasai.
	   Ngoma said the rebel troops on Tuesday captured the town of
Kataku Kombe, 170 kilometers (106 miles) west of Kindu and 320
kilometers (200 miles) from Mbuji-Mayi, the rebels' next target.
	   ``Kindu was just a step. We're moving to other regions. Our aim
is to liberate the whole country,'' Ngoma said. ``We do believe in
negotiations. But it takes two to negotiate. So we'll continue to
advance as long as Kabila refuses to negotiate with us a political
solution.''
	   In Harare, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Kabila's
allies will never allow Congo to fall into the hands of those who
he said had invaded the country _ a reference to Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The allied force helped fend off a rebel onslaught on the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Kabila accuses the rebels of being the puppets of Rwanda and
Uganda, his erstwhile allies who installed him in power in May 1997
after an eight-month war against dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Since then, both countries have accused Kabila of failing to rid
their common border from the Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. Rwanda has
sent troops, officers and equipment to aid the rebels. Uganda says
it has at least two battalions stationed in the country, ostensibly
to protect its borders.
	   The Congolese rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of
corruption, mismanagement and promoting tribalism.

Iraq says U.N. nuclear agency goes beyond inspections mandate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG102
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials complained Wednesday that
U.N. nuclear officials were demanding wide-ranging information
about Iraq's water resources that went beyond their mandate and
bordered on espionage.
	   Iraq's arms monitoring chief and the head of its dams declared
such information was confidential and would by no means be provided
to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The comments came in interviews arranged by Iraqi authorities
and followed previous efforts to discredit U.N. inspectors for
other types of lethal weapons as spies rather than neutral United
Nations employees.
	   Iraq has blocked U.N. nuclear inspectors and those in charge of
investigating chemical and biological weapons from visiting new
suspected arms sites and limited them to monitoring sites already
inspected.
	   The inspectors must verify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, in trying to verify Iraq
is not trying to build nuclear weapons, monitors atomic facilities
and takes samples from rivers and lake waters for radioactive
analysis.
	   On Wednesday, the director of Iraq's National Monitoring
Directorate, Maj. Gen. Hussam Mohammed Ameen, said new requests by
the IAEA for information on Iraq's water resources bordered on
espionage.
	   He said the IAEA inspectors asked questions unrelated to their
mandate and added: ``All of those questions are intelligence
questions and if we answer them it means we help our enemies to get
information on our military capabilities.''
	   He also said the demand runs contrary to commitments made by the
inspectors to avoid matters that encroach ``on Iraq's dignity and
sovereignty.''
	   IAEA officials have not made public its questions about Iraq's
water resources, and officials at the agency's headquarters in
Vienna declined comment on Iraq's accusations.
	   Waleed Saleh, director general of dams in Iraq, said that IAEA
had surprised the government with a demand for ``huge details on
water resources, water levels in dams, cross sections, gauging
methods.''
	   ``This we cannot allow because it is very restricted,'' he said,
referring to Iraq's secrecy rules about both military and natural
resources.
	   Iraq has long maintained it has eliminated its lethal weapons
system and has been in a long-running dispute with the United
Nations over the inspections. The inspectors charge that Iraq has
persistently hidden weapons programs and has not proved it has
destroyed its arms facilities.

Town crier calls Nigerian injured to return to hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. LEADS throughout to UPDATE with town crier sent to Jesse,
families said to be secretly burying relatives, other details,
quotes. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria _ A bell-ringing town crier was sent Wednesday to
call for the injured of this fire-ravaged town to return to
hospitals, while state radio raised the death toll from the weekend
pipeline blaze to 700 people.
	   The Lagos-based newspaper Daily Express also reported at least
700 deaths, citing police who said about 200 people injured in the
original explosion Saturday had since died. The explosion occurred
while as many as 1,000 people were trying to scavenge gasoline
spilling from the pipeline.
	   Local officials warned the toll could reach even higher.
	   ``I'm afraid there could be 1,000'' dead, said J.I. Ogude, the
village chief of Jesse.
	   Counting the dead as well as the injured remained a
frustratingly difficult task for local officials. Some residents
were said to be secretly burying dead family members and others
with burn wounds fled hospitals fearing arrest for gasoline theft.
Some of the injured were being treated at home, without benefit of
medicine or painkillers
	   ``People are running away,'' said Jacob Emogho, a Jesse
resident. ``People are afraid to talk to any strangers.'' Emogho
said some of his neighbors had secretly buried relatives, fearing
prosecution.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
for the gasoline theft or the fire, but no arrests have been made.
	   Because people had left area hospitals, local health workers
sent a town crier into Jesse on Wednesday, to call for people to
return for treatment.
	   ``We cannot force them to stay in hospitals,'' said D. Omamor,
the chief nursing officer for the region, who ordered the bell
ringer to head for Jesse. ``They left on their own volition.''
	   She said she knew of 10 patients who had left hospitals against
doctors' advice, but believed there were many more.
	   But treatment remained hard to come by for those who remained
under medical care. Local hospitals were overwhelmed by the
disaster and were short on medicine and doctors. Local officials
said, though, that extra supplies had begun arriving from the
United Nation's children's organization and Israeli doctors were
also flying in to help.
	   Many people in this farming community refused to talk to
reporters, and fled when strangers stopped at their homes. Those
that would talk denied involvement in the scavenging.
	   ``I did not go to take petrol,'' said Samuel Aminone, who has
burns over 60 percent of his body and was being comforted by nurses
at Eku General Hospital. He said he was searching for his sister
when the blast occurred, sweeping through hundreds of people.
	   ``If it was petrol I went for you would not see me today,'' he
said.
	   His sister, he said, was killed in the blast.
	   At least 400 people have been buried in mass graves dug about
100 yards (meters) from the scene of the explosion in Jesse, 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, authorities said.
	   Firefighters stopped battling the blaze on Monday, and have been
waiting nearby for the thousands of gallons of fuel to burn out in
the Jesse section of the pipeline. The entire pipeline runs for
nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles), from the southeastern city of
Warri to the northern city of Kano.
	   It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off,
while some news reports have blamed the conflagration on a lit
cigarette.
	   For the poverty-stricken people of the Niger River delta region,
the spilling gasoline appeared a chance for quick profits.
	   Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
remains a fuel-starved country and its petroleum industry is
hobbled by corruption and mismanagement. Refineries are in
desperate need of repair, black-market gasoline is often marked up
1,000 percent and fuel is often sold at roadside tables by the
whiskey bottle. Lines at gas pumps can last for days.
	   In other parts of southeastern Nigeria, ethnic Ijaw youths have
attacked Western oil installations in recent weeks, demanding oil
companies and the government supply them with schools, better roads
and political representation. But the Jesse fire was not believed
to be related to those incidents.

First regular OSCE observers ready for duty in Kosovo.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The first of 2,000 foreign observers are set
to enter the troubled Kosovo province as soon as the United
Nation's formally backs a plan to ease ethnic tensions, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe chairman said
Wednesday.
	   Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, who holds the
organization's rotating chairmanship, said the first 50 of 2,000
planned international monitors could begin the risky mission this
week, pending a United Nations resolution backing a peace plan for
Kosovo.
	   ``I hope the U.N. Security Council will take the decision today,
tomorrow, two, three days and no more,'' Geremek said.
	   The presence of 2,000 unarmed international ``ground verifiers''
is a key element in the deal U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke
worked out with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end ethnic
bloodshed in the province.
	   NATO has given Milosevic an Oct. 27 deadline for removing his
troops from Kosovo or face a renewed threat of air strikes by the
alliance.
	   Geremek was in Oslo for a one-day meeting of the OSCE leadership
troika, which also includes the foreign ministers of Norway and
Denmark. He said about 10 countries have committed 800 people to
the 2,000-member force, but could not say when the full number
might be reached.
	   Hundreds of people have died and roughly 300,000 have fled their
homes during fighting and massacres in the Serb province, where 90
percent of the population are ethnic Albanians.
	   Geremek said it was impossible to say how long a force of
monitors might have to remain in Kosovo, but, based on experience
of peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, said countries should think in a
three-year timeframe.
	   ``I have the feeling that this will be a risky operation,'' he
said, noting that security could be difficult because the many
Albanian rebel groups operating in Kosovo have no clear central
control.
	   Norway, which takes over the chairmanship of the OSCE in
January, has taken on the responsibility of setting up a
headquarters for the monitor force in Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
	   Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek said the security of
monitors will a primary concern, and he expects NATO to be engaged
in guaranteeing their safety.
	   ``I suppose there will be a written guarantee from NATO,'' he
said at the news conference

Plagued by errors, Kournikova loses in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Anna Kournikova double faulted 20 times in
an upset loss to Silvia Farina in the Kremlin Cup Wednesday, bowing
out to the angry whistles of her home crowd.
	   The Moscow-born Kournikova clinched the first set 7-6 (7-5) over
Farina, of Italy. But sixth-seeded Kournikova couldn't wrap up the
match, dropping the next two sets 4-6, 1-6.
	   It was her first loss since early 1997 to a player ranked
outside the world's top 15
	   A week ago in Zurich, the 17-year-old Russian committed 17
double faults to lose in the first round of the European
Championships.
	   Kournikova, who now lives and trains in Florida, dropped out of
the top 10 after tearing ligaments in her right thumb. She is
ranked 12th on the WTA tour.
	   She wasn't the only seeded player to lose Wednesday. Chanda
Rubin of the United States upset eighth-seed Irina Spirlea in
straight sets 6-2, 6-3.
	   Sabine Appelmans also beat Elena Dementieva 6-4, 6-4.

German industry, chancellor-elect consider slave-labor fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting started; other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder met
Wednesday with German bank and industry leaders to discuss setting
up a foundation to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era
slave laborers.
	   Schroeder refused to comment going into the meeting and said he
wouldn't afterward either. But a spokesman, Michael Juerdens,
described the first session as ``a historic event.''
	   Among those participating were the bosses of Allianz insurance
company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens,
Krupp, Degussa and BASF.
	   In a reference to recent lawsuits against Swiss banks by
Holocaust survivors, Juerdens said the meeting was called because
``German firms also face the prospect of being sued by former slave
laborers in the United States.''
	   He refused to give further details, saying the talks ``should
not be hindered by public debates or public pressure.''
	   A Greens lawmaker close to the issue, Volker Beck, said the fund
would seek to ``satisfy the right to compensation for unpaid wages
of all forced laborers, and in return offer legal security to the
industry'' against future lawsuits.
	   Schroeder announced plans for joint government-industry fund
Tuesday in a break with long-standing Germany policy.
	   The German government has paid billions in compensation to
Holocaust victims for health damage and imprisonment. But it had
rejected claims for back wages from slave laborers, saying the
companies involved were responsible.
	   Most German firms, though, argued the workers were forced on
them by the Nazis and so the current government, as legal successor
to the Nazi regime, should be responsible.
	   Yet lawsuits pending in the United States and threats of more at
home prompted suggestions this year from some for an industry-wide
fund to settle the claims.

Newspaper: Opposition leader says Ukrainian authorities want to

kill him &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Lazarenko's age in 2nd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A former Ukrainian prime minister said in
an interview published Wednesday that the authorities are planning
to kill him, and insisted that allegations of corruption against
him were unfounded.
	   ``As the youngest prime minister of independent Ukraine, I've
committed mistakes, of course,'' opposition lawmaker Pavlo
Lazarenko, 45, told the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   ``But I've never committed any crimes. Moreover, I never did
anything to deserve killers being sent to me.''
	   Lazarenko, who leads the centrist opposition Hromada party in
parliament, is at the center of a corruption probe focusing on his
time as prime minister in 1996-97.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain, in particular reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine.
	   They claim Lazarenko gave preferential status to a private gas
and energy trader, Unified Energy Systems (UES), headed at the time
by Julia Tymoshenko, now a Hromada ally.
	   The company recently lost an appeal in the Supreme Arbitration
Court over a 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 409 million) fine imposed by
tax authorities for evading taxes and illegally transferring abroad
dlrs 690 million received from gas sales.
	   Last month, authorities also charged a prominent Hromada
activist and former senior government official, Mykola Syvulskiy,
with abusing his position and embezzlement for transferring more
than dlrs 5 million from the accounts of state gas company
Ukrgazprom to UES.
	   Hromada and UES officials say the corruption probe and the tax
fine have no grounds and describe the scandal as politically
motivated and organized by President Leonid Kuchma and his close
supporters. Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister and later
fired him.
	   In his interview, Lazarenko said he was dismissed by Kuchma in
1997 for refusing to take part in ``introducing an economic measure
that would have cost the taxpayers dearly but could bring serious
dividends to some people.'' Lazarenko did not elaborate.
	   He said the campaign against him became more intense after
Hromada and the Communist-led opposition in parliament tried
unsuccessfully last week to bring down the Cabinet.
	   ``The plans of the authorities are first to discredit me as a
politician and then to eliminate me physically,'' Lazarenko told
Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   Lazarenko said he had evidence to back up his allegations, but
gave no details.
	   Lazarenko recalled a 1996 incident in which a bomb exploded near
his car in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. At the time, Lazarenko
blamed leaders of the large coal industry for trying to assassinate
him.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the case, but the investigation is still
underway.

Doctor say Yeltsin recovered from latest illness

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors who examined President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday said he has recovered from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a foreign trip and limit other activities,
his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin had a checkup at the Central Clinical Hospital in
Moscow, also known as the Kremlin hospital, Dmitry Yakushkin said.
The exam included an X-ray, he said, without giving any other
details.
	   Doctors reported that Yeltsin's health had returned to normal,
he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   After his checkup, Yeltsin returned to his Gorky-9 country
residence outside of Moscow. He had no meetings planned, but he
spoke by telephone to German Chancellor-elect Gerhardt Schroeder,
and agreed to meet him in Moscow Nov. 16 and 17, Russian news
agencies said.
	   Yeltsin's latest illness, described as a respiratory infection,
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last week. He
canceled a trip to an Asian summit in Malaysia next month, but
still plans to attend a European Union meeting in Vienna next week,
Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been weakened by recurring health problems in
recent years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. He has kept
an increasingly low political profile, briefly venturing into the
Kremlin two or three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and staunchly deny
speculation that he has serious health problems _ a suggestion that
is repeated every time Yeltsin catches a cold.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would hold several working meetings later
this week, including talks Friday with the speaker of the
Federation Council upper house of parliament, Yegor Stroyev.

Parliamentary committee backs attempt to try Pinochet in Britain

``special mission'' at the time of arrest; edits to tighten &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chile's ambassador said Wednesday that former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet was on a ``special mission''
to Britain when he was arrested last week.
	   Pinochet was arrested at the instigation of a Spanish
magistrate, who is seeking the general's extradition on charges of
genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   If the Chilean authorities can prove Pinochet was representing
the government, however, he could possibly qualify for diplomatic
immunity.
	   Ambassador Mario Artaza said Pinochet was on a mission for an
``official person,'' but would provide no further details, calling
it a ``matter between the government and the institution that
ordered that mission.''
	   Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March,
has viisted British weapons facilities in the past on buying
missions.
	   Asked directly if Pinochet's current trip involved buying arms,
Artaza would not comment.
	   Previously, diplomats from the Chilean embassy had argued that
Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic immunity because he
arrived last month on a diplomatic passport and is a Chilean
senator.
	   The Foreign Office responded that neither distinction confers
diplomatic immunity.
	   Also Wednesday, the head of Parliament's human rights committee
backed an attempt by Amnesty International to have Pinochet
prosecuted in Britain on torture charges if he escapes extradition
to Spain.
	   ``We should seize this chance to bring to justice one of the
most evil dictators alive,'' Ann Clwyd, a lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party, said in a letter to Attorney General John Morris.
	   Pinochet, 82, seized power in 1973 and remained in charge of the
Chilean army until March as part of compromises during the
country's successful return to democracy.
	   His arrest Friday, while recuperating from back surgery in an
exclusive London clinic, has sharply divided political parties both
in Britain and Chile.
	   Britain's opposition Conservative Party, which lost power 18
months ago, accuses Prime Minister Tony Blair's government of
``gesture politics'' and pandering to Labor's left-wing.
	   In Chile on Tuesday, pro-Pinochet demonstrators hurled garbage
at the British and Spanish embassies. Two municipalities withdrew
parking privileges for British and Spanish diplomats and said they
would refuse to collect their garbage.
	   Tony Benn, a veteran leftist Labor lawmaker, said Wednesday that
the U.S. government and the British Conservative Party were
reluctant to see a trial for Pinochet, who violently overthrew the
leftist government of Salvador Allende, because it would spotlight
their links with him.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.
	   On Tuesday, Amnesty International and two other British-based
human rights groups wrote to London's police chief seeking _ if the
extradition fails _ to have Pinochet tried in Britain on grounds
that the victims also included Britons and Chileans who live here.

WTO intervenes in Burma Law dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a
dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S.
legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma.
	   A dispute settlement panel was set up by the WTO Wednesday at
the request of the Europeans and Japanese, who claim the law
deprives them of potential trade benefits.
	   The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of
Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with
companies or individuals doing business with the military
government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.
	   An estimated 30 local governments across the United States have
passed similar laws.
	   The legislation is designed to show opposition to Burma's
military regime which has been accused of drug trafficking and
widespread human rights violations and to encourage it to negotiate
a peaceful transition to representative governments.
	   In a statement to a meeting in Geneva, European Union
representatives said the law imposes conditions for suppliers'
participation in tendering procedures that violate WTO rules.
	   In a separate but similar request for a panel to be established,
Japanese representatives cited several aspects of the legislation
it considers to be inconsistent with WTO regulations.
	   The United States said in a statement it is disappointed with
the decision by the European Union and Japan.
	   ``If this dispute goes to a panel, the U.S. will defend the
measure,'' the statement said.

Sri Lanka to train women umpires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Already the World Cup champion, Sri
Lanka will become the latest nation to introduce women umpires.
	   ``We will be training nearly 30 ladies to start with,'' said
K.T. Francis, a Sri Lankan member of the international umpires'
panel.
	   There are 450 registered male umpires in Sri Lanka.
	   The demand for women umpires was raised by women's groups.
	   ``We agreed and hence the new project,'' Francis said.
	   Women umpires will start with supervising domestic matches for
women's teams. The first group will begin training this weekend.
	   Sri Lanka will become the latest nation to use women umpires. An
ICC spokesman in London said several countries use women at the
club level, but there are no women umpires at the first-class
level.

Government lifts controversial decree after bringing media law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with independent media statement, fresh quotes,
international officials denied visas, German radio station
extending Serbian broadcasts; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serbian government Wednesday
lifted a ban on several independent newspapers, a day after it
imposed a law restricting their work.
	   But a Belgrade-based independent media group slammed the new law
as ``the most scandalous and restrictive media law ever to be
passed in Serbia,'' saying the damage inflicted by it was
irreparable.
	   ``It destroys what little freedom there was... and leads the
country into dictatorship and darkness,'' the Association of
Independent Electronic Media said in a statement.
	   The lifting of the ban means that three leading independent
dailies shut down last week, can resume publishing. Yet some of the
editors from Danas, Dnevni Telegraf and Nasa Borba warned the new
law makes it impossible to work, independent radio B-92 reported.
	   ``Whoever wants to keep one's journalistic integrity will have
enormous problems,'' said Slavko Curuvija, editor of Dnevni
Telegraf. He called on his colleagues at other independent papers
to protest the law and not to resume publishing.
	   Before the papers can resume publishing, the lifting of the ban
has to be published in the state official gazette.
	   Dusan Mijic, owner of Nasa Borba, said his paper would reappear
on the stands only after its editorial staff receive official
notification revoking the ban.
	   Serbia is the main republic in Yugoslavia, along with
Montenegro. Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, has used the possibility of NATO
intervention on military targets to clamp down against opponents at
home.
	   Throughout the nearly eight-month-old Kosovo crisis, state
officials have accused the media of betraying Serbia's national
interests by reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or
carrying foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   The three papers were banned last week after the government said
they had worked against the interests of the state. The government
also evicted a popular Belgrade radio station from their premises
and shut down a number of provincial media.
	   The new information law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media and calls for huge fines against media
editors and owners who disobey the decree.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
report is against the law, and places further restrictions on
working permits for media organizations.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law is highly
restrictive and reintroduces censorship, which was formally
abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s.
	   Germany's state-run radio, Deutsche Welle, reacted to the law
Wednesday, announcing its Serbian-language broadcasts would be
extended from 15 minutes to 120 minutes a day.
	   A statement Wednesday from the authorities in Montenegro said
the new media law in Serbia was ``not in step with modern times.''
	   A U.S. envoy to Kosovo, Christopher Hill, on Tuesday expressed
``outrage'' at the media crackdown at a meeting with editors of
Serbia's independent media.
	   Also Wednesday, two officials from the International Federation
of Journalists were denied visas to Yugoslavia. They had hoped to
acquire firsthand information on the media crackdown, independent
Beta news agency reported.

Jewish settlers try to block West Bank roads in protest

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Jewish settlers demonstrating against
an emerging Israeli-Palestinian deal on a West Bank troop pullback,
blocked several West Bank highways Wednesday, forcing Palestinians
to use side roads.
	   Settlers, some draped in white prayer shawls and waving Israeli
flags, took up positions along three West Bank junctions. At first
police kept the demonstrators from interfering with traffic but
later allowed settlers onto roadways and diverted Palestinian
traffic to backroads.
	   Some settlers held their morning prayers at the roadside,
carrying holy books and swaying rhythmically back and forth, as is
customary among observant Jews.
	   ``We are here to show this is a Jewish country and should not be
given away to non-Jews,'' said one settler, Shai Ben-Tekoa as he
stood by a road near the town of Hebron.
	   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinians held a similar protest, busing
in dozens to block roads used by Israeli military and Jewish
settlers there.
	   Sitting and even lying on the ground amid Palestinian flags and
pictures of jailed loved ones, Palestinian demonstrators demanded
that Israel release Palestinian prisoners held in its jails.
	   At one point, several Palestinian demonstrators blocked a white
van driven by a uniformed soldier. Palestinian police eventually
removed the protesters from the road.
	   Jewish settlers have led Israel's opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords and vehemently oppose handing
any land to the Palestinians. When Israel withdrew from two-thirds
of the Gaza Strip and one-third of the West Bank under the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, thousands of settlers joined street
protests. Rabin was later assassinated by a religious Jew who
opposed his land-for-peace policies.
	   Israeli hardliners who helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996
have warned that they will return to the streets if he transfers
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has been meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Wye Plantation, Maryland, for
the past week to try and reach agreement on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against militants.
	   In response to reports from Maryland of an emerging deal,
hardline members of Netanyahu's government renewed warnings
Wednesday that they would bring down the prime minister's coalition
if he made any concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Education Minister Yitzhak Levy told Israel army radio that his
National Religious Party will topple the government if Netanyahu
gives in on an Israeli demand that the Palestinians extradite
suspects in anti-Israeli attacks.
	   The NRP holds nine seats and could rob Netanyahu of his slim
parliamentary majority.
	   In a related development, Palestinian security officials
confirmed Wednesday that 15 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas were arrested by Palestinian police in the Hebron area.
	   The detainees had ties to Salem Rajab Sarsour, a 29-year-old
Hebron man who threw two hand grenades near a bus stop in the
southern Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday. The attack injured 64
Israelis.
	   Also Wednesday, Palestinian security officials revealed that
they had intercepted a letter from a Hamas leader in Jordan that
contained information leading to the arrest of 16 other Hamas
members over the past two weeks.
	   The letter by Khalid Mashaal, who was the target last year of a
botched assassination attempt by Israeli agents, outlined
activities of the group's military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, and
referred to Qassam members by their initials, said a Palestinian
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Israeli opposition offers safety net to government peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare political move, Israel's opposition
parties jointly decided Wednesday to curtail chances of toppling
the government by throwing their support behind any peace deal
reached by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Hardline members of Netanyahu's own coalition government have
threatened to bring down the premier if he agrees to withdraw from
more West Bank land in a peace deal with the Palestinians.
	   Amid reports from a Mideast summit in eastern Maryland, where
Netanyahu was meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, that a
deal was imminent, the heads of the dovish Labor, Meretz and Arab
parties voted to offer Netanyahu a safety net in a Knesset vote.
	   Netanyahu has promised to bring any deal to the Knesset for
house approval before a signing. But with a narrow majority of 61
of 120 seats and some 17 members of his coalition threatening to
balk, Netanyahu could easily be tossed out in a confidence motion
on a peace deal.
	   However, the three opposition parties have over 40 votes, more
than enough to secure Netanyahu's position.
	   ``The party has to give a safety net to peace,'' said former
prime minister Shimon Peres, whose Labor party formulated the
historic 1993 peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Peres narrowly lost re-election in 1996 to Netanyahu, who ran on
a platform critical of Peres' peace policies and vowed to slow-down
the process.

Russian colonel commits suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A colonel in the Russian army has killed himself,
a news agency reported Wednesday, the latest suicide in the
underfunded and demoralized military.
	   Lt. Col. Vladimir Romanenko had recently been appointed to a
mine-defusing unit based near the central Russian city of Vladimir.
He shot himself Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
the Defense Ministry.
	   The report gave no other details.
	   According to parliament's figures, 132 members of the armed
forces committed suicide in the first four months of this year. No
more recent data were available.
	   Most suicides among officers are attributed to unpaid wages,
which leave them unable to support their families.
	   The Russian army has also seen a rash of hazing deaths and
shootings of soldiers by fellow servicemen.

	   One of Europe's most talented players, Laudrup has played for
clubs in five different countries but has never made it to the
final of one of the club competitions.
	   He almost made it to the AC Milan lineup that won the 1994
Champions Cup by beating Barcelona 4-0 in Athens but wasn't used.
	   Now he lines up for star-studded Chelsea, holder of the Cup
Winners Cup, against his countrymen from FC Copenhagen Thursday.
	   Laudrup, who helped Denmark win the European Championship for
nations in 1992, was at Glasgow Rangers when Chelsea won the Cup
Winners title last year and only joined the fashionable west London
club in the summer.
	   Now the English club has a great chance to become the first team
to win the trophy two seasons in a row
	   With Chelsea, who just edged past Sweden's Helsingborgs in the
round one, now aiming for a place in the quarterfinal, Laudrup is
wary that Copenhagen has the players to stop them.
	   ``I have played with some of the players and I've said to the
boys here that in my opinion they are certainly a stronger side
than Helsingborgs so we know it's not going to be an easy game to
play in,'' he said.
	   ``They will make it difficult for us. For them it's a tremendous
draw but to play Chelsea and if they get something out of the game
on Thursday it will be a tremendous result for FC Copenhagen and
Danish football in general.
	   ``They're a typical Scandinavian side. They're very strong, they
can run all day and put a lot of pressure on their opponents.
	   ``They have some good experienced and talented players and we'll
have to be aware they can do a lot of damage,'' Laudrup said. ``I
think Bjarne Goldbaek and Peter Nielsen are the two main threats.''
	   While Chelsea hosts the opening leg with the return in
Copenhagen on Nov. 5, its biggest challenger in the competition,
Lazio, welcomes Partizan Belgrade.
	   The Roman club is still enjoying the glow of Saturday's 5-3
victory over Inter Milan and is unbeaten in 10 league and cup games
this season.
	   Club owner Sergio Cragnotti has announced a pay bonus for his
team if it reaches the Cup Winners final but the roster is riddled
with injuries heading into Thursday's game at Olympic Stadium.
	   Strikers Marcelo Salas of Chile and Alen Boksic of Croatia,
midfielders Dejan Stankovic of Yugoslavia and Ivan De La Pena of
Spain, and Italian defenders Paolo Negro and Alessandro Nesta are
all sidelined. Christian Vieri is also hurt, although he is
ineligible anyway having been signed to late to play in the
competition.
	   The good news for Swedish coach Sven Goran Eriksson is that
veteran striker Roberto Mancini, and defenders Fernando Couto and
Sinisa Mihajlovic all appear set to play despite minor injuries.
	   With former national team coach Egil Olsen in charge, Valerenga
has climbed from last in the Norwegian domestic league to high up
in the standings. With a policy of using a lone striker, John
Carew, however, it hasn't been particularly entertaining.
	   The Oslo-based club faces Besiktas of Turkey for a place in the
last eight.
	   Mallorca's coach, Hector Cuper, hopes to field Argentine star
goalkeeper Carlos Roa and countryman Gustavo Siviero in Thursday's
match against Belgium's Genk.
	   Both have made surprisingly fast recoveries from injuries, Roa
to the shoulder and Siviero to the knee.
	   Portugal's Sporting Braga goes to Lokomotiv Moscow and Dutch
club Heerenveen has a tricky second round match against Varteks of
Croatia.
	   Maccabi Haifa goes to SV Ried of Austria and Greek club
Pathionios hosts Apollon Limassol of Cyprus.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prosecutors in southern Poland are
investigating allegations of inciting national hate made against a
man who has rallied conservative Catholics to erect crosses near
the former Auschwitz death camp, the news agency PAP reported
Wednesday.
	   Prosecutors in Bielsko-Biala, some 40 kilometers (25 miles)
south of Oswiecim, where the former Nazi death camp is located,
ordered an investigation after residents complained about
statements and leaflets distributed by people working with
Kazimierz Switon.
	   They include a statement issued on June 28, urging residents to
erect crosses at the site, saying ``the time has come so that we,
Poles, wage merciless war on Jewish-communist-masonry, the biggest
enemies of the Polish state.'' Leaflets describe Israel and Germany
as ``satanic-pagan forces aiming at extermination of the Polish
nation,'' PAP reported.
	   If convicted of inciting national hatred, the authors of the
statements face up to two years in prison.
	   Switon has organized the placement of more than 200 small wooden
crosses around a larger, 8-meter papal cross that has stood since
1988 at a site adjacent to Auschwitz where Nazis murdered 152
Polish resistors.
	   Jews have long objected to the presence of the larger cross,
visible inside the camp, as an insult to the memory of Jews killed
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations around the world renewed their
outrage after the smaller crosses began appearing this summer.
	   The Israeli government has urged Poland to solve the dispute.
	   But efforts at a solution were set back on Monday when a
regional court in Oswiecim rejected a request by the Polish
government to evict conservative Catholics who have been camping
out at the site, and appoint a government trustee with authority
over the area.
	   The government said it would appeal.
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in Auschwitz gas
chambers or from forced labor, disease and starvation from 1940-45.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A French prosecutor on Wednesday requested a Paris
appeals court to recommend extradition of David Shayler, a former
British intelligence agent who sold information to a London
newspaper.
	   Shayler has been jailed in France since Aug. 1, when he was
arrested by French authorities at Britain's request.
	   The 32-year-old former MI5 agent would be charged under the
Official Secrets Act if he is returned home.
	   The French appeals court is to announce a decision on Nov. 18.
After that, the prime minister decides whether to execute that
decision.
	   Shayler, who worked for MI5 from 1994 until 1997, maintains,
among other things, that Britain plotted the assassination of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation the government
denies.
	   Libya also has asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Shayler explained on Wednesday that his actions were motivated
by a desire ``to criticize the British government'' and its
methods.
	   His lawyers, William Bourdon and Anne-Sophie Levy, stressed the
``political character'' of the extradition demand, and said that
agreeing to it would be against French law.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Skirting close to the eastern coast of Brazil,
Isabelle Autissier moved up two places to slip into second behind
French compatriot Marc Thiercelin in the first leg of the
43,500-kilometer (27,000-mile_ Around Alone sailing race.
	   Thiercelin was 32 kilometers (20 miles) ahead of Autissier on
Wednesday as the 13-boat fleet faced gusty winds and a series of
line squalls in the Atlantic just off the bulge of Brazil. The two
French boats were at least 160 kilometers (100 miles) ahead of the
next two solo sailors in Class I, for boats up to 18 meters (60
feet): Josh Hall and Mike Golding, both of Britain.
	   ``During the course of the race, there are moments that are
stressful and exhausting, and there are other times, like
yesterday, when it's great to be here,'' Autissier wrote in a
dispatch Tuesday.
	   Autissier, who turned 42 on Sunday, is the only woman in the
race.
	   Brad Van Liew of the United States, had an 18-kilometer
(11-mile) lead Wednesday over Jean-Pierre Mougline of France in the
Class II division, for boats up to 15 meters (50 feet).
	   Van Liew reported that the Brazilian navy agreed to move some
military exercises involving submarines out of his way so he would
not have to lose time changing course. Mougline said the constant
ship traffic in the area was setting off his boat alarms and
cutting into his sleep time.
	   Neal Petersen of South Africa reported that his boat was knocked
down during one intense squall, but his trials were eased when some
dolphins later frolicked on his bow wave for an hour.
	   The fleet left Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 27. The
leaders are expected to reach the first port of Cape Town, South
Africa, around Nov. 5.
	   They will also stop at Auckland, New Zealand, and Punta del
Este, Uruguay, before returning to Charleston next spring.
	   The race, held once every four years, began in 1982, and was
formerly known as the BOC Challenge.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countdown ahead of the third and final test
launch of Europe's Ariane 5 rocket was stopped Wednesday just as
the launch window opened.
	   Officials said the countdown for the unmanned rocket, set to
blast off from its space base in South America, could be restarted
at any moment.
	   The launch window runs from 1600 to 1730 GMT.
	   Technicians at the headquarters of Arianespace, in Evry south of
Paris, gave no reason for the stop in the countdown. Arianespace
commercializes the European rockets.
	   The Ariane 5 is the most powerful in the series of unmanned
European rockets.
	   Wednesday's scheduled launch at the space center in French
Guiana, on the northern shoulder of South America, is to be the
third and final test launch before the rocket goes into commercial
use.
	   The first Ariane 5 launch crashed in June 1996 and the second
launch a year ago was less than perfect.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No ransom was paid for any of the more than two
dozen hostages recently freed from secessionist Chechnya, the
Russian financier who helped secure their release said Wednesday.
	   Boris Berezovsky said that he and others have been sending
humanitarian and medical aid, computers and school textbooks to
Chechnya, and in return, senior Chechen officials have put more
emphasis on identifying and locating kidnappers.
	   Kidnappers have taken hundreds of people hostage in Chechnya and
surrounding areas, usually for ransom, since the region's two-year
war for independence ended in 1996.
	   About 100 people are still held, including three Britons, a New
Zealander and a Turk.
	   A number of hostages have been freed recently, including 24
Russian soldiers and an English couple. Two Latvians, Konstantin
Pridorogin and Konstantin Rysev, were released Wednesday after
spending more than five months in captivity, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   A Russian army soldier was also released Wednesday, the Interfax
news agency said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Guerrillas fired on a police patrol in the restive
southern Russian republic of Dagestan on Wednesday, and two
officers and two attackers were killed, news agencies reported.
	   The patrol had stopped to investigate a police car parked on the
side of a country road near the border with breakaway Chechnya.
When the officers approached the car, they came under fire from
unidentified men in military fatigues, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported.
	   Six police officers were wounded, Interfax said. One attacker
was captured, but about a dozen others escaped, the reports said.
Police were searching the area.
	   Dagestan has been plagued by violence spilling over from
Chechnya, as well as by its own ethnic conflicts.

U.S. determined to make Turkish Caspian oil route a reality

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The United States is determined to see
Caspian oil transported through Turkey and will work to make the
Baku-Ceyhan route a reality, a U.S. official said here Wednesday.
	   ``Overall, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from
environmental, economic and strategic standpoints,'' Undersecretary
of State Stuart Eizenstat told reporters.
	   Earlier it was announced that the U.S. Export-import Bank has
offered a dlrs 827,000 loan to help finance a pipeline linking the
Azeri capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
	   Another dlrs 823,000 grant from a U.S. trade and development
agency for consultant services will be signed shortly, said
Eizenstat, who was in Turkey for a meeting of the U.S.-Turkey Joint
Economic Commission.
	   ``No one should underestimate our determination to make
Baku-Ceyhan a reality,'' he said.
	   Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to
make a final decision on the pipeline route on Oct. 29.
	   According to some reports, the companies may favor shorter and
cheaper routes, including pipelines already being built from
Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast or an
enlarged pipeline along the same route.
	   Turkey strongly objects to the proposals because they would
require the oil to be loaded into tankers and shipped through
Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, which would increase the risk of
oil tanker accidents.
	   ``We cannot turn our straits into a virtual pipeline just
because some oil companies want to make more money,'' said Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem.
	   The Turkish proposal for a 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline
would cost dlrs 2.5 billion dlrs. Turkey has said it would
construct part of the pipeline on its own.
	   Eizenstat also praised the preliminary agreement reached Tuesday
between Turkey and Turkmenistan to build a pipeline to carry
Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.
	   Meanwhile, Turkey's energy ministry announced that it had agreed
to build two natural gas-fired power plants with Turkish-U.S.
ventures.
	   Contractors General Electric and Boston-based Tad LCC, a unit of
Generation Ventures Associates, in joint ventures with Turkish
companies will finance, build the plants and operate them for 20
years before transferring ownership to the Turkish state.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Every morning for a month, German and
French radio will read a letter sent home from the front during
World War I in commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the truce
ending the war, organizers said Wednesday.
	   The project, coordinated by Deutschlandfunk and Radio France,
will convey events along the Western front from 1914-18 as
described by soldiers in the trenches, Deutschlandfunk said. The
letters were collected from listeners.
	   The German broadcasts will begin Nov. 2, and the French one week
later.
	   Some 3.2 million French and German soldiers were killed during
World War I, which ended Nov. 11, 1918 with a truce.

French interior minister makes first comments after accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
who was in a coma for a week due to an allergic reaction to
anesthesia, says his brush with death ``could have happened to
anyone.''
	   ``What happened to me ... was as unpredictable as an auto
accident,'' Chevenement told Paris Match magazine in his first
interview since the Sept. 2 operation.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement's heart stopped after he was
administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients. He was set to undergo gall bladder
surgery.
	   ``Certain people are susceptible to (allergic) reactions,
generally less violent than mine, but just as unforeseeable,'' he
said.
	   Now, nearly two months after his heart attack, Chevenement has
re-read ``War and Peace'' and ``Don Quixote,'' he said. He takes
walks in the garden at Val-de-Grace military hospital. He is
expected to be released this week and to take up his duties again
by the end of the year.
	   Asked if politicians should be required to disclose details
about their health to the public, Chevenement said he didn't think
so.
	   ``If a politician's illness handicaps his performance, he must
suffer the consequences,'' Chevenement said. ``It's a question of
conscience, for which no hard and fast rule can substitute.''
	   Chevenement, a key figure in the French Cabinet, has held
several ministry portfolios, including industry, education and
defense. He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest
France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   As interior minister, he is responsible for the nation's police
and security forces.

Experts say official crime statistics just tip of iceberg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Official figures account for only a small fraction
of Russia's crime rate, which could soar during the current
economic crisis, members of the Russian Criminologist Association
said Wednesday.
	   Government figures indicate crime has decreased in the past few
years, but the criminologists said the real rate is up to hundreds
of times higher.
	   The Interior Ministry says there were 2.4 million crimes in
Russia last year, 200,000 fewer than in 1996.
	   ``These are absurd statistics,'' Viktor Luneyev, a member of the
criminologist association, said at a news conference. ``We should
stop pretending to have a low crime rate while the whole world
shudders from fear of our crime.''
	   Luneyev and his colleagues say Russians do not report many
crimes to police and police then vastly under-report crime to make
themselves look good and to earn perks.
	   ``If they register all crimes, the legal system will collapse
instantly,'' Luneyev said.
	   Government officials, including Russia's top cop, Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin, acknowledged the problem earlier this
year and pledged to stop it.
	   Human rights activists also say that police officers frequently
break the law themselves and that many are involved in torture,
coercion and rape.
	   Luneyev said at least 15 million crimes are committed in Russia
annually. He said some estimates suggest there are as many as two
crimes per capita every year, or almost 300 million crimes in this
country of 147 million people.
	   Only four to five percent of economic crimes are registered, and
half of all murders, Luneyev said.
	   ``In the last few years, police registered about 30,000
premeditated murders a year, while the number of unidentified
bodies plus the number of missing persons was 40,000-45,000,'' he
said.
	   The criminal experts warned that the current economic crisis
could lead to a new increase in crime, partly by fueling turf
battles among criminal clans controlling a large share of Russia's
economy.
	   ``The drop in the number of people who pay extortion money to
mobsters would intensify the fighting between them,'' Luneyev said.

High school students narrowly escape when ceiling crashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Students may have thought their
teacher had hit the ceiling Wednesday when she shouted at them to
leave the room immediately. But she was keeping the ceiling from
hitting them.
	   Seconds after the 26 students fled the classroom at Marselisborg
Gymnasium in Aarhus, the 40-square-meter (430-square-foot) ceiling
fell in one piece.
	   There were no injuries, Danish radio reported.
	   During a Danish lesson, the teacher, whose name was not given,
noticed the celling was arching downwards and yelled for the
students to leave.
	   The ceiling was a construction of plaster and isnulation that
had been attached to the building's original ceiling five years ago
to help absorb noise.

Cyprus supports Syria in its conflict with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 7th graf that SANA called the rebels `illegal' and
not `terrorists'; ADDS new 8th graf with quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Visiting Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides on Wednesday reiterated his country's support for Syria
in its conflict with Turkey over Kurdish rebels, Egypt's news
agency reported.
	   Kasoulides, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, met
with Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
	   The Middle East News Agency quoted Kasoulides as saying after
the meetings that Cyprus supports Syria's stance and rejects the
language of threats and force as a method to solve problems between
countries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria ran high during the past weeks
after Ankara threatened to use military force to stop what it
called Syria's sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Cyprus also has been at loggerheads with Turkey since 1974 when
Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied the northern third of the
island.
	   The Turkey-Syria dispute appears to be waning now after Turkey
said Syria has signed an agreement to ensure that Kurdish
guerrillas do not stage cross-border attacks on Turkey.
	   The Syrian government has not acknowledged signing the agreement
but its official news agency, SANA, on Wednesday branded a major
Kurdish rebel group as an ``illegal and unlicensed party.''
	   ``It has no bases or camps in Syria. It is not allowed to carry
out any activity from Syrian territories,'' SANA said.
	   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between Turkey and
Syria to help ease the tensions. Kasoulides is scheduled to meet
with Mubarak later.
	   ``We are happy that we were able to participate and contribute
in easing tension between the two countries,'' Moussa, the foreign
minister, said.

Report: German culture czar wants Spielberg archive in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government wants to
bring part of U.S. director Steven Spielberg's Shoah Visual History
Foundation to Berlin instead of building a Holocaust Memorial, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Citing knowledgeable sources in Bonn, Der Tagesspiegel newspaper
said Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's designated culture
secretary Michael Naumann wants to locate the center on the plot of
land in central Berlin intended for the memorial.
	   Naumann refused to confirm the plan, saying only: ``Just wait
until (parliament) debates the memorial plan in the coming weeks
and then we'll talk about the future.''
	   A spokesman for Schroeder's Social Democratic party had no
immediate comment.
	   Naumann is one of the most outspoken critics of the decade-old
plan to erect a giant memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe in
the heart of Berlin.
	   He has said he would prefer to see the money be spent on
Holocaust-related projects that would be more educational than an
abstruse monument.
	   The incoming government plans to let parliament debate the issue
before deciding whether to proceed with the project.
	   Spielberg's foundation is an archive of nearly 50,000 filmed
interviews with Holocaust survivors.

New plan: If kids skip school, send parents to classes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Parents could wind up back in
school if their kids regularly skip class as part of a Dutch
government plan to tackle youth crime.
	   Parents of children who constantly play hooky can be fined under
Dutch law. But with about 30,000 reports of truancy each year, the
government is looking for a more effective solution.
	   One suggestion is for court to ask parents to perform the
equivalent of unpaid community service _ the Dutch daily NRC
Handelsblad reported Wednesday, citing unidentified civil servants
at the Justice Ministry.
	   The classes for parents, being put together by education experts
at Leiden University, would include lessons on how the school
system works, keeping track of your child's timetable and a class
called ``puberty psychology.''
	   Three Dutch cities plan to offer the courses on a voluntary
basis to parents of truants. If the classes help to reduce truancy,
they may be used as a form of sanction by the courts, the newspaper
said.

Ariane 5 countdown stopped

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countdown ahead of the third and final test
launch of Europe's Ariane 5 rocket was stopped Wednesday just as
the launch window opened.
	   Officials said the countdown for the unmanned rocket, set to
blast off from its space base in South America, could be restarted
at any moment.
	   The launch window runs from 1600 to 1730 GMT.
	   Technicians at the headquarters of Arianespace, in Evry south of
Paris, gave no reason for the stop in the countdown. Arianespace
commercializes the European rockets.
	   The Ariane 5 is the most powerful in the series of unmanned
European rockets.
	   Wednesday's scheduled launch at the space center in French
Guiana, on the northern shoulder of South America, is to be the
third and final test launch before the rocket goes into commercial
use.
	   The first Ariane 5 launch crashed in June 1996 and the second
launch a year ago was less than perfect.

Russia cuts troops along border with China: Defense minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is continuing to reduce its troops along
the Chinese border, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday.
	   Sergeyev said that so far this year Russia has disbanded or cut
300 military units stationed near the 4,200-kilometer (2,500-mile)
border with its eastern neighbor, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The report did not give the number of soldiers removed, or any
other details.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin agreed last year to a final demarcation of the border and to
reduce military activities along it.
	   Sergeyev arrived in China from Vietnam on Wednesday. He is
scheduled to hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian
and to meet with Jiang on Friday.
	   After decades of friction, relations between Moscow and Beijing
have improved dramatically in recent years as China has become a
major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's
struggling defense industries.
	   Russia views the new relationship with China as a counterbalance
to what it sees as U.S. pre-eminence in global affairs.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
on Wednesday again ruled out negotiations with the Kosovo
Liberation Army to establish peace in the wartorn province.
	   But he also renewed a warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that he is under close scrutiny to comply with the terms
of a deal he signed with NATO. The Western alliance's deadline for
him to pull his forces out of Kosovo or face airstrikes ends
Oct.27.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic said he remains commmitteed to the
Kosovo peace agreement despite what he called ``terrorist''
attempts to sabotage it, a reference to recent KLA hit-and-run
attacks on Serb forces.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network, Cook said, ``It is very
important that we have the cease-fire observed (in Kosovo) on both
sides, and that means (also) the Kosovo Liberation Army, and we
have already taken action through the U.N. to call on all members
to deny funds and arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to
contain the danger of hostilities and injury.''
	   The head of British diplomacy was interviewed while in Skopje,
capital of Montenegro, the second stop on his tour of Balkan
countries.
	   Cook said it was very important for the international community
``that we maintain our negotiations with the political, democratic,
legitimate leadership of the Kosovo people,'' adding that ``we
cannot get into negotiating a separate track with people who have
the guns.''
	   The West considers Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, and his negotatiating team the legitimage representatives
of the Kosovo Albanians, who account for some 90 percent of the two
million people of the troubled Serbian province.
	   However, a 1991 referendum in which a vast majority voted for
independence was never recognized by either Serbia or anyone else.
	   Cook was insistent in the CNN interview'': ``Let's be clear.
what we want to see emerge from the crisis is a stable democratic
Kosovo being run by elected politicians, not by the commander of
any army.''
	   Earlier in Skopje, Cook told reporters the international
community ``will be watching very carefully to make sure'' that
Milosevic sticks to the agreement'' under which he has to pull out
his troops from Kosovo and allow the return of up to 300,000
refugees.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.

	   PARIS (AP) The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, made its third and final test
launch Wednesday, an apparent success.
	   The rocket blasted off from its space base in Kourou, French
Guiana, on the northern shoulder of South America, sailing into the
heavens apparently without a hitch.
	   European officials had been holding their breath for the launch,

	   Flight 503 was carrying a mockup of Eutelsat's W2 satellite and

dominates the world's commercial launch market, competing with
U.S., Russian and Chinese firms.

Three ethnic Albanians sentenced to prison terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
were sentenced Wednesday to between three and six years'
imprisonment, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   All three had been charged with conspiracy against the state and
with being members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla
organization fighting for the province's independence from Serbia.
	   A district court in Pec handed a six-year prison sentence to
Skender Racaj from the municipality of Istok, 55 kilometers (34
miles) northwest of provincial capital Pristina, for aiding and
abetting terrorist activities.
	   The same court sentenced Iljmi Zenelji, 24, from a village near
Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Pristina, to three years.
On several occasions, Zenelji had organized supplies and procured
gasoline for the KLA, the court said.
	   Zenelji's neighbor Sali Gashi, 31, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years
in prison for smuggling machine guns and ammunition crates across
the border from neighboring Albania in June.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Anna Kournikova double faulted 20 times in
an upset loss to Silvia Farina in the Kremlin Cup Wednesday, bowing
out to the angry whistles of her home crowd.
	   The Moscow-born Kournikova dropped the first set 6-7 (5-7) to
Farina, of Italy. Sixth-seeded Kournikova clinched the second set
6-4 and lost the last set 1-6.
	   It was Kournikova's first loss since early 1997 to a player
ranked outside the world's top 15.
	   A week ago in Zurich, the 17-year-old Russian committed 17
double faults to lose in the first round of the European
Championships.
	   Kournikova, who now lives and trains in Florida, dropped out of
the top 10 after tearing ligaments in her right thumb. She is
ranked 12th on the WTA tour.
	   She wasn't the only seeded player to lose Wednesday. Chanda
Rubin of the United States upset eighth-seed Irina Spirlea in
straight sets 6-2, 6-3.
	   In other matches, Sabine Appelmans beat Elena Dementieva 6-4,
6-4. Fifth seeded Mary Pierce beat last year's Kremlin Cup
runner-up Ai Sugiyama 5-7, 6-2, 6-4. Sandrine Testud, seeded
seventh, beat French compatriot Nathalie Dechy 6-2, 6-2.

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Army soldiers raided a separatists'
hideout Wednesday in the mountains of Kashmir near Pakistan,
sparking a gunbattle that killed two soldiers and two separatists,
police said.
	   The violence coincided with the end of a two-day visit to the
troubled Kashmir region by the U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard
Celeste, who urged India and rival Pakistan to continue talks to
resolve their dispute over the Himalayan region, which straddles
both countries.
	   The two countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and India
accuses Pakistan of backing Islamic separatists in its portion of
Kashmir _ a charge Pakistan denies.
	   Weekend negotiations by the countries' foreign secretaries
failed to reach any agreement on Kashmir. The issue developed new
urgency when both countries entered the world's club of declared
nuclear powers by exploding nuclear devices earlier this year.
	   Celeste met with both government leaders and representatives of
separatist groups during his trip.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's
second-largest city Wednesday, apparently marking a return to an
all-out civil war in the tiny west African nation.
	   The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they had taken
Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of the Bissau, the
capital. The claim was corroborated by aid workers in the country
and Portuguese diplomats.
	   A three-month truce ended Sunday in the former Portuguese colony
when rebels clashed with government troops near the presidential
palace in Bissau.
	   ``It looks like they have decided to resolve (the dispute) by
force,'' a Portuguese foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Michael Kleiner, a spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross in Geneva, said the fighting in Bafata was over
quickly. He had no information on the number of casualties.
	   Earlier Wednesday, government forces launched a heavy artillery
barrage against rebel positions in the western outskirts of the
capital.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira, supported by
forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, used
rocket-launchers and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been
advancing on the center of Bissau.
	   Senegal has been readying the small airfield in the Bissagos
Islands, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, to receive
warplanes, possibly for launching air strikes against rebel
positions, according to reports in Lisbon.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by west African and Portuguese-speaking negotiators. The
mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was reached.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of
thousands of refugees throughout the country of 1 million.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

Defense satisfied with opening of Russian treason trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with new quotes from Nikitin. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A retired naval officer and his
lawyers expressed cautious optimism Wednesday that he will receive
a fair trial on charges he revealed state secrets about how Russia
disposes of nuclear waste.
	   Alexander Nikitin, 46, has been charged with treason.
Prosecutors are asking he be sent to prison for 12 to 20 years.
	   Nikitin pleaded innocent when his trial opened Tuesday, more
than three years after he was first charged with giving secret
documents to a Norwegian environmental group, the Bellona
Foundation.
	   Bellona compiled a 1996 report criticizing the handling of
nuclear waste and reactors in Russia's Northern Fleet.
	   The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking
have never been published and were shown to his lawyers for the
first time Tuesday.
	   They argue that under the Russian Constitution, criminal charges
cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws. Nikitin and
Bellona maintain that the information used in compiling their
report came from public records.
	   Judge Sergei Golets evicted most observers from the court a
half-hour after the trial opened. On Wednesday, he went through the
30-page indictment and questioned Nikitin, said Diederik Lohman,
director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch.
	   Defense lawyer Ivan Pavlov was positive about Wednesday's
proceedings, which lasted only four hours.
	   ``The judge asked questions very calmly and professionally,'' he
said.
	   Nikitin said the trial was held ``under normal working
conditions.''
	   ``The judge questioned me, and he did his job in a professional
manner,'' he said by telephone from his home. ``It is hard for me
to evaluate the judge's attitude, but my lawyers said he was quite
professional.''
	   Prosecutor Alexander Gutzan is expected to question Nikitin on
Thursday, as will his own lawyers. The first witnesses are expected
to be called Friday: Sergei Filipov, a former employee of Bellona's
Murmansk office, and retired navy officer Evgeny Chernov.

Ariane 5 makes third and final test launch

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, made its third and final test
launch Wednesday, sailing without a hitch into the heavens above
South America.
	   The lift off from its space base in Kourou, French Guiana, on
the northern shoulder of South America, came at 13:37 p.m. local
time (1637 GMT). It was well within the launch window despite a
half-hour halt in the countdown.
	   Flight 503 was carrying a mockup of Eutelsat's W2 satellite,
weighing 2.6 tons, and a capsule with instruments to measure
various functions. The capsule was to fall later into the Pacific
Ocean for recovery.
	   One of the goals of the launch is to confirm Ariane 5's capacity
to place satellites into orbit.
	   European officials had been holding their breath for the launch.
	   The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and a launch a year ago
was less-than-perfect.
	   Wednesday's final test launch was critical. Officials see the
Ariane 5 as a vehicle to boost Europe's commercial space launch
industry even further along its success route.
	   The Ariane 5 has twice the power and payload capacity of the
Ariane 4, and should double launch capacity for Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the European Space Agency.
	   Trouble with the Ariane 5 forced officials to switch a Eutelsat
satellite to an Ariane 4, ESA officials said in June.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the rocket experienced a
spin problem on its test launch last Oct. 30.
	   Arianespace dominates the world's commercial launch market,
competing with U.S., Russian and Chinese firms.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ New techniques may improve the chances of
successful bone marrow transplants in cancer victims who do not
have good tissue matches with donors.
	   Marrow transplants are a potentially lifesaving treatment of
last resort for some victims of leukemia and other types of cancer.
However, about one-quarter of patients who might benefit cannot
have transplants because doctors are unable to find a closely
matched donor.
	   Without a good match of tissue types, the transplant is likely
to fail, often because the patient's body attacks the foreign
marrow.
	   Now, doctors from the University of Perugia in Italy and the
Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, report a potential way
around this in a study in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   The new method, described by Dr. Franco Aversa, appears to offer
a reasonable chance of success among those in whom only a partial
match can be found. It is based on giving patients much larger than
usual doses of donated marrow.
	   The donor receives growth hormone that trigger the release of
large numbers of marrow cells into the bloodstream. These cells are
then strained from the donors' blood. The marrow is cleansed to
remove blood cells that can trigger a misguided attack by the
body's immune system.
	   After 18 months, 12 of the 43 patients treated this way were
alive and free of disease. However, doctors cautioned that
rebuilding of the patients' immune systems was poor, and infections
were a common cause of death.
	   In another report in the journal, Dr. Takehiko Sasazuki of
Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, reported a way of fine-tuning
donor matching using genetic analysis. Their report showed that
matching up some of the genes that control the immune system are
especially important.
	   They said that this more in-depth matching of donor and
recipient can improve the success rate, even when the two sides
would ordinarily be considered to have identical tissue types.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Jon J. van Rood and Machteld
Oudshoorn of Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands
said the studies are milestones in marrow transplantation.
	   ``It is equally clear,'' they wrote, ``that many other
milestones will have to be passed before not only all patients have
donors, but also all are cured.''

Prosecutors sue journalist for anti-Semitic articles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prosecutors began legal proceedings
Wednesday against the editor-in-chief of a virulently anti-Semitic
weekly, accused of publishing ``chauvinistic and nationalist''
articles.
	   Mihai Bogdan Antonescu, 33, is accused of publishing seven
articles containing ``exclusivism and extremist nationalism,'' said
a statement from the Supreme Court of Justice carried by Mediafax
news agency.
	   If convicted, he could get up to five years in prison.
	   The Jewish Federation in Romania recently asked the government
to investigate the people who run the weekly called ``Attacking the
person'' for articles which they claimed incited the ``mass
execution of Jews.''
	   Many of the articles in the xenophobic weekly are not signed.
The weekly regularly labels politicians of all parties ``dirty
Jews,'' and there is a column called `Swastika.'
	   The rest of the tabloid is devoted to scurrilous and libelous
articles probing public people's private lives.
	   Some 14,000 Jews live in Romania. Before World War II there were
about 800,000. Half perished in the war, partly due to the policies
of pro-Hitler Marshal Ion Antonescu. Most of the rest emigrated to
Israel under communism.
	   The publisher of the weekly, Dumitru Dragomir, is head of
Romania's professional soccer league. He also owns the daily
Romanian Sport and several strip bars in Bucharest.

Bavarian authorities apply for passport to speed deportation of
</HEADLINE>
delinquent Turkish youth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Determined to expel a delinquent Turkish
youth, authorities in the southern state of Bavaria on Wednesday
applied to the Turkish consulate for a second passport for the
14-year-old boy whose case became an election-year symbol of
``criminal foreigners.''
	   Bavarian Interior Ministry spokesman Michael Ziegler said the
boy, known only as Mehmet, probably wouldn't be deported before
next week. Bavarian officials apparently wanted a second passport
to avoid any delays in obtaining the boy's original from his
defense lawyer.
	   A Munich court on Tuesday had upheld a lower court's order to
deport Mehmet.
	   Despite an earlier court decision blocking efforts to deport his
parents along with him, a spokeswoman for Bavarian Interior
Minister Guenther Beckstein said officials also planned to expel
the parents with the boy on ground they failed to properly raise
their child.
	   Efforts to deport the boy, and his parents, who have lived here
for 30 years, became a central theme in election-year politics, and
the new partners in Germany's federal government sharply criticized
plans to go ahead with the expulsion.
	   Cem Oezdemir, the first person of Turkish origin elected to
parliament, warned the planned deportation could have a devastating
effect on relations between Germans and the 2 million Turks living
here.
	   ``If the boy had been German, he would have been punished like
any other youth with a jail term or put in a reform center,'' said
Oezdemir, a member of the Greens, the junior coalition partner.
	   Bavarian authorities sought Mehmet's expulsion on the basis of
more than 60 offenses. Their case was strengthened two weeks ago
when a court handed down the first conviction against the boy, on
charges of robbery and causing bodily harm. German law permits
deportation of any foreigner sentenced to at least one year in
jail.

American sought for sex-crime may have fled Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The HIV-positive American man charged
with assault for allegedly having unprotected sex with countless
women may have fled the country, police said Wednesday.
	   Police telephone lines have been flooded for two days with tips
on the whereabouts of 40-year-old James Patric Kimball and from
women who knew him or had sex with him.
	   At least 65 women have reported having sex with Kimball, a
familiar figure in many Stockholm nightspots, the Swedish news
agency TT reported.
	   Kimball has been charged with rape and grave assault. The latter
charge has been used by Swedish authorities to prosecute others
have unprotected sex while knowing themselves to be HIV-positive.
	   Authorities on Tuesday released Kimball's name and photograph to
the news media, a highly unusual move in Sweden where the legal
system is weighted toward defendants. Releasing that information
prompted hundreds of calls to police and to an HIV crisis telephone
service.
	   ''We have received information that ... he may be in Denmark,''
police spokesman Christer Sjoeblom said Wednesday. Police in
Fredrikshavn, Denmark, reported that an American man was being
sought after failing to pay his bill for a Tuesday night hotel
stay. Fredrikshavn is a main port for ferries travelling from
western Sweden.
	   Police meanwhile were laboring to find background on Kimball,
who moved to Sweden in 1992 after living on the French Riviera.
Authorities say he isived in a two-room apartment in a Stockholm suburb and
worked for a small taxi company, but claimed to have wide celebrity
contacts and styled himself as a party-arranger, according to
Stockholm newspapers.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors who examined President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday said he has recovered from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a foreign trip and limit other activities,
his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin's checkup at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow was
previously scheduled and had nothing to do with his previous heart
problems or any other emergency, Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   The exam included an X-ray, he said, according to the Interfax
news agency, which gave no other details. Doctors reported that
Yeltsin's health had returned to normal, he said.
	   After his checkup, Yeltsin returned to his Gorky-9 country
residence outside of Moscow, but had no working meetings. He spoke
by telephone to German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, and
agreed to meet him in Moscow Nov. 16 and 17, the president's press
service said.

Bangladeshi police storm Burmese refugee camp; 100 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police opened fire and lobbed
tear gas shells at a Burmese refugee camp Wednesday to subdue armed
refugees who have resisted Bangladeshi efforts to send them back to
Myanmar. At least 100 refugees, many of them women and children,
were injured, officials said.
	   Police detained 35 refugees for illegal possession of arms,
local police chief Mohammad Amiruzzman said. The camp at Nayapara,
a southern village near Cox's Bazar, houses more than 11,000 Muslim
refugees from Myanmar, which is also referred to as Burma.
	   A quarter of a million Burmese Muslims fled their homeland for
Bangladesh in 1991, accusing Myanmar's military of murder, rape and
forced labor.
	   More than 212,000 have been sent home under supervision of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. But many others have refused
to return for fear of persecution.

Supplements may offer alternative in fighting heart disease

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ New research suggests that
swallowing a supplement packed with artery-protecting nutrients may
be just as effective in preventing heart disease as sipping a good
Cabernet.
	   The nutrients are flavonoids, vitamin-like compounds that
naturally occur in tea and in fruits and vegetables. They make
blood cells called platelets less prone to clotting and act as
antioxidants, countering the artery-damaging potential of highly
reactive free radical chemicals.
	   The study, funded by supplement manufacturer Melaleuca Inc. of
Idaho Falls, Idaho, tested 14 people who took the supplement ProVex
CV over seven days. Larger studies are being planned.
	   The findings, presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the
American Dietetic Association, indicate that pregnant women and
others who should avoid alcohol can reap the benefits of red wine
without drinking it.
	   Red wine's role in warding off heart trouble was made famous by
research showing that the French, with red wine as a staple, have
lower rates of heart disease despite their penchant for high-fat
food.
	   John Folts, a University of Wisconsin researcher, said the tests
showed ``significant and encouraging'' reductions in platelet
activity.
	   ProVex CV was one of four flavonoid supplements examined by
Folts but was the only one he said showed significant benefits. It
contains extracts made of grape seeds, grape skins, Ginkgo biloba,
bilberries and a specific flavonoid called quercetin.

Sweden &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already banned for three games by UEFA, Paul Ince
has been charged by the Football Association with misconduct over
his reaction to being sent off against Sweden last month.
	   The fiery England midfielder was shown the red card during
England's Euro 2000 qualifying defeat in Stockholm and, on his way
from the field, made a two-finger gesture.
	   It's not clear who the gesture was aimed at but UEFA has already
punished the Liverpool midfielder for comments he made to Italian
referee Pierluigi Collina as he left the field. Ince has already
missed the Euro 2000 games against Bulgaria and Luxembourg.
	   If the FA finds him guilty of misconduct, Ince could be fined
and suspended from England's next two games _ both exhibitions _
against the Czech Republic at Wembley Nov. 18 and against an
opponent yet to be decided in February.
	   Because of the UEFA ban, he misses England's next Euro 2000
qualifying game at home to group leader Poland March 27.

Syria breaks silence to brand Turkish Kurds as illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's official news agency on Tuesday
branded as illegal a Turkish insurgent group, comments that suggest
Syria is willing to placate Turkey in a dispute that had threatened
to turn into war.
	   It was the first official Syrian comment since Turkey's
announcement Tuesday that Syria has agreed to crack down on the
rebels of Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The Syrian government
has not confirmed signing the agreement.
	   In a report by its political editor, the official Syrian Arab
News Agency or SANA, which reflects the government view, said:
``The PKK is an illegal and unlicensed party.''
	   ``It has no bases or camps in Syria. It is not allowed to carry
out any activity from Syrian territories,'' said SANA in the first
direct Syrian comments about the Kurdish rebels since tensions
began rising this month.
	   Turkey says Syria has pledged under the agreement to shut down
PKK camps in its territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley of Lebanon. The agreement was reached after two days of
negotiations in the southern Turkish town of Seyhan.
	   Ankara says the guerrillas stage cross-border attacks on Turkey
in its war for autonomy that has claimed 37,000 lives since 1984.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria peaked Oct. 6 when Turkey
threatened to use military action if Syria did not expel the
rebels.
	   During the tense days, the Syrian government never once
mentioned the PKK directly. Neither did it acknowledge hosting the
rebels.
	   The official media had restricted itself by saying there were
``differences'' and ``tension.''
	   On Wednesday, SANA said that during the discussions in Seyhan
the Turkish side explained its security concerns. ``Views were
identical ... Turkey, on the principle of reciprocity, would not
also allow any activity that aims at Syrian security and
stability,'' it said.
	   The two sides also agreed to set up a ``hot line'' telephone
link between their security officials, SANA said.
	   In Ankara on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Turkey
would ``carefully'' watch Syria's implementation of the deal.

Cyrpus accuses Turkey of buzzing Greek transport aircraft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus on Wednesday accused Turkey of
buzzing a Greek transport aircraft while it flew to a controversial
military base on the island, raising tensions anew on this
war-partitioned Mediterranean nation.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said several Turkish
F-16 fighter jets came within 2,000 feet (600 meters) of the Greek
C-130 transport plane and tailed it for several minutes Tuesday
evening before flying away.
	   Turkey did not immediately respond to the allegation.
	   Stylianides said the Greek plane was headed to Paphos, where the
air base is located.
	   The base was built for the use of Greek warplanes in the case of
an outbreak of hostilities on the island.
	   The accusation came only hours after Athens said 26 Turkish
fighter planes violated Greek airspace on Tuesday when Greek forces
launched war games with Cypriot forces. Turkey denied the charge.
	   In what is certain to raise tensions further, the Cypriot
Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the Greek air force and five
naval vessels _ a submarine, a frigate, a destroyer and two torpedo
boats _ would take part in the six-day war games.
	   NATO partners and traditional rivals Greece and Turkey are at
odds over Cyprus, territorial rights in the Aegean and minorities.
Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974 when it
invaded the island following a coup by Greek Cypriots who wanted to
unite Cyprus with Greece.
	   Since then, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have lived
apart, separated by a cease-fire line policed by a U.N. force.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island, whose division has over
the years foiled repeated attempts by the United Nations and others
to reconcile the two communities.
	   New Zealander Ann Hercus, the U.N. resident envoy in Cyprus, met
Wednesday with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the
Turkish-occupied part of Nicosia as part of the world body's latest
bid to reunite the island.
	   Hercus last week began separate talks with Greek Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash in what her office says are
open-ended, without-an-agenda shuttle diplomacy.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than six
months, with little sign of early progress.
	   After the first day's four-party discussions ended, South Korean
officials remained tight-lipped, saying only that they were
``business-like and constructive.''
	   North Korean and U.S. officials continued to hold bilateral
discussions into the evening. The other two delegations involved
are South Korea and China.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made an opening proposal for a
``humanitarian corridor'' across the line of North-South
demarcation to ease distribution of humanitarian aid.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prosecutors in southern Poland are
investigating allegations of inciting national hate made against a
man who has rallied conservative Catholics to erect crosses near
the former Auschwitz death camp, the news agency PAP reported
Wednesday.
	   Prosecutors in Bielsko-Biala, some 40 kilometers (25 miles)
south of Oswiecim, where the former Nazi death camp is located,
ordered an investigation after residents complained about
statements and leaflets distributed by people working with
Kazimierz Switon.
	   They include a statement issued on June 28, urging residents to
erect crosses at the site, saying ``the time has come so that we,
Poles, wage merciless war on Jewish-communist-masonry, the biggest
enemies of the Polish state.'' Leaflets describe Israel and Germany
as ``satanic-pagan forces aiming at extermination of the Polish
nation,'' PAP reported.
	   If convicted of inciting national hatred, the authors of the
statements face up to two years in prison.
	   Switon has organized the placement of more than 200 small wooden
crosses around a larger, 8-meter papal cross that has stood since
1988 at a site adjacent to Auschwitz where Nazis murdered 152
Polish resistors.
	   Jews have long objected to the presence of the larger cross,
visible inside the camp, as an insult to the memory of Jews killed
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations around the world renewed their
outrage after the smaller crosses began appearing this summer.
	   The Israeli government has urged Poland to solve the dispute.
	   But efforts at a solution were set back on Monday when a
regional court in Oswiecim rejected a request by the Polish
government to evict conservative Catholics who have been camping
out at the site, and to appoint a government trustee with authority
over the area.
	   The government said it would appeal.
	   Meanwhile, administrators of the Auschwitz memorial appealed a
decision by the regional governor lifting the ban on construction
of a controversial visitor's center across from Auschwitz. The
memorial wants construction halted until a development plan is
approved for the zone surrounding the camp.
	   After objections from Jewish organizations, the
	   developer scaled down the project and received permission to
proceed. But the project was halted again in July 1996.
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in Auschwitz gas
chambers or from forced labor, disease and starvation from 1940-45.

Parliament adopts a new constitution.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Albania's parliament, dominated by the
ruling Socialists, adopted Wednesday the first non-Communist
constitution, which must be put to a popular vote to enter into
force. The opposition led by former President Sali Berisha
boycotted the vote.
	   Political observers say that whatever the outcome of the
referendum, it is unlikely to end the ongoing political crisis.
	   A total of 115 deputies voted for the draft, with one
abstention. No one voted against.
	   The referendum will be scheduled by President Rexhep Meidani. It
is expected to be held in late November.
	   At the end of the session, also attended by Meidani and Western
diplomats, parliament speaker Skender Gjinushi appealed to
Albanians to vote for ``the first democratic constitution of the
country''.
	   Gjinushi called it ``Albania's passport to Europe.''
	   Drafters of the new constitution say that, if approved by a
majority of voters in the referendum, it puts Albania on a par with
European democracies, guaranteeing fundamental human and religious
rights and the right to private property.
	   A similiar draft was signed by Berisha when he was president in
1994, but it was never voted on in parliament and was subsequently
rejected by Albanians in a referendum held in November of the same
year.
	   The political tensions, permanent in Europe's poorest country
that emerged from some fifty years of harsh Stalinist rule in 1991,
turned the 1994 referendum into a vote against Berisha, the then
president.
	   Again this year, it is likely that lingering political rivalry
between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats will
turn the fall referendum into a vote for or against the two feuding
leaders: former PremierFatos Nano and Sali Berisha.
	   The new constitution and its 182 articles were drafted under the
close guidance and monitoring of European institutions such as the
Council of Europe, which approved it.
	   But despite international community pressure to convince the
opposition to participate in the process of the drafting and voting
on the constitution, Berisha's opposition Democrats stayed away.
	   The recent killing of an opposition leader has wrecked chances
for a dialogue between the two biggest political parties.
	   At present, unauthorized anti-government rallies called by the
opposition take place three times a week. In those rallies,
Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano is called a ``terrorist'' and
Cabinet members are called ``thieves'' and ``smugglers''.
	   The political disputes worsened after parliament recently passed
a law on holding referendums, which says the result of a referendum
is valid even if less than fifty percent of eligible voters
participate.

Eleven more condemned to die for 1997 coup in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Friends and relatives wept when a
High Court judge on Wednesday sentenced a former government
minister, a 75-year-old woman and 9 others to death for
collaborating with a bloody 1997 coup that toppled Sierra Leone's
president.
	   Among those condemned to hang was Nancy Steel, a 75-year-old
political activist who raised her arms and sobbed when she heard
the judgment.
	   ``May the Lord have mercy on us all!'' she shouted while others
around her also cried.
	   Others sentenced to death Wednesday included former Justice
Minister Claude Campbell and retired army Brig. Leslie Lyman. Five
other people were given 10-year prison terms. All were allowed 21
days to appeal their fate.
	   The rulings bring to at least 69 the number of people sentenced
to death by civilian and military courts in connection with the May
25, 1997 coup that began 10 months of rule by junta and allied
rebel troops.
	   On Monday, 24 military officers were hooded, tied to poles and
executed by a firing squad of soldiers. Among those executed were
Col. F.Y. Koroma, brother of ex-junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul
Koroma, who went into hiding with the remnants of his forces after
a Nigerian-led West African force returned President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah to power earlier this year.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Six Nepali porters accompanying a
Swedish trekking team have died in a high mountain pass in the
Himalayas, Indian news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   The United News of India said the trekkers and the porters were
trying to reach the Pin valley through a high mountain pass in the
Lahaul Spiti region in Himachal Pradesh state on Sunday. But there
was heavy snowfall and the team could not cross the pass, delayed
reports said.
	   The area is 450 kilometers (270 miles) north of the Indian
capital New Delhi.
	   The Swedish team, which had hired 17 porters for the expedition,
made it safely back to the valley.
	   It was not clear from the reports in what condition the rest of
the trekkers and the remaining porters were, nor was it known how
they died.
	   A rescue team was trying to bring the back to Kullu, the nearest
town, the reports said.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ About 10 unarmed demonstrators occupied
Mexico's embassy in Oslo on Wednesday, demanding the release of
political prisoners in the Chiapas region, police said.
	   Police spokesman Vidar Hjulstad said the small group of
Norwegians were members of the local left-wing Blitz youth group,
which routinely demonstrates for a variety of causes. The
demonstrators referred to themselves as Zapatas on Wednesday.
	   In January, 1994, rebels calling themselves Zapatistas staged a
brief armed uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas, demanding
greater democracy and Indian rights. The is still tension in the
area between the rebels and Mexico's government.
	   The demonstrators issued a statement demanding the immediate
release of prisoners and the withdrawal of government troops from
the troubled southern Mexico state.
	   Police surrounded the embassy in downtown Oslo, but took no
immediate action because the Mexican ambassador wanted to wait,
Hjulstad said by telephone.
	   The state radio network NRK said all embassy staff left the
building, except for one employee who stayed to keep an eye on the
protesters.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Guerrillas fired on a police patrol in the restive
southern Russian republic of Dagestan on Wednesday, and two
officers and four attackers were killed, news agencies reported.
	   The patrol had stopped to investigate a police car parked on the
side of a country road near the border with breakaway Chechnya.
When the officers approached the car, they came under fire from
unidentified men in military fatigues, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported.
	   Six police officers were wounded, Interfax said. One attacker
was captured, but about a dozen others escaped, the reports said.
Police were searching the area.
	   Dagestan's interior minister, Adilgirei Magomedtagirov, blamed
Chechnya for the attack. He said questioning of the captured
attacker indicated they sneaked in from Chechnya ``to kidnap people
and hijack cars.''
	   Dagestan has been plagued by violence spilling over from
Chechnya, as well as by its own ethnic conflicts. Kidnappings and
other crimes have become common in Chechnya since the end of its
1994-96 independence war with Russia.

Ariane 5 completes third and final test launch

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, made its third and final test
launch Wednesday, sailing without a hitch into the heavens above
South America.
	   The lift off from its space base in Kourou, French Guiana, on
the northern shoulder of South America, came at 13:37 p.m. local
time (1637 GMT). It was well within the launch window despite a
half-hour halt in the countdown.
	   Just 31 minutes after lift-off, Flight 503 successfully
simulated the launching of a mockup satellite that was part of its
payload, the 2.6-ton MAGSAT 3.
	   Confirming Ariane 5's capacity to lob satellites into orbit at
an altitude of 1,500 kms (932) was a prime goal of this test
mission.
	   The Ariane 5 also dropped a capsule with instruments to measure
various functions. The capsule was to be recovered in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   European officials had been holding their breath for the launch.
	   The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and a launch a year ago
was less-than-perfect, making Wednesday's final test launch
critical.
	   Officials see the Ariane 5 as a vehicle to boost Europe's
commercial space launch industry even further along its success
route.
	   The Ariane 5 has twice the power and payload capacity of the
Ariane 4, and should double launch capacity for Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the European Space Agency.
	   Trouble with the Ariane 5 forced officials to switch a Eutelsat
satellite to an Ariane 4, ESA officials said in June.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the rocket experienced a
spin problem on its test launch last Oct. 30.
	   Arianespace dominates the world's commercial launch market,
competing with U.S., Russian and Chinese firms.

Australia hopes to clinch first series in 39 years

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia can end a 39-year test
series skin starting Thursday, and it doesn't even have to win.
	   Having won the opener, a draw in the third and final test in
Karachi will be good enough to become the first Australian team to
leave Pakistan with a series victory since 1959.
	   ``They haven't lost here and it's a bit of a worry for us,''
Australian captain Mark Taylor said.
	   Australia won the first test in Rawalpindi by an innings and 99
runs while the second test in Peshawar ended in a draw after Taylor
equalled Don Bradman's record for an Australian innings with an
unbeaten 334.
	   ``This time my boys are playing very good cricket and there is
no reason why we should not perform well here,'' he said. ``We will
do our best to clinch the series. I think we can certainly beat
them here.''
	   Getting the early lead will be critical according to Taylor.
	   ``Toss will be vital as whosoever wins it will definitely bat,''
predicted the 33-year-old Australian captain after seeing a flat
and dry wicket at the National Stadium.
	   ``It will definitely help spinners,'' he said. ``The pitch might
start helping the slow bowlers from day one.''
	   Although Taylor did not announce his 11, it is likely that
Darren Lehmann will be back in place of Ricky Ponting. Lehmann has
fully recovered from his groin injury which he aggravated during
the four-day match before the second test. He made successive
centuries against Rawalpindi before he retired due to groin problem
in the second innings.
	   Pakistan has dropped leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed for the final
test. However all-rounder Wasim Akram has fully recovered from
influenza and a throat infection which prevented him from playing
in the second test.
	   ``We will play positively and our aim is to stop Australian from
winning the series,'' Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail said.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Teams &QC; 
	   Pakistan: Aamir Sohail, Saeed Anwar, Ijaz Ahmed, Inzamamul Haq,
Salim Malik, Yousuf Youhanna, Moin Khan, Azhar Mahmood, Wasim
Akram, Shoaib Akhtar, Saqlain Mushtaq, Arshad Khan, Shakeel Ahmed,
Shahid Afridi, Shahid Nazir and Muhammad Akram.
	   Australia: Mark Taylor, Justin Langer, Michael Slater, Steve
Waugh, Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy, Stuart
MacGill, Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath, Collin Miller, Michael

Three premiers revive regional cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Leaders of three Central European
nations gathered Wednesday to revive cooperation and address
regional and international issues.
	   The premiers of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland _ known
as the ``Visegrad Three'' after their initial 1991 venue _ debated
a range of topics, including the Kosovo crisis, the regional impact
Russia's ailing economy and Euro-Atlantic cooperation.
	   The group first met seven years ago, on the idea that
cooperating instead of competing against each other would help them
gain entry into NATO and the European Union.
	   Yet three years later the plan of regional cooperation had begun
to crumble. At Wednesday's meeting, the three agreed to meet at
least every six months in the future. No date or locations were
immediately available.
	   ``We met to revive the cooperation that was so promising when it
started in 1991 and then petered out,'' said Hungarian Premier
Viktor Orban, flanked by his Czech and Polish counterparts, Milos
Zeman and Jerzy Buzek.
	   The breakup of Czechoslovakia and former Czech premier Vaclav
Klaus putting cooperation on the backburner, Slovakia getting
dropped from the fast track to EU and NATO, posed major problems.
	   But Zeman, who was elected this summer, is eager to revive his
country's participation.
	   ``It was a good idea which vanished, but now I hope it'll live
forever,'' Zeman said.
	   Hungary's bumper grain crop even became a divisive factor this
year, when Prague and Warsaw slapped on surcharges this year for
imported Hungarian wheat and corn. The issue was avoided Wednesday,
as it is being negotiated by the Central European Free Trade
Association (CEFTA), made up of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In a new bid to get diplomatic immunity for Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ambassador said Wednesday the former
Chilean dictator was on a special mission to Britain when he was
arrested in a hospital bed last week.
	   The announcement of the unspecified mission was the latest move
to end the impasse over the arrest of Pinochet at the instigation
of a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain on charges
of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and left Chile's government defending the 82-year-old dictator on
grounds that the arrest, which has enraged Pinochet supporters in
Chile, is straining a democracy painstakingly achieved since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   ``It was a special mission,'' Ambassador Mario Artaza told an
embassy news conference.
	   He refused to elaborate or say whether Chile now seeks to
maintain that Pinochet, who was commander-in-chief of the army
until March, was here on an arms-buying trip.
	   In Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said a
``decree'' had been issued that Pinochet was on a special mission
and this had been extended through Nov. 5 when Pinochet decided to
have medical treatment in London.
	   Pinochet underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated spine, and
since his arrest Oct. 16 has remained in an expensive London
clinic, now under police guard.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the ambassador and a special envoy from the
Chilean Foreign Ministry, Santiago Benadava, took the decrees to
the Foreign Office, but apparently made no impact. The Foreign
Office reiterated Wednesday evening that Pinochet did not have
diplomatic immunity.
	   Until announcing the special mission status, Chile had argued
that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity because he arrived last month
on a diplomatic passport and is a senator in Chile.
	   Britain accords diplomatic immunity only to accredited diplomats
and officials of foreign government who come on official visits.
The special mission decrees were an evident bid to qualify Pinochet
in the second category.
	   ``We are not justifying, shielding or defending the dictator of
the 70s,'' said the ambassador, adding that unless the government
protected Pinochet it would be accused by opposition parties that
support him of failing in its duty.
	   ``For you here in Britain it is very easy to pass judgment. ...
But we ask, `Let's find some solution that would be acceptable to
everyone in this situation,'' he added.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the head of Parliament's human rights
committee backed an attempt by Amnesty International to have
Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on torture charges if he escapes
extradition to Spain.
	   ``We should seize this chance to bring to justice one of the
most evil dictators alive,'' Ann Clwyd, a lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party, said in a letter to Attorney General John Morris.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.

EU Troika and Algerian foreign minister agree on association talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union agreed Wednesday to
begin association talks with the Algiers government and to
cooperate in the fight against terrorism.
	   The agreement was announced following talks here between
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf and representatives of the EU
troika -- Britain, Germany and Austria and the EU commission,
represented by Manuel Marin.
	   No date was announced for the negotiations, according to the
Austria Press Agency. But Attaf said the agreement to hold talks
was welcomed by Algeria.
	   All parties expressed hope that that the new relationship would
strengthen ties between Algeria and the EU. The meeting Thursday
followed a visit by an EU mission to Algeria in January and a
meeting of the EU and Mediterranean states in Palermo, Italy, in
July.
	   The parties also expressed their common interest in combatting
terrorism, which has shaken the North African country for the past
six years and claimed tens of thousands of lives.
	   Attaf said the fight against terrorism should take into account
cultural differences the the principle of non-interference in
internal affairs.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than six
months, with few hopes of a breakthrough.
	   South Korean delegation leader Park Kun-woo, the chairman of the
meeting, described the first four-party session as ``business-like
and constructive.''
	   ``I think we're making progress,'' said U.S. delegation chief
Charles Kartman.
	   However, behind the upbeat public comments and smiles for the
cameras, serious problems remained.
	   North Korea last week reiterated its demands that the main items
on the agenda should be a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea
and a peace treaty between the Washington and Pyongyang, excluding
Seoul.
	   Officials indicated that the North Korean Vice Foreign Minister
Kim Gye Gwan brought up the issue again Wednesday.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and March, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However,
Seoul doesn't want it to be a formal agenda item.
	   And the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang, saying
any Korean peace treaty should be signed between the two Koreas.
	   After the talks broke down in March, Pyongyang said the United
States was to blame. It only agreed to resume the negotiations as
part of a package deal with Washington last month.
	   Under that deal, North Korea also agreed to resume talks with
the United States on restricting its development and sales of
missiles. In return it won a U.S. promise to provide it with
300,000 tons of free food.
	   South Korean diplomats said their delegation would propose the
four-party talks take place every three months. China, an ally of
Communist North Korea, is the fourth country taking part.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made an opening proposal for a
``humanitarian corridor'' across the line of North-South
demarcation to ease distribution of humanitarian aid.
	   Foreign ministry official Jacob Kellenberger said such a scheme
would offer logistical support to relief goods passing from South
to North through the border village of Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.
	   Kellenberger also proposed there should be a ``continent-wide
security dialogue'' in Asia _ similar to the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly
2 million troops deployed on both sides.

Four Georgians detained smuggling sheep from Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards detained four people for
trying to smuggle 120 sheep across a mountain pass into Georgia,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   The four Georgians had no documents allowing them to drive
livestock across the border, the news agency said, quoting Russian
border officials.
	   Investigators also want to know where the Georgians got so many
sheep, and whether they were stolen, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Two residents of the southern Russian region of Dagestan and an
Azerbaijani were arrested a week ago trying to smuggle 120 cattle
from Russia to Azerbaijan.
	   Earlier this month, four Dagestanis were arrested when they
tried to drive 30 sheep, six cows and four horses from Russia to
Georgia.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, made its third and final test
launch Wednesday, sailing without a hitch into the heavens above
South America.
	   The lift off from its space base in Kourou, French Guiana, on
the northern shoulder of South America, came at 13:37 p.m. local
time (1637 GMT). It was well within the launch window despite a
half-hour halt in the countdown.
	   Just 31 minutes after lift-off, Flight 503 successfully
simulated the launching of a mockup satellite that was part of its
payload, the 2.6-ton MAGSAT 3.
	   Confirming Ariane 5's capacity to lob satellites into orbit at
an altitude of 1,500 kms (932) was a prime goal of this test
mission.
	   The Ariane 5 also dropped a capsule with instruments to measure
various functions. The capsule was to be recovered in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   French President Jacques Chirac congratulated all involved in
the successful test of what will now be Europe's new satellite
launcher.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
on Wednesday again ruled out negotiations with the Kosovo
Liberation Army to establish peace in the wartorn province.
	   But he also renewed a warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that he is under close scrutiny to comply with the terms
of a deal he signed with NATO. The Western alliance's deadline for
him to pull his forces out of Kosovo or face airstrikes ends
Oct.27.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic said he remains commmitteed to the
Kosovo peace agreement despite what he called ``terrorist''
attempts to sabotage it, a reference to recent KLA hit-and-run
attacks on Serb forces.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network, Cook said, ``It is very
important that we have the cease-fire observed (in Kosovo) on both
sides, and that means (also) the Kosovo Liberation Army, and we
have already taken action through the U.N. to call on all members
to deny funds and arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to
contain the danger of hostilities and injury.''
	   The head of British diplomacy was interviewed while in Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, the second stop on his tour of Balkan
countries.
	   Cook said it was very important for the international community
``that we maintain our negotiations with the political, democratic,
legitimate leadership of the Kosovo people,'' adding that ``we
cannot get into negotiating a separate track with people who have
the guns.''
	   The West considers Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, and his negotatiating team the legitimage representatives
of the Kosovo Albanians, who account for some 90 percent of the two
million people of the troubled Serbian province.
	   However, a 1991 referendum in which a vast majority voted for
independence was never recognized by either Serbia or anyone else.
	   Cook was insistent in the CNN interview'': ``Let's be clear.
what we want to see emerge from the crisis is a stable democratic
Kosovo being run by elected politicians, not by the commander of
any army.''
	   Meanwhile, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, said a delegation of U.N. war crimes
imvestigators and prosecutors plan to visit Kosovo early next
month.
	   The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and
her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports
of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Earlier in Skopje, Cook told reporters the international
community ``will be watching very carefully to make sure'' that
Milosevic sticks to the agreement'' under which he has to pull out
his troops from Kosovo and allow the return of up to 300,000
refugees.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Germany will give Egypt about dlrs 98
million for development projects under an agreement signed by the
two countries Wednesday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed by the minister of state for planning
and international cooperation, Zafer el-Bishry and the German
ambassador, Peter Dingens.
	   El-Bishry said the 160 million German mark (dlrs 98.1 million)
fund includes a grant of 84 million marks (dlrs 51.5 million). The
remaining 76 million marks (dlrs 46.6 million) is a 40-year soft
loan, MENA said.
	   It quoted el-Bishry as saying the money will be used in
infrastructure and environmental projects in addition to developing
some of Cairo's slums.
	   The loan is 20 million marks (dlrs 12.3 million) more than last
year's, el-Bishry said.
	   Dingens said German investment in Egypt is about 1.5 billion
marks (dlrs 920 million), while trade between Germany and Egypt is
about 3.8 billion marks (dlrs 2.33 billion).

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
headed straight for talks with President Emil Constantinescu
Wednesday upon arrival in Romania after a day of talks in
Macedonia.
	   In Skopje, Cook warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
praised Macedonia for its cooperation, and said it was too early to
say whether NATO also would seek to station troops in the region.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia permitted NATO to station spy
planes on its territory as part of efforts to ensure Yugoslavia
complies with an Oct. 12 agreement to defuse violence between
Yugoslav forces and separatist Albanians in its Kosovo province.
	   The Kosovo agreement, signed by Milosevic and U.S. negotiator
Richard Holbrooke, calls for 2,000 unarmed observers in Kosovo as
well as NATO surveillance flights to check whether Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' Cook said in Skopje. ``We will be watching very
carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   While in Macedonia, Cook also met with Kosovo Albanian leaders.
	   In Romania, Cook was to meet Prime Minister Radu Vasile and
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu to discuss their country's role in
the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Torn between its traditional friendship with Serbia and its
desire to join NATO, Romania nonetheless granted NATO use of its
airspace in an emergency situation, should the alliance launch
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite not having qualified for a major
tournament since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russian soccer
federation presidential candidate said Wednesday his country will
be a World Cup contender in 2002.
	   ``We're not losing hope,'' said Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the
president of the southern Russian republic of Kalmykia and head of
the Switzerland-based World Chess Federation. ``Four years is
enough.''
	   Ilyumzhinov, who also has said he will run for the presidency of
Russia in 2000, faces Vyacheslav Koloskov in Thursday's federation
elections.
	   Koloskov is expected to be re-elected by many, but whoever wins,
he faces the unenviable task of resurrecting Russian soccer.
	   Besides not having qualified for the World Cup since 1990 and no
major tournament since the 1992 European Championship _ when it
played under the Soviet banner, the Russian national team has been
hobbled by shortages in government funding and a demoralizing loss
to Iceland last week in qualifying for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   Ilyumzhinov already has a number of ideas for boosting Russia's
chances.
	   ``What's important is that (our players) must be willing to die
on the soccer field for Russia, then we'll receive results,'' he
said. ``We must look from the moral side, then from the financial
one.''
	   He said raising money for Russian soccer shouldn't be difficult
once the ``psychological climate'' is worked out, including
improving morale.
	   Liberal Russian media have assailed Ilyumzhinov for ruling
impoverished Kalmykia like a medieval baron, flaunting his wealth
while ignoring the republic's social woes and crushing dissent.
	   But at a news conference Wednesday, Ilyumzhinov shied away from
politics, and would not say whether his candidacy for the
influential soccer post was tied to the 2000 presidential
elections.
	   ``I am going ... step by step,'' he said. ``Right now I'm going
to put all my strength into soccer, and if it works out, we'll see.
Maybe next I'll do basketball or hockey.''

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's
second-largest city on Wednesday, the latest fighting in the tiny
west African nation.
	   The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they had taken
Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of the Bissau, the
capital. This was confirmed by aid workers in the country and
Portuguese diplomats.
	   A three-month truce ended Sunday in the former Portuguese colony
when rebels clashed with government troops near the presidential
palace in Bissau.
	   ``It looks like they have decided to resolve (the dispute) by
force,'' a Portuguese foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Michael Kleiner, a spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross in Geneva, said the fighting in Bafata was over
quickly. He had no information on any casualties.
	   Earlier Wednesday, government forces launched an artillery
barrage against rebel positions in the western outskirts of the
capital.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira, supported by
forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, used
rocket-launchers and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been
advancing on the center of Bissau.
	   Senegal has been readying the small airfield in the Bissagos
Islands, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, to receive
warplanes, possibly for launching air strikes against rebel
positions, according to reports in Lisbon.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by west African and Portuguese-speaking negotiators. The
mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was reached.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of
thousands of refugees throughout the country of 1 million.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

Jordanians jailed in Israel are in poor health, say families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The families of 14 Jordanian prisoners in
Israel said on Wednesday the inmates are suffering serious health
problems, and urged the government to intercede for their freedom.
	   Israel says the 14 Jordanians jailed in the last 10 years are
convicted of serious offenses, such as fatal attacks on Israelis.
Israel insists they spend their prison terms in its territory while
Jordan is seeking their hand over to Jordanian custody.
	   In a joint statement, the prisoners' families said: ``All the
prisoners suffer from deteriorating psychological and health
conditions as a result of their prolonged and unjustified detention
and the poor living conditions they are living in.''
	   For instance, Kamel Ajlouni, is suffering from advanced cancer
of the liver, it said. Ajlouni, 24, is serving a life term for
killing an Israeli soldier and injuring another in an ambush on the
Israeli frontier in 1990.
	   The statement, made available to The Associated Press, urged the
government to ``continue its efforts to free the prisoners.''
	   The statement was signed by 21 Jordanians who visited the
prisoners in Israel's Ashkelon Prison on Tuesday _ the first such
trip approved by Israel under a 1994 peace treaty with Jordan.
	   In the last four years, Israel has freed more than 20 Jordanian
prisoners, involved in less serious offenses such as infiltrating
to Israel or affiliation with banned militant Muslim factions

After new nationwide protest, govt announces new measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with student leader hinting strife not over &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pressed by nationwide student demonstrations,
France's education minister on Wednesday announced new funding and
more personnel to improve shoddy and overcrowded high schools.
	   But student leaders of the protest had divided reactions.
	   ``It's not yet a victory,'' said Loubna Meliane. ``We'll have to
see,'' she told France-Info radio, hinting that the protests are
not necessarily over.
	   ``The students said clearly that high school reform should take
place as quickly as possible,'' Claude Allegre told the National
Assembly.
	   Allegre said the government would hire 25,000 more adults and
3,000 more youths to improve instruction and security in high
schools across the country.
	   Paris was setting aside 4 billion francs (dlrs 730 million) in
tax-free loans to regional governments to build and improve schools
over the next four years, he said.
	   Allegre said a ``students' charter'' would establish minimum
conditions that all high schools would have to conform to within
two months, and that by the next school year no class will have
over 35 students.
	   The Education Ministry would also seek to ease heavy courseload
by next year, fill missing teaching posts and boost foreign
language instruction.
	   Miss Meliane, the student leader, said that a vacation that
starts next week will give students time to examine the measures.
	   ``The (student) movement is not out of wind. On the contrary,''
she said on French radio, saying students could come back
``stronger yet'' if they are not happy with the measures.
	   Allegre unveiled the plan after meeting again with students
earlier Wednesday, a day after nearly 300,000 youths took to the
streets across the country.,

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
on Wednesday again ruled out negotiations with the Kosovo
Liberation Army to establish peace in the wartorn province.
	   But he also renewed a warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that he is under close scrutiny to comply with the terms
of a deal he signed with NATO. The Western alliance's deadline for
him to pull his forces out of Kosovo or face airstrikes ends
Oct.27.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic said he remains commmitteed to the
Kosovo peace agreement despite what he called ``terrorist''
attempts to sabotage it, a reference to recent KLA hit-and-run
attacks on Serb forces.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network, Cook said, ``It is very
important that we have the cease-fire observed (in Kosovo) on both
sides, and that means (also) the Kosovo Liberation Army, and we
have already taken action through the U.N. to call on all members
to deny funds and arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to
contain the danger of hostilities and injury.''
	   The head of British diplomacy was interviewed while in Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, the second stop on his tour of Balkan
countries.
	   Cook said it was very important for the international community
``that we maintain our negotiations with the political, democratic,
legitimate leadership of the Kosovo people,'' adding that ``we
cannot get into negotiating a separate track with people who have
the guns.''
	   The West considers Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, and his negotatiating team the legitimage representatives
of the Kosovo Albanians, who account for some 90 percent of the two
million people of the troubled Serbian province.
	   However, a 1991 referendum in which a vast majority voted for
independence was never recognized by either Serbia or anyone else.
	   Cook was insistent in the CNN interview'': ``Let's be clear.
what we want to see emerge from the crisis is a stable democratic
Kosovo being run by elected politicians, not by the commander of
any army.''
	   Meanwhile, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, said a delegation of U.N. war crimes
imvestigators and prosecutors plan to visit Kosovo early next
month.
	   The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and
her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports
of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Earlier in Skopje, Cook told reporters the international
community ``will be watching very carefully to make sure'' that
Milosevic sticks to the agreement'' under which he has to pull out
his troops from Kosovo and allow the return of up to 300,000
refugees.
	   U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still not
withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.

Plagued by errors, Kournikova loses in first round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from Kournikova in new 6th graf.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anna Kournikova double faulted 20 times in an
upset loss to Silvia Farina in the Kremlin Cup Wednesday, bowing
out to the angry whistles of her home crowd.
	   The Moscow-born Kournikova dropped the first set 7-6 (7-5) to
Farina, of Italy. Sixth-seeded Kournikova clinched the second set
6-4 and lost the last set 6-1.
	   It was Kournikova's first loss since early 1997 to a player
ranked outside the world's top 15.
	   A week ago in Zurich, the 17-year-old Russian committed 17
double faults to lose in the first round of the European
Championships.
	   Kournikova, who now lives and trains in Florida, dropped out of
the top 10 after tearing ligaments in her right thumb. She is
ranked 12th on the WTA tour.
	   ``I'm tired and nervous, that's why my serve was so bad,'' she
said after the match. ``I haven't been playing for two months and
it was difficult to find new tactics on the court. But I'm glad I'm
finishing the year ranked 12th.''
	   She wasn't the only seeded player to lose Wednesday. Chanda
Rubin of the United States upset eighth-seed Irina Spirlea in
straight sets 6-2, 6-3.
	   In other matches, Sabine Appelmans beat Elena Dementieva 6-4,
6-4. Fifth seeded Mary Pierce beat last year's Kremlin Cup
runner-up Ai Sugiyama 5-7, 6-2, 6-4. Sandrine Testud, seeded
seventh, beat French compatriot Nathalie Dechy 6-2, 6-2.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Massimo D'Alema took office Wednesday with a
coalition ranging from the first Communist ministers in half a
century to former Christian Democrats who escaped corruption
scandals which brought down their party.
	   A confidence vote on the new government, Italy's 56th since the
end of World War II, was scheduled for late Friday following debate
in Parliament.
	   One of the two Cabinet seats assigned to Marxists was the
justice ministry, a particularly sensitive post because of the
ongoing corruption probes which have heavily involved opposition
leader Silvio Berlusconi, the ex-premier and media mogul.
	   Berlusconi, who has been convicted in three cases, has long
contended that prosecutors are leftist sympathizers, and a justice
minister in the hands of the far left and appointed by an
ex-Communist, D'Alema, will likely feed his complaints.
	   ``The naming of Communist (Oliviero) Diliberto to the justice
ministry means strong conditioning of the work of magistrates and,
symbolically, handing over of the prosecutors' offices to the
Communist hardliners,'' said the Civil Rights Movement, a
conservative group.
	   The appointment was also symbolic to Armando Cossutta, a
hardline Communist leader who led a split of his party in order to
back D'Alema. Cossutta noted that when Communists last held Cabinet
posts -- immediately after the war -- the founder of the Communist
Party, Palmiro Togliatti, was also justice minister.
	   Berlusconi's center-right Freedom Alliance, the main opposition,
had been clamoring for early elections to resolve the crisis
sparked Oct. 9 when Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a
confidence vote because of defecting Communists.
	   Some of the ex-Christian Democrats in D'Alema's government had
been voted into Parliament on the Freedom Alliance ticket and were
in the opposition against Prodi but defected recently to the new
coalition.
	   Opposition leaders have charged that the changing of the guard,
without an election, was effectively a kind of coup.
	   ``It's a step back'' for two-bloc democracy, said Berlusconi's
chief ally, rightwing leader Gianfranco Fini.
	   The ex-Christian Democrats, loyal to former President Francesco
Cossiga, received three posts, including the defense ministry.
	   Berlusconi's alliance was considering boycotting the debate on
the confidence vote to protest the defections from his camp to the
government's, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   Prodi, an economist, led the first government including leftists
of the postwar era. But Prodi himself was a moderate.
	   D'Alema, 49, rose through the ranks of what was the West's
largest Communist party before becoming a social democrat after the
fall of the Berlin Wall and creating the Democratic Party of the
Left out of the main mass of Italian Communists.
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said President Clinton
looks forward to working with D'Alema.
	   ``There are obviously a number of issues of mutual concern ...
as well as of multilateral concern,'' Lockhart said, singling out
NATO and Kosovo.
	   The Communists in the new government have voted against NATO
expansion and opposed any NATO intervention in Kosovo. No vote is
looming on any Italian involvement in Kosovo.
	   Among those staying on from Prodi's government is Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, who, as treasury and budget minister, helped guide Italy
into the first group of membership in European monetary union.
	   The six women in the 25-member Cabinet are the most ever in an
Italian government, RAI state TV said.

Russia's economic crisis halts plans for mortgage system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Harvard denying it has halted
program. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Harvard University officials denied Wednesday that
they have pulled out of an attempt to bring to Moscow part of the
American dream _ the creation of a mortgage system _ because of
Russia's economic crisis.
	   Earlier this year, Harvard University developed a plan calling
for loans and credits of about dlrs 500 million in 1998 to create a
mortgage system in Moscow. The plan was to help thousands of home
buyers in the city.
	   But the program's coordinator with the Moscow city government,
Vladimir Shternfeld, was quoted by the Russian daily Vremya as
saying that after Russia's crisis hit in mid-August, the plan was
off.
	   ``The outlines for work with Harvard University experts and the
plans for getting the money have not succeeded,'' Shternfeld told a
city government session Tuesday.
	   ``As soon as trouble started in Russia, they stepped aside,'' he
said.
	   In Boston on Wednesday, Harvard officials denied they had given
up.
	   ``We're not pulling out, we have not pulled out, we have not
made any hints of pulling out and in fact our interest is as strong
as ever despite the financial crisis,'' said Stefan Zhurek,
executive director of the Moscow Mortgage Initiative at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government.
	   Zhurek said Harvard staffers are meeting daily to draft
legislation for a mortgage program for Moscow.
	   He said he believes Shternfeld's comments were misinterpreted,
and he said Shternfeld has since told him that he never meant what
he was quoted as saying.
	   Still, in Russia's uncertain economic climate, it may prove
difficult to find a bank or lending institution to sign on to the
program. Zhurek said no lenders had many any promises so far.
	   Many Muscovites were given ownership of their apartments
following the Soviet breakup. But the development of a
Western-style property market has been slowed by difficulties in
obtaining mortgages and drawing up enforceable contracts.
	   Under the current system, the city pays contractors who build
housing and then sells homes through official realtors without
financing. Only the wealthiest residents can afford new homes and
apartments, which must be paid for in one lump sum.

Poland's screening law gets go-ahead from the constitutional
</HEADLINE>
tribunal &QL; 
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's highest court ruled Wednesday
that a controversial law that could uncover communist-era secret
service collaborators was constitutional, despite objections by
President Aleksander Kwasniewski it encroaches on citizens' rights.
	   The bill, passed by parliament earlier this month, requires
elected officials to state whether they collaborated with the
communist secret service.
	   The bill allows a special prosecutor appointed by the Supreme
Court to investigate the truthfulness of the statements, and those
proven to have lied could be evicted from office, and would be
barred from top state posts.
	   Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, objected that a rule allowing the
prosecutor to investigate statements without informing the person
under investigation was a violation of basic rights.
	   He also pointed out that the head of the Supreme Court _ who
appoints the prosecutor _ would be subject to the screening,
creating a potential conflict of interest.
	   Despite Kwasniewski's objections, the Constitutional Tribunal's
ruling requires him to sign the bill into law.
	   Under the bill, an Institute of National Remembrance will be set
up to collect communist files from 1944-89, as well as documents of
Stalinist and Nazi crimes, which will make the files available to
victims of the totalitarian regimes and reveal who informed on
them.
	   Supported by center and right-wing parties that control
parliament, the bill has come under fire from the ex-communist
parliamentary minority who argue their political opponents want to
use it against them.
	   Since toppling the communists in 1989, Poles have been divided
on whether the files should be opened at all. Some argue they were
falsified by the secret police and that some of the files were
destroyed by communists in order to hide the past.
	   Others say people who collaborated with the secret police should
be exposed and barred from holding public office.

Most-wanted Palestinians: One an auto parts dealer, another a

	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ One sells car parts in this West Bank
town. Another makes pottery at a community center. Some have been
recruited by the Palestinian security services. A few are in
prison.
	   The 36 suspects, most of them accused of killing or wounding
Israelis in terror attacks, comprise Israel's list of Palestinians
it wants extradited.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants them all handed
over before he will conclude any deal on any further troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   The demand has been one of the main sticking points at the
Mideast summit in Maryland. One compromise proposes that all 36 be
imprisoned by the Palestinians, with the CIA making sure they are
not freed prematurely.
	   One man on the list is 27-year-old Wadia Shadia, who told a
reporter Wednesday that he'd shoot anyone trying to arrest him _
Israeli or Palestinian.
	   The former member of the Fatah Hawks, a vigilante group active
during the Palestinian uprising and affiliated with Yasser Arafat's
political faction, is wanted by Israel for shooting and killing his
uncle, a suspected informer for the Israelis.
	   Sitting on an old car seat outside his small shop in the
industrial area of Tulkarem, Shadid said he had no remorse. ``I
washed the family honor with his blood,'' said Shadid, a burly man
with dark wavy hair.
	   He said that when the Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994,
he worked for Palestinian intelligence for five months, only to be
arrested by his employers when Israel sought his extradition.
	   After leaving jail, Shadid received a state stipend for seven
months.
	   Today, Shadid's business is less than two kilometers (less than
a mile) from the nearest Israeli army checkpoint, and he freely
hands out his business card to his customers, many of them Israelis
looking for a bargain.
	   Shadid's partner was arrested by the Israelis outside Tulkarem
on Tuesday on suspicion of dealing in stolen car parts.
	   The interview with Shadid was cut short when two men _
identified as Palestinian intelligence agents _ drove up to the
shop and took him aside. After a half-hour conversation with the
two, Shadid told his visitor he had to leave to visit his mother.
	   The parents of Saleh Othman were evasive when asked about the
whereabouts of their son, who appears on Israel's list for seizing
a Jerusalem bus in 1993 and killing two passengers.
	   Othman, 27, has moved to a high-rise project in the Gaza Strip's
Jebaliya refugee camp, said his mother, Mariam, refusing to give an
address.
	   Othman, an activist in the Islamic militant group Hamas, was
critically wounded when Israeli commandos stormed the bus. He spent
several months in an Israeli hospital before being returned to Gaza
_ apparently because Israel did not expect him to recover.
	   Though still a quadriplegic, Othman has regained the use of his
hands and teaches pottery and embroidery to other handicapped
people at a Gaza City community center, his mother said.
	   Most prominent among the 36 is Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, the
commander of Palestinian police. Israel claims he ordered men on
his force to fire at Jewish settlers. Jabali denies the charges,
saying a tape recording Israel cited as proof was forged.
	   In other cases, it was difficult to track down those wanted by
Israel. Palestinian security officials said they would check who
was in jail and who was at large but provided only partial
information.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the West Bank security chief, said Amjad Hinawi,
who drove the car in a 1996 drive-by killing of American David Boim
in the West Bank was serving a 10-year sentence.
	   Several others are serving time not for crimes Israel has
accused them of, but for offenses committed later on, such as
stealing cars or clan revenge killings.
	   In addition to suspected terrorists, Israel also wants to get
its hands on several common criminals, including a drug dealer, two
tax evaders and a man who stole a generator from an army base.
	   Israel maintains that the Palestinians are flaunting the spirit
of the peace agreements by allowing terrorists to walk freely in
their cities.
	   For many Palestinians, Israel is still the enemy and handing
over people who are widely regarded as heroes is politically
untenable for Arafat's self-rule government.
	   ``We will never extradite any Palestinian,'' said Rajoub.

Injured Katja Seizinger hopes to be back on slopes in mid-December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's Katja Seizinger, the dominant woman
skier last season, will miss several months of the upcoming World
Cup season with torn tendons and a serious knee injury suffered in
June.
	   German coaches Tuesday said Seizinger, a double gold-winner in
Nagano and last year's overall World Cup champion, could be back in
competition as early as mid-December.
	   They expect, at the latest, to have Seizinger fully recovered by
the World Cup that takes place in Vail, Colorado, beginning Feb. 1.
	   The World Cup season starts Saturday in Soelden, Austria.
	   ``I'm making good progress,'' Seizinger told SID, the German
Sports Agency.
	   Seizinger, who has claimed three gold medals and two overall
World Cup titles in her career, suffered the accident June 24 while
training at Schnalstal in Italy.
	   Head coach Wolfgang Maier told SID his German team, which
captured 17 of 33 World Cup races, will have to reduce its
expectations for the coming season.
	   ``There's no way of compensating for the loss of Katja,'' he
said.
	   The downhill and Super-G specialist led a German team that swept
the the first three places in the overall World Cup race circuit
last season. Martina Ertl and Hilde Gerg finished second and third.
	   The trio also won six medals, three of them gold, at the Nagano
Winter Olympics.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior United Nations official
visited the wife of Malaysia's jailed dissident leader Wednesday
and described her as ``a courageous lady.''
	   Abid Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression
and opinion of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, did not say,
however, whether he had come to Malaysia specifically to meet
Azizah Ismail.
	   Azizah, the wife of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim,
said earlier she hoped she would not be arrested on charges of
encouraging protests against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has been among
international leaders who have expressed concern over Anwar's
plight after he appeared in court with bruises and a black eye,
alleging police brutality.
	   Azizah's comments came after rumors of her arrest swept across
Kuala Lumpur. Reporters and photographers rushed to her home.
	   ``I'm very encouraged that he came to visit me,'' Azizah said of
Hussain, who was India's ambassador to the United States in the
early 1990s.

Council meeting on Kosovo to enshrine Holbrooke agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council convened a meeting
Wednesday to work out details on a resolution supporting the
agreement to allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to roam Kosovo to ensure
fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians has ceased.
	   Britain is taking the lead in drafting the resolution, which
would lend the weight of international law to the verification team
from the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to the team, and to
withdraw his special forces from the southern Serb province, after
talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that staved off
threatened NATO action.
	   Milosevic said Wednesday he remained committed to the agreement,
despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo _ has killed
hundreds of people and forced around 300,000 from their homes since
a Serb crackdown began in February. Serbia is the largest of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces
have raised fears about the Oct. 12 agreement, under which
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, the withdrawal of his special
forces, the safe return of refugees and a timetable for restoring
self-rule to the province.
	   The Security Council outlined those demands in a Sept. 23
resolution that threatened unspecified measures if both sides
didn't comply. The resolution was enacted under Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which means it can be enforced militarily.
	   Still unclear is whether the new resolution will provide for
enforcement as well or will rely on the Sept. 23 resolution.
	   A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Britain simply wanted the strongest resolution possible to ``make
Milosevic stick to his word.''
	   Russia and China, two permanent council members with a veto, are
opposed to any use or threats of force.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's
second-largest city Wednesday, apparently marking a return to an
all-out civil war in the tiny west African nation.
	   The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they had taken
Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Bissau, the capital.
The claim was corroborated by aid workers in the country and
Portuguese diplomats.
	   A three-month truce ended Sunday in the former Portuguese colony
when rebels clashed with government troops near the presidential
palace in Bissau.
	   ``It looks like they have decided to resolve (the dispute) by
force,'' a Portuguese foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Bafata's population of 160,000 has doubled since the conflict
began in early June, as thousands of people sought refuge from the
embattled capital, a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Program.
	   ``Civilians are looting WFP stocks, which had some 800 tons of
food supplies,'' Wadgi Othman said by phone from Abidjan in the
Ivory Coast.

Prime Minister: euro currency must not lead to undervalued dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Wednesday
that launching a single European currency must not lead to an
undervalued U.S. dollar.
	   ``If the euro zone is rich and stable, if its economic weight is
comparable to that of the United States ..., the parity of its
currency must be right -- neither overvalued, nor undervalued,''
Jospin said in a speech before French exporters.
	   The remarks followed a call earlier Wednesday by French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who asked the United States and
European governments to take an active interest in managing the
dollar's rate against European currencies.
	   The dollar has fallen about 10 percent against European
currencies since August.
	   A single European currency, to be known as the euro, is to be
put into circulation progressively, starting Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Jospin, a Socialist, also told his audience he would like a cut
in French official interest rates to help coax French companies to
re-invest profits.
	   ``The competitiveness of our companies .... must be further
bolstered. The government intends to see to that,'' Jospin said,
``first by facilitating investments by companies.''
	   ``A decline in interest rates is essential to that end,'' he
said.
	   The Bank of France is holding one of its fort nightly monetary
policy meetings on Thursday. The Bundesbank, Germany's central
bank, is also meeting to discuss interest rates Thursday.
	   The consensus in financial markets is that the Bundesbank and
the Bank of France won't lower their short-term interest rates,
though some are betting on a credit easing.
	   Key short-term interest rates of both France and Germany stand
at 3.30 percent.
	   A growing contingent of officials in France and Germany has
begun calling for lower interest rates.
	   Bank of France Monetary Policy Council member Jean-Pierre Gerard
was quoted Tuesday in the daily Le Monde as saying that French and
German rates should be lowered to counter slowing growth as well as
the impact of the weakening dollar on French and German exports.

Iran frees two more officials of banned liberal newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two more senior employees of a banned
liberal newspaper were freed Wednesday from detention, leaving only
its chief editor in jail, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Ebrahim Nabavi, a columnist of Tous newspaper, and Mohammed
Sadeq Javadi Hesar, a director, were released on bail, IRNA said.
It gave no details.
	   The two were arrested along with Tous chief editor Mahmoud Shams
and managing director Hamid Reza Jalaipur when the newspaper was
banned Sept. 16. The authorities accused the paper of publishing
articles detrimental to Iran's security.
	   Jalaipur was released on bail last week on the orders of Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following an appeal by
Jalaipur's mother.
	   The newspaper had angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Khamenei. Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down
six publications in recent months and detained six journalists for
allegedly publishing lies.
	   The crackdown is stymieing the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   Tous had begun with the name Jameah. It was closed in July but
reappeared shortly afterward under the title Tous.

Scientists find evidence of underground seas on Jupiter's moons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Scientists have detected new
evidence of underground oceans on two of Jupiter's moons,
bolstering hopes of finding life there and other seemingly
inhospitable places in the solar system.
	   Heat and water in liquid form, as opposed to ice, are considered
fundamental requirements for life.
	   ``One could expect life in such oceans,'' said Krishan Khurana,
a geophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles and
lead author of the research.
	   A team from UCLA, the California Institute of Technology and
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory published the findings in
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
	   Ice-encrusted moons like Jupiter's Europa and Callisto, and
other frozen moons even farther from the sun, were long thought to
be too cold for life to form.
	   ``If we find out 4 1/2 billion years after the formation of the
solar system that there's still enough heat that ice will melt on
the interior of these bodies, we have to do a little bit of
rethinking,'' said one of the researchers, UCLA physicist Margaret
G. Kivelson.
	   Earth is 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun;
Jupiter, 483 million (777 million kilometers).
	   The scientists hypothesized the existence of underground seas
from data collected by the Galileo spacecraft. Galileo measured
strong disturbances to Jupiter's magnetic field as the spacecraft
zipped past Europa and Callisto.
	   However, the moons lack strong magnetic fields of their own that
could exert such a force. The scientists concluded that Jupiter's
magnetism must be giving rise to secondary fields within some
powerful electrical conductor on each moon _ a phenomenon known as
electromagnetic induction, which is at work on Earth in generators
and electromagnets.
	   The researchers could imagine only one sufficiently strong
conductor that is plausible on those moons: huge bodies of salt
water. They would be within about 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the
frozen surface, kept from icing over by heat within the interior of
the moons. Assuming they are as salty as Earth's oceans, they would
be about six miles (10 kilometers) deep.
	   ``It's making all of us go back to our models and think about
our understanding of these icy bodies,'' said Ronald Greeley, an
Arizona State University geologist who studies moons.
	   Europa was already viewed as a leading candidate for finding
life, because its jigsaw crust resembles broken icebergs and thus
points to the possibility of oceans at least in the past. However,
Callisto's pockmarked surface contains little visible trace of
liquid movement below.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In a new bid to get diplomatic immunity for Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ambassador said Wednesday the former
Chilean dictator was on a special mission to Britain when he was
arrested in a hospital bed last week.
	   The announcement of the unspecified mission was the latest move
to end the impasse over the arrest of Pinochet at the instigation
of a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain on charges
of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and left Chile's government defending the 82-year-old dictator on
grounds that the arrest, which has enraged Pinochet supporters in
Chile, is straining a democracy painstakingly achieved since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   ``It was a special mission,'' Ambassador Mario Artaza told an
embassy news conference.
	   He refused to elaborate or say whether Chile now seeks to
maintain that Pinochet, who was commander-in-chief of the army
until March, was here on an arms-buying trip.
	   In Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said a
``decree'' had been issued that Pinochet was on a special mission
and this had been extended through Nov. 5 when Pinochet decided to
have medical treatment in London.
	   Pinochet underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated spine, and
since his arrest Oct. 16 has remained in an expensive London
clinic, now under police guard.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the ambassador and a special envoy from the
Chilean Foreign Ministry, Santiago Benadava, took the decrees to
the Foreign Office, but apparently made no impact. The Foreign
Office reiterated Wednesday evening that Pinochet did not have
diplomatic immunity.
	   Until announcing the special mission status, Chile had argued
that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity because he arrived last month
on a diplomatic passport and is a senator in Chile.
	   Britain accords diplomatic immunity only to accredited diplomats
and officials of foreign government who come on official visits.
The special mission decrees were an evident bid to qualify Pinochet
in the second category.
	   ``We are not justifying, shielding or defending the dictator of
the 70s,'' said the ambassador, adding that unless the government
protected Pinochet it would be accused by opposition parties that
support him of failing in its duty.
	   ``For you here in Britain it is very easy to pass judgment. ...
But we ask, `Let's find some solution that would be acceptable to
everyone in this situation,'' he added.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing Chilean opposition
parties who are in London trying to get Pinochet released, renewed
warnings of danger to democracy in their country.
	   ``We think it would be very difficult, very dangerous and would
create much more grief among our nation if Gen. Pinochet was very
ill here or even would die,'' Angelica Cristi, of Chile's National
Renovacion Nacional party, told reporters.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the head of Parliament's human rights
committee backed an attempt by Amnesty International to have
Pinochet prosecuted in Britain if he escapes extradition to Spain.
	   ``We should seize this chance to bring to justice one of the
most evil dictators alive,'' Ann Clwyd, a lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party, said in a letter to Attorney General John Morris.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.

South African veterinarian says elephants are not abused
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ A South African veterinarian
testifying in a custody battle over 30 wild baby elephants on
Wednesday disputed reports that the animals were being abused.
	   The testimony contradicted charges by several international
elephant experts that the animals are suffering abscessed head
wounds, diarrhea, hunger, thirst and depression.
	   Veterinary science Professor David Meltzer told a judge that the
animals lacked signs of abuse and appeared to be adapting to their
captivity at African Game Services, a wild animal export farm near
Pretoria, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The case involves a dilemma over growing elephant populations
protected under international law. The game farm has asked the
court to reverse its ruling last week that the elephants should be
released.
	   Some animal welfare organizations _ like the World Wildlife Fund
South Africa _ back the farm's attempts to train the elephants by
chaining their feet and prodding them with sharp hooks.
	   But others protest the handling, saying elephants can be tamed
with love and gentleness instead of force.
	   ``No animal should be treated this way,'' said Richard Farinato
of the Humane Society of the United States in an interview with
APTN.
	   Farinato and four other international experts were expected to
testify later this week on behalf of the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The NSPCA wants the animals
released.
	   Joyce Poole, an elephant behavior expert from Kenya, said most
of the 30 elephants are younger than four years and were certainly
still suckling milk when they were taken from their mothers on a
game reserve in Botswana.
	   ``I witnessed beatings with ... sharp nails,'' Poole said of her
visit to the farm on Tuesday.
	   ``If the court decides in favor of (the game farm), there is
going to be an ... uproar around the world and it will make South
Africa and Botswana look very bad indeed,'' she said in an APTN
interview.
	   After years of lobbying for permission to trade in live
elephants or ivory from growing herds, southern African countries
got a limited go-ahead last year from the U.N. Convention on Trade
in Endangered Species.
	   The CITES rule allows limited trade in live elephants for
educational purposes.
	   The elephants were destined for zoos in Switzerland and Germany
and a safari park in China.

Rebels seize Guinea-Bissau's second-largest city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to bring refugee situation higher in story,
UPDATES with more detail on situation in Bissagos.
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's
second-largest city Wednesday, apparently marking a return to an
all-out civil war in the tiny west African nation.
	   The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they had taken
Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Bissau, the capital.
The claim was corroborated by aid workers in the country and
Portuguese diplomats.
	   A three-month truce ended Sunday in the former Portuguese colony
when rebels clashed with government troops near the presidential
palace in Bissau.
	   ``It looks like they have decided to resolve (the dispute) by
force,'' a Portuguese foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Bafata's population of 160,000 has doubled since the conflict
began in early June, as thousands of people sought refuge from the
embattled capital, a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Program.
	   ``Civilians are looting WFP stocks, which had some 800 tons of
food supplies,'' Wadgi Othman said by phone from Abidjan in the
Ivory Coast.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of
thousands of displaced people throughout the country of 1 million.
	   At least 10,000 people fled from Bissau to the Bissagos islands
on small fishing boats, since hostilities resumed Sunday, Othman
said.
	   ``They have no food supplies, nor drinking water,'' he said,
adding that in Bubaque, the archipelago's main island, the
population has tripled to 15,000 since June.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   Earlier Wednesday, government forces launched a heavy artillery
barrage against rebel positions in the western outskirts of the
capital.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira, supported by
forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, used
rocket-launchers and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been
advancing on the center of Bissau.
	   Senegal has been readying the small airfield in the Bissagos
Islands, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, to receive
warplanes, possibly for launching air strikes against rebel
positions, according to reports in Lisbon.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking
countries. The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping
force and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was
reached.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

Nicaragua to sell off state communications monopoly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The government announced Wednesday it
is beginning the process of selling the state communications
monopoly ENITEL, which includes the telephone network and satellite
links.
	   Empresa Nicaraguense de Telecomunicaciones S.A., as the monopoly
is formally known, said prospective bidders can register and get
bidding conditions starting Nov. 20.
	   The deadline for submitting bids is Dec. 20, the announcement
said.
	   The government will sell a 40 percent stake to a private
``company or consortium of international prestige in
telecommunications.'' It will keep another 49 percent to be sold
later on the open market.
	   Another 10 percent will be sold to ENITEL's union, and the
government will donate the remaining 1 percent to ENITEL's 3,200
workers.
	   The government decided to sell ENITEL because it lacks the money
to expand and modernize it and improve Nicaragua's inefficient
communications infrastructure. It will start having cellular
telephone service only next year, for instance.
	   Bidders are required to have a minimum of five years of
experience in operating basic communications services, at least
dlrs 1 billion in annual billing with more than 500,000 subscribers
and a minimum of dlrs 1.5 billion in operating capital.
	   The government has hired NM Rothschild and Sons de Mexico S.A.
to audit and evaluate ENITEL's financial structure and help with
the sale.

Human smugglers busy on Hungarian-Ukraine border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Thirty-six Afghans were found Wednesday
by Hungarian border guards after having been abandoned by human
smugglers, a border guard official told state-run radio.
	   ``Of the 36 Afghans, 27 are adults, the rest children,'' Col.
Attila Krisan, the spokesman of the National Border Guards said.
	   The group did not know where they were and stayed in the
abandoned vehicle, as there was a heavy rain.
	   A routine patrol found the vehicle early Wednesday near the
village of Matyus, 240 kilometers (150 miles) east of Budapest, on
the Ukraine border.
	   ``They said they paid Ukrainian human smugglers to bring them
across the border, and then they were left there,'' Krisan said.
	   Krisan said many illegal aliens are trying to cross into Hungary
in that area, adding that ``only hours after this catch 20 Indians
were caught in the same area.''
	   Krisan said all detainees asked for refugee status.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ After being outclassed in the second set, an
off-form Pete Sampras squeezed past fellow American Todd Martin in
Wednesday's first round of the Lyon Grand Prix tennis tournament to
win 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
	   Sampras appeared to be in trouble until breaking Martin's serve
in the final game of the match.
	   But with the score at 15-30, the world No. 1 played a stunning
cross court forehand stroke, before Martin double-faulted to hand
the match to Sampras.
	   ``It was a really tough match and I was a bit lucky to win in
the end,'' said a relieved Sampras.
	   Sampras, a three-time Lyon Grand Prix champion, appeared in
charge after taking the first set.
	   He broke Martin's serve in the third game and then brought out a
series of big serves -- including three aces with the score at 5-4
-- to take the first set.
	   But big-serving, 6-foot, 6-inch Martin, currently ranked 27,
responded by outplaying Sampras in the second set, as
uncharacteristic errors crept into his opponent's game.
	   With the score tied at 1-1 in the final set, Martin had a break
point, but Sampras fired two powerful serves to hold service.
	   Patrick Rafter and Marcelo Rios, currently No. 2 and No. 3 in
the ATP world rankings, also won matches in straight sets.
	   Rios overcame some erratic serving to beat Jeff Tarango of the
United States, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Rios dropped his serve in the first game of the second set.
Then, after fighting back to lead 3-1, he double faulted twice at
15-30 to let the American back into the match.
	   Tarango, whose world ranking is 71, tied the score at 3-3 but
the 22-year-old Chilean went up a gear with some blistering ground
strokes to win in 1 hour, 15 minutes.
	   After a prickly match, during which Tarango complained about
line calls several times, the American said the balls used favored
his opponent.
	   ``Someone should ask the ATP about the balls, which were very
soft and very slow,'' Tarango said. ``I hit winners. Rios plays
retrieval tennis, so that helped his game. He doesn't need all that
help. He is too good for that.''
	   Rios, responding, said Tarango ``has to learn how to lose. He
can't control his feelings and that is not good for the game.''
	   Rios will play Frenchman Nicolas Escude on Thursday in the
second round.
	   In a repeat of one of this year's best U.S. Open matches, Rafter
defeated Moroccan number one Hicham Arazi 6-3, 6-3.
	   Rafter's win was more comfortable than at Flushing Meadow, where
the Australian lost the first two sets.
	   Arazi won the first two games in Lyon but had little to answer
the Australian's powerful serve and volley game.
	   Rafter stormed back to win the second round match 6-3, 6-3.
	   ``There were a few break points against me, but I really went
for it with big serves,'' Rafter said later. ``It could have been a
lot tighter.''
	   Rafter said he expects Arazi to be a top ten player within two
years.
	   ``I was very unsure if I could win. I had a lot of doubt because
I know how talented he is,'' Rafter said.

Turkish parliament ratifies NATO expansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday ratified the
admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO.
	   The three former Communist countries were invited to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in April. All 16 member
countries must ratify the expansion.
	   Parliament also advised the government to encourage the
admission of Bulgaria and Romania in NATO and warned that expansion
should not imply that Turkey receive less funds.
	   Although Turkey's government always spoke in favor of NATO's
expansion, some politicians earlier this year put into question the
ratification after the European Union's decision in December to
exclude Turkey from its enlargement talks.
	   Turks are angered that although they have been trusted allies of
the West for decades, they are being overlooked in the EU.
	   Despite this, deputies said Wednesday the government should
increase its efforts toward Turkey's full membership in the EU.
	   Turkey joined NATO in 1952 and has the alliance's second largest
army after the United States.

Town crier calls Nigerian injured to return to hospital

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ A bell-ringing town crier was sent
Wednesday to call for the injured people of this fire-ravaged town
to return to hospitals while state radio raised the death toll from
the weekend pipeline blaze to 700 people.
	   The Lagos-based newspaper Daily Express also reported at least
700 deaths, citing police who said about 200 people injured in the
explosion Saturday had since died. The explosion occurred while as
many as 1,000 people were trying to scavenge gasoline spilling from
the pipeline.
	   Local officials warned the toll could reach even higher.
	   ``I'm afraid there could be 1,000'' dead, said J.I. Ogude, the
village chief of Jesse.
	   Counting the dead as well as the injured remained a
frustratingly difficult task for local officials. Some residents
were said to be secretly burying dead family members and others
with burn wounds fled hospitals fearing arrest for gasoline theft.
Some of the injured were being treated at home, without benefit of
medicine or painkillers.
	   ``People are running away,'' said Jacob Emogho, a Jesse
resident. ``People are afraid to talk to any strangers.'' Emogho
said some of his neighbors had secretly buried relatives, fearing
prosecution.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
for the gasoline theft or the fire, but no arrests have been made.
	   Because people had left area hospitals, local health workers
sent a town crier into Jesse on Wednesday, telling people they
would not be arrested and promising free medical treatment.
	   ``We cannot force them to stay in hospitals,'' said D. Omamor,
the chief nursing officer for the region, who ordered the bell
ringer to head for Jesse. ``They left on their own volition.''
	   She said she knew of 10 patients who had left hospitals against
doctors' advice, but believed there were many more. Treatment
remained hard to come by. Local hospitals were overwhelmed by the
disaster and were short on medicine and doctors. Local officials
said, though, that extra supplies had begun arriving from the
United Nation's children's organization and Israeli doctors were
also flying in to help.
	   A Red Cross health team arrived in Jesse to help treat the
wounded in hospitals and convince those suffering at home to seek
professional care.
	   ``We were shocked to learn that some injured people fled from
the hospital,'' said Red Cross worker Collins Ezewu.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Southern African military allies of
embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila prepared Wednesday for
a prolonged and costly attack against rebels in the dense eastern
jungles of the vast mineral rich country.
	   ``We will not allow ... (Congo) to fall into the hands of those
who have invaded it. Never, never,'' Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe told reporters.
	   The announcement could lead to a major escalation of the
conflict that began on Aug. 2 when rebels started their drive to
top Kabila.
	   Kabila's allies _ Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ made the
decision Wednesday in Harare. To date, their forces were
concentrated in western Congo.
	   A Congolese rebel leader warned Kabila's allies to back off.
	   ``They must know they cannot stop our struggle. This will be a
long war,'' Arthur Ngoma, a leader of the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition, told the Associated Press from the eastern
rebel stronghold of Goma.
	   Kabila accuses the rebels of being the puppets of Rwanda and
Uganda, his erstwhile allies who installed him in power in May 1997
after an eight-month war against dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The Congo government praised the allied initiative.
	   ``Rwanda and Uganda will now pay for their stubbornness and
refusal to repeated initiatives to return peace to the region,''
said Information Minister Didier Mumengi in the Congolese capital
of Kinshasa.
	   Mugabe acknowledged fighting in the eastern jungles familiar to
the rebels could be difficult.
	   Seasonal rains that close many roads are imminent. Low cloud
cover and tropical rainfall would also curtail the allies'
advantage of air power, said Harare-based defense analyst Michael
Quintana.
	   ``The allies can very easily get bogged down in a Vietnam-type
situation,'' he said.
	   Zimbabwe has strike jets, helicopters, transport planes and
armored cars backing about 3,000 troops in Congo.
	   Mugabe spoke after chairing a three-hour meeting with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and top Kabila
aide Victor Mpoyo.
	   Kabila's allies say they are bound by mutual membership along
with Congo in the 14-nation Southern African Development community
to protect a fellow government in trouble and maintain security in
the region.
	   The central African country of Chad is also backing Kabila.

U.N. official concerned about Chernobyl's effects on Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United Nations' humanitarian aid coordinator
called Wednesday for international aid to Belarussians suffering
from lingering effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
	   Sergio Vieira de Mello voiced concern about the health problems
the accident continues to cause in this former Soviet republic, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. While he urged more international
funding, he acknowledged that the United Nations lacks the money to
do anything now.
	   Belarus is seeking dlrs 5.5 million for medical and
psychological rehabilitation for Chernobyl victims, Emergencies
Minister Ivan Kenik said after meeting with de Mello.
	   De Mello traveled Wednesday to the Gomel region of southern
Belarus, which suffered the worst fallout from the blast at the
Chernobyl nuclear plant in neighboring Ukraine, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl, the world's worst
nuclear accident, sent a cloud of radiation over parts of the
former Soviet Union and Europe.
	   De Mello visited Ukraine on Tuesday. Ukraine is to receive dlrs
2.5 million under a program sponsored by the United Nations and
U.S. cancer institutions to provide health care for the people who
cleaned up after the explosion and their children.
	   Rates of thyroid cancer have climbed sharply among people in
areas affected by the fallout. Many radiation-related diseases
appear years after exposure, so doctors predict many health effects
of the accident may take years to emerge.

Prosecutors sue journalist for anti-Semitic articles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prosecutors began legal proceedings
Wednesday against the editor-in-chief of a virulently anti-Semitic
weekly, accused of publishing ``chauvinistic and nationalist''
articles.
	   Mihai Bogdan Antonescu, 33, is accused of publishing seven
articles containing ``exclusivism and extremist nationalism,'' said
a statement from the Supreme Court of Justice carried by Mediafax
news agency.
	   If convicted, he could get up to five years in prison.
	   The Jewish Federation in Romania recently asked the government
to investigate the people who run the weekly called ``Attacking the
person'' for articles which they claimed incited the ``mass
execution of Jews.''
	   Many of the articles in the xenophobic weekly are not signed.
The weekly regularly labels politicians of all parties ``dirty
Jews,'' and there is a column called `Swastika.'
	   The rest of the tabloid is devoted to scurrilous and libelous
articles probing public people's private lives.
	   Some 14,000 Jews live in Romania. Before World War II there were
about 800,000. Half perished in the war, partly due to the policies
of pro-Hitler Marshal Ion Antonescu. Most of the rest emigrated to
Israel under communism.
	   The publisher of the weekly, Dumitru Dragomir, is head of
Romania's professional soccer league. He also owns the daily
Romanian Sport and several strip bars in Bucharest.

Albanians split over how to gain independence

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The goal among Kosovo's majority
ethnic Albanians is virtually unanimous _ independence from Serbian
rule. But each exploding shell and uprooted family is widening the
split on how best to achieve it: through war or politics.
	   Many favor leader Ibrahim Rugova's push for a political
settlement, a nonviolent approach that has won international
plaudits but no real progress in eight years.
	   Increasingly, though, there is a shift toward the Kosovo
Liberation Army and its armed rebellion against Yugoslav and Serb
forces.
	   Until the division is resolved, diplomatic efforts to resolve
the conflict at a bargaining table are unlikely to succeed.
	   ``To combine the two ways, political and military, that is what
we must do,'' said Rrahman Pacarizi, a university teacher with
relatives throughout Kosovo.
	   At issue is adherence by ethnic Albanians to an agreement
negotiated without their participation _ the deal struck last week
by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   It calls for, among other things, an end to hostilities,
withdrawal of troops Milosevic sent to Kosovo beginning in
February, and the start of talks aimed at giving ethnic Albanians
self-government and their own police.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and many are losing hope that NATO will carry through on
its threat of airstrikes if Milosevic fails to comply.
	   Some now consider the KLA to be their best chance for freedom _
especially with world leaders reiterating opposition to full
independence for Kosovo, fearful of more fighting in the Balkans.
	   Pacarizi said the Serb offensive has divided his family: his
mother and brother are in one village, his father is in another and
a second brother is in their home village of Dragobilje.
	   ``The KLA is the only hope for them. They feel like that,'' he
said.
	   But from his perspective in Pristina, Kosovo's so-far peaceful
capital, he's not sure.
	   ``The only way I can see is if Rugova and the KLA unify, if they
can work together,'' he said Wednesday.
	   That appears unlikely now, according to political analyst and
freelance journalist Belul Beqaj. He said the KLA doubts Rugova's
commitment to full independence, ``and that is the root of their
division.''
	   He traced the split to the massacre of about 30 members of the
Jashari family in March _ including KLA leader Adem Jashari _ which
gave new momentum to the rebel group.
	   The outmanned and outgunned KLA was routed on the battlefield
this summer and saw its cause further damaged when Holbrooke
reached an agreement with Milosevic on Oct. 12 after a week of
negotiations.
	   But there still is no peace in Kosovo: the KLA has resumed
hit-and-run attacks on Serb police, and the KLA accuses the Serbs
of shelling and attacking villagers.
	   Western powers condemned the guerrillas' renewed activity.
	   ``If they don't want to be killed anymore,'' U.S. Defense
Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``they should tell their
leaders to knock this stuff off, to abide by the agreement, and to
... try to work out a political arrangement.''
	   But ethnic Albanians want independence, and emotions are
strongest in the villages and farmlands that have borne the brunt
of the Serb offensive.
	   ``For eight or nine years, we waited to resolve the problem by
peaceful means,'' said Ismet Nuha, 41, who sleeps in the woods near
his village of Kisna Reka. ``When it wasn't, the KLA showed up.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In the Spanish judge's arrest order against
Augusto Pinochet, the accounts are chilling.
	   Men vanish from South American streets in front of their wives
and children. People are dragged from their beds. A pregnant woman
is hauled off to a military school and never heard from again.
	   With these abuses, Judge Baltasar Garzon makes a case for
extraditing the former Chilean dictator from London, where he was
arrested Friday, to face trial in Spain on charges of genocide,
torture and terrorism.
	   In an initial arrest warrant, Garzon cited only one specific
victim. But in an addendum released Tuesday and sent to Britain, he
outlined how 94 people allegedly died or disappeared at the hands
of Chile's military junta leaders and Argentine cohorts from
1976-1983.
	   They were allegedly victims of Operation Condor, a campaign by
South American military juntas, including Pinochet's, to crush
dissent. Victims came from a variety of countries, including
Argentina, the United States, Britain, Garzon's order says.
	   Garzon's arrest order states that under Operation Condor,
Pinochet, as head of state and the military in Chile, ``carried out
criminal activities in coordination with Argentine military
authorities ... issuing orders for the physical elimination of
people, and the torture, kidnapping and disappearance of others.''
	   All but a few of the 94 victims cited in Garzon's document were
Chileans living in Argentina, like Jose Luis Appel de la Cruz. He
was kidnapped by armed civilians on Jan. 10, 1977, as he walked
down a street in the Argentine town of Cipolletti with his wife,
Carmen Delard, and their daughter. Delard later disappeared after
reporting the incident to police, the arrest order says.
	   A week later in Buenos Aires, Delard's sister, Gloria Delard,
was arrested at her home along with her husband Roberto Cristi and
their two children.
	   ``Gloria Delard was pregnant with her third child. Federal
Police agents took them to the Navy School of Mechanics, where they
disappeared,'' the order says. That school was one of the most
notorious torture centers run by Argentina's military juntas.
	   Evidence in Garzon's order was based on a report produced by the
National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed by former
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. The report was published in 1991
and identified nearly 2,300 victims of state-sanctioned killings,
torture, disappearances and other abuses committed under the
Pinochet regime.
	   Among the victims were several Spanish citizens whose cases
triggered the initial Spanish investigation.
	   ``Thousands of people were killed under Pinochet's mandate and
many of them were Spanish so why shouldn't the Spanish courts get
involved?'' Isabel Allende was quoted as saying to the
Barcelona-based daily La Vanguadia. She is the daughter of
President Salvador Allende, who died the night Pinochet's forces
staged the bloody takeover, and has the same name as her well-known
cousin, writer Isabel Allende.
	   Possibly the best-known case was that of Carmelo Soria a
54-year-old Spaniard working for the U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America. His body was found inside his car after it plunged
into a canal in a Santiago suburb in 1976.
	   Soria is believed to have been arrested on July 15, 1976, by
members of DINA, Pinochet's secret police. He was taken to a house
in the Andean foothills near Santiago where he died of torture.
	   Investigators determined that Pincohet's agents tried to make
the killing look like a car accident. In evidence submitted to the
Spanish investigations, Spanish prosecutors said Soria was targeted
because he was believed to have helped several people leave Chile
to escape persecution by the regime.
	   In 1996, a Chilean court ruled that the secret police were
protected by the country's amnesty and could not be tried for
Soria's killing.
	   Pinochet, who relinquished power in 1990 to a civilian regime
after 17 years of authoritarian rule, cannot be prosecuted at home
because he has immunity as a senator for life.
	   Garzon says, though, that Spanish law allows him to prosecute
genocide no matter where it occurred or the nationality of the
victims.
	   Spain's attorney general's office insists he is wrong and has
lodged an objection to his arrest order and to the entire
investigation. The National Court is expected to rule shortly on
the objection and, consequently, the future of the entire case.
	   ``If in Spain the law permits (his) trial, hopefully that will
happen. It's a pity it couldn't happen in Chile, '' Allende's
daughter told la Vanguardia.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors who examined President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday said he has recovered from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a foreign trip and limit other activities,
his press secretary said.
	   Yeltsin's checkup at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow had
been scheduled earlier and had nothing to do with his previous
heart problems or any other emergency, Dmitry Yakushkin said.

	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ One sells car parts in this West Bank
town. Another makes pottery at a community center. Some have been
recruited by the Palestinian security services. A few are in
prison.
	   The 36 suspects, most of them accused of killing or wounding
Israelis in terror attacks, comprise Israel's list of Palestinians
it wants extradited.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants them all handed
over before he will conclude any deal on any further troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   The demand has been one of the main sticking points at the
Mideast summit in Maryland. One compromise proposes that all 36 be
imprisoned by the Palestinians, with the CIA making sure they are
not freed prematurely.
	   One man on the list is 27-year-old Wadia Shadid, who told a
reporter Wednesday that he'd shoot anyone trying to arrest him _
Israeli or Palestinian.

UN receives dlrs 50 million from US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations received dlrs 50
million from the United States on Wednesday, which will help in
Washington's effort to avoid losing its vote in the General
Assembly, U.N. officials said.
	   The wire transfer was received as the U.S. Congress voted to
authorize another dlrs 197 million to the United Nations to pay off
its 1998 bills. Receipt of that payment, the dlrs 50 million plus
another dlrs 100 million that has been appropriated, should save
the U.S. vote in the 185-member assembly.
	   ``Well done United States and lets see more of the same,'' U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst said in announcing the dlrs 50 million
payment for the U.N. regular budget.
	   In addition to the 1998 bills, the United Nations estimates that
Washington owes the world body an estimated dlrs 1.3 billion in
arrears. U.S. lawmakers have made payment on that conditional on
sweeping U.N. reforms that the United Nations says have largely
been implemented.

Gymnast Moceanu sues for independence from parents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE NEEDING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu, a member of the 1996
U.S. Olympic team that won a team gold medal, is suing for
independence from her parents, alleging that they squandered her
fortune and oppressed her for years.
	   Moceanu, 17, filed a state lawsuit in Houston on Monday asking
to be declared a legal adult so her parents can't control her or
her money, the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.
	   A judge signed a temporary restraining order saying Dumitru and
Camelia Moceanu must stay away from the gymnast, who ran away from
their Harris County home on Sunday, until a Nov. 11 hearing.
	   Dumitru Moceanu, who opened a gym last year with some of his
daughter's earnings, declined comment to the newspaper. His wife
couldn't be reached for comment.
	   According to Miss Moceanu's lawsuit, her father has wasted money
she earned since turning professional at age 10.
	   But she told the Chronicle on Tuesday that the problem is about
much more than money.
	   ``I never had a childhood,'' said Miss Moceanu, who added that
her parents fueled her Olympic dream starting at age 3. ``When I
went to compete when I was young, I always was in fear because I
would get yelled at by my father, and I would say to myself, `I'm
13 years old, come on,''' she said. ``Instead of talking to me,
they're always yelling with me, fighting with me.''
	   Although many teen-agers have similar feelings toward their
parents, Miss Moceanu said her life has been far from typical.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Miss Moceanu said. ``We've been trying to keep things
hidden.''
	   The gymnast also told the newspaper her father has hit her ``a
couple of times.''
	   The gymnast and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, both declined to say
how much money she has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore
said a trust that had been set up for her is all but gone.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she said. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Moore said the Moceanu couple, Romanian immigrants, have refused
to answer their daughter's questions about where the money has
gone.
	   The attorney said all Moceanu must prove to gain her legal adult
status is that she is living away from home and can support
herself. Once that status is granted, she will be able to demand an
accounting of her money through legal channels, Moore said.
	   Moceanu said she has been hiding from her parents for the past
few days, moving from house to house to stay with friends.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games.
	   She's the only member of that team still competing in all
gymnastics events and is aiming to compete in the world
championships next year and possibly the Sydney Games in 2000.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition at the Goodwill Games.
	   Despite the legal action, she hopes to mend her relationship
with her parents.
	   ``I love my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is
over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-night Cook comments &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
headed straight for talks with President Emil Constantinescu
Wednesday upon arrival in Romania after a day of talks in
Macedonia.
	   In Skopje, Cook warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
praised Macedonia for its cooperation, and said it was too early to
say whether NATO also would seek to station troops in the region.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia permitted NATO to station spy
planes on its territory as part of efforts to ensure Yugoslavia
complies with an Oct. 12 agreement to defuse violence between
Yugoslav forces and separatist Albanians in its Kosovo province.
	   The Kosovo agreement, signed by Milosevic and U.S. negotiator
Richard Holbrooke, calls for 2,000 unarmed observers in Kosovo as
well as NATO surveillance flights to check whether Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' Cook said in Skopje. ``We will be watching very
carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   While in Macedonia, Cook also met with Kosovo Albanian leaders.
	   In Romania, Cook , conferred for one hours with President Emil
Constantinescu.
	   After his talks, he told reporter, ``We are both clear that the
way forward is for the countries of the region to develop ethnic
tolerance and integration in states which are based on the modern
European principle that all citizens are equal wahetever their
ethnic identity.
	   ``We both recognize that President Milosevic, by pursuing the
opposite policy of ethnic confrontation and the repression of
freedom and democracy, is taking his people in the opposite
direction, isolated from the modern Europe.''
	   Cook was also to meet Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile and
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu to discuss their country's role in
the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Torn between its traditional friendship with Serbia and its
desire to join NATO, Romania nonetheless granted NATO use of its
airspace in an emergency situation, should the alliance launch
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's
second-largest city Wednesday, apparently marking a return to an
all-out civil war in the tiny west African nation.
	   The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they had taken
Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Bissau, the capital.
The claim was corroborated by aid workers in the country and
Portuguese diplomats.
	   A three-month truce ended Sunday in the former Portuguese colony
when rebels clashed with government troops near the presidential
palace in Bissau.
	   ``It looks like they have decided to resolve (the dispute) by
force,'' a Portuguese foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Bafata's population of 160,000 has doubled since the conflict
began in early June, as thousands of people sought refuge from the
embattled capital, a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Program.
	   ``Civilians are looting WFP stocks, which had some 800 tons of
food supplies,'' Wadgi Othman said by phone from Abidjan in the
Ivory Coast.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of
thousands of displaced people throughout the country of 1 million.
	   At least 10,000 people fled from Bissau to the Bissagos islands
on small fishing boats, since hostilities resumed Sunday, Othman
said.
	   ``They have no food supplies, nor drinking water,'' he said,
adding that in Bubaque, the archipelago's main island, the
population has tripled to 15,000 since June.
	   The Portuguese relief group International Medical Assistance
said there were some 40,000 refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of Bissau, and more were expected.
	   Earlier Wednesday, government forces launched a heavy artillery
barrage against rebel positions in the western outskirts of the
capital.
	   Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira, supported by
forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, used
rocket-launchers and artillery guns to pound rebels who had been
advancing on the center of Bissau.
	   Senegal has been readying the small airfield in the Bissagos
Islands, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, to receive
warplanes, possibly for launching air strikes against rebel
positions, according to reports in Lisbon.
	   The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane
_ have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western
outskirts of Bissau, for almost five months.
	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking
countries. The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping
force and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was
reached.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

	   The foes had entered into a cease-fire on July 26 which was
brokered by negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking
countries. The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping
force and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was
reached.
	   The military rebellion started June 7, following Mane's
dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns
to Senegal's Casamance separatists.

German industry, chancellor-elect consider slave-labor fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over, Schroeder's chief of staff to head
group, other details; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
announced on Wednesday that his chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, will
head up a group that will work out a plan to settle back-wage
claims from World War II-era slave laborers.
	   ``We want work out a pragmatic solution to this problem,'' said
Schroeder, speaking after attending the group's first meeting in
the northern city of Hanover. The group is made up of German bank
and industry leaders.
	   Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, said participants
agreed during the two-hour meeting they must speedily resolve the
issue.
	   Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF.
	   Earlier, spokesman Michael Juerdens called the meeting ``a
historic event.''
	   In a reference to recent lawsuits against Swiss banks by
Holocaust survivors, Juerdens said the meeting had been called
because ``German firms also face the prospect of being sued by
former slave laborers in the United States.''
	   A Greens lawmaker close to the issue, Volker Beck, said the fund
would seek to ``satisfy the right to compensation for unpaid wages
of all forced laborers, and in return offer legal security to the
industry'' against future lawsuits.
	   Schroeder announced plans for a joint government-industry fund
Tuesday in a break with long-standing Germany policy.
	   That plan was endorsed in Wednesday's meeting. Further details
of the government-industry collaboration were not immediately
available.
	   A Cologne-based group representing Nazi victims called for
former slave-laborers also to sit in on the talks, so that ``the
victims aren't dependent on the good or bad will of the industries
taking part.''
	   The German government has paid billions in compensation to
Holocaust victims for health damage and imprisonment. But it had
rejected claims for back wages from slave laborers, saying the
companies involved were responsible.
	   Most German firms, though, argued the workers were forced on
them by the Nazis and so the current government, as legal successor
to the Nazi regime, should be responsible.
	   Yet lawsuits pending in the United States and threats of more at
home prompted suggestions this year from some for an industry-wide
fund to settle the claims.

Former Chilean dictator's arrest rattles nation in democratic

transition &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Frei's return to Chile. New to some
points. &QL; 
 &UR; With Pinochet-The Evidence, Spain-Pinochet, Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ President Eduardo Frei urged his nation
Wednesday to shun political confrontation following the arrest in
London of Chile's former dictator, an event that has rattled its
decade-old transition to democracy.
	   Returning from a European visit, Frei exhorted compatriots to
remain calm while Augusto Pinochet remained sequestered at the
London clinic where police arrested him Friday at a Spanish
magistrate's behest.
	   The Spanish judge is seeking Pinochet's extradition on charges
of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year military rule of
Chile, whose historic political divisions have been deepened by the
arrest.
	   ``I want to make an appeal to the country to maintain calm and
serenity and to not polarize the situation,'' Frei said, appealing
to Pinochet's angry rightist supporters and a jubilant left.
	   Every day since news of the arrest reached Chile, foes and
supporters of the 82-year-old former dictator have taken to the
streets in sometimes-violent protests or celebrations, with the
British and Spanish embassies frequent targets of protests. Riot
police on Sunday turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters
trying to break through police lines into the British embassy on
Sunday.
	   The government said Wednesday it would not allow new
demonstrations, but some small and scattered peaceful protests were
reported.
	   The Roman Catholic Church said the Pinochet episode may harm
``the difficult efforts toward reconciliation among Chileans.''
Similar concerns were expressed abroad.
	   Carol Graham, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution in
Washington, noted that Chile's transition to democracy after
Pinochet's long reign had required a long political search for a
``difficult consensus.''
	   ``I see this as a very dangerous tinkering with that
consensus.''
	   Pinochet was arrested as he recovered from back surgery, and
reports from his family and Chilean rightist politicians claimed
his condition deteriorated to a worrisome point on Wednesday.
	   The Spanish judge wants to question him on killings and other
human rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   Britain rejected the Chilean government claim that Pinochet, in
his capacity a senator-for-life, has diplomatic immunity. Chile
filed a formal protest with Britain claiming that immunity had been
violated.
	   Chile said a government decree before the visit established that
Pinochet was traveling on an unspecified ``official mission'' and
that, when he elected surgery, the mission was extended through
Nov. 5.
	   Initial fears that a military backlash over the Pinochet arrest
could endanger Chile's young democracy appeared to dissipate.
	   Sen. Gabriel Valdes noted that statements by the military in
support of Pinochet have been ``remarkably moderate.'' The
statements all backed civilian handling of the matter. ``There is
no danger whatsoever for democratic rule,'' Valdes said.
	   On Wednesday, Pinochet's successor as army commander, Gen.
Ricardo Izurieta, thanked Frei for seeking Pinochet's release.

Gymnast Moceanu sues for independence from parents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE NEEDING

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu, a member of the 1996
U.S. Olympic team that won a team gold medal, is suing for
independence from her parents, alleging that they squandered her
fortune and oppressed her for years.
	   Moceanu, 17, filed a state lawsuit in Houston on Monday asking
to be declared a legal adult so her parents can't control her or
her money, the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.
	   A judge signed a temporary restraining order saying Dumitru and
Camelia Moceanu must stay away from the gymnast, who ran away from
their Harris County home on Sunday, until a Nov. 11 hearing.
	   Dumitru Moceanu, who opened a gym last year with some of his
daughter's earnings, declined comment to the newspaper. His wife
couldn't be reached for comment.
	   According to Miss Moceanu's lawsuit, her father has wasted money
she earned since turning professional at age 10.
	   But she told the Chronicle on Tuesday that the problem is about
much more than money.
	   ``I never had a childhood,'' said Miss Moceanu, who added that
her parents fueled her Olympic dream starting at age 3. ``When I
went to compete when I was young, I always was in fear because I
would get yelled at by my father, and I would say to myself, `I'm
13 years old, come on,''' she said. ``Instead of talking to me,
they're always yelling with me, fighting with me.''
	   Although many teen-agers have similar feelings toward their
parents, Miss Moceanu said her life has been far from typical.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Miss Moceanu said. ``We've been trying to keep things
hidden.''
	   The gymnast also told the newspaper her father has hit her ``a
couple of times.''
	   The gymnast and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, both declined to say
how much money she has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore
said a trust that had been set up for her is all but gone.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she said. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Moore said the Moceanu couple, Romanian immigrants, have refused
to answer their daughter's questions about where the money has
gone.
	   The attorney said all Moceanu must prove to gain her legal adult
status is that she is living away from home and can support
herself. Once that status is granted, she will be able to demand an
accounting of her money through legal channels, Moore said.
	   Moceanu said she has been hiding from her parents for the past
few days, moving from house to house to stay with friends.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games.
	   She's the only member of that team still competing in all
gymnastics events and is aiming to compete in the world
championships next year and possibly the Sydney Games in 2000.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition at the Goodwill Games.
	   Despite the legal action, she hopes to mend her relationship
with her parents.
	   ``I love my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is
over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with weather bureau saying typhoon slightly
weakening but may hit Manila and provinces ravaged by volcanic
mudflows from Mount Pinatubo volcano, CORRECTS location of storm to
southeast of Manila, sted southwest. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A powerful typhoon packing winds up
to 210 kilometers (130 miles) per hour began battering the central
Philippines coast on Wednesday, forcing thousands of villagers from
their homes.
	   Weather forecasters said typhoon Babs could directly hit or pass
near Manila Thursday night if it maintains its current course.
	   Several northern provinces perennially ravaged by volcanic
mudflows from Mount Pinatubo volcano, which erupted in 1991, are
also threatened, they said.
	   Typhoon Babs was centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of
Catanduanes island, 360 kilometers (225 miles) southeast of Manila,
and was expected to blow overland late Wednesday, weather
forecaster Francis Araniador said.
	   The typhoon comes only a week after parts of the northern
Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least
74 people in the country.
	   Babs caused heavy rains and surging waves on Wednesday, halting
ferry service at several ports in Albay and Sorsogon provinces and
stranding more than 2,000 passengers, said disaster official Jason
Aragon.
	   Severe typhoon warnings were in effect for parts of the central
Philippines, and officials cut electricity to Catanduanes and
portions of Albay province to prevent electrocutions, Aragon said.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of rivers overflowing and
landslides, he said. Authorities lost contact with many remote
areas because of downed telephone lines and were calling on amateur
radio operators for help.
	   Congressman Francis Joseph Escudero of Sorsogon said thousands
of people were evacuated from several coastal villages and taken to
temporary shelters.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   In Manila, military rescue units, including air force
helicopters and navy vessels, were on standby.
	   Sustained winds of Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this
season, slightly weakened to 175 kph (108 mph) with gusts of up to
210 kph (130 mph), Araniador said.
	   After hitting the Philippines, Zeb move on to Taiwan, killing 31
people and injuring 19, before cutting across Japan, where it
killed at least 12 people.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Officials from the United Nations and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia have held three days of talks to work
out security arrangements for the possible return of U.N.
international staff to the country, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
	   The two sides were meeting again Thursday in Islamabad, where
the talks have been taking place ``in a cordial atmosphere, with
both sides expressing a desire that matters be swiftly resolved,''
U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
	   The United Nations withdrew all its international personnel from
Afghanistan following the Aug. 21 fatal shooting of a U.N. military
adviser in Kabul. The United Nations is demanding a full report
from the Taliban on the slaying of Lt. Col. Carmine Calo of Italy.
	   The meetings on security issues were apparently planned before a
visit to the region by the U.N. envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to try to
reduce tensions between Afghanistan and Iran following slaying of
Iranian diplomats in a northern Afghan city.
	   Brahimi traveled to Taliban headquarters in Kandahar, but the
United Nations made clear the visit was an exceptional case.

South African troops to hand over control of Lesotho bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Lesotho's defense force is to
regain control of its military bases by the end of the month as
part of a gradual withdrawal of foreign forces from the tiny
African kingdom, a South African military official said Wednesday.
	   But South African troops will remain in Lesotho until
``everything has returned to normal,'' military spokeswoman Lt.
Col. Laverne Machine said.
	   Troops from South Africa and Botswana last month entered
Lesotho, an impoverished nation surrounded by South Africa, to
quell rebellious troops and protests by opposition parties that
nearly shut down the country. Dozens of people died in subsequent
clashes.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks aimed at bringing a durable peace to the
Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than six
months, with few hopes of a breakthrough.
	   South Korean delegation leader Park Kun-woo, the chairman of the
meeting, described the first four-party session as ``business-like
and constructive.''
	   ``I think we're making progress,'' said U.S. delegation chief
Charles Kartman.
	   However, behind the upbeat public comments and smiles for the
cameras, serious problems remained.
	   North Korea last week reiterated its demands that the main items
on the agenda should be a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea
and a peace treaty with Washington that would exclude South Korea.
	   Officials indicated that the North Korean Vice Foreign Minister
Kim Gye Gwan brought up the issue again Wednesday.
	   Two previous rounds of the talks, in November and March, broke
down over the same North Korean demands.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However,
Seoul doesn't want it to be a formal agenda item.
	   And the United States and South Korea have ruled out discussions
on signing a peace treaty between the United States and North
Korea, saying any Korean peace treaty should be signed between the
two Koreas.
	   After the talks broke down in March, officials in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang said the United States was to blame.
They only agreed to resume the negotiations as part of a package
deal with Washington last month.
	   Under that deal, North Korea also agreed to resume talks with
the United States on restricting its development and sales of
missiles. In return, it won a U.S. promise to provide it with
300,000 tons of free food.
	   South Korean diplomats said their delegation would propose the
four-party talks take place every three months. China, an ally of
Communist North Korea, is the fourth country taking part.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting, made an opening proposal for a
``humanitarian corridor'' across the line of North-South
demarcation to ease distribution of humanitarian aid.
	   Jacob Kellenberger, a Swiss foreign ministry official, said such
a scheme would offer logistical support to relief goods passing
from South to North through the border village of Panmunjom.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement have led to chronic food
shortages in North Korea, aggravated by three years of flooding and
drought. It has since been relying on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.
	   Kellenberger also proposed there should be a ``continent-wide
security dialogue'' in Asia _ similar to the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe.
	   North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly
2 million troops deployed on both sides.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ About 10 unarmed demonstrators were arrested
Wednesday after they briefly occupied Mexico's embassy in Oslo,
demanding the release of political prisoners in the Chiapas region,
police said.
	   Police spokesman Vidar Hjulstad said the small group of
Norwegians were members of the local left-wing Blitz youth group,
which routinely demonstrates for a variety of causes. The
demonstrators referred to themselves as Zapatas on Wednesday.
	   In January, 1994, rebels calling themselves Zapatistas staged a
brief armed uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas, demanding
greater democracy and Indian rights. There is still tension in the
area between the rebels and Mexico's government.
	   The demonstrators issued a statement demanding the immediate
release of prisoners and the withdrawal of government troops from
the troubled southern Mexico state.
	   Police arrested all of the demonstrators after about three
hours, without incident. The protesters were being held for
investigation, and could be fined.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo scored what turned out to be the
winning goal in his return from injury Wednesday, lifting
Internazionale of Milan past Spartak Moscow 2-1 in a Champions
League Group C game.
	   The Brazilian star, out a month with tendinitis in both knees,
gathered the ball after it was fumbled by 'keeper Alexander
Filimonov and slotted home to give Inter a 2-0 lead in the 59th
minute.
	   Spartak, the only club to win both of its first two group games,
pulled a goal back in the 65th, when midfielder Ilya Tsymbalar
headed in Andrei Tikhonov's left flank cross.
	   Ronaldo also had a role in the opening goal, in the 32nd, faking
a shot on a free kick and rolling a nifty pass over to Nicola
Ventola, whose 25-meter (yard) blast skimmed off the right post and
into the net.
	   The two-time FIFA player of the year had not played since Sept.
20 and had suggested he might only see 45 minutes of action
Wednesday. He played 72, leaving in favor of countryman Ze Elias, a
defensive-minded midfielder.
	   The Russians forced Inter 'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to make two
leaping saves on long-range shots in the first 12 minutes, first
from Tikhonov and then Vasily Baranov.
	   Filimonov was also kept busy, making back-to-back saves with his
legs on Andre Pirlo and French winger Benoit Cauet in the 40th
minute. The 'keeper also stopped Ronaldo on a one-on-one chance
five minutes later.
	   Pirlo had come off the bench to replace Youri Djorkaeff in the
35th, when the member of France's World Cup champions limped off
the field with a right thigh strain.
	   Inter rebounded from a 5-3 loss to Lazio of Rome in an Italian
League game Sunday.
	   Both Inter, which rebounded from a 5-3 loss to Lazio of Rome in
Italian League action Sunday, and Spartak have two wins and a loss
after three rotations.

Queen unveils restored memorial to Prince Albert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a flourish of trumpets, a shower of fireworks
and glowing words from Queen Elizabeth II, the newly restored
Albert Memorial was unveiled Wednesday night before an audience of
thousands.
	   The 200-foot-high (61-meter-high) marble and gilt tribute to
Queen Victoria's beloved husband Prince Albert _ for many years a
landmark at the edge of Kensington Gardens _ has been wrapped in a
cocoon of scaffolding since 1990, when it was crumbling
dangerously.
	   Some 11 million pounds (dlrs 17 million) later, the Victorian
Gothic edifice, with a re-gilded 14-foot-high (4.3 meter) statue of
the prince at its center, emerged in all its gleaming splendor
Wednesday night.
	   ``This restoration is a triumph,'' the queen declared, standing
on the steps of the memorial to her great-great-grandfather,
designed by architect George Gilbert Scott.
	   ``This is no mausoleum but a celebration of a great and good
life,'' she told thousands of onlookers gathered around the
memorial, reminding them of Albert's work for education and
culture.
	   Albert, a German prince who devoted much of his life and energy
to his adopted country, was adored by his wife but never won the
hearts of her subjects.
	   But after he died of typhoid in 1861 at the age of 42, plunging
Victoria into a lifetime of mourning, the British people joined in
the campaign to raise money for this memorial opposite the Royal
Albert Hall concert center.
	   The queen was accompanied by Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of
English Heritage, the agency that footed the bill for most of the
repairs.
	   The queen congratulated the craftsmen and women who carried out
the restoration and expressed her gratitude that the memorial was
``so lovingly and generously saved.''
	   Because of this, she said, ``all who now pass by'' will see
Prince Albert again ``as those who knew him and loved him best
wished him to be remembered.''
	   More than 100 gilders, blacksmiths and stonemasons restored the
memorial. During World War I, the statue was stripped of its gold
leaf to prevent it glistening at night and attracting German
attack. Gilders have recovered it with 16,875 sheets of gold leaf.
	   Nearly 6,000 pieces of the canopy and spire _ colored glass
baubles, 200 tons of lead roofing, four mosaics, eight-foot-high
gilded angels _ have been cleaned and repaired.

	   PORTO, Portugal (AP) _ FC Porto clinched its first victory in
the European Champions League with a 3-0 win Wednesday over visitor
Croatia Zagreb on goals by Brazilian Doriva and Slovenian Zlatko
Zahovic.
	   The result lifted the Portuguese champion onto four points after
three rotations in Group A. Winless Croatia Zagreb is floundering
with one point and fading hopes of reaching the competition's
quarterfinals.
	   The game was mostly a lacklustre affair, punctuated by the two
first-half goals which stirred the 35,000 crowd at the Antas
stadium.
	   Doriva got the home team's first after 33 minutes with a
sizzling long-range shot which squeezed into the top corner of the
Croatian goal.
	   Zahovic extended the lead 10 minutes later, sneaking unmarked
into the Croatian area to head past Drazan Ladic from point-blank
range.
	   The Slovenian midfielder notched his second goal of the game,
and his fourth in the competition, in a solo run after 70 minutes.
	   Silvio Maric occasionally marauded dangerously inside the
Portuguese half of the pitch, his best chance coming after 10
minutes when he slalomed past defenders and into shooting range but
saw his shot deflected away.

Champions: Kiev forces 1-1 tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Sergei Rebrof fired a last minute
equalizer as Dynamo Kiev scrambled a 1-1 tie with Arsenal in the
Champions Cup Tuesday.
	   Dennis Bergkamp headed the Gunners in front in the 76th minute
but Rebrof collected a pass from a half-cleared corner and fired
the ball past David Seaman for the equalizer.
	   The referee at first appeared to rule that Rebrof was offside
but then gave the goal.
	   There was little doubt about Bergkamp's strike.
	   Ray Parlour sent fullback Lee Dixon down the right and Bergkamp,
who doesn't play in Arsenal's away games in the Champions Cup
because he hates flying, took off and threw himself at the
well-placed cross to power the header home with 16 minutes to go.
It was his first goal in the competition and his only real
contribution to a game Kiev dominated.
	   The result gives Arsenal five points from a win and two ties and
Kiev stays last with two with far less chance of gaining the
quarterfinal.
	   With French World Cup stars Patrick Vieira (suspended) and
Emmanuel Petit (injured) missing, the Arsenal midfield was often
overrun by the slick Kiev players who needed to win to stay in
realistic contention.
	   Andrei Shevchenko went on an amazing 30-meter run from wide on
the right in the fourth minute, weaving past three Arsenal men
before shooting straight at goalkeeper David Seaman
	   The England goalkeeper was tested by a 35-meter shot from
Vladyslav Vashchuk which Seaman turned round the post.
	   Kiev 'keeper Oleksandr Shovkovsky had to race off his line in
the 29th minute to save at the feet of Nicolas Anelka who got clear
of the defense. A minute later Anelka fired over the top after
breaking through two Kiev tackles on the edge of the area.
	   Just before halftime Shevchenko fired just over the bar and Kaka
Kaladze shot straight at Seaman from a good position.
	   Kiev kept firing shots at the Arsenal goal but couldn't produce
power or accuracy to worry Seaman while Arsenal struggled to break
through a well organized defense at the other end.
	   Shevchenko got the ball into the net from what was ruled an
offside position before Bergkamp's goal put Arsenal ahead.
	   Marc Overmars almost added second four minutes from the end when
he got clear and rounded the goalkeeper but Oleh Luzhnyi cleared
off the line.

South African board censors Hustler magazine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The October issue of Hustler
magazine has been banished to sex shops after a women's group
complained about the lampooning of a public official.
	   The magazine _ a South African affiliate in U.S. publisher Larry
Flynt's empire _ superimposed the picture of Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma on a urinal and urged readers to urinate on her
image.
	   The Film and Publications Board ruled Tuesday that the magazine
could be sold only in licensed sex shops, and not at general news
stands. The panel sidestepped the Zuma lampoon and based its ruling
on objections to sexually explicit pictures that appeared elsewhere
in the magazine, Johannesburg's daily, The Star, reported.
	   The board's chief executive officer, Nana Makaula, said the
panel was shocked by the pictures.
	   Press freedom advocates criticized the decision, suggesting it
was politics not sexually explicit pictures that were behind the
ruling.
	   ``Hustler has been going on in this shape and format for some
years, so why is the board restricting its availability only now?''
The Star quoted Raymond Louw of the Freedom of Expression Institute
as saying.
	   The former apartheid government banned pornography. But after
1994's first all-race elections, the government lifted such media
restrictions.
	   Hustler has lampooned other public officials in past issues.
Zuma came under fire in the magazine's most recent issue for her
campaign to restrict public smoking and advertising for tobacco
products.

Report: Germany's Greens predict reduction in size of army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Structural reforms to Germany's army
will sharply reduce its size, the defense spokeswoman for the
Greens party, junior coalition partners in Germany's incoming
government, was quoted as saying in a newspaper report Wednesday.
	   Angelika Beer said recently-completed coalition talks between
Germany's victorious Social Democrats and her small, left-wing
party, had agreed on a commission to look into structural reforms
of the army, according to the Kieler Nachrichten, a north German
newspaper.
	   Beer said a cut in army personnel from 340,000 to about 200,000
was realistic.
	   The cut, aimed mostly at land-based troops, would be accompanied
by a beefing up of rapid reaction forces. They would be fitted out
with more up-to-date equipment, the newspaper quoted Beer as
saying.

Council meeting on Kosovo to enshrine Holbrooke agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council meeting under way, quotes from Yugoslav
ambassador &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council met Wednesday to work
out details of a resolution supporting the agreement to allow 2,000
unarmed monitors to roam Kosovo to ensure fighting between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians has ceased.
	   Britain is taking the lead in drafting the resolution, which
would lend the weight of international law to the verification team
from the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to the team, and to
withdraw his special forces from the southern Serb province, after
talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that staved off
threatened NATO action.
	   Milosevic said Wednesday he remained committed to the agreement,
despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage it, a
view echoed by Yugoslavia's acting ambassador at the United
Nations.
	   ``We are implementing the agreement in good faith,'' Ambassador
Vladislav Jovanovic told a news conference, saying the government
was pulling back police units and reducing the number of army
units.
	   Serb security forces have not carried out ``anti-terrorist
activities'' for several weeks except in response to direct
attacks, he said.
	   He also accused Kosovo Albanian political and rebel leaders of
failing to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions calling
for an end to the fighting, a negotiated settlement, and an
acceptance of Serbia's territorial integrity.
	   The main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, has not
denounced separatism, condemned terrorism and accepted an
unconditional resumption of dialogue, Jovanovic said.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
an overwhelming majority of the population of Kosovo _ has killed
hundreds of people and forced around 300,000 from their homes since
a Serb crackdown began in February. Serbia is the largest of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces
have raised fears about the Oct. 12 agreement, under which
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, the withdrawal of his special
forces, the safe return of refugees and a timetable for restoring
self-rule to the province.
	   The Security Council outlined those demands in a Sept. 23
resolution that threatened unspecified measures if both sides
didn't comply. The resolution was enacted under Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which means it can be enforced militarily.
	   Still unclear is whether the new resolution will provide for
enforcement as well or will rely on the Sept. 23 resolution.
	   Jovanovic said his government was not opposed to the Security
Council endorsing the agreement, but said Yugoslavia would oppose
any attempt to add other issues not in the Milosevic-Holbrooke
agreement to the resolution.
	   A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Britain simply wanted the strongest resolution possible to ``make
Milosevic stick to his word.''
	   Russia and China, two permanent council members with a veto, are
opposed to any use or threats of force.

	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Sigurd Rushfeldt scored all goals as
Rosenborg beat Galatasaray 3-0 in the third round of the European
Champions League Wednesday
	   Rushfeldt scored the first goal of the game in the 68th minute
after outmaneuvering a couple of Galatasaray defenders in the box.
A minute later Rushfeldt was alone with goalie Claudio Taffarel,
but the shot went inches outside the goal.
	   ``Totto'' Dahlum won a fight in the box in the 85th, sent the
ball to Borge Hernes who made a shot. Rushfeldt took advantage of
the rebound to make it 2-0.
	   Rushfeldt finally scored the third goal easily in the 90th when
he was alone with the goalie.
	   Bjorn Otto Bragstad was booked in the 50th and will miss the
next game.
	   Inceefe Vedat got an early shower in the 80th when he got his
second yellow card of the game.

Real Madrid trouunce Sturm Graz 6-1

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two goals each for Brazilian Savio and
Croat Robert Jarni helped defending champion Real Madrid trounce
Sturm Graz 6-1 in European Champions League play Wednesday.
	   Sturm Graz took a surprise lead in the eighth minute when Ivica
Vastic slotted one in from 16 yards (meters). But Madrid was
determined not to let the game slip away and five minutes later
Savio chested down the ball following a superb lobbing pass into
the area by Yugoslav Pedrag Mijatovic. From some 10 yards (meters)
out to the right, Savio swerved and thundered the ball into the
back of the net for the equalizer.
	   Real took a grip of the game nine minutes on when Brazilian
defender Roberto Carlos flicked a sharp-angled pass to 21-year-old
ace striker Raul who from six yards (meters) drove the ball under
the diving body of goalkeeper Kazimierz Sidorczuk.
	   Madrid's play lacked cohesion throughout the game, with its
midfield and defense committing several blunders. Sturm Graz,
however, rarely appeared to have the creative or attacking ability
to seriously exploit the host's weaknesses.
	   But despite the scrappy play, Real had no problem putting in the
goals. In the 61st minute, Jarni steadied up on the left-side of
the box and let fly a thundering shot into the far top right-hand
corner of the Austrian side's goal.
	   Six minutes later, Mijatovic sent a cross in from the left
cornerkick area and Sturm Graz defender Ranko Popovic fumbled a
clearance to score an own-goal and make it 4-1.
	   The fifth came in the 80th minute when Jarni again ran to the
left-hand corner of the box and let fly another shot that left
Kazimierz stretching in vain.
	   Three minutes into injury time, Savio headed the ball in from
seven yards on a chip pass from Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf.

Nova Scotia workers occupy Volvo plant slated for closure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Angered by plans to close their
factory in December, two dozen workers took over a Volvo plant
Wednesday in an attempt to force the company to improve its
severance proposal.
	   The protest halted production at the plant, and the workers said
they were prepared to continue the occupation until the company
made concessions.
	   Volvo Canada officials announced six weeks ago that the assembly
plant in suburban Halifax would close Dec. 18, throwing more than
200 people out of work.
	   Larry Wark, area director of the Canadian Auto Workers, said the
Swedish-owned company is not offering workers proper severance
packages or time off to find new jobs.
	   ``Everybody's too busy to talk to us at Volvo Canada so at this
point in time the membership is fed up,'' said Wark, who joined the
occupation.
	   ``We certainly contacted the Swedes and they'll be contacted
again to let them know in Sweden that you don't do this in your
country, and you're not going to do it in ours.''
	   The president of Volvo's Canadian operations condemned the
occupation and said there would be no further negotiations until
plant operations return to normal.
	   ``The actions of a few, irresponsible individuals intent on
grandstanding can only harm all employees and make an already
difficult situation worse,'' said Gord Sonnenberg of Volvo Canada
Ltd.
	   He said their actions ``are damaging to the reputation of the
entire workforce at a time when the company, the community and
various governments are working hard to re-employ these workers.''
	   The plant employs about 165 hourly and 35 salaried staff, plus
some contract workers. Its maximum annual output was about 8,200
vehicles.
	   The company said in September that the plant did not fit into
its plans for a global restructuring of its manufacturing
facilities.
	   The union had been lobbying to keep the Halifax plant open
through a joint venture between Volvo and a Toronto auto-parts
company. A delegation had traveled to Sweden to pitch the idea,
without success.

Controversial Rische goal gives Kaiserslautern 2-1 win at PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A hotly-disputed 80th-minute
winner from German striker Juergen Rische gave FC Kaiserslautern a
2-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven Wednesday in the Champions League.
	   Rische's header was adjudged to have crossed the line before it
was parried by PSV keeper Ronald Waterreus, but the referee gave
the goal only after consulting with his assistant.
	   Thomas Riedl had only been on the field as a sub for four
minutes when he pounced on a Marian Hristov knockdown to beat
Waterreus with a bouncing shot into the corner on 67 minutes.
	   But ten minutes later Russian Dmitri Khokhlov drove a
grass-cutting shot in from the left to score the first Champions
League goal against Kaiserslautern this year and make it 1-1.
	   With pouring rain and a heavy field a chaotic first half still
produced a few chances.
	   The first came when PSV's Danish winger Dennis Rommedahl broke
lose on 21 minutes and rounded keeper Andeas Reinike but rolled the
ball weakly goalwards only to see it cleared off the line.
	   The game caught pace just before the half and Kaiserslautern
striker Uwe Roesler beat defender Andrius Skerla but Waterreus
stood his ground well to block at point-blank range.

Yikes! Radioactive insects discovered at nuclear site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LINDA ASHTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RICHLAND, Washington (AP) _ Radioactive ants, flies and gnats
have been found at the Hanford nuclear complex, bringing to mind
those Cold War-era B horror movies in which giant, mutant insects
are the awful price paid for mankind's entry into the Atomic Age.
	   Officials at the most contaminated nuclear site in the United
States insist there is no danger of Hanford becoming the setting
for a '90s version of ``Them!,'' the 1954 movie starring James
Arness and James Whitmore in which huge, marauding ants are spawned
by nuclear experiments in the desert.
	   Although Hanford is working to eradicate its ``hot'' insects,
officials said the radioactivity the pests carry is slight and no
threat to neighboring communities.
	   ``We're not dealing with an insect that would leave and all of a
sudden start to give birth to these malformed, horrible insects,''
said a chuckling Richard Zack, an entomologist at Washington State
University in Pullman.
	   The situation came to light in September when red harvester ants
found underground near some old waste pipes were discovered to be
radioactive. Then, earlier this month, workers discovered
radioactive flying insects around cans where the staff's day-to-day
nonradioactive garbage is thrown away.
	   That led Fluor Daniel Hanford, the company that manages Hanford
for the Energy Department, to check the town dump where Hanford
garbage is taken. Workers found trash that had apparently become
radioactive from contact with the bugs, and sent 210 tons of it
back to Hanford for burial.
	   Still, a person would have had to stand next to a spot
contaminated by radioactive bugs for an hour to get the level of
exposure equal to a dental X-ray, said Mike Berriochoa, spokesman
for Fluor Daniel Hanford.
	   And the house-size ants of ``Them!'' are ``physical
impossibilities'' and just the stuff of science fiction, Zack said.
	   Zack and Berriochoa said they are not aware of any pattern of
genetic mutation in the insects around Hanford. And if the insects
were to develop mutations, the abnormalities would be along the
lines of a short antenna or an extra leg, Zack said.
	   And because the insects' range is short _ for fruit flies, it's
a few hundred yards (meters) to a half-mile (kilometer) _ the
chances of their leaving the 560-square-mile
(1,450-square-kilometer) complex are slim, he said.
	   Hanford said radioactive pests are to be expected at a place
that produced 40 years' worth of plutonium for nuclear weapons,
including the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945.
	   With all manner of burrowing creatures in the desert, including
mice, rabbits and snakes, there's always the potential something
will get contaminated, Berriochoa said. When contaminated mouse or
rabbit droppings are found at Hanford, traps are set for the
animal, and it is destroyed.
	   Hanford stopped producing plutonium in the 1980s, but some areas
remain highly radioactive. Billions of dollars are being spent to
clean up the site along the Columbia River.
	   Julie Petersen, 22, who works at Sunburst Video in Richland,
does not spend a lot of time worrying about mutant bugs.
	   ``I'm sure I get more radioactivity from my microwave,'' said
Ms. Petersen, whose friends outside the area still ask her if she
glows. ``It's just something we deal with every day. It's the way
most people live.''

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A weak Brondby defense allowed
Manchester United to trounce the Danish Group D underdogs 6-2
Wednesday in a Champions League match.
	   Ryan Giggs opened the score in the second minute on a
rain-soaked turf. A misunderstanding between goalie Mogens Krogh
and defender allowed Giggs to easily score on a ball lifted by
Wesley Brown.
	   In the 21st minute, Giggs headed a second goal on a long shot by
Manchester's Swedish forward Jesper Blomqvist. Seven minutes later,
Andy Cole ran past three Brondby defenders and fired a low shot
past Krogh.
	   Kim Daugaard reduced the score on a free kick in the 35th
minute. The Danish midfielder gunned a powerful low shot which
Manchester's Danish goalie, Peter Schmeichel, couldn't stop.
	   Schmeichel was back in business Wednesday after he had been out
for a few weeks with a stomach injury. Although Manchester
dominated the match before 40,315 fans at the Parken stadium,
Brondby didn't give up and gave its former goalie Schmeichel a busy
evening.
	   In the second half, the confidence gained after Daugaard's goal
didn't last long for Brondby.
	   Substitute Roy Keene headed past Krogh in the 55th minute on a
pass from Dwight Yorke who, four minutes later, scored Manchester's
fifth goal.
	   Another substitute, Jordi Cruyff, had been on the turf for less
than a minute when the Dutch international fired a powerful shot
into the Danish champions' nets in the 62nd minute.
	   In injury time, Danish international Ebbe Sand saved Brondby's
honor when he shot past a diving Schmeichel.
	   ``This is a regular smacking. There are no excuses for it,''
Brondby coach Ebbe Skovdahl said.
	   Manchester needed a win to take the lead in the group that
includes two other European powerhouses, Bayern Munchen and
Barcelona.
	   Manchester was missing key players like David Beckham and Nicky
Butt who are suspended, and injured Denis Irwin, Teddy Sheringham
and Ronny Johnson.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo scored what turned out to be the
winning goal in his return from injury Wednesday, lifting
Internazionale of Milan past Spartak Moscow 2-1 in a Champions
League Group C game.
	   The Brazilian star, out a month with tendinitis in both knees,
gathered the ball after it was fumbled by 'keeper Alexander
Filimonov and slotted home to give Inter a 2-0 lead in the 59th
minute before 44,199 at San Siro Stadium.
	   Spartak, the only club in the competition to win both of its
first two group games, pulled a goal back in the 65th, when
midfielder Ilya Tsymbalar headed in Andrei Tikhonov's left flank
cross.
	   Tsymbalar has scored in each Champions League game this season.
	   Ronaldo also had a role in the opening goal, in the 32nd, faking
a shot on a free kick and rolling a nifty pass over to Nicola
Ventola, whose 25-meter (yard) blast skimmed off the right post and
into the net.
	   The two-time FIFA player of the year had not played since Sept.
20 and had suggested he might only see 45 minutes of action
Wednesday. He played 72, leaving in favor of countryman Ze Elias, a
defensive-minded midfielder.
	   The Russians forced Inter 'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to make two
leaping saves on long-range shots in the first 12 minutes, first
from Tikhonov and then Vasily Baranov.
	   Filimonov was also kept busy, making back-to-back saves with his
legs on Andre Pirlo and French winger Benoit Cauet in the 40th
minute. The 'keeper also stopped Ronaldo on a one-on-one chance
five minutes later.
	   Pirlo had come off the bench to replace Youri Djorkaeff in the
35th, when the member of France's World Cup champions limped off
the field with a right thigh strain.
	   Both Inter, which rebounded from its 5-3 loss Sunday to Lazio of
Rome in Italian League action, and Spartak have two wins and a loss
after three rotations.

	   HOUSTON (AP) _ For months, Dominique Moceanu argued with her
parents, trying to find out where all her money was going.
	   She never got any answers.
	   Now the Olympic gymnast has split from her parents. She is
hiding out from them and hired a lawyer. She is 17 years old and
wants to be declared an adult so she can claim her earnings.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu said in the Houston Chronicle on
Wednesday, referring to her father. ``They haven't been working
since 1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Her father threatened over the weekend to have her beloved
Romanian coach deported. That was enough to send her to the office
of lawyer Roy Moore. On Monday, he asked a court to declare the
gymnast an adult.
	   Moore said neither he nor his client knows how much money she
has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore said a trust that
had been set up for her is all but gone.
	   Moore suspects that trust bankrolled a dlrs 4 million gym and
other ventures, including a clothing outlet, under the Moceanu
Gymnastics Inc. business title.
	   If she is declared an adult, Moceanu would be entitled to the
earnings from the businesses. A temporary restraining order was
issued Monday to keep the gymnast's parents from her at least until
a Nov. 11 hearing.
	   Calls by The Associated Press to the parents, Dumitru and
Camelia Moceanu, at the Houston gym and their home were not
returned Wednesday.
	   Moceanu, born in Los Angeles in 1981, moved to the Houston area
with her parents in 1990 so she could train with Bela Karolyi, the
famed coach of Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton and Kerri Strug.
	   For the five years leading to the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu trained
in Karolyi's gym. After Atlanta, Karolyi sold his gym and said he
was retiring from elite coaching.
	   So Moceanu's father, a used-car salesman, poured more than dlrs
4 million into a new gym and his daughter went from coach to coach
before settling on Luminita Miscenco, now credited with reviving
Moceanu's floundering career.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games and is the only member of that team still
competing in all gymnastics events. She expects to compete in the
world championships next year and possibly the 2000 Sydney Games.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition at the Goodwill Games.
	   After months of arguing, Moceanu's father threatened on Saturday
to fire Miscenco and have her deported. With Miscenco by her side,
a fearful but determined Moceanu made a second call to Moore from a
shopping mall and asked to meet with him. She's been living with
friends since.
	   In her interview with the Chronicle, Moceanu revealed a darker
side to the pixie persona shown at the Atlanta Games.
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' she told the newspaper. ``We've been trying to keep
things hidden.''
	   Moceanu said her life and her relationship with her parents was
far different from that of the typical teen-ager.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said. ``I would
think, `Don't you guys know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we
go out for ice cream? Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me
being your business?'
	   The gymnast also told the newspaper her father has hit her a
``couple of times.''
	   Despite the legal fight ahead, Moceanu hopes to mend her family
life.
	   ``I love my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is
over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

Lens grabs 1-0 win with late goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Substitute Wagneau Eloi snatched an 80th
minute winner to give Lens a 1-0 victory over Panathinaikos in the
Champions League on Wednesday.
	   Eloi, unmarked only seven meters from goal, latched onto a long
Tony Vairelles cross before calmly stroking the ball past
goalkeeper Josef Wandzik.
	   Lens put its opponents under tremendous pressure earlier in the
match but rarely looked like scoring against a displined Greek rear
guard.
	   It came closest in the 23rd minute when Pascal Nouma tapped in a
Stephane Dalmat cross but was judged offside. Minutes later,
Wandzik saved well from a close-range Nouma shot.
	   Winger Vairelles was the source of Lens' best attacking moves
and nearly scored his third European goal of the season on the
hour. But Wandzik was equal to his 15-yard folly.
	   The result leaves Lens with five points and the Greek side with
three points from three games.

Champions: HJK beats Benfica in Champions' League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A first half penalty goal from Mika
Lehkosuo and a headed goal by Mika Kottila in the second half gave
HJK Helsinki a 2-0 victory against Benfica in the Champions' League
Wednesday.
	   HJK frequently looked for the heading ability of its lone
striker, the lanky Kottila, with midfielders Brazilian Piracaia and
Vesa Vasara, providing crosses from both flanks.
	   A high ball towards the side of the area led to the penalty
after 19 minutes. Benfica central defender Paulo Madeira used a
hand to reach the ball over Kottila's head. Czech referee Vaclav
Kronov gave the penalty, also booking the Benfica player.
	   Lehkosuo coolly rolled the ball down in the right corner, with
veteran Belgian goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme going the other way.
	   HJK lost the offensive Vasara at 28 minutes after a head-on
clash with the uncompromising British left back Scott Minto.
Benfica had most of the possession until the interval, but HJK
still got the best chance as the bustling Albanian Shefki Kuci
missed an open goal with his header from a perfect cross from the
left by Piracaia.
	   In the second half Piracaia hit a corner in the 69th minute, and
Kottila powered a header into the net.
	   Benfica did not get penetration from its strikers Nuno Gomes and
Martin Pringle who both were substituted in the second half. The
best plays came on the left through Britons Scott Minto and
midfielder Mark Pembridge.

Ariane 5's final test launch a success

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the
European series of unmanned rockets, sailed into the heavens above
South America Wednesday in a final test launch hailed as a success.
	   The lift-off from its space base in Kourou, French Guiana, on
the northern shoulder of South America, came at 13:37 p.m. local
time (1637 GMT) -- well within the launch window despite a
half-hour halt in the countdown.
	   The successful third test of Ariane 5, powered with
solid-propellant boosters, followed a failure in 1996 and a test
last year that was only partially satisfactory.
	   Just 31 minutes after lift-off, Flight 503 successfully
simulated the launching, at an altitude of 1,500 kms (932 miles) of
a mockup satellite that was part of its payload, the 2.6-ton MAGSAT
3.
	   Arianespace, the commercial arm of the European Space Agency,
said that Ariane 5 ``left no doubts as to its ability to deliver
payloads ....''
	   Confirming Ariane 5's capacity to lob satellites into
geostationary transfer orbit was the prime goal of the test.
	   The Ariane 5 also dropped a capsule with instruments to measure
various functions. The capsule was to be recovered in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   ``Today Europe confirmed its lead in space transport systems for
the 21st century,'' a statement by Arianespace said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
offered congratulations.
	   The success ``will allow Arianespace to maintain its role as
world leader in space transport,'' Jospin said in a statement.
	   The first commercial flight of the new launcher is set for the
first quarter of 1999.
	   Current satellite launch capacity, using the less powerful
Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 is now 12-15 launches a year until 2001,
Arianespace said.

Effenberg lifts Munich past Barcelona past 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Stefan Effenberg's goal in first half
injury time Wednesday lifted Bayern Munich to a 1-0 victory over FC
Barcelona, scrambling the standings in Group D of the Champions
Cup.
	   Effenberg shoved the ball past Dutch keeper Ruud Hesp, after
Giovane Elber's header dropped at his feet inches from the goal,
almost two minutes into injury time.
	   ``It's a good thing the goal fell at the end of the first half,
otherwise wasting as many chances as we had can make a club
nervous,'' said Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   The win moved the German team, which needed a win to stay alive
in the group, points even at four with Barcelona.
	   Munich had entered the match last in the group table, the
Spanish club in first.
	   Munich threatened the Spanish champions through a lively first
half, ignited by Mario Basler's hard shot in the opening seconds,
but was thwarted repeatedly by Hesp's heroics.
	   Barcelona dominated the slow second half against a passive
Munich, trying to protect its lead, but the German keeper Oliver
Kahn robbed the Barcelona players of several chances.
	   After Rivaldo broke from the pack on a free kick, a lunging Kahn
fisted the ball away a split second before his foot reached the
ball in the 67th minute.
	   Kahn also parried a blast from the right by Giovanni, another
Brazilian, in the 75th.
	   While Barcelona wants the Champions Cup to match the feat of
rival Real Madrid last season, Munich was desperate to prove its
prowress in the Bundesliga is no fluke.
	   Under Hitzfeld, which led Borussia Dortmund to the Champions Cup
triumph two years ago, Munich is unbeaten in eight matches and off
to the fastest start in league history.
	   The Brazilian striker Anderson, who had scored three of
Barcelona's five Champions Cup goals, was reduced to a bystander
for most of the match by Ghana defender Sammy Kuffour.
	   Munich had another offensive outburst to end the match, fueled
by speedy reserve striker Alexander Zickler, who had several
scoring chances.

Controversial Rische goal gives Kaiserslautern 2-1 win at PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A disputed 80th-minute winner from
German striker Juergen Rische gave FC Kaiserslautern a 2-1 victory
at PSV Eindhoven Wednesday in the Champions League.
	   Rische's header was adjudged to have crossed the line before it
was parried by PSV keeper Ronald Waterreus, but the referee gave
the goal only after consulting with his assistant.
	   Thomas Riedl had only been on the field as a sub for four
minutes when he pounced on a Marian Hristov knockdown to beat
Waterreus with a bouncing shot into the corner on 67 minutes.
	   But ten minutes later Russian Dmitri Khokhlov drove a
grass-cutting shot in from the left to score the first Champions
League goal against Kaiserslautern this year and make it 1-1.
	   With pouring rain and a heavy field a chaotic first half still
produced a few chances.
	   The first came when PSV's Danish winger Dennis Rommedahl broke
lose on 21 minutes and rounded keeper Andeas Reinike but rolled the
ball weakly goalwards only to see it cleared off the line.
	   The game caught pace just before the half and Kaiserslautern
striker Uwe Roesler beat defender Andrius Skerla but Waterreus
stood his ground well to block at point-blank range.

Juventus holds Athletic de Bilbao to 0-0 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Athletic de Bilbao dominated play but
failed to garner more than a 0-0 draw against Juventus in European
Champions League play here Wednesday.
	   Before some 40,000 fans packing the San Mames stadium, Bilbao's
Spanish international Joseba Etxeberria had two fine chances at
goal in the first half saved by Juventus' goalkeeper Angelo
Peruzzi.
	   In the first 45 minutes, Juventus' closest attempts on goal came
with two shots from striker Filippo Inzaghi but neither caused
Bilbao 'keeper Imanol Etxeberria any real problems.
	   In the second half Juventus, who lost the Champions Cup final
last season to Spanish side Real Madrid, sought to change the
scoreline when French international Didier Deschamps let fly a shot
from the edge of the area in the 59th minute.
	   Less than 10 minutes later Inzaghi received a pass in the box
from France's Zinedine Zidane but failed to put it past 'keeper
Imanol.
	   Prior to the start of the second half, the game looked as if it
were about to be marked by violence when police cleared dozens of
Juventus fans from the stadium after several of them began throwing
objects at other spectators in nearby sections. The Italian fans
were allowed return moments later and there were no further reports
of trouble.

No more free lunches _ Brazilian president axes palace perks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ There's no such thing as a free
lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
telling government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either.
	   Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash
dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by
paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential
palace in Brasilia, the capital.
	   Sure, it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But as Cardoso readies a
package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to
show Brazilians that economy starts at home.
	   So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit
and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace
were closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers was
restricted. The price of a buffet offered employees for lunch was
raised from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8.50.
	   Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. On
a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation of
just eight, half the usual number.
	   The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a
month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's
office.
	   Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy battered by the
world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the full scope of
his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to include a
spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank
transactions.
	   The plan is part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The money would
strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the
world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial
crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year.
	   Brazil already has agreed to annual targets to sharply reduce
its deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers
published a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a
final agreement hasn't been reached yet.
	   Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less than
impressed by the palace penny-pinching.
	   The leftist Workers Party said the government was making a big
deal of insignificant savings while it failed to cut other dubious
projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 moat being built around Congress
to keep protesters from easily entering the building.
	   The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty of
fat to cut, citing government expenses for running shoes, Persian
carpets and gold cufflinks, intended as presents for visiting
dignitaries.
	   Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governors to
control spending. But the governors, some facing runoff elections
on Sunday, are promising pay raises and public works projects that
could sink the austerity plan.
	   In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises,
bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some
dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explained where the money would come
from.
	   In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost
certainly have to lay off workers _ the state payroll consumes 78
percent of the budget.
	   To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians,
Cardoso reportedly wants to hold local governments to bimonthly
limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if
spending gets out of hand.

Court sentences Syrian to death for spying, bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ An ethnic Syrian man with a Spanish passport
was sentenced Wednesday to death for spying for Saudi Arabia and
for plotting to assassinate Yemen's prime minister.
	   Sixteen Yemenis also were convicted after they confessed to
collaborating with the Syrian, Nabil Ezziddin Nanakali. The Court
of First Instance sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 18
months to three years. It acquitted five others, including two who
were tried in absentia.
	   Convictions and sentencing are handed out in the same session in
Yemen.
	   Nanakali, 45, told the court that he worked for Saudi
intelligence, which he claimed assigned him to assassinate Prime
Minister Abdel Karim al-Iryani in 1997.
	   He said the Saudis also asked him to carry out bombings and
attacks on tourists as well as to gather information.
	   Saudi Arabia had denied after the trial began that Nanakali
worked for its intelligence service.
	   The court disregarded the 16 Yemenis' claim that their
confessions were extracted under duress during the investigations
in the capital San'a and later in Aden.
	   All the defendants were arrested last year. Their lawyers said
they will appeal the sentences.
	   In a separate case, a San'a court on Sunday sentenced three men
to death and nine others to prison terms of six to 10 years for a
series of bombings in eastern Yemen in 1996 that killed a number of
soldiers.
	   In July, Yemen's Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab accused
Saudi Arabia of involvement in an attempt on his life saying some
of the tribesmen who took part in an armed attack on his convoy
sought refuge in Najran in southern Saudi Arabia.
	   He also said some Yemeni dissidents who were involved in bombing
and unrest received monthly payments from Saudi Arabia.
	   Yemen is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore
apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and
the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of
violence were directed from abroad.
	   Yemen and Saudi Arabia have long been locked in a territorial
dispute. Yemen contests Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea
islands, as well as parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert with
potentially lucrative oil fields.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the frontier before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire
and withdrawal.
	   The two countries share a 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.

Manchester United downs Brondby 6-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A weak Brondby defense allowed
Manchester United to trounce the Danish Group D underdogs 6-2
Wednesday in a Champions League match.
	   Ryan Giggs opened the score in the second minute on a
rain-soaked turf. A misunderstanding between goalie Mogens Krogh
and defender allowed Giggs to easily score on a ball lifted by
Wesley Brown.
	   In the 21st minute, Giggs headed a second goal on a long shot by
Manchester's Swedish forward Jesper Blomqvist. Seven minutes later,
Andy Cole ran past three Brondby defenders and fired a low shot
past Krogh.
	   Kim Daugaard reduced the score on a free kick in the 35th
minute. The Danish midfielder gunned a powerful low shot which
Manchester's Danish goalie, Peter Schmeichel, couldn't stop.
	   Schmeichel was back in business Wednesday after he had been out
for a few weeks with a stomach injury. Although Manchester
dominated the match before 40,315 fans at the Parken stadium,
Brondby didn't give up and gave its former goalie Schmeichel a busy
evening.
	   In the second half, the confidence gained after Daugaard's goal
didn't last long for Brondby.
	   Substitute Roy Keene headed past Krogh in the 55th minute on a
pass from Dwight Yorke who, four minutes later, scored Manchester's
fifth goal.
	   Another substitute, Jordi Cruyff, had been on the turf for less
than a minute when the Dutch international fired a powerful shot
into the Danish champions' nets in the 62nd minute.
	   In injury time, Danish international Ebbe Sand saved Brondby's
honor when he shot past a diving Schmeichel.
	   ``This is a regular smacking. There are no excuses for it,''
Brondby coach Ebbe Skovdahl said.
	   Manchester needed a win to take the lead in the group that
includes two other European powerhouses, Bayern Munchen and
Barcelona.
	   Manchester was missing key players like David Beckham and Nicky
Butt who are suspended, and injured Denis Irwin, Teddy Sheringham
and Ronny Johnson.

	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Sigurd Rushfeldt scored all three goals
as Rosenborg beat Galatasaray 3-0 in the third round of the
European Champions League Wednesday
	   Rushfeldt scored the first goal of the game in the 68th minute
after outmaneuvering a couple of Galatasaray defenders in the box.
A minute later Rushfeldt was alone with goalie Claudio Taffarel,
but the shot went inches outside the goal.
	   ``Totto'' Dahlum won a fight in the box in the 85th, sent the
ball to Borge Hernes who made a shot. Rushfeldt took advantage of
the rebound to make it 2-0.
	   Rushfeldt finally scored the third goal easily in the 90th when
he was alone with the goalie.
	   Bjorn Otto Bragstad was booked in the 50th and will miss the
next game.

Leconte defaults, McEnroe wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Frenchman Henri Leconte was forced
to default his opening match in the Champions senior tennis
tournament Wednesday after slipping on the fake clay surface.
	   Leconte hurt himself in the opening set against former dual
Australian Open champion Johan Kriek and packed up for the day with
Kriek leading 6-3, 2-0.
	   Leconte said the surface, which imitates clay but is much
quicker, needed to be adjusted. He pulled out mainly as a
precautionary measure and said he expected to be fit to play
Argentinian Guillermo Vilas on Thursday.
	   Vilas was beaten 6-2, 7-6 by Australian Pat Cash in the second
singles match.
	   John McEnroe scored a comfortable straight-sets win over
Australian John Fitzgerald in the night session while Bjorn Borg
also won.
	   McEnroe, who heads the points table for the senior tour,
defeated Fitzgerald 6-4, 6-2. Borg overpowered Englishman John
Lloyd 6-3, 6-2. (djp)

No more free lunches _ Brazilian president axes palace perks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to include real conversion &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ There's no such thing as a free
lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
telling government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either.
	   Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash
dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) from the budget deficit, and
he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at
the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital.
	   Sure, it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But as Cardoso readies a
package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to
show Brazilians that economy starts at home.
	   So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit
and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace
were closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers was
restricted. The price of a buffet offered employees for lunch was
raised from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8.50 (7 reals to 10 reals).
	   Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. On
a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation of
just eight, half the usual number.
	   The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000
(170,000 reals) a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator
of the president's office.
	   Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy battered by the
world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the full scope of
his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to include a
spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank
transactions.
	   The plan is part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The money would
strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the
world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial
crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year.
	   Brazil already has agreed to annual targets to sharply reduce
its deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers
published a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a
final agreement hasn't been reached yet.
	   Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less than
impressed by the palace penny-pinching.
	   The leftist Workers Party said the government was making a big
deal of insignificant savings while it failed to cut other dubious
projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals) moat being built
around Congress to keep protesters from easily entering the
building.
	   The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty of
fat to cut, citing government expenses for running shoes, Persian
carpets and gold cufflinks, intended as presents for visiting
dignitaries.
	   Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governors to
control spending. But the governors, some facing runoff elections
on Sunday, are promising pay raises and public works projects that
could sink the austerity plan.
	   In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises,
bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some
dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explained where
the money would come from.
	   In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost
certainly have to lay off workers _ the state payroll consumes 78
percent of the budget.
	   To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians,
Cardoso reportedly wants to hold local governments to bimonthly
limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if
spending gets out of hand.

 &UR; British minister in Romania on third leg of Balkan tour &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cook arriving in Bucharest, comments; CHANGES
byline and dateline. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
headed straight for talks with President Emil Constantinescu
Wednesday upon arrival in Romania after a day of talks in
Macedonia.
	   In Macedonia's capital, Skopje, Cook warned Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that the international community was monitoring
his behavior in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   He also praised Macedonia for its cooperation, saying it was too
early to say whether NATO also would seek to station troops in the
region.
	   Earlier this week, Macedonia permitted NATO to station spy
planes on its territory as part of efforts to ensure Yugoslavia
complies with an Oct. 12 agreement to defuse violence between
Yugoslav forces and separatist Albanians in its Kosovo province.
	   The Kosovo agreement, signed by Milosevic and U.S. negotiator
Richard Holbrooke, calls for 2,000 unarmed observers in Kosovo as
well as NATO surveillance flights to check whether Milosevic keeps
his promises.
	   ``President Milosevic should not make mistakes imagining that
the international community is going to forget about its
commitment,'' Cook said in Skopje. ``We will be watching very
carefully to make sure he sticks to the agreement.''
	   While in Macedonia, Cook also met with Kosovo Albanian leaders.
	   In Romania, Cook met with President Emil Constantinescu.
	   ``We are both clear that the way forward is for the countries of
the region to develop ethnic tolerance and integration ... ,'' he
said afterward. ``We both recognize that President Milosevic, by
pursuing the opposite policy of ethnic confrontation and the
repression of freedom and democracy, is taking his people in the
opposite direction, isolated from the modern Europe.''
	   Cook also was to meet Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile and
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu to discuss their country's role in
the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Torn between its traditional friendship with Serbia and its
desire to join NATO, Romania nonetheless granted NATO use of its
airspace in an emergency situation, should the alliance launch
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

Ronaldo strikes in Inter win; Real Madrid and Man Utd hit six
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ronaldo returned to fire Inter Milan to victory
while defending titlist Real Madrid and Manchester United each hit
six goals in the Champions Cup Wednesday.
	   Out for a month with tendinitis in both knees, Ronaldo gathered
the ball after it was fumbled by Moscow Spartak 'keeper Alexander
Filimonov and slotted home to give Inter a 2-0 lead in the 59th
minute at the San Siro.
	   It proved vital as Inter held on for 2-1 to end Spartak's 100
percent start and rekindled the Italian team's title hopes.
	   After its 6-1 crushing of last place Sturm Graz, Real moved to
the top of Group C ahead of Spartak and Inter with all three teams
on six points.
	   Two goals each for Brazilian Savio and Croat Robert Jarni
powered the titlist to a one-sided win after the Austrians had gone
ahead.
	   Manchester United romped to the top of Group D with a 6-2
crushing of Brondby in Copenhagen to muscle its way back into
contention for the title it last won in 1968.
	   After tying its earlier games against Barcelona and Bayern
Munich, Alex Ferguson's team tore the Brondby defense apart with
two strikes by Ryan Giggs and more from Andy Cole, Roy Keane,
Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
	   A goal just before half time by Stefan Effenberg gave Bayern
Munich a 1-0 victory over Barcelona. But the Spanish team is second
on a better goal differential with both teams on four points.
Brondby is fourth with three points but all four teams remain in
contention.
	   Sigurd Rushfeldt scored all goals as Rosenborg beat surprise
Group B leader Galatasaray 3-0 to jump to the top from third place.
Juventus managed only a 0-0 tie with Athletic de Bilbao and dropped
to third with three points.
	   A diving header from Dennis Bergkamp appeared to put Arsenal
into a 2-point lead atop Group E before Sergei Rebrof scored a last
minute leveler for Dynamo Kiev at Wembley.
	   Substitute Wagneau Eloi snatched an 80th minute winner to give
Lens a 1-0 victory over Panathinaikos and Arsenal is ahead of the
French club only because it has scored more goals. Both have five
points with Panathinaikos third with three and Kiev on two.
	   A hotly-disputed 80th-minute winner from Juergen Rische gave FC
Kaiserslautern a 2-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven to stretch the German
team's advantage to three points atop Group F.
	   Rische's header was judged to have crossed the line before it
was parried by PSV keeper Ronald Waterreus, but the referee gave
the goal only after consulting with his assistant.
	   A first half penalty goal from Mika Lehkosuo and a headed goal
by Mika Kottila in the second half gave HJK Helsinki a 2-0 victory
over Benfica and the Finnish team jumped into second place with
four points with Eindhoven and Benfica both on three.
	   Olympiakos edged four-time titlist Ajax Amsterdam 1-0 to move
three points clear in Group A, the only goal coming from Alexios
Alexandris three minutes before half time.
	   FC Porto downed Croatia 3-0 with two strikes by Slovenia's
Zlatko Zahovic and one by Brazil's Doriva to move up to second
ahead of Ajax on goal difference with both tied on four points.

Olympiakos beats Ajax 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Alexis Alexandris' 39th-minute goal was
all Olympiakos Piraeus needed to beat Ajax Amsterdam 1-0 in a Group
A match for the Champions League Wednesday.
	   The win sent Olympiakos atop the group with seven points from
three games.
	   Portugal's Porto and Ajax follow in second place with four
points each, while Croatia Zagreb is last with only one point.
	   Olympiakos, cheered on by a capacity crowd of 75,000, pressed
from the start and came close to open the scoring in the 3rd minute
with Vassilis Karapialis, but goalie Edwin Van Der Sar dived to
save with his foot.
	   Karapialis wasted another chance two minutes later when his
blistering shot went over Van Der Sar's crossbar.
	   Ajax, decimated by injuries, exercised a tight pressing and
launched sudden counter attacks creating some problems to the Greek
defense.
	   Olympiakos' goaltender Dimitris Eleftheropoulos made a key save
to a free kick taken by Frank De Boer in the 33rd.
	   Six minutes later, Alexandris scored the game's only goal off a
center from Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic.
	   Ajax became more aggressive in the second half missing a major
scoring opportunity when a free-kick by Richard Witschge hit
Olympiakos' crossbar in the 55th.
	   As Ajax made desperate attacks to level, Olympiakos came close
to a second goal on at least three occasions with two shots going
wide and one hitting Van Der Sar's left upright.

Mayo Clinic shows ingredient in new margarine lowers 'bad'
</HEADLINE>
cholesterol &QL; 
 &UR; By BRADLEY BROOKS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ A type of margarine that contains a
wood pulp extract and has been eaten in Finland since 1995 proved
effective in a Mayo Clinic study in lowering cholesterol levels.
	   The spread, called Benecol, is expected to be on U.S. grocers'
shelves in January.
	   The active ingredient in the margarine, plant stanol ester, can
lower people's LDL, or ``bad cholesterol,'' 14 percent, the study
found. Stanol ester is flavorless and odorless.
	   Lowell C. Dale, one of the study's researchers, reported the
preliminary findings on Wednesday at a meeting in Kansas City of
the American Dietetic Association.
	   The stanol ester works by inhibiting the transportation of
cholesterol from the digestive tract to the liver, thus decreasing
the amount of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood,
the researchers said.
	   A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that
Finns who ate three pats of the margarine a day without otherwise
changing their diet lowered their total cholesterol by 10 percent.
	   The Mayo study focused on about 300 healthy American men and
women ages 19 and up with borderline or mildly elevated cholesterol
levels.
	   Participants given margarine three times a day lowered their LDL
cholesterol by about 14 percent after eight weeks. Six weeks after
they stopped eating the margarine, their cholesterol shot back up
to where it was when the study began.
	   The product is being introduced in the U.S. by medical giant
McNeil Consumer Products and marketed under the same name it has in
Finland.
	   Company officials said that salad dressings containing stanol
esters and other products will be introduced sometime next year.
	   Another cholesterol-lowering food additive, plant sterol, which
is derived from soybeans, will be introduced in February by Lipton.
It will marketed under the name Take Control and will also be
introduced as a margarine. Studies show it can lower cholesterol by
about 10 percent.

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Sigurd Rushfeldt scored a hat trick as
Rosenborg beat Galatasaray 3-0 in the third round of the European
Champions League Wednesday.
	   Rushfeldt scored the first goal of the game in the 68th minute
after outmaneuvering a couple of Galatasaray defenders in the box.
A minute later Rushfeldt was alone with goalie Claudio Taffarel,
but the shot went inches outside the goal.
	   For much of the first half, Rushfeldt was not to be seen, but he
thought he was in the game most the time.
	   ``As a striker you have to be patient and pay attention all the
time. My body felt good, and Galatasaray was as good as expected,''
he said.
	   ``Totto'' Dahlum won a fight in the box in the 85th, sent the
ball to Borge Hernes who took the shot. Rushfeldt took advantage of
the rebound to make it 2-0.
	   Rushfeldt completed his hat trick in the 90th when he was alone
with the goalie, hiting the ball between Taffarel's legs.
	   ``Had it been a 0-0 game I would never have tried a ''tunnel'',
but it was fun,'' Rushfeldt said. ''But he was a little irritated.
	   ``We've made a good start, but it still annoys me that we did
not win the last home game against Juventus. The last game away
aginst Juventus could be deciding.''
	   Bjorn Otto Bragstad was booked in the 50th and will miss the
next game.
	   Inceefe Vedat got an early shower in the 80th when he got his
second yellow card of the game.

American sought for sex-crime may have fled Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ An American man infected with the HIV
virus may have fled the country after he was charged with assault
for allegedly having unprotected sex with women, police said
Wednesday.
	   Police telephone lines have been flooded for two days with tips
on the whereabouts of 40-year-old James Patric Kimball and from
women who knew him or had sex with him.
	   At least 65 women have reported having sex with Kimball, a
familiar figure in many Stockholm nightspots, the Swedish news
agency TT reported.
	   Kimball has been charged with rape and grave assault. The latter
charge has been used by Swedish authorities to prosecute people who
engage in unprotected sex while knowingly being infected with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS.
	   Authorities on Tuesday released Kimball's name and photograph to
the news media, a highly unusual move in Sweden, where the legal
system is weighted toward defendants.
	   Releasing that information prompted hundreds of calls to police
and to an HIV crisis telephone service.
	   ``We have received information that ... he may be in Denmark,''
police spokesman Christer Sjoeblom said Wednesday.
	   Police in Fredrikshavn, Denmark, reported that an American was
being sought after failing to pay his bill for a Tuesday night
hotel stay. Fredrikshavn is a main port for ferries traveling from
western Sweden.
	   Police, meanwhile, were laboring to find background on Kimball,
who moved to Sweden in 1992 after living on the French Riviera.
Authorities say he is from California.
	   The Stockholm daily Aftonbladet reported Wednesday that Kimball
is believed to have been from the Los Angeles area, but Sjoeblom
told The Associated Press there was no information on what city he
was from.
	   So far, one woman known to have had sex with Kimball has tested
positive for HIV.
	   Kimball lived in a two-room apartment in a Stockholm suburb and
worked for a small taxi company, but claimed to have wide celebrity
contacts and styled himself as a party-arranger, according to
Stockholm newspapers.

Chile, seeking immunity, says Pinochet in Britain on ``special

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a new bid to get diplomatic immunity for Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ambassador said Wednesday the former
Chilean dictator was on a special mission to Britain when he was
arrested in a hospital bed last week.
	   The announcement of the unspecified mission was the latest move
to end the impasse over the arrest of Pinochet at the instigation
of a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain on charges
of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and left Chile's government defending the 82-year-old dictator on
grounds that the arrest, which has enraged Pinochet supporters in
Chile, is straining a democracy painstakingly achieved since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   ``It was a special mission,'' Ambassador Mario Artaza told an
embassy news conference.
	   He refused to elaborate or say whether Chile now seeks to
maintain that Pinochet, who was commander-in-chief of the army
until March, was here on an arms-buying trip.
	   In Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said a
``decree'' had been issued that Pinochet was on a special mission
and this had been extended through Nov. 5 when Pinochet decided to
have medical treatment.
	   Pinochet underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated spine, and
since his arrest Oct. 16 has remained in a London clinic.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the ambassador and a special envoy from the
Chilean Foreign Ministry, Santiago Benadava, took the decrees to
the Foreign Office, but apparently made no impact. The Foreign
Office reiterated Wednesday evening that Pinochet did not have
diplomatic immunity.
	   Until announcing the special mission status, Chile had argued
that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity because he arrived last month
on a diplomatic passport and is a senator in Chile.
	   Britain accords diplomatic immunity only to accredited diplomats
and officials of foreign government who come on official visits.
The special mission decrees were an evident bid to qualify Pinochet
in the second category.
	   The Chilean ambassador said that unless his government protected
Pinochet it would be accused by opposition parties that support him
of failing in its duty.
	   ``We are not justifying, shielding or defending the dictator of
the 70s,'' the ambassador said.
	   ``For you here in Britain it is very easy to pass judgment,'' he
added.
	   The arrest has deepened historic political divisions in Chile,
where President Eduardo Frei urged his nation Wednesday to shun
political confrontation.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing Chilean opposition
parties who are in London trying to get Pinochet released, renewed
warnings of danger to democracy in their country.
	   ``We think it would be very difficult, very dangerous and would
create much more grief among our nation if Gen. Pinochet was very
ill here or even would die,'' Angelica Cristi, of Chile's National
Renovacion Nacional party, told reporters.
	   The U.S. government denied reports that it was quietly trying to
persuade Britain and Spain not to prosecute Pinochet because a
trial would spotlight the U.S. role in the bloody coup that brought
him to power.
	   ``This is a legal matter between the governments of the United
Kingdom, Spain and Chile. The United States is not involved,'' said
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin in Washington.
	   British Prime minister Tony Blair was quoted as telling Madrid's
El Mundo newspaper that Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his
government's so-called Ethical Foreign Policy.
	   ``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition
treaty but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the head of Parliament's human rights
committee backed an attempt by Amnesty International to have
Pinochet prosecuted in Britain if he escapes extradition to Spain.
	   ``We should seize this chance to bring to justice one of the
most evil dictators alive,'' Ann Clwyd, a lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party, said in a letter to Attorney General John Morris.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ For months, Dominique Moceanu argued with her
parents, trying to find out where all her money was going.
	   She never got any answers.
	   Now the Olympic gymnast has split from her parents. She is
hiding out from them and hired a lawyer. She is 17 years old and
wants to be declared an adult so she can claim her earnings.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu said in the Houston Chronicle on
Wednesday, referring to her father. ``They haven't been working
since 1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
	   Her father threatened over the weekend to have her beloved
Romanian coach deported. That was enough to send her to the office
of lawyer Roy Moore. On Monday, he asked a court to declare the
gymnast an adult.
	   Moore said neither he nor his client knows how much money she
has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore said a trust that
had been set up for her is all but gone.
	   Moore suspects that trust bankrolled a dlrs 4 million gym and
other ventures, including a clothing outlet, under the Moceanu
Gymnastics Inc. business title.
	   If she is declared an adult, Moceanu would be entitled to the
earnings from the businesses. A temporary restraining order was
issued Monday to keep parents Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu from her
at least until a Nov. 11 hearing.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Moceanu's father pleaded for his
daughter to come home.
	   ``We love her very much,'' Dumitru Moceanu said, choking back
tears. ``And I hope she change her mind and come home, start
training again.''
	   He said the petition and the restraining order were the work of
others, not his daughter.
	   ``She's just a child, she's just a minor,'' he said. ``I don't
believe this comes from her. It comes from other people.''
	   Moceanu, born in Los Angeles in 1981, moved to the Houston area
with her parents in 1990 so she could train with Bela Karolyi, the
famed coach of Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton and Kerri Strug.
	   For the five years leading to the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu trained
in Karolyi's gym. After Atlanta, Karolyi sold his gym and said he
was retiring from elite coaching.
	   So Moceanu's father, a used-car salesman, poured more than dlrs
4 million into a new gym and his daughter went from coach to coach
before settling on Luminita Miscenco, now credited with reviving
Moceanu's floundering career.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team
at the Atlanta Games and is the only member of that team still
competing in all gymnastics events. She expects to compete in the
world championships next year and possibly the 2000 Sydney Games.
	   In August, she became the first non-Russian to win the
all-around competition at the Goodwill Games.
	   After months of arguing, Moceanu's father threatened on Saturday
to fire Miscenco and have her deported. With Miscenco by her side,
a fearful but determined Moceanu made a second call to Moore from a
shopping mall and asked to meet with him. She's been living with
friends since.
	   In her interview with the Chronicle, Moceanu revealed a darker
side to the pixie persona shown at the Atlanta Games.
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' she told the newspaper. ``We've been trying to keep
things hidden.''
	   Moceanu said her life and her relationship with her parents was
far different from that of the typical teen-ager.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said. ``I would
think, `Don't you guys know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we
go out for ice cream? Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me
being your business?'
	   The gymnast also told the newspaper her father has hit her a
``couple of times.''
	   Despite the legal fight ahead, Moceanu hopes to mend her family
life.
	   ``I love my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is
over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ About 10 unarmed demonstrators were arrested
Wednesday after they briefly occupied Mexico's embassy in Oslo,
demanding the release of political prisoners in the Chiapas region,
police said.
	   Police spokesman Vidar Hjulstad said the small group of
Norwegians were members of the local left-wing Blitz youth group,
which routinely demonstrates for a variety of causes. The
demonstrators referred to themselves as Zapatas on Wednesday.
	   In January 1994, rebels calling themselves Zapatistas staged a
brief armed uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas, demanding
greater democracy and Indian rights. There is still tension in the
area between the rebels and Mexico's government.
	   The demonstrators issued a statement demanding the immediate
release of prisoners and the withdrawal of government troops from
the troubled southern Mexico state.
	   Police arrested all of the demonstrators after about three
hours, without incident. The protesters were being held for
investigation and could be fined.

Prosecutors may postpone Tyson trial, drop charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ZUCKERBROD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Mike Tyson should know by the end of the week
whether he will have to go on trial for allegedly assaulting two
people in Montgomery County, Maryland, his lawyer said Wednesday.
	   State's Attorney Robert Dean has been asked to postpone the
former heavyweight champion's Dec. 1 trial on misdemeanor assault
charges, defense lawyer Paul Kemp said.
	   ``If there's a way to resolve the case short of going to trial
and it's fair, I'm interested in exploring it,'' Dean said.
	   He said he is considering asking the judge to postpone the case
by putting it on the District Court's inactive docket.
	   Kemp has been negotiating a possible settlement with two men who
accused Tyson of assaulting them following a minor traffic accident
involving Tyson's wife, Monica, on Aug. 31. Tyson has denied the
charges.
	   The men, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, supported the
return of Tyson's boxing license by the Nevada Athletic Commission
earlier this week. It was revoked after he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears a year and a half ago during a title fight. The panel voted
4-1 to restore Tyson's license.
	   Kemp said he is also suggesting the misdemeanor assault charges
be dropped after about a year provided Tyson stays out of trouble.
Tyson might undergo counseling as part of the deal, Kemp said.
	   Such arrangements are ``not unusual'' in criminal cases, said
Stephen Saltzburg, a criminal law professor at George Washington
University. ``It is unusual for somebody who is a convicted felon
to get the benefit of this,'' he added.
	   Tyson is on probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.
	   The Indiana parole board is likely watching what Maryland does
in this case, Saltzburg and Kemp said. They agree an assault
conviction could prompt Indiana officials to revoke Tyson's
probation and send him back to prison. Even if Tyson is not
convicted, the parole board could still take such action, although
that is unlikely, the lawyers said.

Olympiakos beats Ajax 1-0

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Alexis Alexandris' 39th-minute goal was
all Olympiakos Piraeus needed to beat Ajax Amsterdam 1-0 in a Group
A match for the Champions League on Wednesday.
	   The win sent Olympiakos atop the group with seven points from
three games.
	   Portugal's Porto and Ajax follow in second place with four
points each, while Croatia Zagreb is last with only one point.
	   Olympiakos, cheered on by a capacity crowd of 75,000, pressed
from the start and came close to open the scoring in the 3rd minute
with Vassilis Karapialis, but goalie Edwin Van Der Sar dived to
save with his foot.
	   Karapialis wasted another chance two minutes later when his
blistering shot went over Van Der Sar's crossbar.
	   Ajax, decimated by injuries, exercised a tight pressing and
launched sudden counter attacks creating some problems to the Greek
defense.
	   Olympiakos' goaltender Dimitris Eleftheropoulos made a key save
to a free kick taken by Frank De Boer in the 33rd.
	   Six minutes later, Alexandris scored the game's only goal off a
center from Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic.
	   Ajax became more aggressive in the second half missing a major
scoring opportunity when a free-kick by Richard Witschge hit
Olympiakos' crossbar in the 55th.
	   As Ajax made desperate attacks to level, Olympiakos came close
to a second goal on at least three occasions with two shots going
wide and one hitting Van Der Sar's left upright.

Peru rejects `binational park' on disputed border with Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Peru's president said Wednesday
that he rejects any notion of a ``binational park'' on his
country's unmarked border with Ecuador to settle their aging border
conflict.
	   Talks here involving Alberto Fujimori of Peru and President
Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador came amid high hopes that an accord was
near in the half-century feud between the South American neighbors.
	   Speaking with reporters, Fujimori said he would not rule out
``two parks'' along a clearly demarcated border. But, he said,
Peruvian law would not allow both nations to share a single park on
an ill-defined border.
	   Such was one of the proposals meant to break the stalemate.
	   ``What is needed is demarcation,'' he said after the two
presidents held separate meetings with Argentine President Carlos
Menem, whose country is one of the de facto negotiators.
	   The appearance here came days after Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said during a weekend Ibero-American summit in
Portugal that a final settlement could come shortly.
	   But such hopes of a quick settlement have been dashed before.
	   Peru and Ecuador have agreed in advance to accept any settlement
proposed by the four guarantor nations of a 1942 treaty that ended
the War of the Pacific between the two countries. Argentine and
Brazil are guarantors, along with the United States and Chile.
	   A dispute over a small swath of their Amazon jungle border has
erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 1995. Tensions
flared anew in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of
entering its territory.
	   Fujimori and Mahaud met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help solve the
dispute. They told him they had made substantial progress toward a
peace agreement but remained at odds over delineating the actual
border.
	   In Buenos Aires, Mahuad signaled Wednesday he was negotiating in
good faith and hoped for a settlement that would allow them to move
on to other issues of mutual concern.
	   ``We will continue building the foundations for a definitive
peace,'' he said. ``When we talk with any other president, such as
Colombia's, we talk about ... trade issues, commerce and industry.
That's how it is with most countries.''
	   But, he added, ``When we talk with the president of Peru, only
one issue is normally on the agenda: the border, the conflict and
the troops. We have to change this.''
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador waged war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Mayo Clinic shows ingredient in new margarine lowers 'bad'

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ A type of margarine that contains a
wood pulp extract and has been eaten in Finland since 1995 proved
effective in a Mayo Clinic study in lowering cholesterol levels.
	   The spread, called Benecol, is expected to be on U.S. grocers'
shelves in January. The study was funded by the company that plans
to introduce the product.
	   The active ingredient in the margarine, plant stanol ester, can
lower people's LDL, or ``bad cholesterol,'' 14 percent, the study
found. Stanol ester is flavorless and odorless.
	   Lowell C. Dale, one of the study's researchers, reported the
preliminary findings on Wednesday at a meeting in Kansas City of
the American Dietetic Association.
	   The stanol ester works by inhibiting the transportation of
cholesterol from the digestive tract to the liver, thus decreasing
the amount of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood,
the researchers said.
	   A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that
Finns who ate three pats of the margarine a day without otherwise
changing their diet lowered their total cholesterol by 10 percent.
	   The Mayo study focused on about 300 healthy American men and
women ages 19 and up with borderline or mildly elevated cholesterol
levels.
	   Participants given margarine three times a day lowered their LDL
cholesterol by about 14 percent after eight weeks. Six weeks after
they stopped eating the margarine, their cholesterol shot back up
to where it was when the study began.
	   The product is being introduced in the U.S. by medical giant
McNeil Consumer Products and marketed under the same name it has in
Finland. It has already been approved by as a dietary supplement
and does not need approval from the Food and Drug Adminstration, a
McNeil spokesman said.
	   Company officials said that salad dressings containing stanol
esters and other products will be introduced sometime next year.
	   Another cholesterol-lowering food additive, plant sterol, which
is derived from soybeans, will be introduced in February by Lipton.
It will marketed under the name Take Control and will also be
introduced as a margarine. Studies show it can lower cholesterol by
about 10 percent.

Latin American human rights groups to file charges against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Latin American human rights activists said
Wednesday they will press charges against former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the death or disappearance of 30 people
from across the continent during his regime.
	   The Latin Americans were killed or disappeared while in Chile
after the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power, according to
the activists.
	   Pinochet, 82, was detained Friday by British police at the
request of a Spanish magistrate who had ordered his arrest for
genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year military rule of
the South American country.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.
	   The Latin American activists' charges will be presented to
Garzon to be included in Pinochet's possible trial in Spain,
representatives of the Quito-based Latin American Human Rights
Association and the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights said at a
news conference.
	   Among the victims were 14 Argentines, four Bolivians, four
Ecuadoreans, three Uruguayans, two Brazilians, a Mexican, a
Peruvian and a Venezuelan, the activists said.
	   Pinochet was in London recovering from back surgery when he was
detained. Chile has protested the detention, saying he has
diplomatic immunity.
	   Pinochet governed Chile from 1973, when he toppled the Marxist
government of Salvador Allende, until 1990. He kept power as head
of Chile's armed forces until 1997, when he stepped down to take a
seat-for-life in the Senate.

U.N. Rights Chief condemns assassination of top labor leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The United Nation's top human rights
official on Wednesday condemned the assassination of a top
Colombian union leader who was gunned down the night before inside
his apartment complex.
	   The slaying ``brought home to me the seriousness of the human
rights situation in Colombia and the enormity of the work that
needs to be done to address it,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is visiting the country this week.
	   Underscoring that message, Robinson said a human rights seminar
she attended Tuesday in Bogota had received a telephoned bomb
threat.
	   Jorge Ortega, vice president of the Unified Worker's Central,
was shot six times in the face, chest and stomach Tuesday night by
a lone gunman who sat for three hours on a park bench awaiting his
victim and chatting with neighbors, according to police. The
assassin fled on the back of a motorcycle, said Bogota police
spokesman Alberto Cantillo.
	   Ortega's death occurred amid a bitter, two-week national public
employees strike that has hobbled public services, caused sporadic
clashes between strikers and police and embittered relations
between unions and the government of President Andres Pastrana.
	   The government, which has taken a hard line against strikers
demands, condemned the killing as the work of ``dark forces trying
to sow chaos and disorder'' and offered a 100 million peso (about
dlrs 70,000) reward for information leading to an arrest.
	   Labor leaders walked out of a late-night bargaining session with
government officials after receiving news of the shooting, and the
Catholic Church-mediated talks have been suspended. Union leaders
said the strike was still on and prepared a protest march.
	   All sides appeared determined, however, to seek an end to the
two-week old work stoppage.
	   ``We've got to find a solution immediately,'' Luis Eduardo
Garzon, president of Ortega's union, said in a radio interview
Wednesday. A funeral was planned for Thursday.
	   Garzon said the 40-year-old Ortega had been followed for days
and was in the process of requesting government protection when he
was killed. Intruders had ransacked Ortega's house two weeks ago
without stealing anything, Garzon said.
	   A government human rights official, who spoke with The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Ortega had refused
to accept secret police bodyguards, insisting the government hire
and train bodyguards from a list of trusted individuals provided by
the union.
	   Threatened human rights activists have taken the same position,
pointing out that the secret police force _ which protects most
high-ranking officials _ has also been implicated in serious human
rights violations.
	   The state workers' walkout is to protest a government austerity
plan that cuts public sector spending and reduces wage increases.

Senegal leader says army will defend territory in rebel Casamance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Abdou Diouf of Senegal told French
lawmakers on Wednesday that his nation's army will not let up
against separatists in Casamance, defending Senegal's territorial
integrity ``with its last energy.''
	   In an address to the National Assembly, Diouf said that the
population of the region seeks the army's protection.
	   Diouf addressed a wide range of issues, from French aid to
solidarity of Francophone nations, in his more than half-hour
speech before French lawmakers.
	   He was the sixth foreign leader to address the body.
Predecessors include British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S.
President Bill Clinton and King Hassan II of Morocco.
	   The army ``defends and will continue to defend, with its last
energy, territorial integrity and national unity,'' Diouf said.
	   ``The Casamance population asks only to be under its protection,
especially with ... the use by rebels of odious anti-personnel
mines,'' he said.
	   The separatist rebellion in the Casamance region of southern
Senegal has smoldered for 15 years. The region, home to 800,000
people, is separated from the rest of Senegal by Gambia.
	   Diouf said, however, that his government has worked to ``create
a dynamic of dialogue.''
	   The Senegalese leader, expressing concern about shifts in French
policy in Africa, asked France to keep aid ``at an acceptable
level.'' He also pleaded for the cause of Francophonie, saying it
must be reinforced.
	   ``Without the resolute adhesion of France ... Francophonie has
little chance of developing,'' Diouf said.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two goals each for Brazilian Savio and
Croat Robert Jarni helped defending champion Real Madrid trounce
Sturm Graz 6-1 in European Champions League play Wednesday.
	   Sturm Graz took a surprise lead in the eighth minute when Ivica
Vastic slotted one in from 16 yards (meters). But Madrid was
determined not to let the game slip away and five minutes later
Savio chested down the ball following a superb lobbing pass into
the area by Yugoslav Pedrag Mijatovic. From some 10 yards (meters)
out to the right, Savio swerved and thundered the ball into the
back of the net for the equalizer.
	   Real took a grip of the game nine minutes on when Brazilian
defender Roberto Carlos flicked a sharp-angled pass to 21-year-old
ace striker Raul who from six yards (meters) drove the ball under
the diving body of goalkeeper Kazimierz Sidorczuk.
	   Madrid's play lacked cohesion throughout the game, with its
midfield and defense committing several blunders. Sturm Graz,
however, rarely appeared to have the creative or attacking ability
to seriously exploit the host's weaknesses.
	   But despite the scrappy play, Real had no problem putting in the
goals. In the 61st minute, Jarni steadied up on the left-side of
the box and let fly a thundering shot into the far top right-hand
corner of the Austrian side's goal.
	   Six minutes later, Mijatovic sent a cross in from the left
cornerkick area and Sturm Graz defender Ranko Popovic fumbled a
clearance to score an own-goal and make it 4-1.
	   The fifth came in the 80th minute when Jarni again ran to the
left-hand corner of the box and let fly another shot that left
Kazimierz stretching in vain.
	   Three minutes into injury time, Savio headed the ball in from
seven yards on a chip pass from Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf.

Thatcher calls for release of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has called
for the immediate release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator under arrest in his London hospital bed.
	   In a letter to The Times newspaper on Thursday, Thatcher, who
entertained Pinochet at her London home two weeks before his
arrest, said Pinochet was a good friend to Britain during the
Falklands War and must be allowed to return to his country
``forthwith.''
	   Pinochet was arrested Friday at the request of a Spanish
magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain on charges of genocide,
murder and torture during his 17-year-rule. He is recovering from
back surgery at a private London clinic.
	   Thatcher wrote that Pinochet helped shorten the Falklands War,
saving many British lives.
	   She said that next week, Britain will welcome Carlos Menem, the
democratically elected leader of Argentina, a country which, she
said, illegally invaded British territory, causing the loss of more
than 250 British lives.
	   ``It would be disgraceful to preach reconciliation with one,
while maintaining under arrest someone who, during that same
conflict, did so much to save so many British lives,'' she said.
	   Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90, said
she had better cause than most to remember Chile, which had
supported Britain in its 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the
Falkland Islands.
	   Thatcher and Pinochet have long had warm relations. In
Conservative government days, he was welcomed on regular visits
that included tea with the prime minister.
	   The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago,
ending 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   ``There were indeed abuses of human rights in Chile and acts of
violence on both sides of the political divide,'' Thatcher said.
``However, the people of Chile, through successively elected
democratic governments, have determined how they should come to
terms with their past.''
	   An essential part of that process has been the settlement of the
status for Pinochet and it is not for Spain, Britain or any other
country to interfere in what is an internal matter for Chile, she
said.
	   ``Delicate balances have had to be struck in Chile's transition
to democracy, balances with which we interfere at our peril,''
Thatcher said.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's president ordered a
unilateral cease-fire Wednesday, hours after the west African
nation's second-largest city fell into rebel hands, and said he was
ready to hold talks with the leader of a breakaway army faction.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said in a broadcast on the
country's state radio that he had instructed his forces to stop
firing from 10 p.m. (2200 GMT) on all fronts.
	   Vieira said he wanted to meet with rebel chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in the former
Portuguese colony that reignited on Sunday after a three-month
truce.
	   ``I am ready to meet, at any time and in any place, with Brig.
Ansumane Mane to put a final end to the tragedy being suffered by
Guinea-Bissau,'' Vieira said in the speech, which was also
broadcast on Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   The rebels had no immediate response, according to Antena 1.
	   The rebels, mostly army veterans angered by poor pay and
conditions, on Wednesday seized control of Bafata, an important
inland town about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of the coastal
capital, Bissau.
	   Earlier in the day, government forces launched a heavy artillery
barrage against the rebel positions near Bissau.
	   The fighting restarted on Sunday in the capital where the rebels
have held the main army garrison and airport in the western
outskirts of the capital for almost five months.
	   The clashes marked a return to an all-out civil war that first
flared June 7, following Mane's dismissal as armed forces
chief-of-staff for allegedly running guns to Senegal's Casamance
separatists.
	   Mane, who is supported by forces from neighboring Senegal and
the Republic of Guinea, says Vieira was running the arms scam and
alleges that he is corrupt.
	   The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of
thousands of displaced people throughout the country of 1 million
residents.
	   Thousands reportedly were fleeing Bissau late Wednesday.
	   Bafata's population of 160,000 has doubled since the conflict
began, as thousands sought refuge from the embattled capital, said
a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Program.
	   ``Civilians are looting (the program's) stocks, which had some
800 tons of food supplies,'' Wadgi Othman said by phone from
Abidjan in the Ivory Coast.
	   The foes had entered a cease-fire July 26 brokered by
negotiators from west African and Portuguese-speaking countries.
The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping force and
military observers, but no deal was reached.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Authorities detained two army officers
for questioning in an alleged plot to kill Venezuela's army chief,
who has provoked controversy by criticizing a top presidential
candidate.
	   The detentions, confirmed Wednesday by Defense Minister Tito
Rincon Bravo, follow days of mutual recriminations between the army
and former coup leader Hugo Chavez, the front-runner in Dec. 6
presidential elections.
	   Rincon Bravo said the detainees, a major and a retired
lieutenant, were allegedly overheard talking about a plan to kill
Gen. Ruben Rojas Perez, the head of the army and the son-in-law of
President Rafael Caldera.
	   It wasn't immediately clear when the officers were detained, but
Rincon Bravo said they were still being held for questioning on
Wednesday. The officers' names were not given.
	   Chavez charged this week that Rojas is conspiring to thwart his
chances in the race through a coup or an assassination. The
military is in charge of security on election day.
	   Officials deny the allegations.
	   Rojas said recently that the armed forces do not support the
former soldiers who, led by Chavez, tried to overthrow the
government in 1992.
	   Chavez, 44, a former paratrooper, is drawing support from the
poor and is leading all presidential polls. His candidacy has
reportedly divided the armed forces between pro-Chavez and
anti-Chavez factions.

Sorenstam, Pak push for top spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE VILLAGE, Florida (AP) _ Even if she finishes last in the
16-player field at the Samsung World Championship of Women's Golf,
Annika Sorenstam will surpass dlrs 1 million in earnings for the
second straight year. She can thank Se Ri Pak for that.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean this year became the first rookie
since Juli Inkster in 1984 to win two majors.
	   ``After she started winning, I felt like I had to play well
toward the end of the year,'' Sorenstam said. ``I think the
competition got my attention.''
	   The competition could rise a notch starting Thursday at Tierra
Del Sol in central Florida, when Sorenstam and Pak are paired in
the first round of the dlrs 550,000 event.
	   Sorenstam, the top-ranked player in the world, didn't win her
first tournament until June, but she has been on a roll since. She
has won four times and finished in the top 10 in 16 of her 19
events.
	   That has put her dlrs 1,002 away from dlrs 1 million and given
her a dlrs 152,000 lead in the race to lead the money list. But
player of the year is another matter.
	   Sorenstam and Pak both have four victories. Pak has the LPGA
Championship and the U.S. Women's Open, but Sorenstam has a lead in
the points race based on her top-10 finishes.
	   They are separated by 27.90 points, which isn't much considering
that victories are worth 30 points and the season-ending Tour
Championship is worth 60.
	   ``I'm trying to get more points for the Rolex Player of the Year
and also stay up on the money list and the Vare Trophy (lowest
scoring average),'' she said. ``All of those things are important
to me.''
	   The Samsung World Championship field includes the winners of the
four major championships _ Pat Hurst (Dinah Shore), Pak and Brandie
Burton (du Maurier) _ along with Grace Park, the U.S. Amateur
champion.
	   Others include Helen Alfredsson (leading European player), Laura
Davies (leading International player) and Hiromi Kobayashi (top
Japanese player), defending Vare Trophy winner Karrie Webb and
Inkster, the defending champion.
	   The rest of the field is determined by the LPGA money list _
Donna Andrews, Liselotte Neumann, Meg Mallon, Dottie Pepper,
Dannielle Ammaccapane and Lorie Kane.
	   The Samsung had been played in South Korea, but was moved to
this community an hour northwest of Orlando in May, just two weeks
before Pak started her run by winning the LPGA Championship.
	   Samsung is her sponsor, having paid for her to move to Florida
and train under David Leadbetter. Pak's real homecoming is next
week, when she returns to South Korea for the first time since
captivating women's golf and will get a presidential parade.
	   ``I am like kids before they go to picnic or Disney World,'' Pak
said about her homecoming. ``Cannot sleep. I am like that.''
	   This is no time to rest. With a strong finish, she can become
the first player since her idol _ Nancy Lopez _ to win rookie of
the year and player of the year in the same season.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors on Wednesday formally charged
a Roman Catholic priest in the killing of a bishop who headed the
archdiocese's human rights office.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina ordered the Rev. Mario Lionel
Orantes Najera to remain in jail on charges he killed Bishop Juan
Gerardi Conedera.
	   Orantes has maintained his innocence, and church and human
rights officials have accused prosecutors of arresting the priest
to divert blame from the military.
	   A church spokesman, Monsignor Efrain Hernandez, called
Wednesday's actions ``lamentable.''
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in the garage of his church
residence on April 26, two days after releasing a report blaming
the military for most of the deaths in Guatemala's 36-year civil
war, which ended in 1996.
	   Orantes, who was living in Gerardi's residence at the time of
the killing, was arrested July 22 because of evidence that his dog
had bitten the archbishop. Prosecutors have not given a motive for
the killing.
	   Prosecutor Otto Ardon Medina said the investigation is
continuing and his office will continue interviewing military
officials and civilians who may have information in the case.
	   On Tuesday, church officials criticized the investigation and
called for Orantes' release.
	   Archbishop Victor Hugo Martinez, speaking on behalf of the
national Episcopal Conference, accused prosecutors of ignoring
``the hidden forces who were behind the crime.''
	   Gerardi's successor as the head of the human rights office,
Bishop Mario Rios Montt, said ``the killing of Gerardi was
political.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ An uprising Wednesday by Honduran
prisoners demanding better food and medical care left one inmate
injured, officials said.
	   The uprising by 375 prisoners in the Danli state prison, 100
miles (160 kilometers) east of Tegucigalpa, the capital, ended
after six hours and the prisoners returned to their cells, said the
police chief, Col. Rafael Antonio Rodriguez.
	   He said officials negotiated with prisoners and ``we avoided a
great tragedy.''
	   Inmates armed with rocks and sticks had tried to escape from the
prison. Rodriguez said prison guards fired in the air to stop them,
but one inmate suffered a minor wound.
	   Prison uprisings are common in Honduras, where inmates complain
about poor conditions, bad food and the slow judicial system. There
were 15 prison disturbances last year and more than 6,500 prisoners
escaped.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A small plane on Tuesday crashed into a
house in northeastern Brazil, killing three people, police said.
	   The twin-engine Brasilia crashed into a middle-class district in
the city of Fortaleza, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) northeast of
Sao Paulo.
	   The Fortaleza police department said the pilot, co-pilot and a
woman who was sweeping her backyard died when the plane plowed into
the house.
	   One passenger, the only other person on board, was seriously
injured.
	   Police said they were investigating the cause the accident.
	   The plane was on a daily 500-kilometer (310-mile) flight from
the city of Teresina to Fortaleza.

	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Sigurd Rushfeldt scored a hat trick as
Rosenborg beat Galatasaray 3-0 in the third round of the European
Champions League Wednesday.
	   Rushfeldt scored the first goal of the game in the 68th minute
after outmaneuvering a couple of Galatasaray defenders in the box.
A minute later Rushfeldt was alone with goalie Claudio Taffarel,
but the shot went inches outside the goal.
	   For much of the first half, Rushfeldt was not to be seen, but he
thought he was in the game most the time.
	   ``As a striker you have to be patient and pay attention all the
time. My body felt good, and Galatasaray was as good as expected,''
he said.
	   ``Totto'' Dahlum won a fight in the box in the 85th, sent the
ball to Borge Hernes who took the shot. Rushfeldt took advantage of
the rebound to make it 2-0.
	   Rushfeldt completed his hat trick in the 90th when he was alone
with the goalie, hiting the ball between Taffarel's legs.
	   ``Had it been a 0-0 game I would never have tried a ''tunnel'',
but it was fun,'' Rushfeldt said. ''But he was a little irritated.
	   ``We've made a good start, but it still annoys me that we did
not win the last home game against Juventus. The last game away
aginst Juventus could be deciding.''
	   Bjorn Otto Bragstad was booked in the 50th and will miss the
next game.
	   Inceefe Vedat got an early shower in the 80th when he got his
second yellow card of the game.

Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ambassador said Wednesday the former
Chilean dictator was on a special mission to Britain when he was
arrested in a hospital bed last week.
	   The announcement of the unspecified mission was the latest move
to end the impasse over the arrest of Pinochet at the instigation
of a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain on charges
of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year-rule.
	   The crisis has soured British and Spanish relations with Chile
and left Chile's government defending the 82-year-old dictator on
grounds that the arrest, which has enraged Pinochet supporters in
Chile, is straining a democracy painstakingly achieved since
Pinochet stood down in 1990.
	   ``It was a special mission,'' Ambassador Mario Artaza told an
embassy news conference.
	   He refused to elaborate or say whether Chile now seeks to
maintain that Pinochet, who was commander-in-chief of the army
until March, was here on an arms-buying trip.
	   In Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said a
``decree'' had been issued that Pinochet was on a special mission
and this had been extended through Nov. 5 when Pinochet decided to
have medical treatment.
	   Pinochet underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated spine, and
since his arrest Oct. 16 has remained in a London clinic.
	   In a letter to The Times newspaper on Thursday, former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who entertained Pinochet at her London
home two weeks before his arrest, said Pinochet was a good friend
to Britain during the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina and must
be allowed to return to his country ``forthwith.''
	   Noting that Argentina's leader Carlos Menem is to visit Britain
next week, Thatcher said, ``It would be disgraceful to preach
reconciliation with one, while maintaining under arrest someone
who, during that same conflict, did so much to save so many British
lives.''
	   She said Pinochet's fate was an internal matter for Chile and
that Spain or Britain should not interfere with Chile's transition
to democracy.
	   Until announcing the special mission status, Chile had argued
that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity because he arrived last month
on a diplomatic passport and is a senator in Chile.
	   Britain accords diplomatic immunity only to accredited diplomats
and officials of foreign government who come on official visits.
The special mission decrees were an evident bid to qualify Pinochet
in the second category.
	   The arrest has deepened historic political divisions in Chile,
where President Eduardo Frei urged his nation Wednesday to shun
political confrontation.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing Chilean opposition
parties who are in London trying to get Pinochet released, renewed
warnings of danger to democracy in their country.
	   The U.S. government denied reports that it was quietly trying to
persuade Britain and Spain not to prosecute Pinochet because a
trial would spotlight the U.S. role in the bloody coup that brought
him to power.
	   ``This is a legal matter between the governments of the United
Kingdom, Spain and Chile. The United States is not involved,'' said
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin in Washington.
	   Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon is seeking Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile,
including an unspecified number of Spaniards, and the disappearance
of 94 people, mostly Chileans, in Argentina.

Forget golf, Stockton's got Serena
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Dave Stockton Jr. leaned back
in a golf cart with a smile so wide one would never guess he is
125th on the money list and in danger of losing his PGA Tour card.
	   Let the others grind it out this week at the National Car Rental
Classic at Disney World, whether they're trying to finish in the
top 30 to qualify for the Tour Championship or the top 125 to
qualify for the tour next year.
	   Thumbing through pictures of his 7-week-old daughter Serena,
born 2 1/2 months premature and still in a hospital back home in
California, Stockton has a new perspective on the final full-field
tournament of the year.
	   ``Last year, my whole world was, 'God, I have to get my card.'
But this is not my world. This means nothing compared to what's
going on at home,'' Stockton said Wednesday.
	   ``Some of the other guys may feel pressure trying to keep their
card. I know they do because I've been there,'' he said. ``But I'm
about as relaxed and happy as you can be because I know my baby is
doing good.''
	   Stockton never thought he would be in this position two months
ago. His plan all along was to win enough money by September so he
could stay home with his wife Diane, who was having a complicated
pregnancy with twins.
	   One of the babies died in the womb at 12 weeks but continued to
grow, a phenomenon known as ``trap'' that happens in one of every
65,000 twin pregnancies.
	   Stockton was 7-under over the weekend in Vancouver and finished
20th for another solid check. Already with three top 10s while
playing with conditional status, he had earned dlrs 215,000 for the
year and was all but certain to secure his card.
	   As he left for the Greater Milwaukee Open, Stockton told his
wife, ``One more week and I'll be home with you. Everything will be
fine and I'll be done for the year.''
	   Serena was born two days later Sept. 2. She was in critical
condition for six days, weighing just 2 pounds, 11 ounces (1.35
kgs). The other baby weighed five pounds (2.25 kgs) but never
developed a heart.
	   ``She was taking nutrients away from Serena,'' Stockton said.
``If Serena had been in there any longer, we might have lost her.
It was a shock to both of us.''
	   Over the next month, Serena had heart surgery and stomach
surgery, suffered pneumonia and jaundice. Stockton didn't pick up a
club for five weeks.
	   ``Golf wasn't even on my mind,'' he said.
	   Serena's progress was slow, but she weighs 4 pounds now and
should be able to come home in a month.
	   ``The worst part is behind us,'' he said.
	   Stockton finally returned to tour in the Michelob Championship
two weeks ago, where he finished 74th. During his time away from
golf, he had slipped from 104th to 125th on the money list, and
already sent in his dlrs 4,000 entry fee for Q-school.
	   ``That was frustrating because I knew after Vancouver that I
wouldn't have to go this year,'' he said.
	   Next up is Disney, which has one of the strongest fields of the
year. Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Mark O'Meara and Vijay Singh are
in the field, trying to keep David Duval from running away with the
money title. And Stewart Cink and Billy Andrade are among those
trying to get into the top 30 for the Tour Championship.
	   Stockton recalls being a bundle of nerves last year when he was
outside the 125 cutoff going into the last tournament, the Las
Vegas Invitational, where he missed the cut. This year, beads
spelling S-E-R-E-N-A that hang from his bag remind him of what's
truly important.
	   ``Who knows? Maybe this will make me play well,'' he said. ``I
call every morning and ask how my baby did last night. And every
time, they say she had a good night. I just smile. If my baby is
having a good day, that's all that matters.''

Thousands protest in Suriname against judicial appointment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEO MORPURGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Thousands of people marched in
Paramaribo Wednesday to protest the president's choice for supreme
court chief justice.
	   ``He lies,'' chanted the protesters, who oppose President Jules
Wijdenbosch's contention that he did not have to present nominee
Alfred Veldema to other justices for their approval. The
demonstrators marched through the capital to the supreme court's
offices, then listened to speeches from opposition lawmakers.
	   Police said the march was peaceful.
	   Wijdenbosch kept Veldema's appointment secret until his
swearing-in ceremony in July. The other supreme court justices have
refused to recognize Veldema, saying the country's constitution
requires that they be consulted on such appointments. The country's
largest associations of lawyers also oppose his appointment.
	   Last week, police and Central Intelligence Service agents broke
into the chief justice's office and changed the locks so that
Veldema could move in.
	   Wednesday's protest was organized by the opposition National
Party of Suriname, labor unions, the Association of Merchants and
Businessmen, teachers' associations, human rights groups and
students.
	   They marched despite warnings Tuesday by Paramaribo district
commissioner Carlo Visserr that the demonstration was illegal
because organizers did not have protest permits.
	   Wijdenbosch was attending a conference of the Caribbean
Community trade group in Grenada.
	   Wijdenbosh, an ally of former military dictator Desire Delano
Bouterse, has been criticized for his economic policies and rising
inflation in this former Dutch colony on the northeast shoulder of
South America.
	   The country has been wracked by strikes and protests since
December. Earlier this month, opposition parliament member Harry
Kisoensingh was beaten by police during a demonstration by rice
farmers in Saramacca, south of the capital.

USOC to pursue medal change from '76
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Efforts to get gold medals for four American
Olympic swimmers because of possible drug use by the East German
team that beat them will proceed despite initial rejection by a top
IOC official.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee will pursue the medal change for the
women's 400-meter medley relay team from the 1976 Montreal Games
once it receives a written report from a German court case, USOC
president Bill Hybl said Wednesday.
	   Hybl said the committee will not be deterred by comments in
Sydney, Australia, by Jacques Rogge, an International Olympic
Committee executive board member and a front-runner to be the IOC's
next president.
	   The head of the IOC coordination commission for the 2000 Games
in Sydney, Rogge said Wednesday the international committee was
opposed to retroactive action on suspected drug users.
	   ``We are not going to change what has happened in the past,''
Rogge said. ``There's absolutely not going to be any change for
things that happened more than 10 years ago.''
	   But Hybl said he was prepared to ask IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch for gold medals for Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile
Wright and Shirley Babashoff, based upon comments by Samaranch and
IOC general secretary Francois Carrard.
	   ``The USOC certainly respects Jacques Rogge and his feelings on
this,'' Hybl said. ``We will submit this, although we don't know
what the outcome will be.''
	   The USOC president also said there were no plans to ask for
wholesale medal changes. He said no athletes, coaches or other
representatives had approached the committee about possible review
since he announced the swimming-medal plan Monday.
	   ``Our goal is to work with the IOC on a case-by-case basis,''
Hybl said.
	   Jezek, Siering, Wright and Babashoff lost by 6.6 seconds to the
East German team in Montreal, but a German court case has provided
what the USOC sees as irrefutable evidence Pollack was helped by
steroids.
	   The court has heard evidence that East German trainers and
coaches routinely gave steroids to athletes as young as 12 years
old, telling them the banned drugs were vitamins. The USOC won't
ask that the East Germans relinquish their medals because the
doping appeared to be unknown to the athletes at the time.
	   Over the years, the IOC has rebuffed attempts to change results
of the games that might have been affected by drugs or other
cheating. But last January, Samaranch said the committee would
consider stripping medals from former East German athletes
identified as drug users. That stand was repeated by Carrard in an
August interview on ABC's ``Nightline.''
	   But Rogge said it was too hard to prove that drug use robbed
athletes of medals so long ago.
	   ``You have to have documented evidence if you want to reopen
these cases,'' Rogge said. ``We know of course that there was a
doping problem in some countries, but at this stage we still have
no documented evidence of doping of an athlete on the day of
Olympic competitions.
	   ``You cannot just condemn someone because there was a general
problem. Not all of them have taken drugs.''

All Blacks criticized for not singing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ They put everything into their
emotional war-dance known as the ``haka,'' and speak of the pride
of the black jersey, but New Zealand's rugby players have been
hammered for failing to sing the national anthem.
	   New Zealand's navy chief, Rear Admiral Fred Wilson, says less
than half the players acknowledge, let alone sing, God Defend New
Zealand prior to test matches.
	   ``It seems strange to me that our country's heroes on the rugby
field should so deliberately shun a specific part of our identity
as a nation,'' Wilson wrote in the Navy Today magazine.
	   The All Blacks spoke with pride about their famous jersey but
they then ``solemnly line up before a match and studiously ignore,
even disrespect, another national icon, which is our anthem.
	   ``It is difficult for me to regard them as heroes when they
demonstrate such scant regard for one national emblem while wearing
another,'' Wilson said.
	   New Zealand Rugby Football Union spokeswoman Jackie Maitland
said all players were encouraged to sing the anthem and the All
Blacks had practiced it this year.
	   She believed more than half of them sang it before games and
``maybe the others are respecting it in a different way.''
	   ``I disagree with the admiral's comments,'' said Maitland.
``There is no desecration.''
	   She said large sections of New Zealand crowds also did not sing
the anthem and Kiwis were less likely to sing than rugby fans in
other countries.
	   Maitland said the haka had a longer and stronger association
with New Zealand rugby.
	   ``The haka is very strong and passionate and I don't think the
anthem stirs the same emotions,'' she said.
	   Wilson said national identity was a fragile thing which ``can be
subtly trashed by those who carry our banner behaving in a crass
and uncaring manner.''

New Zealand to control flow of Indonesian asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand suspended Wednesday
the visa-free entry status of Indonesians because of a dramatic
increase of asylum seekers following riots there in May.
	   Immigration Minister Tuariki Delamere said Indonesians were
abusing the visa-free system, which had been set up to encourage
tourism while Asian economies were booming.
	   He said more than 300 refugee applications had been received in
the past four months from Indonesian nationals who had traveled to
New Zealand on three-month visitor permits, then claimed refugee
status once they were in the country.
	   Fifty-four of those applications had been in the first two weeks
of October alone.
	   ``This is a very serious trend. Indonesia now represents almost
half of all refugee claims over the last four months,'' Delamere
said.
	   ``By suspending the visa-free status for Indonesian nationals we
are better placed to manage the risk of people seeking refugee
status once they arrive here,'' he said.
	   Delamere said there were many opportunities for people to enter
New Zealand as migrants ``without attempting to get in through the
back door and cheat the system.''
	   An immigration office would be opened in Jakarta to manage visa
requirements.
	   Delamere said New Zealand had a robust refugee policy, designed
to assist people who were homeless and fleeing from persecution. It
took in 750 refugees a year on referral from the United Nations
refugee organization.
	   The rise in asylum seekers from Indonesia coincides with
deepening economic turmoil there and follows riots in May which led
to the fall of former president Suharto.
	   Ethnic Chinese were the principal victims and say they live in
fear of further violence.
	   Matt Robson, immigration spokesman for the opposition party
Alliance, said he met ethnic Chinese leaders in Indonesia last
month to discuss the situation facing their community, including
continuing attacks, torture and rapes.
	   ``The people who have had the door slammed in their face today
... are the people who are escaping this persecution,'' Robson
said.

The '98 Yankees: The best since '27?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Even last spring, the great Yogi knew it: This
New York Yankees team was special.
	   ``I said they were going to win by 25,'' Yogi Berra recalled
Wednesday. ``They only won by 22.''
	   At 124-50 and one win away for their second World Series title
in three seasons, these Yankees are on the verge of completing one
of U.S. baseball's greatest seasons.
	   With a sweep, they would finish with a .714 winning percentage,
the highest in baseball since the '27 Yankees Murderers' Row team
and the fourth-highest ever.
	   But how good are they? The best in 71 years? The best ever?
	   ``That can't be answered,'' said Berra, who then proceeded to
try.
	   As part of Yankees teams that won 14 pennants in 16 years, Berra
is uniquely qualified to judge. He holds the record for most World
Series games, at-bats, hits and doubles.
	   ``I hope they can win five in a row like we did,'' said Berra,
part of 10 Series champions, including the five straight from
1949-53.
	   Led by the M and M Boys, the '61 Yankees had more power, with
Roger Maris hitting 61 homers and Mickey Mantle hitting 54 en route
to a 109-53 record and a 4-1 Series win over Cincinnati.
	   The '39 Yankees were the strongest of Joe DiMaggio's teams,
finishing the regular season 106-45 and sweeping the Reds to win
their fourth straight Series title.
	   The '27 Yankees, generally regarded as baseball's best, went
110-44 and then swept Pittsburgh.
	   And what of the 1975-76 Cincinnati Reds, the Big Red Machine led
by Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose?
	   ``I would rank this team third or fourth,'' said the Chicago
Tribune's Jerome Holtzman, who has been on the beat for 42 seasons
and is the senior baseball writer in the United States. ``There
isn't a Hall of Famer. They don't have a dominant hitter.''
	   Holtzman rates this team behind the '27 Yankees, the '61
Yankees, the Big Red Machine and perhaps the '19 White Sox, who
threw the World Series against Cincinnati in a gambling scandal.
	   Morgan puts these Yankees behind the '76 Reds because there's no
superstar. Cincinnati had three of them in Bench, Rose and Morgan,
and Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion were close behind.
	   ``If you're going to dominate for a long time, you have to have
a stud,'' Morgan said. ``I don't like talking abut individuals or
throwing them up against my team because they're going to come up
second-best. But they're a team.''
	   It's also hard to rank these Yankees because they had a huge
lead by the All-Star break and coasted to a 114-48 record, the most
wins in the regular season since the '06 Cubs went 116-36.
	   Sparky Anderson knows something about great teams, too. He
managed the Reds to Series titles in '75 and '76, as well as the
'84 Detroit Tigers, who started the season 35-5 and beat San Diego
4-1 in the Padres' only other World Series appearance.
	   ``You can never rank teams for this reason: There's no way the
'27 Yankees can ever play the '98 Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles
and the Oakland Athletics or the great Reds team,'' Anderson said.
``They're a great team for this era and will go down in history as
a great team, but they cannot be rated until they've won at least
three World Series.''
	   The Swingin' A's from 1973-75 were the last team to win three
with the same nucleus. New York manager Joe Torre looks up to the
Catfish Hunter-Reggie Jackson-Rollie Fingers teams as a standard,
along with the Yankees in the '40s and '50s, and the Big Red
Machine.
	   ``I don't remember the '27 Yankees, but you hear about those
guys a lot,'' the 58-year-old manager said. ``It's tough to look
back at the '27 Yankees and say we're better position by position,
but everything is based on bottom line. ... Since everything is
based on the bottom line, I guess so.''
	   All through September and October, as the wins kept piling up,
more and more Yankees talked about magnitude of the
accomplishments.
	   ``There's going to be a lot of arguments historically about
where this team fits in,'' David Cone said. ``It's the most
professional team, it's the best team in baseball. We've worked
very hard to play professionally, to come out every night. We won
114 games during the regular season, and you don't do that without
being an unbelievably professional team, and I'm very proud to be
part of it.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ The U.S. administration crafted
fresh security proposals Wednesday in an effort to salvage Mideast
peace talks, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``we will
go'' if there was no substantial progress on two key issues. The
Israeli leader set a deadline for late Wednesday night as President
Bill Clinton pondered whether to return to the troubled talks,
which were in their seventh day. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said an Israeli breakoff would be ``unfortunate'' since
``there is a sufficient basis for peace.'' Netanyahu identified the
two stumbling blocks as the Palestine Liberation Organization's
covenant, which contains several anti-Israel provisions, and
whether terrorist suspects would be extradited to Israel. With the
atmosphere souring on the seventh day of the talks, Israel and the
Palestinians exchanged accusations on which side was responsible
for the slow progress in concluding a land-for-peace accord.
(US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ A bell-ringing town crier was sent to
Jesse on Wednesday to call for the injured to return to hospitals,
while state radio announced that the death toll from the fireball
that tore through this southern Nigerian town has risen to 700. The
region's nursing supervisor, D. Omamor, said she knew of 10
patients who had gone home against their doctors' advice, fearing
they would be arrested for gasoline theft if they stayed. She said
she believed there were many more. ``They left on their own
volition,'' said Omamor, who ordered the bell ringer, a man who
lives nearby, to head to Jesse. Like many Nigerians, she used an
initial for her first name. Saturday's explosion occurred while as
many as 1,000 people were trying to scoop up gasoline pouring from
holes in the pipeline. (NIGERIA-EXPLOSION)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The head of British diplomacy ruled
out negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
on Wednesday, saying the international community should not
negotiate ``with people who have the guns.'' British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook also warned Slobodan Milosevic that he is
under close scrutiny to comply with the terms of a peace deal that
the Yugoslav leader signed with NATO. The Western alliance's
deadline for Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo or face
airstrikes ends Oct. 27. Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanians since late February has killed hundreds of people and
forced about 300,000 from their homes. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Four-party talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the Korean peninsula resumed Wednesday after a break of more than
six months, with little sign of progress. South Korean officials
were tightlipped at the end of the day's discussions, saying only
that the talks were businesslike and constructive. North Korean
diplomats had no comment for reporters. The two nations have been
in a technical state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in
an armistice, not a peace treaty. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
The United States and China are participating in the talks.
Switzerland, hosting the meeting in a Geneva conference center,
began the talks by proposing that a cross-border corridor be opened
at the village of Panmunjom to ease distribution of humanitarian
aid to North Korea. (KOREAN TALKS)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Southern African military allies of
embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila began preparing
Wednesday for a prolonged and costly offensive against rebels in
the dense eastern jungles of the country. ``We will not allow ...
(Congo) to fall into the hands of those who have invaded it,''
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said. The announcement could
lead to a major escalation of the conflict that began Aug. 2 with
rebel advances aimed at toppling Kabila. Kabila's allies _ Namibia,
Zimbabwe and Angola _ made the decision Wednesday in Harare. To
date, their forces were concentrated in western Congo. A Congolese
rebel leader warned Kabila's allies to back off. The Congolese
rebels accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and promoting
tribalism. (ZIMBABWE-CONGO)

Leno, Queen Elizabeth, Luciano Pavarotti and unruly air passengers.
Some items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Some people might paint the town red when
the year 2000 rolls around, but people in Sortland might paint the
town blue.
	   The small community in the Vesteraalen Islands off northern
Norway is considering a proposal by four local artists to mark the
new milennium by painting everything some shade of blue _ including
the church, sidewalks and streets.
	   ``It is a lively idea that really engages local people,''
Sortland Mayor Ingolf Markussen was quoted as telling the newspaper
Aftenposten. He said the town council appeared happy with the idea.
	   The report did not say whether Sortland - which means Black Land
in Norwegian _ might also change its name to reflect the proposed
color.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The former wife of Earl Spencer
spoke of her struggles with drugs, alcohol and anorexia in her
first public appearance since her bitter divorce.
	   ``Addiction is a disease,'' Lady Spencer said Tuesday. ``It is
not a respecter of age, color, class or creed, and it causes your
loved ones despair and pain.''
	   The former model Victoria Lockwood spoke at the opening of
Stepping Stones, a rehab center. She has acknowledged suffering
from eating disorders and drug and alcohol problems in the past.
	   Lady Spencer and Princess Diana's brother settled their divorce
out of court in the middle of a trial. She received dlrs 3 million.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Taliban militia's newest enemies are Jay and
Mavis Leno.
	   The host of the TV talk show ``Tonight Show'' and his wife
donated dlrs 100,000 on Wednesday to a campaign to call attention
to the Taliban's restrictions on women.
	   ``Two years ago, women in Afghanistan could work, be educated
and move freely,'' Mrs. Leno said. Since the Taliban took control
in 1996, women have been banned from working and are forbidden to
leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative. Taxi
drivers are beaten if their fare is a woman alone. The Taliban
defend their edicts in the name of Islam.
	   Their donation went to the Feminist Majority Foundation for its
Campaign to Stop Gender Apartheid.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a flourish of trumpets, a shower of fireworks
and glowing words from Queen Elizabeth II, the newly restored
Albert Memorial was unveiled Wednesday night before an audience of
thousands.
	   The 200-foot-high (61-meter-high) marble and gilt tribute to
Queen Victoria's beloved husband Prince Albert _ for many years a
landmark at the edge of Kensington Gardens _ has been wrapped in a
cocoon of scaffolding since 1990, when it was crumbling
dangerously.
	   Some 11 million pounds (dlrs 17 million) later, the Victorian
Gothic edifice, with a re-gilded 14-foot-high (4.3 meter) statue of
the prince at its center, emerged in all its gleaming splendor
Wednesday night.
	   ``This restoration is a triumph,'' the queen declared, standing
on the steps of the memorial to her great-great-grandfather,
designed by architect George Gilbert Scott.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Luciano Pavarotti has pulled out of three
performances at the Metropolitan Opera as he recovers from major
hip and knee surgery.
	   Pavarotti, who had the surgery in July, will miss his scheduled
appearances as Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca'' on Nov. 7, 12 and

More trillion-dollar software troubles loom, experts say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS ALLBRITTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Cyberspace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If you thought the Year 2000 computer bug was
bad, just wait. Other problems that computers may have with dates
and data could cost even more to fix and promise to extend well
into the next century.
	   The much-fretted Y2K problem, which arises from the way
computers keep track of dates using two digits instead of four, is
expected to cost the world between dlrs 600 billion and dlrs 4.6
trillion to fix.
	   Less familiar looming concerns include:
	   _ The European Union's conversion to the new euro currency
starting in a few months;
	   _ The rollover of the date system in Global Positioning System
satellites;
	   _ America's surfeit of telephones for home and office, voice and
data, threatening the possibility that the nation could run out of
phone numbers; and
	   _ Ditto Social Security numbers, which are not used again when
people die.
	   That's the warning of Capers Jones, chief scientist at Artemis
Management Systems Inc. and founder of Software Productivity
Research, which analyzes software development and planning.
	   Starting next year, date and data corrections will dominate the
software industry, said Jones, and the repairs will cost dlrs 5
trillion over the years 1999 to 2050. He predicted these problems,
along with Y2K, will damage the software industry for a generation.
	   ``The best we can hope for is a quick recovery,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; The Euro
	   The European Monetary Union will begin its conversion to the
euro currency Jan. 1, 1999, and union countries are scheduled to
phase out national currencies in 2004.
	   The euro conversion is the second largest software challenge in
the world behind the Y2K problem, said Jones, and it's more
sophisticated. Instead of changing every date in a computer system
with a single deadline looming, computer systems have to be able to
handle the different ways the 11 union countries change over.
Further complicating the problem are individual companies that may
convert completely to conducting business in euros, or they may
continue to track their national currency while simultaneously
using the euro.
	   Ed Severs, chief operating officer for ADPAC Inc., one of the
older companies designing mainframe computer systems, said there
aren't enough programmers to finish both the euro conversion and
the Y2K fix.
	   Jones said about 10 million programs, ranging from Microsoft's
spreadsheet software, Excel, to specialized financial tracking
software, would have to be modified to handle the euro conversion.
	   France and Germany, said Gary Fisher, a computer scientist at
Information Technology Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology, are putting all their resources into
converting to the euro instead of Y2K. ``They're in a fix, I
think,'' he said. ``They're going to be fighting fires
everywhere.''
	   The euro conversion could cost between dlrs 150 billion and dlrs
400 billion spread among the 11 union countries, said Severs. Jones
agreed and said 70 percent of the cost likely would be borne by the
union countries, with the rest falling on companies around the
world that deal with the union and track European currencies.
	   ``If you're a financial institution (doing business in Europe),
you're going to spend between three and five times what you did on
Y2K,'' said Severs.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; GPS satellites
	   In the period between the euro conversion and Jan. 1, 2000, the
belt of 24 satellites making up the Global Positioning System is
programmed to reset its date system. This could cause problems in
navigation and power plants, and even in the calculation of
interest for international financial transactions.
	   The network, run by the Defense Department, allows anyone with a
GPS receiver to pinpoint their position on the Earth to within
about 330 feet (100 meters). The satellites keep track of dates by
measuring the number of weeks elapsed since Jan. 5, 1980. Every
1,024 weeks, the timer resets to zero; that will occur at midnight
Aug. 21, 1999.
	   The satellites use the elapsed week count to account for
variations in the earth's orbit and rotation. That's why civilian
Earth-based receivers, not programmed to handle the rollover, could
have problems determining the location, Fisher said.
	   ``The receivers are going to have to become compliant, either
through a new chip or new software,'' said Fisher. ``And the
satellites that have the problems will have to be replaced.''
	   GPS dates also are used to synchronize some electrical power
plants and large international transfers of funds. Jones worries
that the rollover might cause some plants to quit working, and
interest payments on the transfers could be thrown off.
	   For instance, if it takes a second to transfer dlrs 1 billion
between two banks in different countries, the interest could be a
few hundred dollars. But if one of the banks, relying on the GPS
satellites, hasn't planned for the date rollover, its computers
could think the transfer took 20 years. The interest could be off
by trillions of dollars in that case.
	   Because the rollover's timing, computer systems handling large
financial systems will need to be checked for euro, GPS date and
Y2K compliance all at the same time.
	   ``It's in the international standards, so it shouldn't be a
surprise,'' said Jones. ``But Year 2000 should have been obvious,
too.''

	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Phone numbers
	   Last year, Arkansas gained a new area code after decades of a
single code. In January this year, western Massachusetts gained a
new one as well. And new area codes seem to pop up weekly in the
San Francisco area, ground zero for the use of multiple phone lines
in the home.
	   Usually, a new area code is a minor annoyance, necessitating
minor costs in reprinting stationery and business cards. But in
about 10 years, the number of phone lines needed will exceed the
capacity of a three-digit area code with a seven digit phone
number. Jones suggests a five digit area code and a nine-digit
phone number to allow up for to a trillion individual phone lines _
enough for several phone numbers for every person on the planet.
	   Problem solved? Nope. Millions of software applications in the
United States can handle only three-figure area code and
seven-figure phone number. To upgrade them all will be cumbersome
and expensive.
	   Any lengthening of the phone number probably won't be a problem
for telecommunications and directory companies, Jones said, but
large private and corporate phone lists will have to be updated.
This could be a problem if the program is configured to accept only
the current format.
	   Jones estimates about 25 million software applications will need
to be fixed.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Social Security
	   And if all that wasn't enough, the United States might run out
of Social Security numbers.
	   Numbers assigned to U.S. citizens are not reused once someone
dies. The current nine-digit system provides a maximum of about 1
billion numbers. Since 1936, when the first number was issued, more
than 381 million numbers have been assigned, with about 6 million
new ones issued each year.
	   It's easy to add a digit, but thousands of computer programs
that expect nine-digit numbers will have to be modified. Cost?
Equal that of the Y2K bug in the United States, Jones figures.
	   The grandchildren of today's programmers will be solving that
one, when the current numbers run out around 2075.

	   NES TSIONA, Israel (AP) _ A horse whinnied behind an
electrified, barbed-wire fence that protects the Israel Institute
for Biological Research, a cluster of low buildings hidden by
trees.
	   The institute's official Internet site says its researchers
develop veterinary medicines.
	   That explains the horses, but not the barbed wire.
	   Recent developments have fueled new speculation that the
top-secret facility makes biological and chemical weapons.
	   On Oct. 1, government officials confirmed an Israeli cargo plane
that crashed in the Netherlands six years ago was carrying a
shipment for the institute of a chemical that can be used in the
manufacture of nerve gas.
	   While conceding that the chemical, dimethyl methylphosphonate,
can be used to make sarin gas, officials said the shipment was
going to be used for testing gas mask filters.
	   A week before that announcement, the government dropped plans to
expand the institute, apparently to avoid a high-publicity court
battle with residents of Nes Tsiona fearful of a toxic spill. Now
the mayor, Yossi Shevo, wants the facility removed from his town of
30,000 people, which is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Tel
Aviv.
	   Many in Nes Tsiona are uneasy about their mysterious neighbor.
	   ``It would be better if it were somewhere else, not next to a
city,'' said Alon Kedem, a salesman in a toy store in a shopping
center across the street from the institute.
	   Israel's government has done its best to keep the institute out
of the news, with the military censor restricting reporting by
Israel-based journalists.
	   During a recent tour by journalists and town officials along the
perimeter road around the institute fence, a patrol vehicle inside
the barrier screeched to a halt. A young Israeli, solid, crewcut,
wearing the loose gray jacket that is the trademark of government
security guards, peered through aviator-style sunglasses at the
group.
	   Within 15 minutes, three more security vehicles drove by for a
look. Even in security-conscious Israel, that is not standard
procedure for a horse hospital.
	   An Associated Press request to the Defense Ministry for
permission to tour the facility was ignored.
	   A government spokesman, Moshe Fogel, said the institute
``produces medicines and antidotes for poisoning from chemical
weapons.''
	   He said there have been many false reports about the institute,
but ``beyond that we haven't been saying anything'' about the
alleged production of weapons material there.
	   The state has said the institute employs about 300 people, 120
of them scientists in the fields of biology, biochemistry,
biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, pharmacology, physics and
environmental sciences.
	   According to institute documents quoted by the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, the institute has manufactured small amounts of nerve gas
for experimental purposes. Laboratory animals were injected with
the poison, the report said.
	   Yiftach Shapir, an expert on chemical and biological warfare at
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said,
``Even if you don't make chemical or biological weapons as weapons,
you need small quantities to produce and test antidotes.''
	   Having small quantities of dangerous agents for research
purposes would make the institute no more threatening than an
ordinary pharmaceutical factory manufacturing vaccines, he said.
	   Foreign newspaper reports, quoted widely in Israel, have gone
much further.
	   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot, citing a foreign report, wrote of
hundreds of bottles of deadly anthrax toxin being stored in
refrigerators at the institute.
	   The Sunday Times of London said the institute produced the
poison gas used in Jordan a year ago in a botched Israeli attempt
to assassinate a leader of the militant Hamas group. It also made
the antidote that saved him after the two Israeli assassins were
captured, the Times said.
	   In September, the institute's former deputy director, Marcus
Klingberg, was released from jail for health reasons after serving
15 years of a 20-year sentence for passing state secrets to the
Soviet Union. But the 80-year-old scientist is still considered a
security risk because of his knowledge and remains under
round-the-clock surveillance.
	   Government secrecy about the institute has not prevented concern
from building.
	   In August, Yediot Ahronot splashed a picture of a man wearing a
gas mask on the cover of its weekend magazine and headlined in
large type, ``The Next Disaster,'' for a story warning of
widespread casualties if germs leaked out of the institute.
	   In his petition to the Supreme Court, Nes Tsiona's mayor wrote
that the institute conducts research ``in the area of biological
weapons and manufactures ... violent bacteria, which constitute a
danger to the lives of the people living in the vicinity of the
institute.''
	   Not everyone is worried.
	   Zvi Naim, who grew up in a little house just across from the
institute, said the reports about the goings-on inside never
bothered him.
	   ``You see,'' he joked, ``I haven't sprouted horns, and neither
have my children.''

NASA's ion-propulsion spacecraft worthy of ``Star Trek''

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ NASA is about to launch a
spacecraft worthy of ``Star Trek'' _ Deep Space 1, a small but
smart, self-navigating probe that will be propelled all the way to
an asteroid by an ion engine.
	   It's the opening act in NASA's New Millennium program.
	   ``This is the first Star Trek-y thing that NASA has done,'' says
Curt Cleven, deputy spacecraft systems manager for Deep Space 1.
``It's the first time we're really trying something out of the
ordinary.''
	   The goal is to test technologies too new and risky to fly on
science missions, yet which could lead to smaller, faster and
cheaper spacecraft in the future.
	   Twelve such technologies will soar with Deep Space 1; launch is
targeted for Saturday. Perhaps the most intriguing, and futuristic,
are the ion-propulsion engine and autonomous navigation system.
	   ``These two technologies are like having your car find its own
way from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles, arrive at a designated
parking space and do it all while getting 300 miles per gallon (128
kilometers per liter),'' says Marc Rayman, chief engineer and
deputy mission manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California.
	   Rayman first heard about ion propulsion in a 1968 episode of
``Star Trek.'' An alien spacecraft uses advanced ion propulsion,
impressing the crew of the faster-than-the-speed-of-light starship
Enterprise.
	   In the much slower real world, solar-powered ion engines are 10
times more efficient than traditional chemical engines. In other
words, they require only one-tenth the amount of fuel, which allows
for lighter spacecraft and therefore smaller (i.e. cheaper)
launchers.
	   A small Delta rocket costing a modest dlrs 43 million, for
instance, will launch the 1,080-pound (490-kilogram) Deep Space 1
on its one- to three-year mission. The Delta's third stage will
boot the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and put it on a perpetual
sun-orbiting course.
	   The ion engine, once it's running, will provide the extra kick
needed for Deep Space 1 to meet up with asteroid 1992 KD next July.
	   That extra kick will be light yet long.
	   The thrust of an ion engine is 10,000 times weaker than that
generated by typical interplanetary spacecraft. Hold a piece of
paper, Rayman says, and that's how light the thrust of an ion
engine would feel.
	   The farther Deep Space 1 gets from the sun _ which provides the
power that drives the engine _ the lower the thrust. Because of the
constant acceleration, however, the spacecraft can zoom along at
incredibly high speeds after months and even years.
	   ``It's what I like to call acceleration with patience,'' says
Rayman.
	   Deep Space 1's ion engine will run on 180 pounds (82 kilograms)
of xenon gas. Here's how it will work:
	   The colorless, inert gas is bombarded by electrons that knock
away one of the 54 electrons orbiting the nucleus of each atom of
xenon. This leaves each atom one electron short, resulting in
positively charged ions.
	   The xenon ions are drawn toward high-voltage grids at the open
end of the engine and expelled into space at a speed of more than
62,000 mph (100,000 kph). They're mixed with electrons again to
neutralize their electrical charge and protect the spacecraft from
shorting out or the engine from shutting down.
	   This glowing blue stream of xenon ions, traveling fantastically
fast, is what provides the push.
	   To provide enough solar power for the ion engine, Deep Space 1
is outfitted with a pair of newfangled solar wings. Some 720
silicone lenses on the exterior of the wings will focus sunlight
onto the 3,600 solar cells below, vastly improving efficiency.
	   ``Ion propulsion, if it works and we think it will ... it's a
whole new way to get someplace a lot faster,'' Cleven says.
	   The estimated 10-year trip to unexplored Pluto, for instance,
could be reduced by at least a couple of years with ion propulsion.
	   While ion engines have flown before _ they're helping, for
example, to maintain the position of some high-orbiting
communication satellites _ this will be the first use of such an
engine as the primary propulsion for a deep-space mission.
	   Cautious ground controllers will wait a week or two before
firing up Deep Space 1's ion engine. They'll try a variety of
throttle settings, then suspend operations for a few weeks to
evaluate the data. If all goes well, the engine will begin
thrusting again six weeks after launch.
	   After this initial shakedown phase, Deep Space 1's motto will
be: Don't call me. I'll call you.
	   In the first such test, the spacecraft will find its own way to
asteroid 1992 KD and attempt to pass within six miles (9.6
kilometers) of the two- to three-mile-diameter (3- to
5-kilometer-diameter) rock.
	   Deep Space 1 will determine its place in the solar system by
taking pictures of known asteroids and comparing their positions to
background stars. The orbits of 250 asteroids and the positions of
250,000 stars will be stored in its computer memory.
	   What's more, Deep Space 1 will take charge of some of its own
commanding thanks to artificial intelligence in the autonomous
navigation system, reminding itself when to turn, take pictures and
change the throttle settings, among other things.
	   And in another experiment, the spacecraft will keep Earth posted
of its health and whereabouts, periodically radioing back one of
four tones.

	   No. 1, the so-called green tone, means ``All is well, leave me
alone.'' No. 2 means ``I've got some data, how about scheduling a
hookup via NASA's Deep Space Network sometime soon.'' No. 3 means
``I've had a problem, better take a look.'' No. 4 is the emergency
red alert: SOS.
	   Such a straightforward monitoring system requires a relatively
small antenna on Earth and thereby frees up the congested Deep
Space Network of giant antennas for other uses, says Rayman. It
also reduces the number of ground controllers needed to run a
mission, further cutting costs.
	   Rayman estimates fewer than 40 controllers will be needed during
the early part of the Deep Space 1 mission, primarily to validate
the experimental technologies. That compares to a cast of hundreds
on some deep-space missions.
	   Deep Space 1 was developed in three years, practically no time
at all by NASA standards. What's more, the entire mission _
spacecraft, rocket and nearly a year of flight operations _ is
budgeted at dlrs 152 million, a bargain compared to the behemoth
projects of yesteryear.
	   The cost will jump another dlrs 15 million if NASA extends the
mission beyond September 1999, enabling Deep Space 1 to fly past
one and maybe two comets in 2001.
	   Any scientific observations of the asteroid or comets will be
``pure bonus,'' says Rayman. Only a few million dollars, as a
matter of fact, is targeted for science.
	   ``The real science return from Deep Space 1 is in the future
missions that are enabled by the technologies that we're
carrying,'' Rayman says. ``We're taking the risks so that the
future missions don't have to.''

Study finds exercise reduces stroke risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Being active in middle age sets good health
habits that apparently pay off in a reduced risk of stroke in the
retirement years.
	   Paradoxically, however, being very active seems to make some of
that benefit go away. And researchers admit they don't know why.
	   ``Higher levels (of exercise) did not appear to add benefit,''
said I-Min Lee of the Harvard School of Public Health. ``With
higher levels, the benefit somewhat tapered.''
	   Lee and Dr. Ralph S. Paffenbarger Jr., a renowned Stanford
University researcher, looked at the health histories of 11,130
male Harvard alumni with an average age of 58, who reported in 1977
on their physical activity levels.
	   The study, one of the relatively few to focus on physical
activity and the risk of stroke, is in the October issue of the
American Heart Association journal Stroke.
	   Researchers found the more active alumni were less likely to
have had a stroke by 1988. By then, the alumni would have been in
the high-risk age range _ strokes are most common among people 65
and older.
	   The study was able to tell how much activity had the biggest
payoff. People who burned 2,000-3,000 calories a week reduced their
risk by 46 percent, compared with those who got little or no
activity. Those who burned 1,000-2,000 calories weekly reduced
their risk 24 percent.
	   To burn 1,000 calories, a person could, for instance, walk
briskly for 30 minutes, 5 days a week. To double the calories
burned, the person would have to double the time or distance.
	   But something unexpected happened as activity levels hit 3,000
calories and higher _ benefits fell back. Burning 3,000-4,000
calories reduced the risk only 22 percent, and burning 4,000
calories or more had only an 18 percent reduction.

 &UR; Ring found on Outer Banks may help solve mystery of Lost
Colony,0691
	   BUXTON, North Carolina (AP) _ Archaeologists have found more
evidence they say suggests members of the Lost Colony may have
joined American Indians living on the Outer Banks.
	   A 16th-century gold signet ring recently unearthed is a new clue
in the 400-year-old mystery of Roanoke Island settlements, a
veteran archaeologist said Oct. 13.
	   ``This is the first direct tie-in we'd had with the Roanoke
colonies,'' said David Phelps, director of the East Carolina
University Coastal Archaeology Office.
	   The ring, bearing a depiction of a lion, was sifted from sand
taken from 4 feet down in an archaeological excavation pit on
Hatteras Island. Sir Walter Raleigh's settlements of 1585 and 1587
were located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north on Roanoke
Island.
	   Settlers under the leadership of John White mysteriously
disappeared after he left them to get more supplies from England.
Upon his return in 1591 he found the letters ``Croatoan'' carved on
a tree. Many theorized the settlers joined the Croatan Indians on
Hatteras Island.
	   But others believe the settlers died from disease or were killed
by American Indians as described on stone tablets found in the late
1930s.

 &UR; Franklin Institute awards dlrs 250,000 prize to California
professor
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ A California university chancellor who
researched the ``greenhouse effect,'' the inventor of the computer
mouse and a famed linguistics professor are among 10 people honored
for their achievements.
	   The Franklin Institute, a Philadelphia science museum, made the
announcement Oct. 12. It plans to laud nine scientists and a
business executive at its annual award ceremony on April 29.
	   Ralph Cicerone, chancellor of the University of California,
Irvine, was awarded dlrs 250,000 for the museum's 1999 Bower Award
and Prize for Achievement in Science, according to Franklin
Institute president and CEO Dennis M. Wint. The award recognizes
Cicerone's research on greenhouse gases and the depletion of the
earth's ozone layer.
	   The Franklin Medals in Computer and Cognitive Science will be
awarded to Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for his analysis of human and computer language, and
Douglas C. Engelbart of the Bootstrap Institute in Fremont,
California, who invented the computer mouse.
	   P. Roy Vagelos, the former chairman of the board and CEO of
Merck and Co. Inc., will receive the 1999 Bower Award in Business
Leadership, for his work to combat ``river blindness,'' a disease
spread by contaminated water in developing countries.

 &UR; Study: Giving antidepressant through skin patch may offer fast
relief
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Depressed people who got an antidepressant
through a skin patch showed unusually fast relief, a researcher
says.
	   The effect was apparent one week into a study, while
antidepressants generally require two weeks or more to take effect,
said researcher Dr. Alexander Bodkin of McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Massachusetts. A one-week response is unusual but not unheard of in
antidepressant studies, he said.
	   Prior studies have shown that antidepressants work faster if
injected than if swallowed, Bodkin said.
	   He stressed that the new findings are only preliminary and must
be duplicated in another study, which has already begun. Bodkin
said in a telephone interview that he hasn't formally reported the
result or written it up yet for a journal. The study was financed
by the drug's manufacturer.
	   Participants put on a new patch every day. Eighty-nine
participants wore patches containing the drug Eldepryl, which is
approved in the United States for treating Parkinson's disease but
is also sometimes used in depression. Eighty-eight others wore
patches without any drug.
	   At one week, and generally throughout the six-week study, people
wearing the drug-containing patch showed about 50 percent more
improvement than the other participants, Bodkin said. There was no
difference in reported side effects, he said.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Teams of medical workers were being
shuttled in to help overwhelmed hospitals deal with the aftermath
of a weekend pipeline inferno in this southwest Nigeria town, while
state radio raised the death toll to 700.
	   A Red Cross health team arrived Wednesday in Jesse, 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, and a bell-ringing town
crier was sent to call for the injured to return to hospitals short
on medicine and doctors.
	   Supplies began arriving from the United Nations' children's
organization and Israeli doctors were also flying in to help treat
the injured from the explosion, which occurred Saturday while as
many as 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling from
the pipeline.
	   State radio raised the death toll to 700. The Lagos-based
newspaper Daily Express also reported at least 700 deaths, citing
police who said about 200 people injured in the original explosion
Saturday had since died.
	   The toll could reach 1,000, said J.I. Ogude, the village chief
of Jesse, a scattered, poor town of about 12,000 people, most
either cassava farmers or small traders.
	   Counting the dead as well as the injured remained a frustrating
task. Many people were burying their family members secretly,
fearing the possibility of arrest for either causing the fire or
for scavenging gas.
	   It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government
officials have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off,
while some news reports have blamed a lit cigarette.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges,
and no arrests have been made. While authorities have prosecuted
some pipeline saboteurs in the past, the reactions in Jesse
appeared to be rooted in a small-town fear of authority.
	   To overcome those fears, local health workers sent a town crier
into Jesse on Wednesday, telling people they would not be arrested
and promising free medical treatment.
	   ``We cannot force them to stay in hospitals,'' said D. Omamor,
the chief nursing officer for the region, who ordered the bell
ringer to head for Jesse. ``They left on their own volition.''
	   Red Cross medical worker Collins Ezewu said his team was trying
to help treat the wounded in hospitals and persuade those suffering
at home to seek professional care.
	   ``We were shocked to learn that some injured people fled from
the hospital,'' Ezewu said.
	   Some of the injured were being treated at home, without the
benefit of medicine or painkillers.
	   ``People are running away,'' said Jacob Emogho, a Jesse
resident. ``People are afraid to talk to any strangers.'' Emogho
said some of his neighbors had secretly buried relatives, fearing
prosecution.
	   Many people in this farming community refused to talk to
reporters and fled when strangers stopped at their homes. Those
that would talk denied involvement in the scavenging.
	   ``I did not go to take petrol,'' said Samuel Aminone, who has
burns over 60 percent of his body and was being comforted by nurses
at Eku General Hospital. He said he was searching for his sister _
who died in the explosion _ when the blast occurred.
	   ``If it was petrol I went for you would not see me today,'' he
said.
	   At least 400 people have been buried in mass graves dug about
100 yards (meters) from the blast scene, authorities said.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the flames, and were waiting
nearby for the thousands of gallons (liters) of fuel to burn out in
the Jesse section of the pipeline. The entire pipeline runs for
nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles), from the southeastern city of
Warri to the northern city of Kano.
	   For the poverty-stricken people of the Niger River delta region,
the spilling gasoline appeared a chance for quick profits.
	   Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria
remains a fuel-starved country and its petroleum industry is
hobbled by corruption and mismanagement. Refineries are in
desperate need of repair, black-market gasoline is often marked up
1,000 percent. Lines at gas pumps can last for days.
	   In other parts of southeastern Nigeria, ethnic Ijaw youths have
attacked Western oil installations in recent weeks, demanding
schools, better roads and political representation. The Jesse fire
was not believed to be related to those incidents.

Four-party talks on Korea resume with little hope of progress

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Four-party talks on a permanent peace treaty for
the Korean peninsula resumed after a break of more than six months,
with little sign of progress.
	   South Korean officials were tightlipped at the end of
Wednesday's discussions, saying only that the talks were
businesslike and constructive. North Korean diplomats had no
comment for reporters.
	   The two nations have been in a technical state of war since the
1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Their
border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2 million
troops deployed on both sides.
	   The United States and China are participating in the talks, and
U.S. diplomats continued meeting with North Korean officials into
the evening Wednesday.
	   Switzerland, hosting the meeting in a Geneva conference center,
began the talks by proposing that a cross-border corridor be opened
at the village of Panmunjom to ease distribution of humanitarian
aid to North Korea.
	   Decades of economic mismanagement, aggravated by three years of
flooding and drought, have led to chronic food shortages in the
North. The country's reclusive, communist leadership has since
relied on outside aid to help feed its 23 million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured North Korea this summer said 2 million
North Koreans may have died in a famine.
	   ``The four-party talks have great importance for the peace and
stability in and around the Korean peninsula,'' said South Korean
delegation leader Park Kun-woo.
	   However, chances of a breakthrough seemed limited.
	   Last week North Korea reiterated its demands that the main
agenda focus on a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea and the
signing of a peace treaty with the United States.
	   Two previous rounds of talks, in November and March, broke down
over the same demands.
	   Officials told reporters that the North Korean delegation
brought up the issue again at Wednesday's talks.
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the removal
of the 37,000 U.S. troops can be discussed. However, Seoul doesn't
want the withdrawal to be a formal agenda item.
	   For their part, the United States and South Korea have ruled out
discussions on a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang.
Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty should be signed
between the two Koreas.
	   Pyongyang blamed the United States after the talks broke down in
March and only agreed to resume the negotiations as part of a
package deal with Washington last month.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Athletes who try to sue their way onto U.S.
Olympic teams will find it more difficult because of a change in
the federal law governing amateur sports.
	   The amendments to the 1978 Amateur Sports Act were passed by the
House and Senate as part of the budget bill and was signed by
President Clinton on Wednesday.
	   U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens sponsored the changes, which bar courts
from issuing injunctions against the U.S. Olympic Committee over
athlete participation within 21 days of the start of the Olympics,
Paralympics or Pan American Games if the committee formally
declares it cannot settle the dispute in time.
	   Such a measure could have saved the committee from one of its
most embarrassing moments: allowing Tonya Harding to compete in the
1994 Winter Games after the figure skater filed a dlrs 25 million
lawsuit against the committee just days before the event began.
	   The amendments also:
	   _ Add the Paralympics to include disabled athletes in the
legislation.
	   _ Make Olympic committee rules on athlete participation in
committee decision-making federal law.
	   _ Strengthen due-process provisions.
	   _ Require the committee to hire an ombudsman to help athletes
with questions about their rights to compete.
	   _ Give the Olympic committee trademark protection for the
Pan-American Games, Paralympics, and symbols associated with each.
	   _ Change the name of the law to the Olympic and Amateur Sports
Act.
	   ``It benefits the athletes, the national governing bodies, the
disabled sports organizations and everybody under the umbrella of
the United States Olympic organization,'' said Trevor McCabe,
Stevens' legislative director.

Heavy losses at Rover threaten British car plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ BMW-owned car manufacturer Rover
Group is suffering heavy losses and wants to eliminate 2,400 jobs
in Britain, labor union representatives said.
	   In a joint message to workers on Wednesday, several unions said
urgent talks had been held with BMW to avert a closure of Rover's
huge plant at Longbridge in Birmingham, which employs 14,000
people.
	   ``Without major surgery to cut costs immediately, via
significant job losses alongside cuts to employment-related and
other costs, there will not be a supportable survival plan to place
before the BMW board,'' the unions said, and the future of the
plant remained ``in the balance.''
	   Rover Group could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
	   The company has become more productive since BMW bought it from
British Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has
made its automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while
making imported cars cheaper for British consumers.
	   Government Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson said he
would meet Thursday morning with Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of
BMW, and Rover chairman Walter Hasselkus, but that Rover's fate
rested in its own hands.
	   ``Ultimately it is for the company to rise to the challenge and
to ensure that Rover continues to thrive in the global
marketplace,'' Mandleson said in the House of Commons.
	   Union leader Tony Woodley said, ``The company have made it clear
that they are sustaining losses that are completely unacceptable
and ... it is their intention to try and cut costs in a number of
areas as soon as possible.''
	   Woodley, the Transport and General Workers Union motor industry
leader, said the unions were looking at ways to assist in cutting
costs but that they ``can't and won't accept,'' closure of
Longbridge.
	   In July, Rover said it would cut jobs by the end of the year in
all areas of its business except research, design and engineering.
It also said it was planning to start buying hundreds of millions
of dollars in components from abroad.
	   At the time, Rover said it hoped to reduce the work force
through voluntary and early retirements without resorting to forced
layoffs.
	   Rover has not specified how much money the unfavorable currency
rates has cost it, but British news reports have placed the figure
at around $330 million yearly.

More trillion-dollar software troubles loom, experts say

 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slugline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If you thought the Year 2000 computer bug was
bad, just wait. Other problems that computers may have with dates
and data could cost even more to fix and promise to extend well
into the next century.
	   The much-fretted Y2K problem, which arises from the way
computers keep track of dates using two digits instead of four, is
expected to cost the world between dlrs 600 billion and dlrs 4.6
trillion to fix.
	   Less familiar looming concerns include:
	   _ The European Union's conversion to the new euro currency
starting in a few months;
	   _ The rollover of the date system in Global Positioning System
satellites;
	   _ America's surfeit of telephones for home and office, voice and
data, threatening the possibility that the nation could run out of
phone numbers; and
	   _ Ditto Social Security numbers, which are not used again when
people die.
	   That's the warning of Capers Jones, chief scientist at Artemis
Management Systems Inc. and founder of Software Productivity
Research, which analyzes software development and planning.
	   Starting next year, date and data corrections will dominate the
software industry, said Jones, and the repairs will cost dlrs 5
trillion over the years 1999 to 2050. He predicted these problems,
along with Y2K, will damage the software industry for a generation.
	   ``The best we can hope for is a quick recovery,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; The Euro
	   The European Monetary Union will begin its conversion to the
euro currency Jan. 1, 1999, and union countries are scheduled to
phase out national currencies in 2004.
	   The euro conversion is the second largest software challenge in
the world behind the Y2K problem, said Jones, and it's more
sophisticated. Instead of changing every date in a computer system
with a single deadline looming, computer systems have to be able to
handle the different ways the 11 union countries change over.
Further complicating the problem are individual companies that may
convert completely to conducting business in euros, or they may
continue to track their national currency while simultaneously
using the euro.
	   Ed Severs, chief operating officer for ADPAC Inc., one of the
older companies designing mainframe computer systems, said there
aren't enough programmers to finish both the euro conversion and
the Y2K fix.
	   Jones said about 10 million programs, ranging from Microsoft's
spreadsheet software, Excel, to specialized financial tracking
software, would have to be modified to handle the euro conversion.
	   France and Germany, said Gary Fisher, a computer scientist at
Information Technology Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology, are putting all their resources into
converting to the euro instead of Y2K. ``They're in a fix, I
think,'' he said. ``They're going to be fighting fires
everywhere.''
	   The euro conversion could cost between dlrs 150 billion and dlrs
400 billion spread among the 11 union countries, said Severs. Jones
agreed and said 70 percent of the cost likely would be borne by the
union countries, with the rest falling on companies around the
world that deal with the union and track European currencies.
	   ``If you're a financial institution (doing business in Europe),
you're going to spend between three and five times what you did on
Y2K,'' said Severs.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; GPS satellites
	   In the period between the euro conversion and Jan. 1, 2000, the
belt of 24 satellites making up the Global Positioning System is
programmed to reset its date system. This could cause problems in
navigation and power plants, and even in the calculation of
interest for international financial transactions.
	   The network, run by the Defense Department, allows anyone with a
GPS receiver to pinpoint their position on the Earth to within
about 330 feet (100 meters). The satellites keep track of dates by
measuring the number of weeks elapsed since Jan. 5, 1980. Every
1,024 weeks, the timer resets to zero; that will occur at midnight
Aug. 21, 1999.
	   The satellites use the elapsed week count to account for
variations in the earth's orbit and rotation. That's why civilian
Earth-based receivers, not programmed to handle the rollover, could
have problems determining the location, Fisher said.
	   ``The receivers are going to have to become compliant, either
through a new chip or new software,'' said Fisher. ``And the
satellites that have the problems will have to be replaced.''
	   GPS dates also are used to synchronize some electrical power
plants and large international transfers of funds. Jones worries
that the rollover might cause some plants to quit working, and
interest payments on the transfers could be thrown off.
	   For instance, if it takes a second to transfer dlrs 1 billion
between two banks in different countries, the interest could be a
few hundred dollars. But if one of the banks, relying on the GPS
satellites, hasn't planned for the date rollover, its computers
could think the transfer took 20 years. The interest could be off
by trillions of dollars in that case.
	   Because the rollover's timing, computer systems handling large
financial systems will need to be checked for euro, GPS date and
Y2K compliance all at the same time.
	   ``It's in the international standards, so it shouldn't be a
surprise,'' said Jones. ``But Year 2000 should have been obvious,
too.''

	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Phone numbers
	   Last year, Arkansas gained a new area code after decades of a
single code. In January this year, western Massachusetts gained a
new one as well. And new area codes seem to pop up weekly in the
San Francisco area, ground zero for the use of multiple phone lines
in the home.
	   Usually, a new area code is a minor annoyance, necessitating
minor costs in reprinting stationery and business cards. But in
about 10 years, the number of phone lines needed will exceed the
capacity of a three-digit area code with a seven digit phone
number. Jones suggests a five digit area code and a nine-digit
phone number to allow up for to a trillion individual phone lines _
enough for several phone numbers for every person on the planet.
	   Problem solved? Nope. Millions of software applications in the
United States can handle only three-figure area code and
seven-figure phone number. To upgrade them all will be cumbersome
and expensive.
	   Any lengthening of the phone number probably won't be a problem
for telecommunications and directory companies, Jones said, but
large private and corporate phone lists will have to be updated.
This could be a problem if the program is configured to accept only
the current format.
	   Jones estimates about 25 million software applications will need
to be fixed.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Social Security
	   And if all that wasn't enough, the United States might run out
of Social Security numbers.
	   Numbers assigned to U.S. citizens are not reused once someone
dies. The current nine-digit system provides a maximum of about 1
billion numbers. Since 1936, when the first number was issued, more
than 381 million numbers have been assigned, with about 6 million
new ones issued each year.
	   It's easy to add a digit, but thousands of computer programs
that expect nine-digit numbers will have to be modified. Cost?
Equal that of the Y2K bug in the United States, Jones figures.
	   The grandchildren of today's programmers will be solving that
one, when the current numbers run out around 2075.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With street protests, pressure on
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to mount
Wednesday from within the premier's own political camp against a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.
	   Hardliners from Netanyahu's coalition government and leaders of
the powerful Jewish settler lobby vowed to bring down Netanyahu if
he signed a deal at a Mideast summit outside of Washington.
	   The threats indicated that the prime minister would likely face
a political storm on his return home and could be behind
Netanyahu's hard bargaining tactics at the summit.
	   Israel media reported that Netanyahu was even considering
calling a snap election, a move which would hurt his smaller
partners at the polls and signal that he would not be pushed
around.
	   Wednesday, dozens of Jewish settlers, some draped in white
prayer shawls and waving Israeli flags, blocked major West Bank
highways, forcing Palestinians to use side roads.
	   Some settlers held their morning prayers at the roadside,
carrying holy books and swaying rhythmically back and forth, as is
customary among observant Jews.
	   ``We are here to show this is a Jewish country and should not be
given away to non-Jews,'' said one settler, Shai Ben-Tekoa as he
stood by the side of a road near the West Bank city of Hebron.
Settlers planned similar, larger street protests for Thursday.
	   A large majority of Netanyahu's government is sympathetic with
the settler movement, which helped get Netanyahu elected in 1996
based on his campaign promises to slow down the peace process begun
by his predecessors.
	   But with a deal still on the table at the summit in eastern
Maryland for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank, Netanyahu's greatest supports have started to turn on him
quickly.
	   A 17-member right-wing faction inside his coalition has control
of enough seats to topple Netanyahu's narrow 61 majority in the 120
seat Knesset.
	   Noting the premier's 49th birthday Wednesday, Nissan Smolianski,
a legislator from the National Religious Party in Netanyahu's
coalition said, ``I hope he will remember this birthday as the day
his government ended.''
	   Jewish settlers have led Israel's opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords and vehemently oppose handing
any land to the Palestinians. When Israel withdrew from two-thirds
of the Gaza Strip and one-third of the West Bank under the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, thousands of settlers joined street
protests. Rabin was later assassinated by a religious Jew who
opposed his land-for-peace policies.
	   Israeli hardliners who helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996
have warned that they will return to the streets if he transfers
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   But early elections could block that. Most of Netanyahu's
coalition parties would be ill prepared to head to the polls so
soon, especially the newly formed 17-member Land of Israel Front.
By reducing the political threats, Netanyahu would be left facing
the moderate Labor party, which wrote the historic 1993 peace
accords with Yasser Arafat's PLO.
	   On Wednesday, Labor announced it would join forces with other
dovish parties in the Knesset and curtail chances of toppling the
premier by providing him with a parliamentary safety net on issues
of peace.
	   An early election could also bring Netanyahu and Labor together
in a unity government, a scenario long considered to be Netanyahu's
best chance to pass peace agreements and remain in power.

Astronomers find dusty disk around star similar to solar system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Astronomers have detected for the first time a
disk of debris orbiting a sun-like star paired with a planet. They
said this combination of features in the constellation Cancer looks
more like our solar system than any yet found.
	   The orbiting disk is made up of dust, comets and other cosmic
leftovers, and it extends for billions of miles (kilometers) beyond
the star known as 55 Cancri.
	   Astronomers at the University of Arizona who discovered the disk
said it is very similar in size and composition to the Kuiper Belt
in our solar system. The Kuiper Belt begins beyond the orbit of
Pluto about 5 billion miles from the Sun and extends into deep
space.
	   ``And, for all we know, there could be other similarities in
this system yet to be discovered,'' said David E. Trilling.
Trilling and planetary scientist Robert E. Brown report on the disk
in the Thursday issue of the journal Nature.
	   The star, about the same size and age as the sun, is located
about 40 light years away. Two years ago, scientists at San
Francisco State University detected a gravity-induced wobble in the
star's motion.
	   They calculated that the wobble was the result of a planet that
probably has 1.9 times the mass of Jupiter. The planet is 50 times
closer to its star than Jupiter is to the sun, making direct
observation impossible.
	   In observations last February, the Arizona team attached a
special instrument to a telescope atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, that
blocked intense starlight coming from 55 Cancri. It allowed them to
examine the infrared radiation reflected by the dust disk without
interference from the star.
	   In recent years at least a dozen planets have been found in
orbit of distant stars. All are the size of Jupiter or larger, and
none is ``Earth-like.'' But their existence strongly suggests the
existence of smaller planets potentially more friendly to life.
	   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now
considering 30 proposals to search specifically for Earth-like
planets. Trilling said 55 Cancri might be the most promising.

Children increasingly victims of war: Two million killed since
</HEADLINE>
1987 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Children are increasingly the innocent
victims of war: Two million have been killed since 1987, six
million have been seriously injured or permanently disabled, and
300,000 are currently fighting in government or rebel armies,
according to a U.N. report released Wednesday.
	   ``Not only are millions of children still the victims of war,
far too often they are its principal targets and even its
instruments,'' the U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict,
Olara Otunnu, said in his first annual report.
	   Children are suffering from the effects of armed conflict in
approximately 50 countries, and fighting is still continuing in
about 30 of these countries, he said in a news conference.
	   ``From Sierra Leone to Tajikistan, from Liberia to Cambodia,
from the Sudan to Kosovo, from Sri Lanka to Afghanistan, millions
of children are being robbed of their childhood and left with
mangled lives,'' Otunnu said.
	   An alarming trend, he said, is the growing use of child
soldiers.
	   The number of children under the age of 18 serving as combatants
in government armed forces or armed opposition groups in ongoing
conflicts is estimated to have increased from 250,000 some 2 1/2
years ago to 300,000 today, Otunnu said.
	   ``Many more are being used in indirect ways that are more
difficult to measure, such as cooks, messengers and porters.
Children have also been used for mine clearance, spying and suicide
bombing,'' he said.
	   The development and proliferation of lightweight automatic
weapons has made it possible for very young children to bear and
use arms, he noted.
	   Otunnu said he is working to mobilize public opinion and
political pressure ``against this terrible trend.''
	   He is backing efforts to raise the legal age for military
recruitment and participation in hostilities to 18 years _ and to
make the recruitment of children under the age of 15 and their
participation in armed conflicts a war crime.
	   The U.N. envoy accused governments of ignoring international
treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which
calls for the protection of children's right to life, education,
health and other fundamental needs.
	   ``These provisions apply equally in times of armed conflict and
in times of peace. However, the value of these provisions is
limited to the extent to which they are applied. Words on paper
cannot save children in peril,'' he said.
	   Otunnu noted that children are being affected by armed conflict
in many other ways.
	   Children constitute well over 50 percent of the 24 million
people who are either refugees or internally displaced in their own
countries, he said.
	   ``For all the children deliberately massacred or caught in
crossfire or mained by anti-personnel landmines, many more have
been deprived of their physical, mental and emotional needs in
societies at war,'' Otunnu said.
	   ``Millions have lost their homes and their parents, not to
mention years of education and their youth. Some have been
permanently traumatized by the events they have witnessed and
experienced,'' he said.
	   Children have also been targeted by adults intent on eliminating
the next generation of potential adversaries: To this end, many
girls have been sexually abused and many boys have been recruited
or kidnapped to become child soldiers, he said.
	   Otunnu said children have also suffered from economic sanctions.
	   At the news conference, he called on the U.N. Security Council
to reveal ``the negative impact'' of sanctions on Iraqi children.
He called for similar reviews on the effects of sanctions on the
health, nutrition and education of children in former Yugoslavia
and Burundi.

Russia and China object to using force to enforce Kosovo accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with work stalling, Russia China
objecting to effort to have resolution threaten all measures to
enforce. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Work on a Security Council resolution to
back the Kosovo accord stalled amid differences over whether to
threaten Serbs and ethnic Albanians with an explicit use of force
to implement the agreement.
	   An effort to warn both sides that the international community
would use ``all necessary measures,'' to enforce the agreement
appears to have been quashed, diplomatic sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are adamantly against
using force, and said Wednesday they wouldn't support any
resolution that threatened international intervention to enforce
the deal.
	   ``We don't want to give any authorization to the NATO for the
use of force,'' said the deputy Chinese ambassador, Shen Guofang.
	   A late draft of the resolution makes no mention of the threat.
The council demands that both the government and ethnic Albanian
leadership implement the terms of the agreement and previous
council resolutions, the draft says.
	   Consultations were expected to resume Thursday.
	   The goal of the resolution is to enshrine the agreement and back
the provision to allow 2,000 unarmed monitors from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo and ensure
fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians has ceased.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to the verification
team, and to withdraw his special forces from the southern Serb
province, after talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
that staved off threatened NATO action.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo _ has killed hundreds of people and forced
around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown began in
February. Serbia is the largest of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.
	   Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces
have raised fears about the Oct. 12 agreement, under which
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire, the withdrawal of his special
forces, the safe return of refugees and a timetable for restoring
self-rule to the province.
	   The Security Council outlined those demands in a Sept. 23
resolution that threatened unspecified measures if both sides
didn't comply. The resolution was enacted under Chapter 7 of the
U.N. Charter, which means it can be enforced militarily.
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the provisions laid out in
resolution 1199 of Sept. 23 were agreed to in an emergency
situation, which has since improved.
	   ``So to adopt something which is stronger than 1199 in a
situation which is softer than the one which existed at the time of
1199 adoption is just to go against the facts. And we are not going
to do this,'' he said.
	   Yugoslavia's acting ambassador, Vladislav Jovanovic, said his
government was not opposed to the council endorsing the agreement
as long as it didn't add other issues to the resolution. He didn't
specify.
	   ``We are implementing the agreement in good faith,'' Jovanovic
told a news conference, saying the government was pulling back
police units and reducing the number of army units.

Iraq's gamble paying off, aided by conciliatory UN

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Ten weeks after Iraq decided to block U.N.
weapons inspections to protest eight years of sanctions, Baghdad's
risky move has gone virtually unchallenged.
	   In fact, pressure against the U.S.-led hard-line on Iraq has
only increased while inspections have been at a standstill. Support
is growing for an acknowledgment that Iraq has complied with some
of its disarmament obligations, and thus an easing of sanctions
finally can be considered.
	   How times have changed since February, when the United States
and Britain punished Iraq for blocking inspections of eight
presidential palaces by threatening to drop bombs on Baghdad.
	   Now inspectors can't go anywhere unannounced, and the United
States and Britain offer little but muted complaints. With
dwindling domestic and international support for a tough line
against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington and London have
delegated negotiations on the impasse to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan while they deal with Kosovo and the Middle East peace
process.
	   Many diplomats point to the change of heart to ``what happened
in Ohio'' in February, when top U.S. administration officials were
heckled, live on CNN, at Ohio State University, where they had gone
to justify the military threat. Audience members shouted anti-war
slogans and demanded an end to sanctions they said are
impoverishing a majority of Iraqis.
	   This is not to say the prospect of lifting sanctions is near. No
council member _ the United States in particular _ is willing to
concede that Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations to destroy its
weapons of mass destruction. All agree that it must do so before
sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait are lifted.
	   A State Department official noted that it's up to Iraq to comply
with U.N. demands to resume cooperation with inspectors and
disclose information about banned weapons. Washington ``doesn't see
the pendulum swinging Iraq's way,'' the official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   A meeting Thursday and Friday of chemical weapons experts to
discuss results of tests for deadly VX nerve gas on Iraqi missile
warheads could bolster assertions that Iraq hasn't been truthful
about its chemical weapons program.
	   But members of the council, the U.N. chief and even inspectors
themselves are much more willing today to acknowledge that they
will never know whether Iraq has destroyed all its banned weapons.
As a result, and thanks to a divided council, pressures are
increasing to rein in the inspectors' open-ended mandate and simply
map out what else needs to be done.
	   Annan has suggested a timeline for a ``comprehensive review'' of
what remaining information Iraq needs to turn over. Iraq requested
clarification on nine items of the review, officials said Thursday.
	   Council members have agreed to the review, but say they'll do it
on their own terms once Iraq has resumed cooperation with
inspectors. The council held out its own olive branch last week,
saying Iraq only needed to answer a few remaining questions about
its proscribed weapons programs to satisfy U.N. disarmament
resolutions.
	   The Iraqis, however, are playing hardball: Baghdad has given no
indication that inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission will
ever be welcome again to carry out spot searches.
	   Iraq also has time on its side. Every time Baghdad has ignited a
crisis by blocking inspections, it has gained just a little
momentum towards its ultimate goal of getting sanctions lifted.
	   In the meantime, Iraq has been delivering a dizzying array of
letters to the Security Council that question everything from U.S.
air patrols to the interception of Iraqi cargo ships suspected of
smuggling oil.
	   The most frequent target has been the inspectors themselves _
part of an apparent campaign to discredit the U.N. Special
Commission and shift attention away from the core issue of
disarmament to the United Nations.
	   In that regard, though, Iraq has had considerable ammunition.
	   Scott Ritter's departure as a top weapons inspector fueled Iraqi
assertions that UNSCOM was full of spies. Ritter, who quit in
frustration over the flailing council resolve to disarm Iraq, has
said Israel gave inspectors Iraqi weapons data.
	   In Denis Halliday's resignation as the head of humanitarian
programs in Iraq, Baghdad has a new voice making the lecture
circuit advocating an end to sanctions.
	   Somehow, Iraq has capitalized on the resignation of one U.N.
official who left because he thought the council wasn't doing
enough to keep tough inspections in place and another who quit
because he thought it was doing too much.

Dollar up against yen, Tokyo stock prices surge in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Thursday
amid renewed speculation the German central bank may ease credit.
Tokyo stock prices surged on further optimism over Japan's banking
sector.
	   The dollar bought 117.63 yen in early trading, up 1.27 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 117.00
yen in late overnight trading.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 480.70
points, or 3.38 percent, to 14,697.03 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei closed up 408.28 points, or 2.96
percent, for the fourth consecutive trading day of increase.
	   The dollar advanced overnight after Bundesbank official Hans
Juergen Krupp told a German news magazine European short-term
interest rats should converge below Germany's. Traders interpreted
his remarks as favoring a German rate cut sometime before the euro
is launched on Jan. 1.
	   The dollar also picked up support from an overnight advance on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.38
points, or 0.1 percent, to 8,519.23 on Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started sharply higher
as hopes grew that more Japanese banks will accept public funds
under a government plan to strengthen their financial positions.
	   That optimism followed a report in Thursday's Nihon Keizai
newspaper that Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank and Daiwa Bank are considering
applying for the funds. On Wednesday, the Industrial Bank of Japan
became the first bank to publicly say it would seek such money.
	   Japan's Parliament adopted laws earlier this month which will
allow the government to take over foundering banks and to inject up
to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer money into the
cash-strapped financial system.
	   Sentiment was also lifted by the debut of NTT Mobile
Communications Network, commonly known as NTT DoCoMo, on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's first section Thursday, traders said.
	   In early trading, shares of NTT DoCoMo were bid-only at 4.1
million yen (dlrs 35,043) per share against its initial public
offering price of 3.9 million yen (dlrs 33,333).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 33.20 points, or 3.10 percent, to 1,105.03. The
TOPIX closed up 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early trading, compared with Wednesday's
finish of 0.845 percent. Its price closed at 108.52 yen the
previous day.

Lions in southern Africa facing serious threat of disease
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOWER SABIE, South Africa (AP) _ Southern Africa's majestic
lions are facing perhaps their biggest threat since man began
hunting them with rifles _ deadly tuberculosis that is reducing
them to ``a skeleton covered in skin.''
	   Lions in Kruger National Park, one of the world's largest game
reserves, have picked up the fatal disease after feeding on
infected Cape buffalo, their natural prey.
	   Researchers say that more than 90 percent of the lions tested in
the southern part of the vast park are infected with the disease.
It is suspected of cutting the number of adult lions in one study
area from 25 to 12 in less than 2 1/2 years.
	   Conservation and wildlife officials normally allow nature's ways
to proceed unchecked in the park. But they are so fearful of the
disease infecting all of Kruger's 1,500 to 2,000 lions that they
are considering slaughtering 8,000 Cape buffalo or building a fence
across the park to contain the diseased animals.
	   ``We cannot allow this disease to spread,'' said Emily Mogajane,
the director of animal health for South Africa's Agriculture
Ministry.
	   Before making a decision, scientists are scrambling to determine
how widespread the TB is. This week, they descended on the sultry
stillness of an isolated section of the park.
	   Scientists aboard a helicopter swooped into a shallow valley
where a herd of buffalo grazed in the shade of thorn trees. A
scientist aimed a rifle at one of the behemoths and fired an orange
dart into its flank. The buffalo dropped. Another dart was fired.
Another buffalo dropped.
	   Minutes later, 19 buffalo were dead or dying from lethal doses
of muscle relaxant.
	   Thirty scientists and helpers descended from a convoy of
all-terrain vehicles and dissected the animals on the spot. About
40 vultures floated overhead, but pickings were slim _ the
carcasses and body parts were loaded onto trucks and taken away for
study.
	   Skin tests can detect the presence of TB without killing the
animal. But only an autopsy can reveal how far the disease has
spread and how long the animal has been sick.
	   That evening, Dewald Keet, Kruger's chief veterinarian and one
of the lion study's two authors, displayed a buffalo's lung to a
reporter. The pink membrane contained white tubercular lumps.
	   ``If a lion eats this, he will get a massive dose of TB,'' Keet
said.
	   Because the disease is ingested, the lion's intestines are the
first to be affected. The lion will develop intestinal lesions
before the disease spreads to lymph nodes and other organs. Unlike
the buffalo, which get TB from breathing the germs, the lion's
lungs are not immediately affected.
	   A lion that contracts bovine tuberculosis can take several years
to die from the disease itself, but its weakened condition makes it
an easier target for rival lions.
	   TB is alien to the 100-year-old park. Cape buffalo contracted it
by mingling with infected cattle herds in the 1950s near southern
Kruger, before the park's boundary was fenced off.
	   Although the spread of the disease has been slow among buffalo,
many of those affected can live out a normal lifespan.
	   Not so for the lion. The disease seems to hit lions more quickly
and with more devastating effects.
	   Keet discovered the first infected lion in September 1995.
	   ``The lion was on its last legs, a skeleton covered in skin, due
to the TB,'' Keet said. He has discovered at least eight fatally
ill lions since then.
	   Authorities say the disease has hit other species, although many
appear to be little affected.
	   In August, TB in leopards was discovered after one of the cats,
perhaps too weak from the disease to hunt other prey, sneaked up on
a ranger and killed him.
	   The disease has also hit lions in two other game parks,
including one in Uganda, adding urgency to finding a solution.
	   ``They're not dying like flies,'' Keet said. ``TB is a slow,
insidious, dangerous disease. (But) by the time you realize there
is a problem, it can be too late.''
	   It is probably hitting many more African game reserves, but few
studies have been done because of lack of money, said Leo Braack,
chief of conservation at Kruger.
	   ``Hopefully the insight we gain can benefit a whole range of
countries,'' Braack said.

Guyanese agents find huge stash of cocaine in ship bound for
</HEADLINE>
Netherlands &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese authorities who cut through
the hull of a Panamanian ship searching for drugs said they found
2,400 kilograms (5,200 pounds) of cocaine _ the largest seizure
ever in Guyana.
	   The ship was bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where the
cocaine would have had a street price of about dlrs 220 million.
	   Lambert Marks, head of the customs anti-drug unit, said
Wednesday that investigators found the cocaine welded into the hull
of the M.V. Danielsen and in other parts of the ship.
	   The ship had docked in Georgetown on Oct. 10 to pick up a load
of rice bound for the Netherlands. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and
Interpol officials believed it held a shipment from Colombia's Cali
Cartel and tipped off local officials, Marks said.
	   He said U.S. drug agents based in Caracas, Venezuela, assisted
with the search.
	   Background checks showed several members of the ship's
multinational crew had arrest records. The vessel was registered in
the southeastern Caribbean country of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.
	   Caricom Rice Mills said last week it could no longer wait for
agents to finish the search and hired another ship to transport the
rice.
	   The seizure followed last week's expulsion to the Netherlands of
Dutch national Mohabeer Latchmansingh, owner of a fishing business,
to face cocaine trafficking charges.

Players descend on Vegas for lockout update
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ As more than 170 locked-out players were
arriving in the glitziest non-National Basketball Association city
in America, their union and 19 agents spent Wednesday discussing
the state of the lockout.
	   Their actions seemed to signal that there would be no quick end
to the work stoppage that has shut down the league.
	   Instead of discussing the fine points of the offers on the
table, they instead laid the groundwork for exhibition games,
financial assistance and maybe even a new league.
	   ``I thought we'd be fighting, but it was the most harmonious
agents meeting I've ever been to,'' said Bill Duffy, one of the 19
members of the union's agents advisory committee. ``The deal the
league has offered us is so bad there wasn't even a need to discuss
it.''
	   The committee was updated for about three hours by union
director Billy Hunter and president Patrick Ewing, and also heard
from three players who dropped in _ Kendall Gill, Malik Sealy and
Michael Curry.
	   ``All three of these guys would be squeezed under the owners'
proposed deal, and all three were talking about maintaining unity
and resolve,'' Duffy said.
	   On Thursday, it'll probably be the biggest one-room assemblage
of basketball talent in history as about half the league's players
convene for an update on the stalemated collective bargaining
talks.
	   No talks have been held in more than a week, and the league is
expected to cancel the remainder of the November schedule. The
first two weeks of the season have already been scrapped.
	   Hunter, Ewing and the 19 agents on the committee complained that
the league, asking for a hard salary cap, an elimination of the
Larry Bird exception and other concessions, has not put forth a
proposal worth considering.
	   ``The message that's going to come loud and clear out of this
session is that the players are prepared to hang as long as they
have to hang,'' Hunter said. ``As soon as that message arrives
home, then I think the NBA owners will be prepared to sit down and
engage in a good-faith negotiations.''
	   The owners' next move should come out of a meeting next Tuesday
of the Board of Governors, with one representative from each
ownership group.
	   The owners' bargaining position seemed to be strengthened this
week when an arbitrator rejected a union grievance claiming that 26
players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the
lockout.
	   But the owners, too, are losing money, and all indications
currently point to a lockout with no end in sight.
	   It was with that grim outlook in mind that the agents' committee
discussed three remedies:
	   _ A series of exhibition games to raise money for the union.
Hunter said a game this Friday in Houston had already sold out a
10,000-seat arena at the University of Houston. Another game with
many high-profile players was being planned for Las Vegas, perhaps
to be televised on pay-per-view, and a third game was being planned
for Japan.
	   _ All players are due to receive dlrs 25,000 checks Nov. 15 as
part of the league's group licensing agreement, and Ewing said many
of the wealthiest players would forego those checks for one year,
with lower-salaried players getting an extra dlrs 25,000.
	   _ Lines of credit have been obtained from two banks, Hunter
said, and other professional sports unions have pledged loans.
	   Hunter said there were other options discussed that he did not
want to disclose, but some agents said a subcommittee would be
formed to explore the feasibility of starting a new league if the
lockout forces the cancellation of the entire 1998-99 season.

UN warns of declining shark stocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Many of the world's shark species are
severely depleted, the United Nations said in urging prompt action
to stop growing catches that threaten the species' future.
	   Thanks to an increased trade in shark fins and other exotic
shark products over the past 20 years, a record 760,000 tons of
shark was brought ashore in 1996, compared with 272,000 tons in
1950, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said Wednesday in
a statement.
	   Most of the world's shark catch is unintentionally caught in
fisheries targeting tuna, swordfish, shrimp and squid, FAO said.
	   No international treaties exist to manage sharks, though
representatives from 70 countries are expected to approve an
international plan of action to conserve shark species at a Rome
conference Oct. 26-30.
	   Sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation because they are
slow-growing and mature late in life. There are indications that of
the 100 exploited shark species, around 20 are vulnerable,
endangered or critically endangered, the statement said.
	   Shark fins, extremely valuable in parts of Asia, are one of the
most expensive fish products in the world. The major shark fishing
nations are Indonesia, India the United States, Pakistan and
Mexico.

Iraq outlines clarifications for comprehensive review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has given the United Nations a list
of nine questions it needs answered about a proposed
``comprehensive review'' of sanctions before it will consider
resuming cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's chief of staff briefed the
Security Council on Wednesday on the nine demands and on the
progress of talks between Iraq and the U.N. envoy in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah.
	   Shah and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are trying to
negotiate a deal under which Iraq would rescind its Aug. 5 decision
to stop cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors and in return receive
a watershed review by the council of its seven-year effort to
disarm itself.
	   U.N. inspectors must certify Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before the council will lift sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The review, as the U.N. chief has proposed, would require
inspectors prove that Iraq is still hiding banned weapons and set a
timetable to clear up outstanding disarmament issues so that
sanctions could be eased.
	   One of Baghdad's nine concerns is that inspectors be forced to
disclose the source of evidence to back their claims that Iraq
isn't fully disarmed. That could be a problem considering some
council members have already expressed discomfort with Annan's
proposal to shift the onus of disclosing information about the
hidden weapons from Iraq to inspectors.
	   The council has agreed to conduct a review but hasn't given any
details on how it would be carried out. Council members have said
they won't do so until Iraq rescinds its decision to stop
cooperation.
	   There were calls Wednesday from some members to formally respond
to Annan's proposal _ a move that would give Iraq some indication
of where the council was headed on the issue. One western diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Annan had indicated he
wouldn't proceed with any more talks with Baghdad until he received
more direction from the council.
	   Council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said only that
``We will probably have a fair amount of work to do to come to any
conclusion of the council on this subject. So those discussions
will continue inside informal consultations over the next few
days.''
	   Iraq wants to know, for example, precisely how long it would
have to wait for the review once it resumes cooperation and what
role Baghdad and the U.N. chief will have in the process. Iraq also
wants assurances that council members will accept that they can
never know for sure whether Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Baghdad halted cooperation with inspectors _ ending spot
searches _ after the chief U.N. weapons inspector refused in August
to certify Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   One big question of Iraq's chemical weapons program will be
discussed at length beginning Thursday at U.N. headquarters.
Chemical weapons experts from seven countries will assess results
from U.S. and French laboratories on whether Iraq was able to load
the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Previous U.S. test results showed traces of VX on fragments of
warheads, countering Iraqi claims that it was never able to produce
enough VX or stabilize it sufficiently to load into missiles.

Nitrate pollution is tied to crumbling bedrock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Widespread nitrate pollution in wells and
reservoirs may come from the natural weathering of bedrock, not
just sloppy farming and factory pollution.
	   Researchers working in a central California watershed have
determined for the first time that high levels of nitrates are
released as crumbly bedrock weathers year after year.
	   Nitrogen compounds that leach into waterways and aquifers are
linked to environmental damage and serious illnesses. In high
concentrations, nitrates can cause miscarriages and ``blue baby
syndrome,'' in which an infant's red blood cells are unable to
carry sufficient oxygen.
	   The pollution taints drinking water around the world, including
many communities in the United States.
	   Until now, the contamination has been blamed on overuse of
fertilizer and releases of untreated livestock manure, as well as
timber clear-cutting and factory emissions that contribute to acid
rain.
	   But exposed rock deposits around the world contain as much as 20
percent of the planet's total nitrogen, the researchers calculated,
and geology might be a significant contributor in some places.
	   Their report was published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
	   ``It appears that the early rains flush out the nitrogen that
weathers from the rock during the summer,'' said biogeochemist
JoAnn Holloway of the University of California at Davis. ``Even
small areas of these rocks can have a profound influence on water
quality.''
	   Other researchers said that farming and industry still represent
a threat to drinking water, and even natural contamination must be
treated if the nitrate levels exceed public health standards.
	   ``Humans have created the problem by building reservoirs that
act like a pool for these nitrates to concentrate,'' said Lloyd
Walker, a biological resources engineer at Colorado State
University. ``In a natural environment, these nitrates would flush
right through.''
	   In the study, UC-Davis researchers sampled the water in 35
streams in the 600-square-mile (1,560-square-kilometer) Mokelumne
River watershed in the Sierra Nevada southeast of Sacramento.
	   They were seeking to pinpoint the source of elevated nitrate
levels in downstream reservoirs. The nitrates have caused
large-scale algae blooms and fish kills, but their levels were
within federal health standards.
	   Holloway and others ruled out several culprits before concluding
the contamination has geological origins. Laboratory tests showed
that the nitrate is a form of naturally occurring nitrogen rather
than isotopes of nitrogen from feedlots and fertilizer.
	   Near the mountain resort of Kirkwood, nitrate levels in the
water were much lower than in the downstream reservoirs. The hard
granite bedrock there contains much less nitrogen and it weathers
slowly, Holloway said.
	   However, the bedrock changes to slate and other sedimentary
deposits in lower elevations near the foothills town of Jackson,
California. The soft bedrock there formed from nitrogen-rich
organic materials hundreds of millions of years ago.
	   The study was funded by the California Department of Forestry.
The researchers ruled out timber clear-cutting as a nitrate source
because water samples from logged areas showed low nitrate levels.
	   Planting trees may help reverse the contamination.
	   ``Oak trees have deep root systems that can draw up the
nitrogen,'' said co-author Randy Dahlgren of Cal-Davis.

Yanks' Williams: `I haven't changed'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Bernie Williams prepared for Game 4 of the
World Series as if it were the season-opener. And he didn't allow
himself to think it could be his last one with the New York
Yankees.
	   Williams is eligible for free agency, and there's a chance the
All-Star center fielder won't ever wear a New York uniform again
after the World Series.
	   ``I'm just not going to let myself think about that possibility
right now,'' he said Wednesday. ``I have a lot more things to think
about within the next three or four hours, and then after that ...
.''
	   Williams and his agent, Scott Boras, were only able to work out
a one-year contract after negotiations on a multiyear deal fell
through last winter. Williams' uncertain future in New York was a
hot topic all season, and recently there was speculation Williams
had already made up his mind about leaving the team.
	   He was reported as having distanced himself from teammates,
refusing to join the celebration after the club won the AL East
title, the division series over Texas and the ALCS against
Cleveland.
	   Williams, who won the AL batting title this season despite all
the outside distractions, said he's the same on Oct. 21 as he was
on April 15.
	   ``The circumstances surrounding my situation ... has maybe made
people assume that I'm trying to distance myself from the team, and
doing all kinds of stuff,'' he said. ``But I haven't changed.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG MAC: &LR;  Mark McGwire's 70 homers earned him a trip to the
World Series. Baseball's new home-run king threw out the ceremonial
first pitch for Game 4.
	   Introduced as ``one of baseball's greatest ambassadors,''
McGwire, wearing a World Series jacket, saluted the players and
fans before throwing the ball to Padres reserve outfielder Mark
Sweeney.
	   McGwire and Sweeney then delivered uppercut punches to each
other in the gut, the slugger's signature greeting after he hits a
home run.
	   ``I still can't figure out how I hit 70,'' McGwire said. ``It's
hard enough to hit 62; 70 was incredible.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BATTERED BOCHY: &LR;  Critics have taken shots at Padres manager
Bruce Bochy for his on-field strategy, especially in the late
innings of Game 3.
	   He doesn't mind the scrutiny as long as they leave his players
out of it.
	   ``I'd rather them point a finger at me than the players because
we have a tremendous ballclub,'' he said. ``What they've done this
year, nobody expected us to win the West, nobody expected us to
beat Houston or Atlanta. I'll take this situation every year.''
	   Bochy said he relies on a combination of instinct and what his
gut tells him.
	   ``When you're playing in a Series like this, every move is going
to be scrutinized and that's fine,'' he said. ``That shows you
people have interest, especially here in San Diego.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TORRE'S TEAM: &LR;  New York manager Joe Torre still isn't sure
where his club ranks among the great teams. But even now, with a
World Series title just one win away, he continues to be surprised
by the '98 Yankees.
	   When the club started the season on the West Coast losing four
of its first five games, Torre decided it was time for a meeting
when the team got to Seattle.
	   ``Let's do something about it,'' Torre recalled as the meeting's
tone. ``We've got to get hungry, we've got to get angry.''
	   Torre said his record-setting team has showed him a side this
fall he hadn't previously seen.
	   ``I found out something in the postseason,'' he said, ``that
it's OK to be tense in games and admit your tense, and you still do
a good job. I felt that way during the Texas series. That was a
revelation for me, that guys aren't loose and yet they still manage
to win.''
	   For months, he's been asked to compare his team with other World
Series champions and on Wednesday Torre was once again asked to
measure the 1998 Yankees against the 1927 team.
	   ``Well, I don't remember the '27 Yankees,'' he said, smiling.
``But you hear about those guys a lot.''

Australia's Labor Party turns on former leader over rumors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's main opposition Labor
Party turned Thursday on one of its elder statesmen, accusing him
of spreading malicious gossip about former prime minister Paul
Keating.
	   Bill Hayden, a former Labor leader and governor-general, told a
court Wednesday about false rumors that Keating had an extramarital
affair and liked young boys.
	   Hayden said he told the tales as an example of how false rumors
can damage politicians' reputations and haunt their careers.
	   Labor leaders past and present condemned Hayden's comments about
Keating, suggesting they were motivated by a desire for revenge.
	   In 1983, Keating helped oust Hayden as Labor leader on the eve
of an election at which his replacement, Bob Hawke, became prime
minister. Keating succeeded Hawke and Hayden was later appointed
governor-general, the Queen's representative and titular head of
state in Australia.
	   Hayden was giving evidence in a defamation case in which
conservative Treasurer Peter Costello, his wife Tanya, and
Employment Services Minister Tony Abbott and his wife, Margaret,
are suing publisher Random House over the book ``Goodbye
Jerusalem,'' by Labor Party author and speechwriter Bob Ellis.
	   The book falsely accused the two ministers of changing their
political allegiances to the Liberal Party _ now in government _
after they slept with a woman whom one of them later married.
	   The book was withdrawn from sale and Ellis has offered an
apology.
	   Former Labor minister Bob Collins said Hayden's comments were a
deliberate tactic to publicize rumors about Keating.
	   ``What he did was to cold-bloodedly promulgate absolutely
vicious and completely untrue, ludicrous in fact, rumors that have
been doing the rounds for years,'' Collins told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``And why? Bill obviously considers himself being cheated of the
prime ministership of Australia.''
	   Current Labor leader Kim Beazley said Hayden's comments were
totally unnecessary.
	   Other Labor members of Parliament also said they were a vicious
attempt at revenge.

Anesthesiologists relax patient drinking rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Anesthesiologists are relaxing
recommendations for what patients can drink before undergoing
surgery.
	   The American Society of Anesthesiologists said Wednesday that
patients should be allowed to drink clear liquids up to two hours
before surgery with the permission of their doctors.
	   Previously, doctors didn't want patients to eat or drink
anything eight to 12 hours before surgery because of concerns they
could choke or have the contents of their stomachs go into their
lungs while under anesthesia.
	   The new guidelines released at the group's annual convention
allow patients to drink limited amounts of water, fruit juices
without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea and black coffee.
	   Studies suggest that patients are less anxious, better hydrated
and may have fewer headaches and nausea after surgery if they
allowed to drink up to two hours before surgery, according to the
34,000-member association.
	   The guidelines still tell patients to avoid solid food, alcohol
and milk for at least eight hours before surgery.

Iraq outlines clarifications for comprehensive review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UN human rights report at end &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has given the United Nations a list
of nine questions it needs answered about a proposed
``comprehensive review'' of sanctions before it will consider
resuming cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's chief of staff briefed the
Security Council on Wednesday on the nine demands and on the
progress of talks between Iraq and the U.N. envoy in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah.
	   Shah and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz are trying to
negotiate a deal under which Iraq would rescind its Aug. 5 decision
to stop cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors and in return receive
a watershed review by the council of its seven-year effort to
disarm itself.
	   U.N. inspectors must certify Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before the council will lift sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The review, as the U.N. chief has proposed, would require
inspectors prove that Iraq is still hiding banned weapons and set a
timetable to clear up outstanding disarmament issues so that
sanctions could be eased.
	   One of Baghdad's nine concerns is that inspectors be forced to
disclose the source of evidence to back their claims that Iraq
isn't fully disarmed. That could be a problem considering some
council members have already expressed discomfort with Annan's
proposal to shift the onus of disclosing information about the
hidden weapons from Iraq to inspectors.
	   The council has agreed to conduct a review but hasn't given any
details on how it would be carried out. Council members have said
they won't do so until Iraq rescinds its decision to stop
cooperation.
	   There were calls Wednesday from some members to formally respond
to Annan's proposal _ a move that would give Iraq some indication
of where the council was headed on the issue. One western diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Annan had indicated he
wouldn't proceed with any more talks with Baghdad until he received
more direction from the council.
	   Council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said only that
``discussions will continue inside informal consultations over the
next few days.''
	   Iraq wants to know, for example, precisely how long it would
have to wait for the review once it resumes cooperation and what
role Baghdad and the U.N. chief will have in the process. Iraq also
wants assurances that council members will accept that they can
never know for sure whether Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Baghdad halted cooperation with inspectors _ ending spot
searches _ after the chief U.N. weapons inspector refused in August
to certify Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   One big question of Iraq's chemical weapons program will be
discussed at length beginning Thursday at U.N. headquarters.
Chemical weapons experts from seven countries will assess results
from U.S. and French laboratories on whether Iraq was able to load
the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Previous U.S. test results showed traces of VX on fragments of
warheads, countering Iraqi claims that it was never able to produce
enough VX or stabilize it sufficiently to load into missiles.
	   Another issue concerning Iraq's disarmament and sanctions _ the
U.N. oil-for-food plan _ is also expected to surface over the next
coming weeks. Iraq must turn over its plan to distribute food and
medicine to Iraqis with the proceeds from the oil it's allowed to
sell under the unique U.N. program.
	   In a report Wednesday, the U.N. special rapporteur for human
rights in Iraq said the health and nutritional situation of Iraqis
remains precarious, notwithstanding the increase in the amount of
oil Iraq is able to sell. ``In this respect, the government of Iraq
bears primary responsibility for the continuing suffering of the
Iraqi people,'' the report said.

United stops Crew 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter scored twice and Jeff Agoos added
a goal as D.C. United clinched the Eastern Conference finals with a
3-0 victory over the Columbus Crew Wednesday night.
	   United shoots for its third consecutive Major League Soccer
title Sunday against the Chicago Fire in the MLS Cup championship
at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The expansion Fire swept the
Los Angeles Galaxy in the Western Conference best-of-3 finals.
	   Agoos scored in the 12th minute and Lassiter connected in the
44th and 79th minutes as United improved its three-year playoff
record at RFK Stadium to 9-0.
	   United goalie Tom Presthus got his third shutout in his last
four playoff games.
	   Columbus snapped United's 13-game playoff winning streak with a
4-2 victory in Game 2 Sunday at Ohio Stadium. The Crew is 0-9 at
RFK.
	   United controlled Wednesday's game from the start with Jaime
Moreno firing a shot at Crew goalie Juergen Sommer just 20 seconds
into the match.
	   D.C. cracked the the Crew defense in the 12th minute after Brian
McBride was called for a foul on Ben Olsen four yards outside the
penalty area.
	   United playmaker Marco Etcheverry, known for his crafty free
kicks, set up from 22 yards. Etcheverry slotted the ball to Agoos
in the middle. Crew defender Ansil Elcock tried to stop Agoos, but
the United defender blasted a shot that deflected off Elcock's
right foot and tucked into the left corner of the net.
	   It was the second goal of the season for Agoos.
	   United's second score came off a long pass by Etcheverry to the
edge of the penalty area. Moreno one-timed the ball to John Harkes,
who redirected it to the front of the net.
	   The speedy Lassiter ran onto the ball and pushed it with his
left foot past Sommer.
	   Lassiter's final goal, his fourth of the playoffs, came on a
breakaway.

Red Wings 5, Predators 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Darren McCarty and Doug Brown each scored two
goals as the Detroit Red Wings overcame a stellar performance by
Nashville goaltender Mike Dunham and beat the Predators 5-2
Wednesday night.
	   Brendan Shanahan scored his sixth goal in five games for the Red
Wings, who have won four straight since an opening-game loss. It
was Detroit's last game before the return of coach Scotty Bowman,
who has been recovering from offseason angioplasty and knee
replacement surgery.
	   Greg Johnson had a goal and an assist and Sergei Krivokrasov
scored the other goal for the expansion Predators in their
first-ever meeting with the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champion.
	   The game was close through 2{ periods only because of Dunham,
who was peppered with 57 shots, 27 in the second period alone.
 &UR; Canucks 2, Capitals 1
	   In Washington, Garth Snow made 34 saves and Adrian Aucoin had a
goal and an assist to help the Vancouver Canucks gain their first
victory over the Washington Capitals in nearly six years.
	   Vancouver last beat Washington on Oct. 28, 1992. Since that
victory, the Canucks went 0-7-1 against the Capitals, and
Washington outscored them 34-14 during that stretch. The Canucks'
last road win against Washington came on March 17, 1990.
	   Snow made a number of key saves, including 13 in the final
period as Washington tried to tie. Aucoin scored the Canucks' first
goal in the first period. He also assisted Bill Muckalt on the
other.
	   Kelly Miller played in his 1,000th NHL game for Washington, a
franchise-record 883 with the Capitals. He also got an assist on
the team's only goal, by Craig Berube.
 &UR; Canadiens 3, Senators 2
	   In Montreal, Brian Savage, playing his first game of the season
after agreeing to a contract Tuesday, scored early in the third
period as the Montreal Canadiens beat the Ottawa Senators.
	   Savage, who signed a two-year, dlrs 3.5 million deal, scored on
a 2-on-1 break with Mark Recchi as the Canadiens handed the
Senators their first loss of the season after three victories.
	   Saku Koivu had a shorthanded goal and Vladimir Malakhov added a
power-play goal to help the Canadiens snap a two-game losing
streak. Jocelyn Thibault made 26 saves for his third victory of the
season, giving up goals only to Andreas Dackell and Shawn
McEachern.
 &UR; Lightning 5, Penguins 0
	   In Tampa, Florida, Darcy Tucker scored twice and 1998 No. 1
overall draft pick Vincent Lecavalier recorded his first NHL point
as the Tampa Bay Lightning snapped a 15-game winless streak.
	   Lightning goaltender Daren Puppa stopped 28 shots in recording
his 18th career shutout and first since March 26, 1996.
	   The Lightning (1-4-1) had not won a game since a 3-1 triumph
March 30 at the New York Rangers. Tampa Bay also stopped a
franchise record-tying 10-game winless streak at home, dating back
to a 5-1 victory over Florida on March 21.
	   Tampa Bay broke the game open with a four-goal second period,
with the goals coming on just five shots.
 &UR; Oilers 4, Islanders 2
	   In Uniondale, New York, Boyd Devereaux scored twice as the
Edmonton Oilers took a three-goal lead and then hung on for a 4-2
victory over the New York Islanders before a sparse crowd of
approximately 3,000.
	   Pat Falloon and Bill Guerin also scored for the Oilers, who won
four of five games on their first road trip of the season. Mikhail
Shtalenkov stopped 28 shots for the Oilers, who lost 3-2 to the New
York Rangers on Tuesday night.
	   Trevor Linden and Kenny Jonsson scored for New York. Tommy Salo,
who had two straight shutouts on the road before Wednesday night's
game, stopped 26 shots.
	   It was Edmonton's first win at Nassau Coliseum in their last
seven visits (1-4-2), since a 4-2 win on Oct. 19, 1991.

Reports: Malaysian court orders trial of 127 anti-government
</HEADLINE>
protesters

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A local court has ordered the
trial of 127 people who were arrested for participating in a
demonstration that demanded the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, news reports said Thursday.
	   They were produced Wednesday before a magistrate and charged
with unlawful assembly and disobeying police orders to disperse
from the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, The Star
daily said.
	   All 127 pleaded innocent to the charge. One person pleaded
guilty and was fined 2,000 ringgit (dlrs 526).
	   Police have arrested people each time groups sympathetic to
jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim have organized protests. But
so far the protesters have been released within days and not
formally charged in court.
	   If convicted in the trial that begins in May, the accused could
be jailed for one year and fined 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,600).
	   Police have declared all pro-Anwar demonstrations illegal.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, several thousand Malaysians have gathered
in Kuala Lumpur and other towns regularly to demand justice for the
jailed leader. Anwar faces trial beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts
	   Mahathir, who fired Anwar as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2, has said the protesters want to overthrow his
government by violence.
	   Speaking to local reporters Wednesday at a news conference which
foreign reporters were barred from attending, Mahathir blamed the
foreign press of trying to influence Anwar's trial by biased
reporting.
	   ``The government is on trial as far as the foreign media is
concerned,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``They are not concerned whether Anwar is guilty or not but they
want to make sure the government or the courts are guilty,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying by the Star.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar's case continued to attract international
attention.
	   On Wednesday, Abid Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of
expression and opinion for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
visited Anwar's wife and expressed admiration for her courage in
facing up to the threats of arrests and police intimidation.
	   Azizah, Anwar's wife, said earlier she hoped she would not be
arrested on charges of encouraging protests against Mahathir.

NTT DoCoMo shares debut on Tokyo Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Investors scrambled Thursday morning to get a share
of Japan's biggest cellular-phone company in the world's biggest
public stock offering.
	   NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., commonly known as NTT
DoCoMo, is Japan's largest cellular phone carrier and a subsidiary
of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
The company is hoping to raise 2.13 trillion yen (dlrs 18.6
billion) by selling a third of its shares.
	   Investors bid up the stock to 4.52 million yen (dlrs 38,435) in
its first morning of trading Thursday, 16 percent higher than the
3.9 million yen (dlrs 33,163) initial-public-offering price.
	   The strong gain was not a surprise to market watchers as Japan's
fast-growing and profitable cellular-phone industry is a bright
spot in an economy mired in its deepest recession in decades.
	   The cellular market has grown from around 2 million subscribers
in 1995 to 42.8 million at the end of September. NTT DoCoMo has a
commanding lead over two rival companies with a 57 percent market
share.
	   DoCoMo forecast its net profit will rise 56 percent this fiscal
year to 188 billion yen (dlrs 1.6 billion) from 120.63 billion yen
(dlrs 1 billion) last year.
	   Analysts said one risk for NTT DoCoMo is the large loss they
expect the company to suffer as it absorbs the operations and debts
of NTT Personal Communications Network. NTT Personal sells a
cheaper version of cellular service known as the personal
handyphone system, or PHS.
	   PHS phones can't be used in moving vehicles or in remote areas
and the falling price of cellular phones has made it increasingly
difficult for PHS providers to compete.
	   DoCoMo's initial public offering was the largest since parent
NTT went public for dlrs 13.6 billion in 1986. The sale of 545,000
shares includes 218,000 shares from NTT and 327,000 newly issued
stocks.
	   NTT, the country's largest phone company, had held 95 percent of
DoCoMo and will retain a 67 percent share of the company even after
Thursday's sale.
	   NTT DoCoMo plans to use the proceeds from its stock sale to
develop a new cellular phone system.
	   The sale makes DoCoMo Japan's third largest company in terms of
market capitalization after NTT, and Toyota Motor Corp.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stock prices up at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
morning amid renewed speculation the German central bank may ease
credit. Tokyo stocks surged on the listing of a subsidiary of
Japan's telecommunications giant.
	   The dollar bought 117.96 yen at midday, up 1.60 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 117.00 yen
in late overnight trading.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 415.29
points, or 2.92 percent, to end the morning session at 14,631.62.
On Wednesday, the Nikkei closed up 408.28 points, or 2.96 percent,
for its fourth consecutive trading day of increase.
	   Japanese currency investors continued to bid up the dollar
against the German mark Thursday after it rose nearly two pfennings
Wednesday.
	   The dollar was trading at 1.6578 marks, up from 1.6370 late
Wednesday in Tokyo and 1.6525 late in New York overnight.
	   The dollar's surge was triggered after Bundesbank official Hans
Juergen Krupp told a German news magazine European short-term
interest rates should converge below Germany's. Traders interpreted
his remarks as favoring a German rate cut sometime before the euro
is launched on Jan. 1.
	   The dollar also picked up support from an overnight advance on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.38
points, or 0.1 percent, to 8,519.23 on Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were boosted in a
positive reaction to the listing of NTT Mobile Communications
Network Inc., commonly known as NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest
cellular phone carrier and a subsidiary of telecommunications giant
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
	   Investors bid up the stock to 4.52 million yen (dlrs 38,435) in
its first morning of trading Thursday, 16 percent higher than the
3.9 million yen (dlrs 33,163) initial-public-offering price.
	   Traders said the market is also being lifted by hopes that more
banks will accept public funds.
	   The optimism followed a report in Thursday's Nihon Keizai
newspaper that Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank and Daiwa Bank are considering
applying for the funds. On Wednesday, the Industrial Bank of Japan
became the first bank to publicly say it would seek such money.
	   Japan's Parliament adopted laws earlier this month which will
allow the government to take over foundering banks and to inject up
to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer money into the
cash-strapped financial system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 28.89 points, or 2.70 percent, to 1,100.72. The
TOPIX closed up 28.81 points, or 2.76 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in morning trading. On Wednesday its yield
finished at 0.845 percent, while its price closed at 108.52 yen.

<TEXT>
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Kings goaltender Manny Legace, playing in
his first NHL game, stopped 49 shots as Los Angeles tied the
Florida Panthers.
	   The Panthers extend their unbeaten start to 2-0-2.
	   Legace, 25, was called up Monday from the Long Beach Ice Dogs of
the IHL because both Kings goalies, Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr
suffered groin injuries in Sunday's 5-5 tie with Colorado.
	   The Panthers outshot the Kings 29-9 after two periods and 46-17
prior to the overtime. Florida's 50 shots were just two shy of its
club-record 52, set against the Kings in 1993.
	   Luc Robitaille scored for Los Angeles. Dave Gagner had Florida's
goal.

The '98 Yankees: The best since '27?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs. UPDATES with Yankees' sweep &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Even last spring, the great Yogi knew it: This
New York Yankees team was special.
	   ``I said they were going to win by 25,'' Yogi Berra recalled
Wednesday. ``They only won by 22.''
	   And then they went 11-2 in the postseason, completing one of
baseball's greatest years with a 125-50 record, capped by a
Wednesday night's 3-0 win over San Diego. The victory finished off
the Yankees' first World Series sweep since 1950.
	   They finished with a .714 winning percentage, the highest in
baseball since the '27 Yankees Murderers' Row team and the
fourth-highest ever.
	   But how good are they? The best in 71 years? The best ever?
	   ``That can't be answered,'' said Berra, who then proceeded to
try.
	   As part of Yankees teams that won 14 pennants in 16 years, Berra
is uniquely qualified to judge. He holds the record for most World
Series games, at-bats, hits and doubles.
	   ``I hope they can win five in a row like we did,'' said Berra, a
member of 10 Series champions, including the five straight from
1949-53.
	   Led by the M and M Boys, the '61 Yankees had more power, with
Roger Maris hitting 61 homers and Mickey Mantle hitting 54 en route
to a 109-53 record and a 4-1 Series win over Cincinnati.
	   The '39 Yankees were the strongest of Joe DiMaggio's teams,
finishing the regular season 106-45 and sweeping the Reds to win
their fourth straight Series title.
	   The '27 Yankees, generally regarded as baseball's best, went
110-44 and then swept Pittsburgh.
	   And what of the 1975-76 Cincinnati Reds, the Big Red Machine led
by Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose?
	   ``I would rank this team third or fourth,'' said the Chicago
Tribune's Jerome Holtzman, who has been on the beat for 42 seasons
and is the senior baseball writer in the United States. ``There
isn't a Hall of Famer. They don't have a dominant hitter.''
	   Holtzman rates this team behind the '27 Yankees, the '61
Yankees, the Big Red Machine and perhaps the '19 White Sox, who
threw the World Series against Cincinnati in a gambling scandal.
	   Morgan puts these Yankees behind the '76 Reds because there's no
superstar. Cincinnati had three of them in Bench, Rose and Morgan,
and Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion were close behind.
	   ``If you're going to dominate for a long time, you have to have
a stud,'' Morgan said. ``I don't like talking about individuals or
throwing them up against my team because they're going to come up
second-best. But they're a team.''
	   It's also hard to rank these Yankees because they had a huge
lead by the All-Star break and coasted to a 114-48 record, the most
wins in the regular season since the '06 Cubs went 116-36.
	   ``New York played against themselves all year just to see how
good they could be,'' Morgan said. ``Maybe they would have won 120
games if someone was pushing them.''
	   Sparky Anderson knows something about great teams, too. He
managed the Reds to Series titles in '75 and '76, as well as the
'84 Detroit Tigers, who started the season 35-5 and beat San Diego
4-1 in the Padres' only other World Series appearance.
	   ``You can never rank teams for this reason: There's no way the
'27 Yankees can ever play the '98 Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles
and the Oakland Athletics or the great Reds team,'' Anderson said.
``They're a great team for this era and will go down in history as
a great team, but they cannot be rated until they've won at least
three World Series.''
	   The Swingin' A's from 1973-75 were the last team to win three
with the same nucleus. New York manager Joe Torre looks up to the
Catfish Hunter-Reggie Jackson-Rollie Fingers teams as a standard,
along with the Yankees in the '40s and '50s, and the Big Red
Machine.
	   ``I don't remember the '27 Yankees, but you hear about those
guys a lot,'' the 58-year-old manager said. ``It's tough to look
back at the '27 Yankees and say we're better position by position,
but everything is based on bottom line. ... Since everything is
based on the bottom line, I guess so.''
	   All through September and October, as the wins kept piling up,
more and more Yankees talked about magnitude of the
accomplishments.
	   ``There's going to be a lot of arguments historically about
where this team fits in,'' David Cone said. ``It's the most
professional team, it's the best team in baseball. We've worked
very hard to play professionally, to come out every night. We won
114 games during the regular season, and you don't do that without
being an unbelievably professional team, and I'm very proud to be
part of it.''

SAN DIEGO: Series championship.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   It was New York's second title in three years and its first
sweep since 1950. The Game 4 victory gave the Yankees 125 wins _ a
total that ranks right up there with all the other big numbers put
up in baseball this year. Their 114 regular-season victories were
the most ever for a champion.
	   And it was a tribute to a team vastly different from all those
other pinstriped winners. Without a Ruth, DiMaggio or Mantle among
them _ no certain Hall of Famers and no one even elected to start
in the All-Star game this season _ these Yankees posted a .714
winning percentage, the best in the majors since their Murderers'
Row club of 1927.
	   Pettitte shut out San Diego into the eighth inning while the
Yankees hitters did just enough to bring down ace Kevin Brown.
	   Bernie Williams, perhaps playing his last game for New York,
broke a scoreless tie with an RBI chopper in the sixth. In the
seventh, Scott Brosius singled home a run and surprising rookie
Ricky Ledee hit a sacrifice fly.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the eighth, when Tony Gwynn's
eighth hit of the Series finished Pettitte. A single by Ken
Caminiti off Mariano Rivera loaded the bases with two outs, but Jim
Leyritz, a postseason hero in the past for the Yankees and San
Diego, flied out to Williams.
	   The sweep was the first since Cincinnati upset Oakland in 1990,
and was the Yankees' seventh. Also, New York won its eighth
straight Series game while the Padres lost their seventh in a row.
	   For a team that led the AL in pitching and scoring, it was a
complete performance that produced its seventh straight win in this
postseason.
	   Plus, perhaps the Yankees had something else going for them _
inspiration from slugger Darryl Strawberry, out because of colon
cancer. All the Yankees had his No. 39 embroidered on their caps.
	   Pettitte won just six days after his father underwent heart
bypass surgery, allowing five hits in 7 1-3 innings. It was
reminiscent of his performance in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series,
when he beat Atlanta 1-0.
	   Brown, who could not hold a three-run lead in the seventh inning
of Game 1, took the loss.
	   Rivera closed out his spectacular postseason, getting the last
four outs for his third save of the Series. Including the playoff
wins over Texas and Cleveland, he pitched 13 1-3 scoreless innings
and recorded six saves.

Despite recession, building starts on dlrs 2.9 billion Disney theme
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   URAYASU, Japan (AP) _ Hoping to mine even more gold from the
Japanese love affair with Mickey, Minnie and Donald, the Walt
Disney Co. and the owner of Tokyo Disneyland began construction
Thursday of a dlrs 2.9 billion ``DisneySea'' theme park.
	   Company officials predict the park, which is being built on 167
acres (67 hectares) of reclaimed shoreline adjacent to Tokyo
Disneyland, will draw more than 10 million visitors a year once it
opens in 2001.
	   And although Japan is now slogging through its worst economic
slump since World War II, they have reason to be optimistic
Disney's ninth theme park in the world will be a success.
	   Tokyo Disneyland, which marked its 15th anniversary this year,
has proven to be the most lucrative of all Disney parks worldwide.
More than 200 million people have passed through its gates, and _
recession notwithstanding _ attendance last year alone was more
than 17 million.
	   Per capita expenditure among visitors to Tokyo Disneyland,
located in this suburb just east of the capital, is also typically
higher than other Disney parks. In 1997, the average visitor spent
about dlrs 75.
	   ``It's true that the economy is bad now but I think people in
times like these need something to take their minds off of their
troubles,'' said Toshio Kagami, president of Oriental Land Co.
which owns Disneyland and will also build, own and operate
DisneySea.
	   ``Our attendance hasn't dropped due to the economy. I think this
shows the high standards that we keep,'' Kagami said.
	   When asked if the timing of the project might be a problem
because of Japan's economy, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said
``I'm a bit of an expert on that. We built an expensive park in
Paris during an extremely robust economy and then opened it in a
recession.''
	   He says he would prefer to build in a recession and open when
the economy is strong.
	   Disney will license its names and characters and act as a
consultant in the park's construction and operation.
	   DisneySea will consist of seven areas.
	   One, dubbed Mysterious Island, is based on the stories of Jules
Verne, while the Mermaid Lagoon takes its inspiration from the
animated movie ``The Little Mermaid.''
	   An American Waterfront section will include reproductions of the
New York City waterfront at the beginning of the 20th century.
	   It's a ``totally different and unique'' Disney park, Eisner
said.
	   As yet more evidence that theme park investors aren't being
scared off by Japan's stagnant economy, MCA Inc. plans to start
construction later this month on a Universal Studios project in
Osaka, in western Japan.
	   That park, also slated to open in 2001, will feature rides based
on hit movies such as ``Back to the Future'' and ``Jurassic Park.''

SAN DIEGO: six saves.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Pettitte and Brown dueled evenly into the sixth, when the
Yankees moved ahead by the slightest of margins.
	   Derek Jeter singled with one out and slumping Paul O'Neill
doubled. Williams, the AL batting champion, hit a chopper in front
of the mound that Brown barehanded.
	   But Jeter quickly broke for home and Brown saw he had no play,
getting the out at first. Jeter took no chances, sliding home and
toppling Padres catcher Carlos Hernandez.
	   Williams finished 1-for-16 in the Series. He's eligible for free
agency, and there's been talk that he might leave for Arizona,
Colorado or another club and a salary of more than $10 million a
season.
	   In the eighth, Jeter led off with a walk and O'Neill reached on
an infield single. Both moved up on Williams' groundout and Brown
intentionally walked Tino Martinez to load the bases.
	   That brought up Brosius, acquired in the winter after hitting
just .203 last year for Oakland. The hero of Game 4 with two
homers, he hit an RBI single. Brosius went 8-for-17 in the series
with six RBIs.
	   Ledee followed with a sacrifice fly. He finished 6-for-10 in
three starts.
	   Brosius and Ledee provided the last of several highlights for
the Yankees this year, a season that included David Wells' perfect
game and the debut of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez.

Navy defuses World War II bomb in seaside town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GREAT YARMOUTH, England (AP) _ Navy experts defused a World War
II German bomb Thursday found in a harbor of this seaside resort
after some 600 residents were evacuated.
	   Royal Navy experts removed the fuse from the 550 pound (250
kilo) device and lowered it back on to the sea bed until it could
be completely dismantled later in the day.
	   ``This will allow many people to return to their home addresses,
although some houses and business premises close to the site should
remain clear,'' said a local police spokesman, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity. ``The bomb will be made
completely safe at a later time.''
	   The bomb was discovered Wednesday afternoon by a dredger in the
harbor. Police evacuated all the homes and businesses within 435
yards (400 meters).

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ How appropriate _ a sweep.
	   What else could it be for a New York Yankees team that is surely
one of the greatest in baseball history.
	   Andy Pettitte and the Yankees put the finishing touch on their
most dominant season by beating the San Diego Padres 3-0 Wednesday
night for a record 24th World Series championship.
	   It was New York's second title in three years and its first
sweep since 1950. The Game 4 victory gave the Yankees 125 wins _ a
total that ranks right up there with all the other big numbers put

Mexico's Silvia Molina wins literature award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Silvia Molina of Mexico has won this year's
Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz literature award for a novel dealing with
female adultery, the award's organizers announced.
	   The award, meant to honor writing by women in Spanish, is to be
given Dec. 2 at the University of Guadalajara's Book Fair. It is
named for the 17th-century Mexican nun considered one of the
greatest poets in the Spanish language.
	   As part of the award, Molina's winning novel, ``El Amor Que Me
Juraste'' (``The Love You Pledged Me''), is to be published in
English by Curbstone Press.
	   The award jury said Wednesday that it chose the work ``for its
maturity, subtlety, concision and sensibility in dealing with a
topic which continues to be a taboo in our society.''
	   Thirty novels from seven countries were considered for the
honor, which in past years has gone to writers such as Laura
Restrepo, Elena Garro, Tatiana Lobo and Marcela Serrano.
	   Molina, 52, earlier won the Xavier Villaurrutia award for her
1977 novel ``La Manana Debe Seguir Gris'' (``The Morning Should
Stay Gray'') and a national award in 1992 for her children's novel
``Mi Familia y la Bella Durmiente Cien Anos Despues'' (``My Family
and Sleeping Beauty 100 Years Later'').
	   She has taught at Mexico's National Autonomous University as
well as at Brigham Young University in the United States.

Brazil's Santos wins Conmebol Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Brazil's Santos tied Argentina's
Rosario Central 0-0 Wednesday night to win the Copa Conmebol.
	   After losing to Santos 1-0 earlier this month, Rosario Central
needed a win by two goals to walk away with the championship. A
home-field advantage and 46,000 cheering fans wasn't enough to
bring victory.
	   Looking to salvage an otherwise unremarkable league season,
Rosario dominated most of the game, pushing forward and looking to
score at every opportunity.
	   Santos threatened several times in the second half with
successful counterattacks. But Santos' goalkeeper, Zetti, made some
great saves, pushing away several Rosario opportunities and
preserving the tie.
	   Rough play carried over from their first meeting.
	   Both teams finished with 10 players after Santos' Eduardo
Marques was sent off in the 65th minute. Rosario Central's Cristian
Daniele exited in the 77th.
	   Despite the expulsions, neither team fielded all of their
starters as several had to sit out from the last game.
	   For Santos, it was the first time the team won an international
tournament in nearly 30 years.
	   Lineups:
	   Rosario Central: Jose Buljubasich, Dario Marra, German Gerbaudo,
Maximiliano Cuberas, Juan Ramon Jara, Hugo Gonzalez(Ezequiel
Gonzalez), Cristian Daniele, German Rivarola, Walter Gaitan, Rafael
Maceratesi(Manuel Ruiz) y Sebastian Flores Coronel.
	   Santos: Zetti, Anderson, Sandro, Claudiomiro, Athirson, Marcos
Basilio, Narciso, Eduardo Marques, Elder, Rodrigo(Bahiano) y
Alessandro(Adiel).

A look back at a magical Yankees season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Back on April 4, the Yankees were 0-3 for the
first time in 14 years and already the New York tabloids and talk
radio gurus were in a panic: No team had ever lost its first four
games and gone on to win the World Series.
	   ``I don't know that after three losses you can worry about
pressure,'' manager Joe Torre said that afternoon after a 7-3 loss
at Oakland. ``We're still not swinging the bats. We just couldn't
get anything going. We will. It's just a matter of time.''
	   One of the greatest seasons ever was about to start, and the
Yankees didn't even know it.
	   They got their first win the next day, 9-7 against the Athletics
behind Chuck Knoblauch's go-ahead sacrifice fly. They lost 8-0 the
next day at Seattle, and then the magic began.
	   An eight-game winning streak _ which included a win over Anaheim
at Shea Stadium after Yankee Stadium was temporarily closed because
of a fallen expansion joint _ put New York in first place.
	   After a loss at Detroit, the Yankees reeled off six more wins
and were atop the AL East to stay. Then, following a loss to
Toronto came an eight-game winning streak that ran the record to
23-6. They never looked back.
	   ``We've had an uncanny knack all year,'' said David Cone, a team
leader and often its chief spokesman. ``When we need to pitch well,
when we win 1-0 or 2-1, we get great pitching performances. And
when we need to score runs, it seems like we're able to match up
and do that. Is that character? Is it integrity? It's a team that
really picks each other up and pulls for each other.
	   ``We sense when the starter is struggling, then we score runs.
And vice versa. If the other pitcher does well and we need to hold
them down as a pitching staff, we do that as well.''
	   It all added up to a 114-48 regular season record, an 11-2
postseason mark and the team's second World Series title in three
seasons. Wednesday night's 3-0 win over the San Diego Padres gave
the Yankees their first Series sweep in 48 years and a .714 winning
percentage, the best _ regular and postseason _ since the '27
Yankees Murderers' Row team.
	   They destroyed records all along the way:
	   _ The 114 wins (including 50 in which they came from behind)
broke the old AL record of 111 by the '54 Cleveland Indians and was
the second-highest total ever, trailing only the 1906 Chicago Cubs,
who went 116-36. It also broke the team record set by the Babe
Ruth-Lou Gehrig team that went 110-44.
	   _ They played .700 ball in each of the first four months of the
season, the first team ever to do that.
	   _ They went 61-20 in the first half of the season, the best
record since baseball went to a 162-game schedule in 1961.
	   _ They took leads in 48 consecutive games starting June 28 at
the Mets, a streak not broken until a 9-4 loss at Minnesota on Aug.
20.
	   _ They clinched a postseason berth on Aug. 29, the earliest in
baseball history, and won their 100th game on Sept. 4, also the
earliest.
	   _ They matched a team record by finishing 66 games over .500,
the most in baseball since the '54 Indians went 111-43, and
finished with a 22-game lead over second-place Boston, the largest
victory margin ever for a Yankees team.
	   And all the accomplishments were spread out.
	   Tino Martinez (123) and Paul O'Neill (116) were the only players
to drive in 100 runs. Ten players hit 10 or more home runs.
	   Bernie Williams won the AL batting title at .339, and Derek
Jeter (.324), O'Neill (.317) and Scott Brosius (.300) all hit .300
or better.
	   Cone (20-7) became a 20-game winner for the first time in 10
years, David Wells went 18-4 _ including his perfect game against
Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17 _ Andy Pettitte went 16-11
and Orlando Hernandez was 12-4 after joining the team in June.
	   Hideki Irabu, who didn't even pitch in the postseason, was 13-9.
	   Mariano Rivera backed the starters with 36 saves, and all that
led to a 10-game winning streak, a pair of nine-game streaks,
another pair of eight-game streaks, plus a seven-game streak and a
six-game streak.
	   After the first three games, they didn't lose three in a row
until Aug. 23-26, when they dropped four straight against Anaheim
and Texas. They had a pair of three-game losing streaks in
September, dropping eight of 12 as middle relievers fought
injuries, then closed with seven straight wins against Cleveland
and Tampa Bay. That started a stretch of 18 wins in their final 20
games, including the postseason. And they went through October
without Darryl Strawberry, recovering from colon cancer surgery
following his finest season since 1991.
	   ``This ballclub, they're going to take MVP votes away from each
other,'' Torre said. ``It's a great feeling for a manager to know
when these guys come to the field, the only thing they're
interested in is winning the game. They don't care who gets the
winning hit. They all want to get the game-winning hit, but they
don't want to talk about it. It's a very unusual club.''

Popular Japanese architect Miyawaki dies at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mayumi Miyawaki, a popular Japanese architect known
for his designs of modern housing, has died of pharyngeal cancer, a
family member said Thursday. He was 62.
	   Miyawaki, who underwent surgery for cancer of the larynx last
year, died Wednesday at Tokyo's Keio University hospital, where he
had been receiving treatment.
	   A graduate of the University of Tokyo's graduate school,
Miyawaki sought the coexistence of traditional and modern
architectural styles in his work.
	   In 1980, he was awarded the Architectural Institute of Japan
prize for his modern housing designs.
	   Miyawaki, who frequently appeared on television shows, was one
of the lead designers for the ongoing urban development of Rokko
Island, built on reclaimed land in the western Japanese city of
Kobe.
	   He is survived by a daughter and son.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ How appropriate _ a sweep.
	   What else could it be for a New York Yankees team that is surely
one of the greatest in baseball history.
	   Andy Pettitte and the Yankees put the finishing touch on their
most dominant season by beating the San Diego Padres 3-0 Wednesday
night for a record 24th World Series championship.
	   ``This is the top,'' weeping owner George Steinbrenner said.
``This is truly one of the greatest teams in baseball history. I've
never seen anything like this. They don't quit and seem to overcome
everything.''
	   It was New York's second title in three years and its first
sweep since 1950. The Game 4 victory gave the Yankees 125 wins _ a
total that ranks right up there with all the other big numbers put
up in baseball this year. Their 114 regular-season victories were
the most ever for a champion.
	   And it was a tribute to a team vastly different from all those
other pinstriped winners. Without a Ruth, DiMaggio or Mantle among
them _ no certain Hall of Famers and no one even elected to start
in the All-Star game this season _ these Yankees posted a .714
winning percentage, the best in the majors since their Murderers'
Row club of 1927.
	   ``This is the most determined team I've been around,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``I don't know if we have the best team of
all time, but I do know that we have the best record.''
	   The Padres, the only team in the majors that did not get swept
in a series this year, beat 100-game winners Houston and Atlanta in
the NL playoffs. A record crowd of 65,247 saluted San Diego players
who came back on the field after the game.
	   ``We got close,'' first baseman Wally Joyner told the fans,
``and it was very special because of you.''
	   Pettitte shut out San Diego into the eighth inning while the
Yankees hitters did just enough to bring down ace Kevin Brown.
	   Bernie Williams, perhaps playing his last game for New York,
broke a scoreless tie with an RBI chopper in the sixth. In the
seventh, Series MVP Scott Brosius singled home a run and surprising
rookie Ricky Ledee hit a sacrifice fly.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the eighth, when Tony Gwynn's
eighth hit of the Series finished Pettitte. A single by Ken
Caminiti off Mariano Rivera loaded the bases with two outs, but Jim
Leyritz, a postseason hero in the past for the Yankees and San
Diego, flied out to Williams.
	   The sweep was the first since Cincinnati upset Oakland in 1990,
and was the Yankees' seventh. Also, New York won its eighth
straight Series game while the Padres lost their seventh in a row.
	   For a team that led the AL in pitching and scoring, it was a
complete performance that produced its seventh straight win in this
postseason.
	   Plus, perhaps the Yankees had something else going for them _
inspiration from slugger Darryl Strawberry, out because of colon
cancer. All the Yankees had his No. 39 embroidered on their caps.
	   Pettitte won just six days after his father underwent heart
bypass surgery, allowing five hits in 7 1-3 innings. It was
reminiscent of his performance in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series,
when he beat Atlanta 1-0.
	   ``This is more gratifying than the Game 5 victory,'' Pettitte
said. ``It has been an up-and-down year, especially with the
situation with my dad. He's home watching. I know he's at home with
a big smile on his face.''
	   Brown, who could not hold a three-run lead in the seventh inning
of Game 1, took the loss.
	   Rivera closed out his spectacular postseason, getting the last
four outs for his third save of the Series. Including the playoff
wins over Texas and Cleveland, he pitched 13 1-3 scoreless innings
and recorded six saves.
	   Pettitte and Brown dueled evenly into the sixth, when the
Yankees moved ahead by the slightest of margins.
	   Derek Jeter singled with one out and slumping Paul O'Neill
doubled. Williams, the AL batting champion, hit a chopper in front
of the mound that Brown barehanded.
	   But Jeter quickly broke for home and Brown saw he had no play,
getting the out at first. Jeter took no chances, sliding home and
toppling Padres catcher Carlos Hernandez.
	   Williams finished 1-for-16 in the Series. He's eligible for free
agency, and there's been talk that he might leave for Arizona,
Colorado or another club and a salary of more than dlrs 10 million
a season.
	   In the eighth, Jeter led off with a walk and O'Neill reached on
an infield single, a close play dispute by Brown and manager Bruce
Bochy. Both runners moved up on Williams' groundout and Brown
intentionally walked Tino Martinez to load the bases.
	   That brought up Brosius, acquired in the winter after hitting
just .203 last year for Oakland. The hero of Game 4 with two
homers, he hit an RBI single. Brosius went 8-for-17 in the series
with six RBIs.
	   Ledee followed with a sacrifice fly. He finished 6-for-10 in
three starts.
	   Brosius and Ledee provided the last of several highlights for
the Yankees this year, a season that included David Wells' perfect
game and the debut of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez.
	   Brown retired the first 10 batters in order with 96 mph (154
kph) fastballs and 94 mph (151 kph) sinkers, and breezed before
running into trouble in the fifth.
	   A single by Martinez and a double by Ledee put Brown in trouble
with one out, but he escaped by snaring Joe Girardi's hard
comebacker and coming back from a 3-1 count to strike out a
swinging Pettitte.
