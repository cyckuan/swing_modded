<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to GOP voters, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.'' He nows leads Bush in the hunt for
1,034 delegates at the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan with room to spare. It
further damaged Bush's aura as the inevitable GOP nominee, and propelled both
men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's Michigan chairman. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush was
supported by two-thirds of the Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the
party for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew a smaller percentage bedrock Republicans than in South Carolina.
McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives, union
members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the previous
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 76 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
532,422 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 472,779, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 59 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 156,324
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 93,160 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 31
of the 58 at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates. Although Bush gained at least three delegates Tuesday, he
only had 64 delegates to date; McCain had 75.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain suggested to supporters
that he, not Bush, would be the best general election candidate. ``We are Al
Gore's worst nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by victory, McCain decided Tuesday night to air TV ads in
northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After
losing South Carolina, he told his staff to ease up their efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's main focus, however, will be California. He plans to spend seven of
the next 12 days in the state that awards 162 delegates to the March 7 primary
winner, sources said. He is counting on his strong showing in New Hampshire to
give him a boost in New England states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   With McCain now setting the agenda, Bush has decided to cancel a Virginia
trip early next week to to head to Washington state instead, keeping pace with
McCain, who will be there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush also would
increase his criticisms of McCain, starting with complaints that the senator's
campaign accused him of anti-Catholic bias. Look for Bush and his TV ads to call
into question McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996 and 1992. Three-quarters of
McCain's vote came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote
came from bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls show McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and
appeared to have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true
reformer and straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and
independents, McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain won the majority of Republicans, even as one in four
voters in his home state said the senator didn't have the temperment to serve
effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned side-by-side in Michigan with Engler, who appeared to draw
some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and
conservative South Carolina, Michigan tested the candidates' ability to appeal
to a large, diverse electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to the March 7 contests, Bush stopped in Missouri, then flew
to California after the voting in Michigan. He has operations in all 13 states
that vote that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan was fertile ground for McCain's populist pitch; the state supported
the independent presidential bid of Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 and gave Ross Perot
19 percent of its vote in the 1992 election. Pat Buchanan's anti-trade populism
earned him a third of the vote in the 1996 GOP primary.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stand on Taiwan Worries U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed concern Tuesday over
a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. diplomats relayed the administration's concerns to Chinese authorities
in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an
11,000-word position paper.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart recalled that the
United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region to
calm a crisis four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the
sides is the way to move forward,'' he said. ``We have repeated, I think, in
both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Stanley O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Chinese
position paper appeared to be contrary to ``the policy that is the bedrock of
our relations'' with China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter B. Slocombe, an undersecretary of defense who returned this week from
high-level talks in Beijing, was quoted by The Washington Post in its Wednesday
issue as saying China would face ``incalculable consequences'' if it followed
through on its threats.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Chinese policy statement, ``if it says what it appears to say,
is a new and troubling formula.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress, where support for Taiwan runs strong, suggested the
administration was not repudiating the Chinese with enough force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to articulate more clearly where we are,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said China's statement ``is unacceptable'' and
that the administration had the responsibility to make sure that China ``not
misinterpret where we are -- in one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be a mistake
to exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had much worse periods on this question in the past,'' he said. He
added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to
legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S.-Taiwanese military relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said military ties with Taiwan, authorized under the Taiwan Relations
Act, has enabled the United States to be ``second-to-none'' in its support of
the anti-communist bastion. He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest
ports, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other
warships to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   China's muscle-flexing at the time was related to impending presidential
elections. The new threat from Beijing appeared aimed at influencing
presidential elections on Taiwan set for next month. Analysts said China seems
intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified with the
pro-independence sector on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart recalled that in 1996, ``we responded appropriately to what was
viewed as a threat. And that should give you some indication of how we view this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said there has been no change in
U.S. military operations in the Pacific in response to the threat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only rhetoric at this point,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said ``it would be extremely difficult for China to carry out an
invasion'' of Taiwan, given the Chinese military's limited capacity to execute a
large amphibious operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, Taiwan's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan's
China policy, would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would
not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each
side is controlled by a separate government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we unify, both sides of course will have different views about what
'one China' means,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton's drive to win
congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China, part of a deal
to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for
global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes of blocking
the trade package. Lockhart insisted that it should not affect the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement is very much in our country's interest and our national
interest,'' he said. ``This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American
business, American workers, American families. We should move forward on that
basis.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Buoyed by Win  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Savoring a pair of GOP primary victories only partly built
by members of his own party, John McCain exhorted fellow Republicans on Tuesday
night to join him, not fear him. ``We are creating a new majority, my friends,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator, in his victory speech after winning in Michigan and his
home state, spoke hopefully of a new ``McCain majority'' that seeks to embrace
traditional Republicans as well as the independents and Democrats who came out
for him in the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to fool you about me,'' he said of the opponents in Gov. George
W. Bush's camp who are portraying him as not Republican or conservative enough.
``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican party. It is my home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where you belong, in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald
Reagan,'' he said, invoking two presidents who reached across party lines.
``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans -- join it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicated the challenge facing McCain in winning over
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Just over half of the Michigan voters were independents or Democrats, and
they overwhelmingly backed McCain. Bush easily won among Michigan Republicans,
taking two-thirds of that vote. McCain did win a majority of Republicans in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three days earlier, McCain was all bravado as he glared from the podium
and vowed to crush Bush, the Texas governor who had stolen his New Hampshire
thunder by winning the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But the truth is that McCain had not been nearly that confident about his
chances in the Michigan presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Phew!'' he exclaimed as he watched from the protective comfort of his own
couch, as the earliest, razor-thin results from Michigan rolled in from the
television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We jumped up and we were excited,'' said the understated political
director John Weaver, who persuaded McCain to run in the first place and sat
next to him at the crucial moment. ``We didn't say anything. Nothing needed to
be said.''
</P>
<P>
	   A while later, McCain was standing before an adoring crowd, soaking up his
wins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, Michigan sent a powerful message across America -- a message that
our party wants real reform from the real reformer,'' he said, playing off of
Bush's own claim to be a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   He asserted: ``We are Al Gore's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
	   But his road ahead is long and geared most immediately to the West Coast.
McCain is going Wednesday to Washington state but plans to spend seven of the
next 12 days in California, competing for that state's huge haul of delegates in
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   No longer planning to simply cede Virginia to Bush, McCain also planned at
least to run some ads in the northern part of the state. Virginians vote
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan was McCain's lifeline, aides acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything about his body language earlier in the day indicated his
confidence was not high.
</P>
<P>
	   Casting a vote for himself during his only event, McCain
uncharacteristically stayed clear of reporters and cut off questioning when it
strayed beyond general topics. Before he could be asked about Bush's charge that
he was spreading rumors that the Texas governor was anti-Catholic, McCain turned
his back on the press gaggle and jumped into his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush campaigned in Michigan until the polls there closed, McCain stayed
at home with his family through the afternoon, creating a media blackout that
was unusual for a candidate who promised during the heady days of his New
Hampshire campaign to ``kill 'em with access.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Not Influenced by Engler  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Michigan Gov. John Engler was supposed to rouse Republicans and turn the
state's GOP primary into a firewall for George W. Bush, but it didn't work out
that way. Exit polls provided some details of the Engler effect:
</P>
<P>
	   --A sixth of all voters said Engler's role influenced their vote a great
deal -- but they went for John McCain by a 3-to-1 margin. About a third said his
role influenced them somewhat or not much and they went for Bush by 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   --Half of all voters said Engler's role didn't influence them at all and
McCain won that group by 20 points. Almost half of Republicans also said
Engler's role didn't influence them at all.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among McCain supporters who said Engler's support of Bush mattered a great
deal in their vote, 9 in 10 said they prefer a presidential candidate who is not
tied to party leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   --Three of 10 Democrats who voted in the primary said Engler's support of
Bush had a great deal of influence on their vote. The number of Democrats who
said it had a great deal of influence was three times the number of Republicans
who felt that way. Democrats voted overwhelmingly for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ideologically, the biggest group that said Engler's support of Bush had a
great deal of influence on their vote described themselves as liberals, a group
that went overwhelmingly for McCain. Almost a third of liberals said it had a
great deal of influence, while one of 10 conservatives felt that way.
</P>
<P>
	   --A fourth of McCain voters who were casting their first GOP primary ballots
said Engler's support of Bush had a great deal of influence on their vote.
</P>

support had a great deal of influence on them.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers 4, Avalanche 3  </HEADLINE>
    By AARON J. LOPEZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Ray Ferraro scored on rebound midway through the final period
as the Atlanta Thrashers ended a 12-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory over
the slumping Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert Vasiljevs added his first career goal for the expansion Thrashers,
who won for the first time since Jan. 14. Atlanta (12-41-6) also ended a 16-game
winless streak.
</P>
<P>
	   After scoring seven goals in the last five games, Atlanta capitalized on
Colorado penalties by converting 3 of 6 power-play chances.
</P>
<P>
	   The third power-play goal proved to be the difference as Ferraro followed
Hnat Domenichelli's shot from the slot, slipped behind Avalanche goalie Marc
Denis in the crease and pushed the puck over the line with 9:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado, 1-4-1 in its last six, failed to convert a power play after
Ferraro's goal and finished the night 0-for-3 with a man-advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta goalie Scott Langkow turned away several desperation shots in the
final three minutes and finished with 34 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandis Ozolinsh scored two goals for the Avalanche, but he committed a
costly turnover that Vasiljevs, a fellow Latvian, turned into a breakaway goal
that tied the game 3-3 at 7:27 of the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Ozolinsh had given the Avalanche a 3-2 lead with a wrist shot from the right
slot at 4:09.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta, which has one of the NHL's worst power-play units, converted two of
its first three chances, the second coming when Patrik Stefan redirected a shot
from the slot to give the Thrashers a 2-1 lead at 11:57 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche pulled even heading into the third when Chris Drury took a
centering pass from Alex Tanguay and beat Langkow for his 18th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan Hejduk picked up his 100th career point on the play when he was
credited with the second assist.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams traded goals in the first period as Ozolinsh scored from the slot
at 5:27 and Nelson Emerson countered nine seconds into a power play, beating
Denis from a bad angle at 17:49.
</P>
<P>
	   Denis made his second straight start in place of Patrick Roy, sidelined by a
strained groin. Roy needs one victory to tie Jacques Plante (434) for second on
the NHL's career list.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Conservatives Rally To Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain successfully countered George W. Bush's
conservative appeal in Michigan on Tuesday by building a big advantage among
moderates and by reaching broadly outside the party, exit polls indicated.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic participation in Michigan's Republican presidential primary was
twice that of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and independents heavily favored McCain, while Bush was drawing
strong support from Republicans. GOP voters made up less than half the total
voters, according to exit polls by Voter News Service taken for The Associated
Press and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, Republicans made up almost two thirds of the total vote in
the state's GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In Macomb County just north of Detroit, independent voter Linda Szymanski,
said she voted for McCain because: ``I like the honesty thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he deserves a shot at least of making it to the general
election,'' said the 45-year-old mother of two. ``I'm not real happy with the
presidency and the Bush family line and the Clinton family line. I'd like to see
some honesty in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Gov. John Engler's high-profile and personal push for Bush appeared
to pay few dividends.
</P>
<P>
	   A sixth of voters interviewed in exit polls said he had a great deal of
influence on their decision -- but they voted overwhelmingly for McCain. About
the same number said he influenced them somewhat and they backed Bush by a
2-to-1 margin. Half said he was not an influence at all and McCain led that
group. Engler said his failure to counter McCain's Democratic appeal might have
been ``a big strategic error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most voters said they wanted a candidate who was not tied to Republican
party leaders, and they tended to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain was backed overwhelmingly by most demographic groups in
his home state, according to the exit polls. McCain even led Bush among
self-described Republicans in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates put most of their campaigns' emphasis on Michigan, where
some Republican voters expressed concern about the role played by
non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Comben, a 40-year-old computer developer and conservative who
generally votes Republican, said he made certain to vote for Bush because of
concerns the race would be tight. And he was worried about ``the concerted
effort by Democrats to drum up support for McCain just to spite Engler.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, governor of Texas, had better than a 2-to-1 advantage among
Republicans, while McCain had a similar margin among independents and an 8-to-1
advantage among Democrats, who made up almost a fifth of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Three fourths of Bush's overall vote was Republican and the rest independent
with a smattering of Democrats. Conservatives made up two-thirds of Bush's
support, while moderates made up a third. Four of 10 were religious
conservatives, while just over half were not. Almost two-thirds were abortion
opponents. More than half his supporters thought issues were more important than
personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth of McCain's supporters in Michigan were Republican, four of 10 were
independent and almost a third Democrats. Almost half described themselves as
moderate, just over a fourth were conservative and a fourth said they were at
least somewhat liberal. Almost six of 10 of his voters said personal qualities
were more important.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain seemed to connect with Michigan voters on themes that helped him win
big in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of Michigan voters credited McCain with saying what he believes
and not just what people want to hear. Only about four in 10 said the same about
Bush. About half said McCain was a real reformer, while about four in 10 said
Bush was a reformer. McCain won a majority of the veterans, about a fifth of all
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had a slight edge when voters were asked who had the better chance to
win in November, 50-46.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results were from interviews of 2,339 voters in 45 precincts around
Michigan. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points,
larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona's GOP primary, McCain was winning among those who cared most
about a candidate's military record, about picking someone who was not a typical
politician and someone who stands up for what he believes in. Bush led among
voters who most wanted someone who could win in November or who best represented
conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Neville, 74, of Phoenix said her vote for McCain was as much a vote
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like George Bush because he always has a smirk on his face,'' she
said, ``and I think any president that has a grin on his face all the time is
probably going to lie to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, the poll results were from interviews around the state with
2,191 voters in 40 precincts on Tuesday and 260 absentee voters surveyed by
telephone Feb. 15-19. The margin of sampling error for the combined results was
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Flunked Drug Test  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry tested
positive for cocaine on Jan. 19 and might once again be suspended from baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A high-ranking baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said Tuesday the commissioner's office is investigating and a
decision whether to take disciplinary action likely would be made by Thursday at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry is tested two or three times a week as part of his no-contest
plea on May 26, 1999, to charges of cocaine possession and soliciting a
prostitute. He was sentenced to 18 months of probation and 100 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
	   The official did not say what disciplinary action the sport was likely to
take against Strawberry. But given his past penalties, a suspension that would
last most if not all of this season appears likely. Rich Levin, the spokesman
for commissioner Bud Selig, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and general manager Brian Cashman also
declined comment on the news, first reported by WTVT in Tampa and WLWT in
Cincinnati. WLWT obtained the three-page report on the probation violation from
the Florida Department of Corrections and made it available to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight-time All-Star, who came back from colon cancer surgery in October
1998, was counted on the Yankees to be their primary designated hitter this
season following the retirement of Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Yankees manager Joe Torre gave a hint that something may have
been up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a sense something will happen here that will stir the pot,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, who has been working out at the Yankees complex, could not be
contacted after positive test became known. He lives a gated community, Cheval,
just north of Tampa in the suburb of Lutz.
</P>
<P>
	   He already has served two drug-related suspensions.
</P>
<P>
	   The first, for 60 days, was in 1995 after he tested positive for cocaine.
The second, from April 24 to Aug. 4 last season, came after he was arrested in
Tampa last April 4 for possessing 0.3 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, who turns 38 next month, didn't rejoin the Yankees until Sept.
1, but hit .327 with three homers and six RBIs. In the postseason, he batted
.333 (5-for-15) with two homers and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 8 report by correction probation specialist Shelley J. Tomlinson,
which was approved by deputy regional director Nancy L. Ham and signed by
Hillsborough County Circuit Judge Florence Foster, said Strawberry did not make
a statement about the violation on the advice of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The report did not ask that Strawberry's probation be revoked or modified.
It recommended Strawberry ``remain under supervision with enhanced treatment
sanctions and continued urine monitoring 2-to-3 times per week.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the report said Strawberry should receive ``updated
substance-abuse evaluation'' and have weekly counseling and continue to attend
Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joel Solomon, the medical adviser to the players' association,
recommended ``an enhancement of his aftercare program consisting of regular
individual therapy sessions while in Tampa and also once he moves to New York,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Department of Corrections regional director Joe Papy said Strawberry
has been tested by baseball three times a week since May and that the Jan. 19
result was the only one that has returned positive.
</P>
<P>
	   Papy said the recommendation for enhanced supervision and treatment was
typical in cases like Strawberry's because officials anticipate relapses.
Substance abuse counselors will determine the best way to help the outfielder
after meeting with Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they try to do is determine why someone who's been getting three
negatives a week all of a sudden tests positive ... Something had to happen,''
Papy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year, has a .259 career
average with 335 homers and 1,000 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   His relapse with drugs last spring came while he was undergoing
chemotherapy, which he claimed led to depression.
</P>
<P>
	   He had surgery on Oct. 3, 1998, to remove a 16-inch portion of his large
intestine to rid him of a cancerous colon tumor almost 2 1/2 inches long. At the
time, doctors said the cancer did not appear to have spread.
</P>
<P>
	   At Strawberry's sentencing, Florida Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. ordered
him to stay out of bars and asked police and prosecutors to supply Strawberry
with a map of Tampa ``hot spots'' to avoid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This really isn't about baseball,'' the judge said. ``It isn't about your
job, but about you. ... This is about what's in your heart and what's in your
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you stop producing, nobody will care about you,'' he added. ``If this
is the picture of life after baseball, it's not pretty. This is only an
opportunity. I hope you make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without being asked, Strawberry replied: ``I will.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry spent the first eight seasons of his career with the New York
Mets, then became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers, his hometown team
while growing up in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dodgers released him on May 26, 1994, in the midst of his 28 days at the
Betty Ford Center for a substance-abuse problem. San Francisco signed him the
following month but released him the following Feb. 8 following the positive
cocaine test that led to the 60-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry's latest problem is likely to help Tim Raines, Roberto Kelly and
possibly Felix Jose, who are in camp on minor league contracts trying to make
the team. Nick Johnson, another possibility, hasn't played above Double-A but
hit .345 at Double-A Norwich with 14 homers and 87 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer, who had been expected to battle for a spot in
left field, also are possible replacements at DH along with Jim Leyritz,
reacquired last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Charisse, is five months pregnant with the couple's third child.
Strawberry also has two children from a previous marriage.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to GOP voters, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.'' He nows leads Bush in the hunt for
1,034 delegates at the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan with room to spare. It
further damaged Bush's aura as the inevitable GOP nominee, and propelled both
men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's Michigan chairman. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush was
supported by two-thirds of the Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the
party for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew a smaller percentage bedrock Republicans than in South Carolina.
McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives, union
members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the previous
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 80 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
560,684 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 494,731, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 69 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 161,770
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 96,473 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 46
of the 58 at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates. Although Bush gained at least three delegates Tuesday, he
only had 64 delegates to date; McCain had 90.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain suggested to supporters
that he, not Bush, would be the best general election candidate. ``We are Al
Gore's worst nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by victory, McCain decided Tuesday night to air TV ads in
northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After
losing South Carolina, he told his staff to ease up their efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's main focus, however, will be California. He plans to spend seven of
the next 12 days in the state that awards 162 delegates to the March 7 primary
winner, sources said. He is counting on his strong showing in New Hampshire to
give him a boost in New England states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   With McCain now setting the agenda, Bush has decided to cancel a Virginia
trip early next week to to head to Washington state instead, keeping pace with
McCain, who will be there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush also would
increase his criticisms of McCain, starting with complaints that the senator's
campaign accused him of anti-Catholic bias. Look for Bush and his TV ads to call
into question McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996 and 1992. Three-quarters of
McCain's vote came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote
came from bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls show McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and
appeared to have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true
reformer and straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and
independents, McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 127, Magic 91  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM COUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rashard Lewis scored 21 points and Emanual Davis hit five
3-pointers and scored 17 points in the Seattle SuperSonics' highest-scoring game
of the season, a 127-91 victory over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Payton and Brent Barry, Seattle's starting backcourt, had 17 and 16
points, respectively, against a Magic team coming off a demoralizing overtime
loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Ruben Patterson also had 17 points for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, a reserve guard averaging 3.7 points a game, hit three 3-pointers
when Seattle went on a 22-0 run in the second quarter to break the game open.
</P>
<P>
	   Chucky Atkins led the Magic with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis was at his best when Seattle scored 22 unanswered points in the second
period that gave the Sonics a 55-31 lead with 2:51 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic went almost six minutes without a point. Ben Wallace's dunk after
an offensive rebound was Orlando's first basket since Atkins hit a 16-footer
with 3:54 gone in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   With Seattle ahead 33-31, Davis connected on a 3-pointer with 7:49 left in
the first half. After Davis made two 3-pointers, Payton had a three-point play
to give the Sonics a 24-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics widened the lead in the third quarter as Davis made two more
3-pointers to make it 99-60 going into the final period. He sank a 3 during an
11-0 run by Seattle that gave the Sonics a 71-38 lead. His 3-pointer with 6:36
remaining in the third quarter put Seattle in front 78-39.
</P>
<P>
	   Notes: Playing against his former team for the first time, Horace Grant of
the Sonics had 10 points and six rebounds. ... Corey Maggette, who was traded on
draft day last June by the Sonics for Grant, had 13 points off the bench. ...
The Sonics and the Magic met for the first time in two seasons. Seattle beat
Orlando for the 13th time in 15 games in Seattle. ... Seattle's Vin Baker had
two points and six rebounds in 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to GOP voters, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.'' He nows leads Bush in the hunt for
1,034 delegates at the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, humbled by defeat, said, ``This is a marathon and I'm going to be in
it all the way to the end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a see-sawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
followup showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan with room to spare. It
further damaged Bush's aura as the inevitable GOP nominee, and propelled both
men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's Michigan chairman. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush was
supported by two-thirds of the Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the
party for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew a smaller percentage bedrock Republicans than in South Carolina.
McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives, union
members and Baby Boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the previous
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 80 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
560,684 votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 494,731, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 69 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 161,770
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 96,473 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 46
of the 58 at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates. Although Bush gained at least six delegates Tuesday, he only
had 67 delegates to date; McCain had 90.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start realize his cross-party coalition would beat Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain suggested to supporters
that he, not Bush, would be the best general election candidate. ``We are Al
Gore's worst nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by victory, McCain decided Tuesday night to air TV ads in
northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After
losing South Carolina, he told his staff to ease up their efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's main focus, however, will be California. He plans to spend seven of
the next 12 days in the state that awards 162 delegates to the March 7 primary
winner, sources said. He is counting on his strong showing in New Hampshire to
give him a boost in New England states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   With McCain now setting the agenda, Bush has decided to cancel a Virginia
trip early next week to to head to Washington state instead, keeping pace with
McCain, who will be there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush also would
increase his criticisms of McCain, starting with complaints that the senator's
campaign accused him of anti-Catholic bias. Look for Bush and his TV ads to call
into question McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996 and 1992. Three-quarters of
McCain's vote came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote
came from bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls show McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and
appeared to have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true
reformer and straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and
independents, McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, anti-abortion and strongly
conservative. They cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting
for him. Religious right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain won the majority of Republicans, even as one in four
voters in his home state said the senator didn't have the temperment to serve
effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned side-by-side in Michigan with Engler, who appeared to draw
some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and
conservative South Carolina, Michigan tested the candidates' ability to appeal
to a large, diverse electorate.

<HEADLINE> Utah Set To Rename Day To Honor MLK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Senate voted Tuesday to rename the state's
Human Rights Day in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. If Gov. Mike Leavitt
approves, it will make Utah the last state to recognize the slain civil rights
leader by name.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, when the federal government and many states decided to celebrate a
King holiday on the third Monday of January, Utah legislators instead created
Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill passed Tuesday changes the day to specifically honor King and also
swaps the name Presidents Day for Washington-Lincoln Day, a condition imposed by
the House in return for its approval Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire celebrated its first Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Day
last month, and some Southern states, including Virginia and South Carolina,
celebrate King's birthday in conjunction with state holidays honoring
Confederate leaders.

turned out to be a wallet, when he pulled it out, "that was it," attorney John
Patten told the jury. "You can't expect (the officers) to stand there and get

<HEADLINE> Elian's Mother's Story Contradicted  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- Cuban officials insist that Elian Gonzalez's mother
undertook her fatal journey to the United States under threat from a brutal
boyfriend with a long criminal record.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban exiles in Miami insist she did it to bring her son to freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of Elisabeth Brotons' friends in her home town of Cardenas believe
she left neither to pursue freedom nor because she was threatened. She just
wanted to be with her boyfriend, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can say she did what she did because of love,'' said Lisbeth Garcia, 28,
who worked alongside Brotons as a hotel chambermaid.
</P>
<P>
	   What emerges from interviews in the couple's home province is a love story
between a hardworking young woman in good standing with the Communist Party and
an anxious young man who liked to buck the system.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has depicted the boyfriend, Lazaro Munero, as a violent
felon, but residents statements indicate that is likely an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not categorize him as a criminal,'' said Seida Garcia, a former
school official in the small town of Jaguey Grande, where Munero was transferred
after misbehaving at another school down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Munero and Brotons were killed along with nine other people when the boat
they were riding in sank in the Atlantic. Clinging to an inner tube, Elian
survived two days alone at sea until he was rescued on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy is now living in Miami with his paternal great uncle, who is
fighting to keep him in the United States, claiming his mother died trying to
bring him to freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's communist government has turned the case into a major national
crusade, demanding that the boy be returned to his father in Cuba and insisting
Brotons made the trip under ``threats and violence'' from Munero.
</P>
<P>
	   Brotons did not tell her friends of her plans to leave Cuba. Those who knew
her said she earned about $50 a month as a hotel maid -- about five times the
average salary in Cuba but possibly not enough to resist the United States' lure
of plenty.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet she was a member of the Communist Party, and never spoke of any desire
to go to the United States, her friends said.
</P>
<P>
	   To understand the story of Lazaro and Elisabeth is to understand life in
Cardenas, where the Party controls most of daily life, where many people still
get around by horse and buggy and where earning an extra buck through prohibited
activities is common.
</P>
<P>
	   A big banner near the city's entrance reads: ``Elian, your city awaits
you!''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of what the Cuban government has said about Munero is true: that he
once broke into a tourist's hotel room, that he was kicked out of a high school
for dropping feces-filled cans into a courtyard, that he illegally used his car
as a taxi and sold beer on the black market.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's also true that the Cuban government, which employs widespread
surveillance, turned over virtually every rock in Munero's life looking for the
dirt they eventually found.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. immigration authorities earlier said that they believed Munero earned
money by smuggling aliens and charged passengers for the fatal trip. Although
the two adults who survived with Elian said they paid Munero $1,000 each for the
journey, it appears unlikely that he made his living as an alien smuggler
because he made only one other known previous trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's Communist Party daily Granma recently published a long expose
describing Munero's ``fines, convictions for armed robberies, felonies, swindle,
the crime of buying and selling stolen goods, all sorts of illegal activities,
alcohol abuse and others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several of Brotons' friends in Cardenas said they heard about Munero's
violent personality in government news reports after the tragedy, but never
actually saw him mistreat Brotons. In fact, some said he treated both her and
Elian well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was very good to the boy. Every morning, they would wait for Elisa to
catch her bus and then Lazaro would take the boy to school,'' Lisbeth Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Added 67-year-old Clemente Robaina, whose daughter is married to Brotons'
brother Pedro: ``To me he was a good person.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other acquaintances echoed the government's position, calling Munero a bully
and a thug.
</P>
<P>
	   Few were willing to speak well of Munero, which would mean contradicting the
party line.
</P>
<P>
	   One man neighbors described as Munero's best friend refused to let his name
be used or even speak about the case, saying he could get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Elian's former neighbors said she thinks Munero got a bum rap.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The dead don't talk. Who will defend him now?'' she said, refusing to give
her name because she said she could ``go to jail for 20 years'' for publicly
disagreeing with the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper Granma said Munero, as an 18-year-old in 1993, was convicted
for breaking into a hotel room in the nearby tourist mecca of Varadero and
stealing from a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government says the conviction proves Munero was a crook. But
Hector Reyes, the hotel's security chief, described the incident as minor.

<HEADLINE> Violence Plaguing Turkey's Prisons  </HEADLINE>
   By HARMONIE TOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The Islamic militant inmates used guns, swords,
knives, even makeshift flame-throwers and firebombs to battle guards entering
their prison ward. It was only the latest riot in Turkey's penitentiaries, and
Turkish officials say they must regain control.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey's prisons have been plagued by violence, including riots,
hostage-takings and shootouts.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem, says Ali Suat Ertosun, director of Turkey's prisons, is the
large wards that house up to 100 prisoners, who often all belong to a single
political group and run their blocks independently.
</P>
<P>
	   So authorities aim to move the inmates out of the wards into smaller cells,
Ertosun said.
</P>
<P>
	   But prisoners linked to radical groups say they will fight to the death
before they agree to leave their comrades and enter small cells, where they fear
they are more likely to be abused by authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has already begun.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, 10 inmates were killed in a prison riot in Ankara when
inmates, fearing that authorities were planning to transfer comrades to another
prison, clashed with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors accuse 86 of the rioters of accidentally killing the 10. Inmates
say security forces killed the prisoners and that they are being charged as part
of a cover-up. A court ruled Tuesday that the inmates should be charged with
committing a terrorist act against the state.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, inmates loyal to a radical Islamic group, the Islamic Great
Eastern Raiders-Front, injured 54 soldiers and took over 100 hostage at
Istanbul's Metris prison to protest plans to transfer some of them out of a
ward.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest rioting was also at Metris, where prisoners last month fought
soldiers for 12 hours in a vain attempt to stop them from entering a ward to
take the group's leader to court. Some prisoners apparently feared that soldiers
would not return Salih Mirzabeyoglu but would take him to a new prison that had
cells. In the end, one inmate was killed, 11 injured, and Mirzabeyoglu was
transferred to a cell.
</P>
<P>
	   The ward at Metris is now a wreck. Its floors are covered in rotten food,
half-burnt furniture litters the area and entire slabs of walls lie broken by
soldiers who had to fight their way in. Authorities showed journalists the array
of makeshift weapons the inmates used.
</P>
<P>
	   Prisoners say conditions in the wards are terrible and often stage hunger
strikes to protest conditions that include overcrowding and poor food and
medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, prisoners are so scared of being transferred out of
their wards that they even refuse medical treatment, fearing that authorities
will use the occasion to put them in a cell, said Erkan Yirdem, a member of an
association of relatives of leftist prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to isolate the prisoners, then they can hurt them or even kill
them,'' said Yirdem. ``The prisoners say they will fight until the very last one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups say that torture and killings in Turkish prisons are not
uncommon. They say abuse is more likely against prisoners from anti-state
groups, such as leftist and Kurdish organizations, than inmates from right-wing
or criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The government argues that the prisoners refuse to move because the wards
allow political groups to run virtual indoctrination centers and in some cases
also organize attacks outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Of Turkey's 69,000 prisoners, 10,000 are linked to political groups, mainly
Kurdish, leftist and radical Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch said that in Turkish
prisons ``political organizations exert tough party discipline to the extent
that they have sentenced and 'executed' many supposed spies and informers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven new cell-system prisons will be ready in May and more are coming to
replace prisons made up of large wards -- a series of interconnected rooms, each
with its own kitchen and bathroom where up to 100 prisoners live in
near-complete independence. Different political groups tend to have their own
wards.
</P>
<P>
	   Of Turkey's 561 prisons, 64 are already based on the cells, mostly built for
six to eight prisoners. Single-inmate cells do exist.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said the prisoners are not isolated and
the new prisons meet U.N. standards.
</P>
<P>
	   But Human Rights Watch says the regime in Istanbul's Kartal cell-system
prison ``appears to be one of extreme isolation ... and may amount to cruel,
inhuman and degrading treatment.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Goes on Trial Again  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Abdullah Ocalan could receive a second death sentence
in a new trial against Kurdish rebel leader on charges on separatism, murder and
extortion
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan, the lone prisoner on Imrali Island in the Sea of Marmara, is not
expected to appear before the Ankara court when the trial opens this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan already was sentenced to hanging for treason and separatism in June.
His lawyers fear that a new death sentence will increase pressure in Turkey to
carry out the June sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey's parliament, which must approve any death sentence, has postponed
any decision on Ocalan's execution until the European Court of Human Rights
reviews his appeal. Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan, his estranged wife, Kesire, and 99 other members of his Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, all face the death sentence for treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
	   The first trial was based on charges related to the PKK's armed insurgency,
which peaked in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The current charges relate to events prior to the 1980 military coup in
Turkey. Before the coup, the PKK operated freely in southeastern Turkey, an
overwhelmingly Kurdish region that was largely outside of the government's
control. The group spent much of its time recruiting members and securing
funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his capture by Turkish commandos early last year, Ocalan has called on
his fighters to lay down their weapons and pursue a peaceful campaign for
Kurdish rights. Earlier this month, the PKK announced an end to its armed
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey's estimated 12 million Kurds are barred from teaching or broadcasting
in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has said that it will not negotiate with the organization,
which it dismisses as a group of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives, mostly Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Estrogen, Alzheimer's  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A year of taking estrogen did nothing to slow the
progression of Alzheimer's or improve mental function in 120 older women with
mild to moderate forms of the disease, researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Research has suggested that women who take estrogen are less likely to
develop Alzheimer's. But the study published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association found that once the mind-robbing disease sets in, the female
hormone offers no benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, the results of this study do not support the role of estrogen in
the treatment" of Alzheimer's, wrote researchers led by neuroscientist Ruth
Mulnard of the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
	   Alzheimer's affects more than 4 million Americans, stealing their memories
and ability to care for themselves. About twice as many women as men have the
incurable disease, in part because they tend to live longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Its causes are unknown, but suggestions that the decline in estrogen levels
in women at menopause might somehow make them more vulnerable to the disease
have prompted interest in the hormone as a possible treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest study, the women, age 60 and older, were given either a low
estrogen dose, a high dose or a placebo every day for a year. No significant
differences were found among the groups in tests of mental function, mood,
memory, attention, language skills or motor function.
</P>
<P>
	   Women taking the low-dose estrogen showed improvement in one measure of
mental function after two months, but the gains disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, those taking estrogen fared worse than the placebo group in a
rating of dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Bennett Shaywitz and Sally Shaywitz of
Yale University called the findings "clear and unequivocal" but said more study
is warranted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Still unanswered are questions concerning, for example, whether estrogen
given in the early postmenopausal period can prevent or delay the onset of
Alzheimer's disease or diminish its severity," they wrote.

<HEADLINE> California To Vote on Juvenile Crime  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California voters will be asked next month whether
prosecutors should be able to take a harder line on juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a measure on the March 7 ballot, Proposition 21, juveniles as young as
14 could more easily be charged as adults for serious crimes and could face life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure reflects a growing belief that the state's century-old juvenile
court system -- built around rehabilitation, confidentiality and individual
treatment -- cannot handle violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   It would allow prosecutors to decide in most cases whether a youth should be
tried as an adult, exposing them to sentences of up to life in prison.
Currently, only judges can make those decisions, and sentences in juvenile court
last until age 25.
</P>
<P>
	   David La Bahn, a California District Attorneys Association official who
helped write Proposition 21, said moving violent youths into the adult system
will make juvenile courts more effective.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If juvenile court is designed to treat low-level offenders ... then this
strengthens juvenile court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other provisions would make juvenile proceedings and records less secretive,
require gang members to register with police and increase various punishments --
including mandatory jail for all gang-related crimes and possible felony charges
for vandalism with more than $400 in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure comes at a time when a rash of school shootings has heightened
fears of juvenile crime, even though the government says such crimes have been
falling for a decade nationally and in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of Proposition 21 say it would deter violent crime. Opponents --
including probation officers statewide -- say the measure contains no money for
probation or other preventive measures and would cost money for new prisons.
They also say studies in other states show youths prosecuted as adults commit
more crimes after their release.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposition 21 is part of a trend of increasingly punitive juvenile laws
passed by the Legislature since 1994. The measure doesn't go as far as laws in
states like Michigan, where a youth was convicted last November of a murder
committed at 11 under a statute allowing adult prosecution for serious crimes
committed at any age.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it is part of a national debate on the usefulness of juvenile courts,
with some criminologists warning of a coming generation of young
``superpredators.'' Others say such predictions are belied by crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   The state attorney general's office says that between 1990 and 1998,
juvenile arrests dropped 30 percent for all felonies, 20 percent for violent
felonies and 60 percent for homicides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system is not the kind of failure some people assert,'' said attorney
David Steinhart, director of the Commonweal Juvenile Justice Program in San
Francisco and an opponent of the ballot measure. ``Look at the crime rate.
Something's working.''

<HEADLINE> Sheppard's Son Testifies at Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sam Reese Sheppard told a jury he never asked his father
whether he killed his mother in the 1954 case that helped inspire ``The
Fugitive'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard said he never felt the need to pose such a question, because he was
sure his father, the late Dr. Sam Sheppard, was innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a belief,'' Sheppard testified Tuesday. ``It is a knowledge that
I know through and through.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard, 52, is suing the state, claiming his father was wrongfully
imprisoned for the 1954 beating death of Marilyn Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, Sheppard conceded he never read his father's
statements to police about the case. He also said his father told him that he
loved his wife, Marilyn, but had an ``open marriage'' while she recovered from
sexual difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   Essentially, Sheppard ``was allowed to have kind of an open marriage while
my mother worked out some personal sexual problems on her own,'' Sheppard said
his father told him. ``And that they loved each other very dearly and were
working that through.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have tried to portray the doctor as an adulterous husband who
felt trapped in his marriage and killed his wife in a fit of rage.
</P>
<P>
	   The elder Sheppard spent 10 years in prison but the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned the verdict, ruling the trial judge failed to shield the jury from
massive pretrial publicity against the doctor. He was acquitted at a retrial in
1966. He died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   For more than a decade, Sheppard has tried to clear his father's name and
solve his mother's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Terry Gilbert, told him some people think he should ``get a
life'' and asked why he has pursued the case so hard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My mother was murdered,'' Sheppard said. ``The offender has never been
found -- it's an unsolved murder case. My father's life was destroyed by the
state of Ohio. Any son who would sweep that under the rug is not worth his salt
as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard recounted the weekend his childhood was blown apart by his mother's
slaying when he was 7 years old. He said there was ``no tension or hostility''
in the house the weekend she was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Sheppard tucked him into bed the night of her death, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he slept through the murder in the early morning hours and awoke to
``my uncle Richard and Mrs. Houk (a neighbor), who were very upset. They told me
something terrible had happened.''
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor told authorities a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife and his
son believes that intruder was Richard Eberling, who washed windows for the
Sheppard family. Eberling was convicted of a separate murder and died in prison.

<HEADLINE> Salzburg Festival Director To Stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) -- Gerard Mortier, who had announced he would step
down as director of the Salzburg festival to protest inclusion of the far-right
in Austria's government, has decided to stay on in his post, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mortier said earlier this month he would leave his post at one of the
world's most prestigious music festivals at the end of the summer in response to
Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party's presence in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an interview due to be published today in the Vienna daily Der
Standard, he said he had changed his mind and would remain in his post.
</P>
<P>
	   Mortier was quoted in the interview, which was carried in part by the
Austria Press Agency, as saying he consulted numerous cultural figures before
making his decision to stay on.
</P>
<P>
	   Those consulted include French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, former French
Culture Minister Jack Lang and conductor Pierre Boulez. Mortier's contract runs
out next year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interview with The Associated Press, the Belgian-born Mortier
said he had received a growing amount of hate mail from Austrians since
announcing his decision to resign after the August season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Go to Chechnya,'' advised one writer on the back of a postcard. Another
Austrian -- who did not sign his letter -- filled more than a page with
anti-Semitic drivel before telling the director: ``Go to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mortier said he feared the mail reflects a climate he fears will get worse
under the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview with Der Standard, Mortier sharply rejected claims that he
had wanted to quit prematurely in order to secure a job in Berlin and because of
a budget problem next year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It must be made clear from our side that we don't agree with this
government,'' he told Der Standard.

<HEADLINE> Sheep Industry Struggles To Survive  </HEADLINE>
    By ROXANA HEGEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAIZE, Kan. (AP) -- Chuck Woodard used to run a flock of 1,000 ewes,
carrying on a family tradition that began when he was a boy helping his
grandfather on their Kansas farm.
</P>
<P>
	   But three years ago, an aging Woodard decided he and his wife could no
longer handle the hard physical labor that goes along with raising sheep.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to make a choice. We still enjoyed sheep so we got out of having
high intensity (labor) mother sheep and now we buy feeder lambs," Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Woodards fatten 2,000 lambs each year on their winter wheat,
alfalfa and milo acres. Their lambs are brought in from Texas and Wyoming
because few Kansas flocks remain to supply the large lamb numbers needed by
feeders.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in 1943, during the industry's heyday, more than 1.6 million sheep
grazed pastures across Kansas. At the beginning of this year a government count
put the number of all sheep and lambs in Kansas at 100,000 head, unchanged from
1999 after decades of dwindling numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   What is happening in Kansas is a reflection of a struggling sheep industry
nationwide. The nation's total sheep inventory of about 7 million head on Jan. 1
was down 3 percent from a year ago, and down 10 percent from two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of sheep has been on a downward spiral since 1942 when it peaked
in the United States at more than 56 million head.
</P>
<P>
	   People like Woodard are among the few operators who have found a way to hang
on in a business buffeted in recent years by the collapse of the world wool
market, volatile lamb prices and falling consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Most producers now make as much as 98 percent of their income from the sale
of lambs, with the rest coming from wool sales, said Clifford Spaeth, Kansas
State University Extension sheep specialist. But producers of sheep breeds with
lesser quality wool often cannot even recoup the cost of shearing from their
wool sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year 100 Kansas sheep growers sold off their entire flocks and got out
of the business. As of Jan. 1, just 1,500 sheep operations remained in Kansas,
according to Kansas Agricultural Statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   That compares to 1992, when 2,400 Kansas farmers were still raising sheep.
</P>
<P>
	   "Last year was a losing proposition," said Tom Pope, who raises about 140
ewes outside McLouth in northeast Kansas. "I sheared them myself because I
couldn't afford to have anyone else come in."
</P>
<P>
	   He got just 7 cents a pound for his wool. He figured he might have gotten 3
to 7 cents more if an experienced shearer had done a better job. But even that
does not pay when it costs as much as $3 a head for shearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pope farm is too small to diversify into other crops, and he has to buy
all his feed. So he tries to squeeze as much money as he can from his animals by
selling freezer lambs directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pope is lucky to get 80 cents a pound for a lamb at the auction, but he can
sell it directly to consumers for $1 a pound live weight, plus processing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   His farm operation, he said, is not making the family a living. His wife,
Kathy Ewert, keeps the family going from the money she makes in her job as a
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm trying. It is not really working," he said. "My wife working full-time
is the only thing that saved us."

<HEADLINE> China Awakens Pro-Taiwan Lobby  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's threatened use of force against Taiwan is having
the effect of poking a stick into a lightly slumbering beast, Capitol Hill's
substantial pro-Taiwan lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   That could spell trouble this spring for the Clinton administration's hopes
of winning congressional action on legislation to expand trade ties with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   More immediately, it could build previously lacking Senate support for a
House-passed measure to increase U.S. military ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Red China has escalated its threat of armed aggression against democratic
Taiwan,'' declared Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. The chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee is one of the few members of Congress who still refers to
the People's Republic of China by the ``Red China'' Cold-War-era designation.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms had planned a hearing for today on the subject of defense aid to
Taiwan, but at the last minute the administration declined to send a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Although China opposes the Taiwan military aid bill and wants Congress to
approve the China trade bill, its new threats on Taiwan could both undermine the
market-opening accord and nurture support for the military legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think China was thinking very clearly,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of
Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   From the administration's point of view, China's new apparent belligerence
couldn't have come at a worse time.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration is asking Congress to act quickly on granting China
permanent trade benefits as a follow-up to the trade agreement it negotiated
with Beijing last fall. That pact calls on both China and the United States to
remove barriers to each other's trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional approval -- ending annual votes on of China's trade status --
would ease the way for China's long-sought entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Support for the package was fragile to begin with.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized labor has made its defeat its No. 1 legislative goal this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor's position puts great pressure on Democrats in a year in which they've
been hoping to recapture the House and retain control of the White House, and
even Vice President Al Gore has seemed ambivalent on the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   China on Monday warned that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely
reunification talks with Beijing. Until then, support for the bill to increase
U.S. military ties with Taiwan appeared to be subsiding, despite its approval
earlier this month in the House by a 341-70 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate, generally more cautious on foreign affairs than the House, had
been expected to sit on the legislation, allowing it to die what the
administration hoped would be an unnoticed death.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, however, passions have become inflamed anew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was deeply distressed,'' Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said in a Senate
speech urging passage of the military cooperation bill. ``It's almost as if they
(China's leaders) have a visceral antipathy to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even ardent supporters of the China trade bill had suggested that
provocative acts or words by China could play into the hands of those who want
to see a vote put off until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart recalled that the
United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region to
calm a crisis four years ago. ``We reject any use of force or any threat of
force in this situation,'' Lockhart said. He said he hoped Congress would not
negatively link China's new threats with the trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Stanley O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, ran into bipartisan criticism Tuesday during an appearance
before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee. Senators suggested the
administration was not repudiating the Chinese with enough force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to articulate more clearly where we are,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee. Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said China's statement ``is unacceptable'' and that the administration
had the responsibility to make sure that China ``not misinterpret where we are
-- in one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's tough words accomplished something that clearly was not intended by
Beijing. It gave U.S. labor leaders unexpected new ammunition to use in their
campaign to torpedo the China trade deal.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state sweep
Tuesday night, rallying a ``new McCain majority'' of independents and Democrats
in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona to seize momentum for a
two-week blitz of Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching out to GOP voters, the senator told supporters, ``Don't fear this
campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it.'' He now leads Bush in the hunt for
1,034 delegates at the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said the race is a marathon and he's in it to the end. ``I got some
good news and I got some bad news,'' he told a rally in an airport hangar in
Burbank, Calif. He said the bad news was that he lost Michigan. ``The good news
is that when the Republicans came in ... you're looking at a man who got 68
percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor congratulated McCain but said ``he's going to learn in
the long run that it's Republicans and like-minded independents who are going to
make the decision in the Republican primaries,'' including California on March
7.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's is the latest victory in a seesawing Republican nomination race.
The Arizonan won New Hampshire's leadoff primary in a landslide, lost the
follow-up showdown in South Carolina and won Michigan with room to spare. It
further damaged Bush's aura as the inevitable GOP nominee, and propelled both
men toward a March 7 showdown in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means we're going to go charging into Super Tuesday,'' said state
Sen. John Schwarz, McCain's Michigan chairman. Even before winning his double
header, McCain narrowed Bush's financial advantage and closed the gap in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, Bush and McCain forged mirror-image coalitions: Bush was
supported by two-thirds of the Republicans, and McCain ventured outside the
party for a similar-sized force of Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush drew a smaller percentage bedrock Republicans than in South Carolina.
McCain's mixed breed of voters -- blue-collar economic conservatives, union
members and baby boomers -- voted in far larger numbers than in the previous
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's coalition was reminiscent of the voters who put Ronald Reagan into
the White House then became a battleground for Democrats and Republicans in
subsequent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Open to all comers, Michigan's primary actually drew more non-Republicans
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters bitterly dismissed McCain's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party-building, he's party-borrowing,'' said three-term
Michigan Gov. John Engler, who accused the senator of ``renting Democrats'' for
the night. Engler had promised to carry Michigan for Bush, and took blame for
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's response: ``Be a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 87 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had
574,861 votes, or 49 percent, and Bush had 511,325, or 44 percent. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 79 percent of the precincts reporting, McCain had 170,663
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 101,688 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 46
of the 58 at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates. Although Bush gained at least six delegates Tuesday, he only
had 67 delegates to date; McCain had 90.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told The Associated Press that GOP leaders backing Bush will peel
away when they start to realize his cross-party coalition will beat Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' said
McCain, who received just one fourth of the GOP vote in Michigan ``What I
believe we are assembling is the new McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   With an American flag serving as a backdrop, McCain suggested to supporters
that he, not Bush, would be the best general election candidate. ``We are Al
Gore's worst nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a whirlwind 48 hours after the South Carolina primary, Bush and McCain
traded accusations of negative campaigning in Michigan. Each complained that the
other was using automated phone calls to voters to make inflammatory religious
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by victory, McCain decided Tuesday night to air TV ads in
northern Virginia in an attempt to win the state's 56 delegates Feb. 29. After
losing South Carolina, he told his staff to ease up their efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's main focus, however, will be California. He plans to spend seven of
the next 12 days in the state that awards 162 delegates to the March 7 primary
winner, sources said. He is counting on his strong showing in New Hampshire to
give him a boost in New England states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   With McCain now setting the agenda, Bush has decided to cancel a Virginia
trip early next week to head to Washington state instead, keeping pace with
McCain, who will be there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush also would
increase his criticisms of McCain, starting with complaints that the senator's
campaign accused him of anti-Catholic bias. Look for Bush and his TV ads to call
into question McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with voters as they left polling places showed that more than
half of the Michigan voters were non-Republicans -- independents and Democrats
who voted in far larger numbers than in 1996 and 1992. Three-quarters of
McCain's vote came from the non-Republicans, and three-quarters of Bush's vote
came from bedrock Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and television
networks, conducted the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls show McCain did better among veterans than in South Carolina, and
appeared to have greater success convincing voters that he was the race's true
reformer and straight talker. In addition to his success among Democrats and
independents, McCain earned the support of an overwhelming percentage of new
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters were younger, more affluent, and strongly conservative. They
cited his conservative values as their top reason for voting for him. Religious
right voters also preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four in 10 voters said both candidates attacked unfairly, though the
bickering seemed to leave Michigan voters with a more negative impression of
Bush than McCain. That is a reverse of polling from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, McCain won the majority of Republicans, even as one in four
voters in his home state said the senator didn't have the temperament to serve
effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned side-by-side in Michigan with Engler, who appeared to draw
some backlash from voters -- of those who said Engler's support affected their
vote a great deal, two-thirds actually voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Following contests in tiny New Hampshire and Delaware, remote Alaska and
conservative South Carolina, Michigan tested the candidates' ability to appeal
to a large, diverse electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to the March 7 contests, Bush stopped in Missouri, then flew
to California after the voting in Michigan. He has operations in all 13 states
that vote that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan was fertile ground for McCain's populist pitch; the state supported
the independent presidential bid of Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 and gave Ross Perot
19 percent of its vote in the 1992 election. Pat Buchanan's anti-trade populism
earned him a third of the vote in the 1996 GOP primary.

McCain Beats Bush in Two-State GOP Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- John McCain thumped George W. Bush in a two-state GOP
presidential primary sweep Tuesday, rallying a "new McCain majority" of
independents and Democrats in Michigan and winning his home state of Arizona.
Bush declared: "This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it all the way to the
end -- and some primaries you win and sometimes you don't." With 73 percent of
Michigan's precincts reporting, McCain had 501,278 votes or 50 percent, and Bush
had 443,196, or 44 percent. With 49 percent of Arizona's precincts reporting,
McCain had 137,891 votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 81,981, or 36 percent.

Elian's Mother's Story Contradicted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- Cuban officials insist that Elian Gonzalez's mother
undertook her fatal journey to the United States under threat from a brutal
boyfriend with a long criminal record. Cuban exiles in Miami insist she did it
to bring her son to freedom. But some of Elisabeth Brotons' friends in her home
town of Cardenas believe she left neither to pursue freedom nor because she was
threatened. She just wanted to be with her boyfriend, they said. The government
has depicted the boyfriend, Lazaro Munero, as a violent felon, but residents
statements indicate that is likely an exaggeration.

Violence Plaguing Turkey's Prisons

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The Islamic militant inmates used guns, swords,
knives, even makeshift flame-throwers and firebombs to battle guards entering
their prison ward. It was only the latest riot in Turkey's penitentiaries, and
Turkish officials say they must regain control. Turkey's prisons have been
plagued by violence, including riots, hostage-takings and shootouts. The
problem, says Ali Suat Ertosun, director of Turkey's prisons, is the large wards
that house up to 100 prisoners, who often all belong to a single political group
and run their blocks independently.

cut off funding to the library unless it installed computer programs that deny
access to certain Web sites. Opponents say such filters don't work and often
prevent library patrons from accessing legitimate information. Unofficial
results showed voters rejecting the proposal 4,379 to 3,626.

being dragged for miles at speeds up to 80 mph. The boy was "hanging out of the
side of the car bouncing" down Interstate 70 as horrified motorists honked their
horns and flashed their lights at the fleeing vehicle, said Fred Byam, one of
four men who helped capture the man suspected of stealing the vehicle. Jake D.
Robel was killed after he was dragged more than four miles.

their 11-day voyage, Endeavour's astronauts worked in round-the-clock shifts to
keep two large radar antennas running -- one in the shuttle cargo bay and one on
the end of a 197-foot mast. The method is expected to produce precise 3-D maps
of Earth's peaks and valleys.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Kid's Rights Law Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL WEISSERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Outside the Guatemalan Senate, 7-year-old Sara
Venturo clutched a squeegee half as tall as she is, prowling the street for
drivers who would let her wash their windshields.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, lawmakers -- for the fourth time -- postponed action on a bill aimed
at keeping children like Sara off the street and putting them in the classroom.
No one knows when and if the bill will be revived.
</P>
<P>
	   For three years, the Juvenile and Infancy Code has been one of Guatemala's
hottest issues. Advocates see it as an important weapon for battling the rise in
child labor and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents -- including some children's rights activists and leaders of
the governing Guatemalan Revolutionary Front Party -- see it as a costly,
unenforceable law that would do little to help children.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would mandate stricter punishments for parents who force their
children into prostitution to pay bills, and for adults who solicit child
prostitutes. It would also put child labor restrictions in line with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill was to become law March 3, but Front lawmakers suspended it Friday.
A vote to overturn the suspension failed, and the measure has now been removed
from the Senate's calendar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are banging our head against the wall every day and we can't even pass
something as basic as children's rights measures,'' said Frank La Rue, executive
director of the Legal Defense Fund, a human rights group. ``Sometimes you just
have to wonder what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
	   LaRue said even if the code would not bring sweeping changes, its symbolic
value would be extraodinary in a society where children's rights have often been
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hector Dionesio, legal counsel for Guatemala's leading child advocacy
group, Casa Alianza, said symbolism was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We consider the code a political and social symbol that ... won't help the
children,'' Dionesio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics claim enforcement would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bill's most outspoken critics, Efrain Rios Montt, the Senate's
president and head of the Front, has pushed for the creation of a
state-sponsored ``Family Institute,'' which he claims would circumvent the need
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute, he said, would help troubled families work through problems
through counseling instead of mandating jail time for the parents.
</P>
<P>
	   If the current bill were passed, among those who could face charges could be
Sara's mother, Lila Guerra, for letting her daughter wash windshields.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerra said she isn't worried about the prospect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they do can't affect us,'' she said, pointing to the Senate with
filthy fingers. ``We have to do everything ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Says HMO Violated Duty to Her  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman's lawsuit over her ruptured appendix is bringing
the Supreme Court into the controversy over patients' right to sue their
health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   An Illinois HMO is asking the justices during arguments today to rule that
HMOs cannot be sued for offering doctors financial bonuses to keep costs down. A
decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't reverse (a lower court ruling) suddenly it will be open
season on pension plans, health plans ... all of those will be attackable,''
Stephanie Kanwit, a lawyer for the American Association of Health Plans, told
reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for Cynthia Herdrich of Bloomington, Ill., say her HMO violated
its legal duty to her by depriving her of proper medical care and keeping the
cost savings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By creating conflicting loyalties for physicians, some of the techniques
of managed care can undermine the physician's fundamental obligation to serve as
patient advocate,'' her lawyer said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court allowed Herdrich, of Bloomington, Ill., to sue the Carle
Clinic Association for delaying diagnostic tests after she reported a sharp pain
in her abdomen. Her appendix ruptured and she contracted peritonitis, requiring
emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The HMO's appeal to the Supreme Court argues that if she can sue, ``then
many, if not most, HMOs are unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case stakes out one of many fronts in the war over managed care. Other
lawsuits against HMOs accuse them of violating a racketeering law by concealing
financial incentives provided to doctors to hold down treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states have decided to let patients sue HMOs, and Congress is
considering patients' rights legislation that could set new standards for
managed care and might allow patients to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue in today's case is how HMOs are affected by a federal law that
governs employee benefits and pensions, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act. The law requires employee-benefit plan managers to act solely in
beneficiaries' best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich's lawsuit said her appendix ruptured in 1992 because her doctor at
Carle Clinic delayed diagnostic tests for eight days so the tests could be
performed at a facility owned by the HMO. She was awarded $35,000 for medical
malpractice under state law.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich also alleged that Carle Clinic, which is owned by its doctors,
violated its duty to act in beneficiaries' interests by giving doctors financial
rewards to minimize costs.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court dismissed that claim, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the issue could go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Carle Clinic argues that it cannot be sued under the federal law because its
doctors do not act as plan managers. It cannot violate ERISA to operate a health
plan through a design that uses cost-containment measures, the health plan
argues.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Pegram vs. Herdrich, 98-1949.

<HEADLINE> Woman Tells Story of Sexual Slavery  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In halting tones at a Senate hearing, a Mexican woman
told how her quest for a better life turned her into a sexual servant and made
her one of the estimated 50,000 women trafficked to the United States for
illicit purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was enslaved for several months, other women were enslaved for up to a
year,'' said ``Inez,'' a native of Veracruz who wore a disguise because of fears
her family would be harmed if traffickers identify her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We worked six days a week and 12-hour days,'' she said Tuesday. ``We
mostly had to serve 32 to 35 clients a day. Weekends were even worse.''
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony of Inez provided a dramatic backdrop to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee's Near Eastern and Southern Asian affairs subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who chaired the hearing, spoke of meeting some
women victims during recent travels to Asia and called the trade ``the greatest
manifestation of slavery in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are told they will be taking a job as a nanny and are given money.
... Then they are taken across a border and held against their will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With as many as 2 million women worldwide forced into sexual slavery, the
sex trade seems to have replaced narcotics as the favored illegal trade
activity, White House officials said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Inez said she was duped by men in Mexico who promised her work at a
restaurant but said she owed them a ``smuggling fee'' of $2,500 that she had to
pay off by selling herself to men.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials raided the brothel and while some of the
traffickers have been prosecuted, some escaped capture and returned to Mexico,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have even threatened to bring our younger sisters to the United
States and force them to work in brothels as well,'' Inez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Solid numbers on the scope of the problem are hard to come by, but best
estimates show at least 50,000 women brought into the United States annually for
forced labor, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are weaker restraints and growing demand,'' said Harold Koh,
assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor. Koh said
international criminals are moving away from ``guns and drugs'' to marketing
women.
</P>
<P>
	   Feeder countries for the slave trade include Ukraine, Albania, the
Philippines, Thailand, Mexico and Nigeria, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, said the Clinton
administration approach has focused on preventing the trade from getting
established, protection and assistance for victims and prosecution of
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Loy said the administration has stopped short of pushing for economic
sanctions against offending nations, however, because that would curtail efforts
to build an international effort to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Bills aimed at curbing trafficking have been introduced in the House and
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Study: More Kids on Prescribed Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of 2- to 4-year-olds taking psychiatric drugs
like Ritalin and Prozac soared 50 percent between 1991 and 1995, according to a
new study that experts said reveals a troubling and growing trend.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said the effects of such drugs are largely unknown in children so
young and they worry the drugs could affect the development of young minds. More
than 200,000 preschool-aged children around the country were studied for the
report in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are substantial increases with little or no data supporting their
use. I think that's the message that should go out," said Julie Magno Zito, the
lead author and an assistant professor of pharmacy and medicine at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers suggest the increase is due to a growing acceptance of such
drugs and because more and more children are attending day-care and are being
pressured to conform to school standards of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Michele Barker, a Hot Springs, Ark., mother of three, learned firsthand
about psychiatric drug use in small children before her son, Heath, started
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicknamed "the red tornado" for his auburn hair and wild ways, Heath's
penchant for tearing things up and plunging off furniture worried his parents,
so they had him tested. A pediatrician diagnosed an attention deficit disorder
and prescribed the stimulant drug Ritalin in the early 1990s. Heath was 4 years
old.
</P>
<P>
	   Heath's mother has anecdotal evidence suggesting -- as the authors do --
that the increases are continuing. Through her involvement in several Internet
support groups for parents of children with behavior problems, she said she's
hearing of "more and more 3- and 4-year-olds" being put on drugs like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's become a quick fix," said Barker, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Joseph Coyle of Harvard Medical School's psychiatry department said the
study reveals a troubling trend. He said "there is no empirical evidence to
support psychotropic drug treatment in very young children" -- and there are
valid concerns that such treatment could harm brain development.
</P>
<P>
	   "These disturbing prescription practices suggest a growing crisis in mental
health services to children and demand more thorough investigation," Coyle wrote
in a JAMA editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors reviewed Medicaid prescription records from 1991, 1993 and 1995
for preschoolers from a Midwestern state and a mid-Atlantic state; and for those
in an HMO in the Northwest. The states were not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Use of stimulants, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and clonidine -- a drug
used in adults to treat high blood pressure and increasingly for insomnia in
hyperactive children -- were examined. Substantial increases were seen in every
category except anti-psychotics, though in some cases the actual number of
prescriptions was quite small.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of children getting any of the drugs totaled about 100,000 in
1991, and jumped to 150,000 in 1995. That year, 60 percent of the youngsters on
drugs were age 4, 30 percent were 3 and 10 percent were 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
	   The use of clonidine skyrocketed in all three groups. Although the numbers
were small, the researchers said the clonidine increases were particularly
remarkable because its use for attention disorders is "new and largely
uncharted." They noted that slowed heart beat and fainting have been reported in
children who use clonidine with other medications for attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David Fassler, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's
council on adolescents and their families, said the medications studied "can be
extremely helpful for some children, even quite young children." But he said
they should be prescribed only after a comprehensive evaluation and in
conjunction with other therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   Their use is increasing in part because doctors are getting better at
diagnosing behavior disorders at an early age, Fassler said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, because their effects on younger children and their development
aren't known, Fassler said, the Food and Drug Administration has recently
instructed pharmaceutical companies to study the connection.
</P>
<P>
	   Barker said Ritalin calmed her son and helped him do well in school. But it
also stole his bubbly personality, so she took him off it after four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "He started becoming the so-called zombie," she said. The family altered his
diet and tried nutritional supplements instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Now almost 12 and drug-free for nearly four years, Heath is repeating fifth
grade and has some learning difficulties. But his mother said he seems happier,
and so is she.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't care if he's not an honor roll student," she said, "because he's
healthy."

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Iran Sanctions Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is taking up legislation that would strengthen
the hand of the president in punishing Russia and others that aid Iran's weapons
programs. Senators said they hoped the bill would help Iranian reformists who
triumphed in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration opposes the bill, which it says complicates
nonproliferation efforts, but Democrats said enough changes had been made to
avoid a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House threatened a veto last September when the House passed a
similar bill by 419-0. A Senate vote is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he hoped the legislation
would help the reformers against those bent on harming the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that despite the reformists' election advances, the situation is
still ``quite scary. Iran's leaders now and in the future would be in the
possession of nuclear-tipped ICBMS capable of reaching Washington or Los Angeles
or New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would require the president to submit reports to Congress
every six months identifying those providing Iran with material promoting Iran's
missile and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would have the option of cutting off arms sales or economic
aid to those nations helping Iran's weapons programs. He could also waive
sanctions for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also states that the United States could only make payments to the
Russian Space Agency for its role in building the International Space Station
when the president determines that Russia is actively opposing proliferation to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``is not anti-Russian,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. ``But we
are manifestly anti-proliferation. We will not tolerate vicious and venal
persons plunging the world into a new Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``sends a message to our friends in Russia about the intensity of
our concern about their part in helping Iran develop weapons of mass
destruction,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   The president in 1998 vetoed legislation that, unlike the current bill,
would have required the imposition of sanctions against those helping Iran build
missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading off a possible veto override, Vice President Al Gore shortly
thereafter announced sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of
transferring weapons technology to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were
added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   But legislators said the administrative action, while needed, did not go far
enough. Lott said that Russia, as well as China and North Korea, have not
sufficiently opposed the clandestine transfer of materials to Iran. The
administration strategy ``has failed to slow the flow of this dangerous
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott and others pointed to CIA warnings earlier this year that Iran may be
closer than previous believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal and that Russia,
already a top supplier of weapons to Iran, had agreed to sell Iran more nuclear
reactors for power generation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Film Director Mustafa Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Husam el-Din Mustafa, an American-trained film director
who created about 100 films and dozens of popular Egyptian soap operas, died
Tuesday. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Mustafa died in his Cairo home from a stroke, according to the Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his career as an assistant to American director Cecil B. De Mille.
Mustafa graduated from the University of Southern California in 1951 before
assisting De Mille in the film ``The Greatest Show on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   On his return to Egypt in 1956, he directed his first film, ``Enough, My
Eyes,'' a tragedy that introduced him as a serious director and producer.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his prize-winning movies are ``The Bullet Still in My Pocket,'' about
the 1973 Arab Israeli War, along with ``Enemy Brothers'' and ``The Devils.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``By himself, he was a school in the movie art who advanced Egyptian
cinema,'' said actress Nadia Lutfi, who starred his 1963 film, ``The Black
Glasses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mustafa earned the wrath of many pan-Arabists when he visited Israel several
times after the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace accord. He urged fellow artists to visit
as well, a a move he said would encourage peace between Arabs and their Jewish
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   His soap operas were mostly historical, dealing with events in the early
centuries of Islam. Hid better-known soap operas included: ``The Knights,''
``The Heroes,'' ``Ibn Hazm'' and ``The Age of The Imams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mustafa had been working on a popular television series, ``The Eagle of the
East,'' about the Muslim military leader Saladin, who drove back crusaders from
the holy land in Palestine in the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
	   A funeral was held Tuesday in Cairo. Mustafa is survived by his wife, Nadia,
and a daughter, Jihan.

<HEADLINE> Forest Activist Making Mark  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ken Rait is an aggressive, sometimes pushy Oregonian who
has won accolades from his peers and the grudging respect of opponents while
building a reputation as one of the nation's foremost environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This guy seems to be the Forrest Gump of the forest movement,'' said Duane
Gibson, a lawyer for the House Resources Committee, alluding to Rait's penchant
for getting in the middle of major environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Rait gained notoriety in 1996 when he spearheaded a movement to persuade
President Clinton to protect a 1.7 million-acre swath of land in Utah as a
federal monument.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, as director of the Heritage Forests Campaign, Rait helped persuade
Clinton to seek protection for approximately 50 million acres of forest -- a
move hailed by environmentalists as one of the major conservation initiatives of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   Rait, 37, lacks the portfolio of a Washington power broker. He is not a
major political donor or Capitol Hill veteran, nor has he served in any White
House administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   But he is relentless when in pursuit of a cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's aggressive, effective -- sometimes abrasive -- but I sure respect
him,'' said Josh Kardon, chief of staff for Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``It would be
difficult to argue that Ken Rait hasn't been one of the most effective
environmental activists over the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those who know him say Rait has mastered the tools of his trade, blending
high-tech savvy, media skills, political sophistication and grass-roots activism
into a powerful pro-environment punch.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination has helped Rait tap into major contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based foundation, awarded the
National Audubon Society some of Pew's larger environmental grants -- nearly
$3.5 million over 27 months -- to finance Rait's forest protection campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Pew leaders knew of Rait's work in successfully pushing for creation of the
Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. Monument status adds
protections for federal land against activities such as mining, logging and
off-road vehicle use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pew grants, which comprise 90 percent of the Heritage Forest Campaign's
budget, gave Rait access to an arsenal of weapons. He hired consultants, ran
full-page newspaper ads and commissioned a poll showing public support for
forest protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Rait also held an ``Internet day of action'' last year. Activists flooded
the White House with more than 100,000 e-mails urging Clinton to protect
forests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the White House gets 2,000 calls a day over a period of two months,
that's something they sit up and take notice about,'' said Mike Matz, executive
director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign resulted in Clinton initiating a regulatory process that is
expected when completed to give federal protection to 50 million acres of
roadless forests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do think it's a situation where the stars really began to line up,''
Rait said. ``Sometimes good things happen for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rait's work on the issue has drawn critical attention from House
investigators. The staff of the House Resources subcommittee on forests and
forest health released a preliminary report last week that said the ``roadless
area initiative was developed in an environmental vacuum, with virtually all
input coming from a select few in the environmental community, primarily Ken
Rait.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rait never expected to be a diehard environmental activist. The Buffalo,
N.Y., native was set to follow his father's footsteps and become a dentist, but
high school trips to the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York imbued a
passion for the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
	   When he was in college at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., Rait learned
the affects of acid rain on the Adirondacks, which led him to take a greater
interest in the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   While in Tucson, Ariz., in 1986 pursuing a Ph.D. in hydrology and water
resources, which he never completed, Rait volunteered with the local Sierra
Club. He soon found himself devoting more time to environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990 he landed his first paying job as an environmentalist with the
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance in Salt Lake City. His advocacy in protecting
Utah lands reached a peak when Clinton agreed to monument status for the Grand
Staircase.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What was stunning about that was ... the administration took a hard look
at the largest undeveloped coal field in the country and said, `You know,
protecting this land is a higher public value,''' Rait said.

<HEADLINE> Truckers Protest High Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers expressed concern at rising fuel prices that
have left independent truck drivers struggling to make ends meet and prompted a
big-rig convoy to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Truckers need immediate financial relief to help offset the escalating
burden of diesel fuel,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said Tuesday. ``These
higher costs will soon be felt by consumers if we don't take immediate action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli said he would introduce legislation proposing a six-month
suspension of the 24-cent-a-gallon federal tax truckers pay on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said he was ``very sympathetic'' to the
truckers' plight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't come to any final conclusions, but I think they make a point,''
said Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
	   But a White House spokesman said repealing the fuel tax was ``not a viable
option.'' Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has already cautioned
leaders about tapping into government oil reserves to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 truckers, organized by the National Owner Operator Trucking
Association, converged on the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday in a convoy that began in
New Jersey and traveled through Delaware and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., who attended the rally, told the
truckers, ``When your industry comes to a standstill, this nation does too.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to President Clinton on Tuesday, Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., said
the rising prices of fuel and home heating oil should be considered ``a national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are angry that fuel prices have been rising steadily since last
March, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil
production by 7.5 percent to boost prices that had fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases in diesel fuel prices are costing truckers as much as $100 a day,
some haulers contend. They said the cost eventually will push them out of
business and wreak havoc on an economy that depends on trucks to transport 90
percent of goods, including food, clothing, cars and appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   The spiraling costs are perhaps most apparent in the Northeast -- Vermont,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- where
diesel costs an average $1.86 a gallon, the American Automobile Association
said. In some parts of the country, diesel fuel is as high as $2.04 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the nationwide average for diesel was $1.07 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   With some large trucks averaging just 5.5 miles per gallon and fuel tanks
that hold as much as 150 gallons, truckers say their costs are astronomical.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers want Congress and President Clinton to repeal or suspend the
diesel fuel tax and to investigate OPEC. They also are asking the White House to
release oil from a government oil reserve of almost 600 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said repealing the gas tax wasn't an option because most of the
money goes towards building highways that truckers use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been doing things to make sure that more product gets (to the
Northeast),'' Lockhart said. ``We have some evidence now that prices are coming
down, and we'll continue to watch the situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers weren't sure they had time on their side for lawmakers to struggle
with the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're dying,'' said Douglas Sorantino, a rally organizer and New Jersey
truck driver. ``We need help now. If they don't do it tomorrow, we won't be
around 60 or 90 days from now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's tax waiver would be retroactive to Jan. 1 and would stay in
effect until July 1.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Close on Congo Force  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council is wrapping up a U.S.-sponsored
resolution to send U.N. military observers to Congo to monitor a cease-fire
signed last summer by six governments and three rebel groups involved in the
Congo conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States would like the council to approve the mission to send a
message to a summit of leaders from six African nations involved in the 1
1/2-year war in Congo. The summit starts today in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultations continued into the night Tuesday to settle several key
differences on the plan to send 500 military observers and 5,037 security and
logistics personnel to Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet early today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we are close to an agreement, very close to an agreement,''
Argentina's U.N. ambassador, Arnoldo Listre, who holds the rotating council
presidency, told reporters after the council met on Tuesday. He said the council
would likely vote today, although diplomats cautioned that a vote could be
delayed until later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The council could not vote before today because the U.S. Congress requires
15 days notification of any U.N. peacekeeping operation. No Congressional
objection had been received by late Tuesday, clearing the way for U.S. approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're making good progress, and I'm confident we'll come to a final
resolution soon,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, the top U.S.
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. observers would verify the separation and redeployment of opposing
troops and lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N.
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The three rebel groups who launched an insurrection in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, as well as their backers Rwanda and Uganda,
signed the cease-fire agreement. So did Kabila and his supporters, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though the six nations reaffirmed their support for the Lusaka
accord last month directly to the Security Council, intermittent fighting has
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the six nations are expected to try once again to save the
fragile peace process at today's summit in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, senior Rwandan official Patrick Mazimhaka said the United Nations
was still reluctant to send military observers into Africa's third-largest
nation, where renewed fighting, tribal clashes and growing civil unrest in
rebel-held eastern Congo threatens to undermine the six-month peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Adoption of the resolution would demonstrate that the United Nations is
prepared to act.
</P>
<P>
	   Listre said one of the unresolved questions is the number of observers to be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
	   Some council members who favor a larger force want the resolution to
authorize at least 500 observers, leaving Secretary-General Kofi Annan the
option of beefing up the force if there is a need. Others want the resolution to
authorize up to 500 observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Another issue still being debated is a call for implementation of sanctions
authorized in previous resolutions that cover the Interahamwe militiamen who
helped carry out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and now back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States supports inclusion of the reference to these sanctions,
but diplomats said the 11-nation Southern African Development Community wants it
dropped.

<HEADLINE> Report Critical of Ex-CIA Director  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite public and private apologies from former CIA
Director John Deutch, a Senate inquiry into his admitted misuse of classified
material on home computers will proceed, says the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no excuse for this kind of behavior,'' Sen. Richard Shelby said
after Deutch appeared before his panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, in his first public comments on his computer behavior, told
reporters after Tuesday's closed-door session he erred in doing classified work
on unsecured computers in his home -- computers that were also connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no time did I intend to violate security rules,'' Deutch said. ``The
director of Central Intelligence is not above the rules.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, R-Ala., said his panel eventually will recall Deutch. It also wants
to hear from present senior CIA officials, including Director George Tenet, on
why it took so long to strip Deutch of his security clearances or to notify the
Justice Department and Congress that an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All this happened on his watch,'' Shelby said. ``This I do not believe was
Mr. Tenet's finest hour.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch left the CIA in December 1996. Tenet had his predecessor's security
clearances removed last August. Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, also
held onto a Pentagon security clearance but gave it up this month after it was
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA inspector general's report says Tenet ``should have involved himself
more forcefully to ensure a proper resolution of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Tenet considers Deutch's
mishandling of classified information ``inexcusable.'' The inspector general's
report ``paints a picture of individuals struggling with the challenge of
conducting a sensitive security investigation of the agency's former director.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Director Tenet has made it clear that the agency will not hide behind
excuses for why the original investigation fell short of expectations,'' Harlow
said. ``We could have and should have done better.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the findings of the inspector general's report had been disclosed
earlier by those familiar with the August 1999 document. The panel released a
77-page version from which classified material had been removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the report said that several ``high-risk'' Internet
sites that had been visited by someone in the Deutch household had left
electronic imprints, or ``cookies,'' on Deutch's computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
	   Other officials familiar with the investigation said pornographic sites were
among those visited, and the visits appeared to have occurred while Deutch was
not at home.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason Deutch was especially vulnerable, the report said, was that his
Internet screen name was accompanied by an online profile giving his true name,
that he lived in Bethesda, Md., and that his occupation was ``scientist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a chemistry professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
asserted that no national security secrets were compromised by his lax computer
conduct. However, the CIA was conducting a full damage assessment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I very much regret my errors,'' Deutch said. ``I've worked for this
country for over 40 years in a number of positions, and I am proud of my
accomplishments. I hope that my mistakes will be weighed against the service and
the contributions that I have made.''
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report said Deutch violated agency rules in using at
least five unsecured computers to process ``a large volume of highly classified
information,'' including information on covert intelligence operations, top
secret communications, classified details about intelligence budgets and drafts
of top-secret memos to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   These included desktop computers that Deutch had at his homes at Bethesda
and Belmont, Mass., and his offices in the CIA headquarters and in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House, plus a laptop.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal investigation ``has established that Deutch was aware of
prohibitions relating to the use of unclassified computers for processing
classified information,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   It disclosed that Deutch had been reprimanded for mishandling classified
information earlier, even before he became CIA director in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Details were not in the report. But those familiar with it said it dealt
with an investigation of Deutch during the early 1980s for a security clearance
to serve on a government panel.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey's Book Will Name Suspects  </HEADLINE>
   By JOE EDWARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A new book by the parents of JonBenet Ramsey will
name suspects -- including some who have not been pursued by police -- and
explore the motive for their daughter's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Death of Innocence'' by John and Patsy Ramsey is scheduled to be
released March 17 by Thomas Nelson Publishers, a Nashville-based company that
specializes in books with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Rolf Zettersten said Tuesday the 400-page book ``talks about the
Ramseys' motivation to find the killer, so they provide as many clues and as
much information as they can.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zettersten would not identify the suspects named in the book, saying he
wanted to wait until its release.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's people who have been mentioned before,'' he said. ``There will be a
couple of others, but not by name.''
</P>
<P>
	   The book also discusses ``the profile of the murderer and the motive in the
sense it was likely someone who had a vendetta and was sadistic,'' Zettersten
said.
</P>
<P>
	   JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled on Dec. 26, 1996, in the
basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   Her parents are under suspicion in their daughter's death but have never
been charged. They announced in November they were writing the book to answer
``myths and falsehoods'' about the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ramseys worked, with some assistance, on their home computer in Atlanta,
where they now live, Zettersten said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a convincing work, page after page that contradicts the public
perception and sets the record straight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the book deal were not disclosed. The couple has said proceeds will
help pay legal expenses associated with the case and will go to the JonBenet
Ramsey Children's Foundation.

<HEADLINE> US To Change Food Stamp Car Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recognizing that many of the working poor live far from
where the jobs are, the White House plans to make it easier for families getting
food stamps to own a decent car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we say more Americans should be able to get to work, we mean it
literally,'' said Eric Liu, deputy domestic policy adviser at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton planned to scrap an eligibility rule that counted the value of all
but the oldest, and thus least reliable, cars against a family's assets. Too
many assets, and a family can't get food stamps, the national coupon program to
subsidize grocery bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Under existing rules, food stamp recipients cannot own a car valued at more
than $4,651. Clinton will replace that dollar limit with an equation that will
enable families with little equity in their cars to qualify for food stamps, no
matter the total value of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   To figure a car's equity, the government will subtract outstanding loans
from the car's fair market value. If the equity value is less than $1,000, the
car would be irrelevant toward determining food stamp eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House estimates the change, which Clinton planned to announce
today, will help 150,000 people own a car over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of all new jobs are now created in suburbs, but three-quarters of
welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities where public transit
systems are often sketchy or nonexistent. The White House estimates that even in
metropolitan areas with extensive transit systems, fewer than half the
entry-level jobs are accessible by transit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Having a car can make a tremendous difference,'' a White House statement
said, citing a recent Urban Institute study that shows twice as many welfare
recipients with cars were working than those without cars.
</P>
<P>
	   The food stamp program, which benefits 19 million people, is expected to
cost $21.2 billion in 2001, up $1.4 billion from this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The food stamp rule change, which does not require approval from Congress,
goes along with a proposal in Clinton's 2001 budget that the White House
estimates would benefit 245,000 people over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   If Congress agrees, each state could set a different automobile limit for
food stamps and key the amount to what they now permit in their respective
welfare programs, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states place no limit on the value of a welfare recipient's car. In
many states, the limit ranges from $7,000 to $9,000. The change would cost
taxpayers an estimated $80 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also wants congressional approval for two spending proposals
intended to help the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   He wants to double, to $150 million, a grant program that finances local
transportation priorities keyed to low-income working people, such as extensions
in the operating hours of public transit systems, commuter van programs or
ride-share operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the Department of Transportation will also set aside $5
million for Indian tribes and designate another $5 million for applicants from
the Mississippi Delta region.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will also highlight a $25 million initiative in his budget to
allow low-income families to use a federally subsidized savings program to save
for a car that will help them get or keep a job. Currently, ``individual
development accounts'' provide incentives through federal matching funds to save
for a first home, post-secondary education or to start a business, but not to
buy a car.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Land Mine Agency To Close  </HEADLINE>
   By KER MUNTHIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodia's mine-clearing agency, once widely
praised for its efforts but recently plagued by scandals, says it must close its
doors at the end of this week because it is out of money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cambodian Mine Action Center will stop work Friday and remain closed for
a month or two while it waits for foreign donors to contribute more money,
Director-General Khem Sophoan told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension could cripple Cambodia's drive to rid itself of the estimated
10 million mines left in the early 1990s by decades of war. The center had been
hailed internationally as a model for other war-scarred nations as it worked to
clear former battlefields.
</P>
<P>
	   The center, which evolved from mine clearance efforts during a major United
Nations peacekeeping operation here in the early 1990s, receives about $12
million annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly all major donor nations, however, suspended funding last year when it
was revealed that more than $1 million was spent to clear land in southwestern
Cambodia that was ultimately turned over to government officials, wealthy
businessmen and army generals.
</P>
<P>
	   Quick reforms seemed to placate donors, and in December the government-run
center said it had some new pledges.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new blow, the Phnom Penh Post newspaper reported last week that Canada
pulled its mine clearance advisers from the field when it found that Cambodian
site managers were designating some mined areas as cleared land when no work had
been done.
</P>
<P>
	   Khem Sophoan said Tuesday the center was quickly running out of money. The
center has only $200,000 left, and needs $800,000 more to cover normal
operational costs through the end of March, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese Ambassador Masaki Saito called the CMAC's suspension ``a pity,''
saying he hoped donor nations would follow Tokyo's lead and disburse new
funding. He attributed the funding shortage to donors' frustration with the
scandals.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1991, intense surveying and mine clearance by several organizations
has reduced the number of mines in Cambodia to an estimated 4 million to 6
million. The CMAC has been responsible for nearly two-thirds of professional
mine clearance since U.N. peacekeepers left Cambodia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the mines were laid during the 1980s, when the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrilla groups resisted Vietnamese occupation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Family of Crash Victim Sues Airline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The family of a man who died in last month's crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the
airline and the plane's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of 34-year-old Juan
Marquez, who was returning from a vacation in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   He was among the 88 people killed when the Boeing MD-83 crashed into the
Pacific on Jan. 31. The flight, headed to San Francisco and Seattle from Puerto
Vallarta, was trying to make an emergency landing in Los Angeles after reporting
mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar lawsuit was filed in Chicago on Feb. 13 by Julie Friedmann, whose
husband, Allen M. Friedmann, also died in the crash. The widow's lawsuit
contends the aircraft's pilots did not take all possible measures to make an
emergency landing. It did not specify the amount of monetary damages being
sought.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Tuesday, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's office positively
identified the remains of eight more victims, including Friedmann. Authorities
have now identified the remains of 52 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's pilots had reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer and
were trying to correct them when the aircraft spun out of control and spiraled
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections
of more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, all of which use
similar control mechanisms. Investigators are focusing on a part that moves the
stabilizer, a 40-foot tail-mounted wing that controls the pitch of the
aircraft's nose.

<HEADLINE> In Florida, a Change in Executions  </HEADLINE>
   By RON WORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time in its history, Florida prepared to
execute an inmate by injection following a high-profile struggle with how the
condemned should be put to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Terry Melvin Sims, 58, was scheduled to die today for killing an off-duty
sheriff's deputy in 1977 during a drugstore robbery in the central Florida town
of Longwood.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida Legislature, meeting in special session earlier this year,
approved giving death row inmates the option of choosing injection over the
electric chair. Thirty-four other states execute inmates by injection.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida stopped executions after the July 8, 1999, electrocution of Allen
Lee ``Tiny'' Davis. Blood poured from Davis' nose, making a plate-sized stain on
his white shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis' execution prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to hear a case
challenging Florida's use of the electric chair. After the state law was changed
to allow injection, the high court backed out of deciding whether the chair was
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sims, who unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the electric
chair, last week lost a bid attacking the method of lethal injection. Late
Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
denied his appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   He was convicted of shooting 55-year-old George Pfeil, a retired New York
City police officer and volunteer Seminole County deputy sheriff. Pfeil was
off-duty when he stopped to pick up a prescription for his wife at a pharmacy
being held up by Sims and an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
	   When Sims spotted Pfeil's uniform, he opened fire. The fatally wounded
deputy fired and hit Sims in the hip. Sims was not arrested until June 1978
after an attempted robbery in California.

<HEADLINE> Killer Whale Freed in Japan River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Rescuers today freed a killer whale trapped in a narrow
Japanese river by coaxing it safely into the deeper waters of a nearby port.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17-foot whale entered the Horikawa river on Tuesday morning from the
port of Nagoya. The whale swam about 2.5 miles upstream before getting stranded.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 people in five small boats struggled all morning to guide the
mammal back to the port by tapping metal rods in the water in hopes it would
swim away from the noise, port spokesman Kameaki Mizuno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Progress stalled at one point when the whale had trouble negotiating around
a support for a bridge spanning the river, and rescuers were worried that it
might become exhausted, Mizuno said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the whale appeared to be in good condition after the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's swimming around and seems to be OK,'' Mizuno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mizuno said officials had yet to decide what to do with the whale now that
it was back in the port.
</P>
<P>
	   Though smaller animals such as porpoises are sometimes found in the river,
whales rarely make their way upstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Killer whales, which have a black back and white underbelly, have a
reputation as ferocious hunters. They grow as large as 31 feet and live in
groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagoya is about 168 miles west of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Texas Board Won't Block Execution  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The fate of a 62-year-old woman on death row now
rests with Gov. George W, Bush, a death penalty supporter who has permitted 119
executions since taking office five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The state parole board Tuesday refused to halt the planned execution of
Betty Lou Beets for the shooting death of her husband, a Dallas fire captain.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the parole board did not recommend that Beets' sentence be commuted,
Bush's only option under Texas law is to grant a one-time, 30-day stay of
execution. Beets is to die by injection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   She would be only the second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War and
the fourth in the nation since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to
resume in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents have said cases like Beets' are a test of Bush's
``compassionate conservatism.'' Since Bush took office in 1995, he has spared
only one prisoner, citing flimsy evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, was campaigning
in Michigan on Tuesday. A spokeswoman has said he would not make a decision in
the Beets case until all legal action was over.
</P>
<P>
	   The fairness of the death penalty has received renewed attention since Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois suspended executions until the state's death penalty
procedures are examined. Thirteen inmates have been released from death row in
that state since 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was convicted of murder for the 1983 shooting death of Jimmy Don
Beets, her fifth husband, in what prosecutors said was a scheme to collect his
life insurance and pension. She also was convicted of shooting and wounding
husband No. 2, and charged -- but never tried -- in the 1981 shooting death of
her fourth husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawyer, Joe Margulies, said that while there wasn't evidence of physical
abuse by Jimmy Don Beets, there was severe ``emotional torment'' in their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All my momma's life, she's been abused,'' Beets' daughter Faye Lane told
the parole board Tuesday. ``I've seen it with my own eyes. And I know that if
the jury heard the truth about my momma, she only could have done something like
this if she'd been very scared or threatened.''
</P>
<P>
	   The last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker in 1998. She was put
to death in the same chamber in Huntsville after being convicted of killing two
people with a pickax in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas authorities are already preparing to execute Cornelius Goss tonight.
He was convicted for the bludgeoning death of 66-year-old Carl Leevy during a
house burglary in Dallas almost 13 years ago.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Mich., Ariz. Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, rearmed by a double victory over Gov. George W. Bush,
claimed ``a new majority'' for his presidential cause and urged Republican
regulars to join him -- not fear his reach for Democratic and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush tried to ease the blow of his defeat in battleground Michigan by saying
he ``won overwhelmingly'' among Republican voters, who were narrowly outnumbered
in their own primary, which McCain captured with votes from independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also won at home in Arizona by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
	   So the victorious challenger and the hobbled front-runner turned today to
the West Coast contests just ahead. McCain was campaigning in Washington state,
which holds another open-to-all GOP primary next Tuesday; Bush was in
California, the biggest prize of the March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   At an airport rally in Burbank, Calif., late Tuesday, Bush said that while
he didn't win, the good news is that he dominated the Republican vote in
Michigan. He suggested his popularity among the party faithful would spell
trouble for McCain in the contests still to come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to congratulate my opponent for a race well run, but he's going to
learn in the long run that it's Republicans and like-minded independents who are
going to make the decision in the Republican primaries,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrating his victories, McCain set about rebutting Bush's argument that
he's building his victories outside the GOP, among voters who likely will
abandon him in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud Reagan conservative,'' McCain said. ``I love the Republican
Party. It is my home ... We are creating a new majority, my friends. A McCain
majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 46
of the 58 at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates. Although Bush gained at least six delegates Tuesday, he only
had 67 delegates to date; McCain had 90.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with 97 percent of the precincts counted, McCain had 610,588
votes, or 50 percent, and Bush had 519,880 votes, or 43 percent. Alan Keyes had
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 83 percent of the precincts counted, McCain had 174,921
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 104,199 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush expected momentum going into Michigan after his 11-point beating of
McCain in South Carolina, but it wasn't enough. Nor was the aggressive backing
of Michigan Gov. John Engler, who had promised a firewall for Bush, but may have
stirred a damaging backlash against his candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What a difference a couple of days makes,'' McCain said Tuesday at his
victory rally in Phoenix. Saturday night, he had angrily, acidly conceded South
Carolina to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Now it was the Texas governor's turn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To those Washington politicians who try to divide us into boxes and pit us
against each other, I say shame on you,'' Bush said, bitter over McCain campaign
calls to Michigan Catholics suggesting that Bush had played to anti-Catholics in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   After campaigning in Washington state, McCain planned to spend seven of the
next 12 days in California. His strategists decided to raise the stakes a bit in
Virginia's GOP primary next Tuesday, expecting a Bush victory but trying to make
inroads with advertising in suburban areas outside Washington, D.C. Bush will be
stiffening his stand in Virginia and raising his profile in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now, on to California, on to New York, on to Virginia, on to Washington
and on to victory,'' McCain said. The latter two are the warmups. There also are
Republican caucuses in North Dakota next Tuesday. But the main event is March 7,
with 613 Republican nominating delegates at stake in 13 states -- just short of
60 percent of the 1,034 it will take to choose the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had effectively conceded McCain's home state after earlier trying to
make a stand there. ``It may slow down the race a bit, but when he loses he just
comes back stronger and more willing to fight,'' said Arizona Gov. Jane Hull,
who backed the losing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's Engler conceded he might have blundered by deciding against
head-on campaign ads warning Republicans that Democrats were being asked to
invade their primary for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've never seen a candidate like John McCain who went out to rent
Democrats for a day and get himself a nomination,'' Engler said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
	   There are several open primaries ahead, likely to McCain's advantage.
California's primary is not limited to Republicans, although only their votes
will count toward awarding delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said the Republican-only primaries still ahead would be to his
advantage. ``I'm very upbeat about my chances for the nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, slightly more than half of the votes were cast by independents
or Democrats, and they were overwhelmingly for McCain. Bush won two-thirds of
the Republican vote, McCain matched that among independents, and took 80 percent
of the ballots cast by Democrats. Exit polls by Voter News Service, a consortium
of The Associated Press and the television networks, showed that Democrats
accounted for 20 percent of the primary vote.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Security Forces on Alert  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL COONEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Reassuring investors that he is in full control
of his troubled nation, Indonesia's president said police were on alert in the
capital today after thwarting plans for a large anti-government demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Life appeared to be carrying on normally in Jakarta today, with no signs of
troops or extra police on the streets. Groups that have staged some recent
peaceful demonstrations said they had no knowledge of any plan for a big
protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jakarta is under a first stage of alert by the police because there is a
plan for a large-scale demonstration,'' President Abdurrahman Wahid said. ``But
you would not realize it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He told a meeting of local and foreign business people at the presidential
palace that security officials had the situation under control and ``people can
proceed calmly with their activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid warned he had the ability ``to control the situation'' and guarantee
freedom of speech while maintaining stability for investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Arie Kumaat, the national intelligence chief who advises Wahid,
confirmed that a state of alert was in force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a plan to stage a large demonstration in Jakarta, but security
officials have taken precautionary measures to prevent it from happening,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are still investigating the group and their leaders and the purpose for
the demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jakarta police spokesman Lt. Col. Zainuri Lubis said a low-level alert had
been put into place Tuesday, putting all officers and police vehicles on standby
in their positions, ready to deploy.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, a Muslim cleric and democratic reformer, was appointed head of state
last October a few months after Indonesia held its freest general election in
four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has whittled away at the power of the military, triggering
speculation that some disaffected officers might try to destabilize the world's
fourth largest nation by provoking riots and protests.
</P>
<P>
	   There were coup rumors several weeks before Wahid removed former military
commander Gen. Wiranto from his Cabinet on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   There have also been a series of peaceful protests against government
economic reforms that will raise prices on fuel and electricity.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Professor Returns To Georgia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- As a young black man in south Georgia four decades ago,
Preston King refused to report for an Army physical because an all-white draft
board would not address him as ``Mr.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was given 18 months in prison for draft evasion, a sentence he avoided by
fleeing to England.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton issued a full pardon this week, and King is expected to
return to the United States today for the first time since 1961.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm relieved and reassured,'' King told CNN on Tuesday. ``We've made a
move to cut a certain tie with a certain part of the past, and that's a good
move to make.''
</P>
<P>
	   King, now 63 and a professor of political science at Lancaster University in
England, was to fly into Atlanta this afternoon and attend his brother's funeral
in Albany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he didn't know what to expect -- only that the United States would
be ``radically transformed'' from when he last saw it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little bit numb,'' King said. ``To be cut off from your native land
is always painful. My family was there, my friends were there, my schools were
there. All that was taken away.''
</P>
<P>
	   King had refused to report for the Army physical until the all-white draft
board in Georgia addressed him as ``Mr.,'' as they did white draftees. He noted
that the board called him ``Mr. Preston King'' before learning he was black and
``Preston'' after that.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge who presided over King's conviction said he was delighted with the
presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think justice has been done,'' retired U.S. District Judge William A.
Bootle said. ``He's lived a good life for 39 or 40 years. He's established
himself as a good citizen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of King's family said they were excited to have him back, despite
the somber nature of his return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't express to you how elated the family is that this matter will be
brought to an end after 39 years,'' King's nephew Chevene King said. ``I'm sure
to a large degree it won't actually sink in until we see him home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another family member said King has no plans to return to the United States
permanently.

<HEADLINE> McSorley Suspended for Savage Hit  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Hockey League suspended Marty McSorley on
Tuesday after the notorious enforcer knocked out and bloodied an opposing player
with a stick-swinging blow so savage that police in Canada are investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Bruins defenseman, known more for his fists than his finesse,
struck the Vancouver Canucks' Donald Brashear, another renowned tough guy,
across the right temple during a game in Vancouver on Monday night. Brashear
crumpled to the ice and lay twitching and unconscious, blood flowing from his
nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear, 28, suffered a concussion and will be out for at least two to
three weeks, the Canucks said. He was released from a Vancouver hospital after
being evaluated overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview with the Vancouver Province, Brashear said he did
not remember the hit but has seen it on tape.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looked worse than it was. It looked like I was dying," he said. Told
McSorley had apologized, Brashear said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to talk about it now," he said. "Maybe I'll talk in a couple
of days. Right now I just need a lot of rest."
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL will convene a hearing Wednesday to determine further punishment for
McSorley, who was suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vancouver, police, deluged with calls from angry fans, are investigating
and said they will consult with the NHL. Criminal charges for on-ice violence in
an NHL game are unusual but not unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
	   Canucks general manager Brian Burke said the police should stay out of the
situation. "Leave this stuff on the ice. Leave it to the National Hockey
League," Burke told Vancouver radio station CKNW.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident came with only 2.7 seconds left in the game and the Canucks
holding a 5-2 lead. McSorley skated up -- out of Brashear's view -- and thrust
his stick with both hands against Brashear's head.
</P>
<P>
	   "I apologize to Donald Brashear and all the fans who had to watch that,"
McSorley said. "I got way too carried away. It was a real dumb play."
</P>
<P>
	   Police have gotten involved in several previous on-ice conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to a day in jail and fined $1,000
in 1988 for striking Luke Richardson several times in the head with his stick.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1970, Wayne Maki of the St. Louis Blues and Ted Green of Boston were the
first NHL players taken to court after a stick-swinging duel at a 1969 preseason
game. Green, who suffered a fractured skull, and Maki, who was not injured, were
acquitted of assault.
</P>
<P>
	   Last November, a Chicago teen-ager was charged with aggravated battery for a
hit from behind during a high-school game that left an opponent paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley, 36, has lasted 17 years in the league because of his ability to
fight and protect his more skilled teammates. In only 27 games this season,
McSorley is second on the Bruins with 62 penalty minutes. With 3,381 career
minutes, McSorley is third on the all-time NHL list.
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley is best known for serving as Wayne Gretzky's bodyguard, first with
the Edmonton Oilers and then with Los Angeles, after the two were traded
together in one of hockey's biggest deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear had fought with McSorley just two minutes into Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Brash fought him one time and beat him and beat him bad like he always does
against him," Vancouver's Markus Naslund said. "I don't know if (McSorley) was
so embarrassed and gutless that that is the way he's got to take it out."

<HEADLINE> Ways To Protect Right Whales Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY LINDSAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- With three right whale deaths over the last 10 months,
scientists, fishermen and federal regulators have gathered for a conference
aimed at finding better ways of protecting the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These whales are in serious, serious trouble,'' George Miles of the
National Marine Fisheries Service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last April, a 60-ton whale was found dead off Cape Cod, its broken bones
evidence of a fatal collision with a ship. A month later, rescuers could not
save a whale entangled in fishing gear off Nantucket. Last month, a dead whale
was spotted floating off Rhode Island's coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The losses devastated a species already hovering near extinction -- only
about 300 right whales still swim the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The slow, shallow-diving whales indigenous to the North Atlantic became
known as the ``right'' whale to kill because they were easy to harpoon and
floated a long time after death. The population was thinned out decades ago by
whalers who killed them for their thick blubber and baleen, More recently, the
whales have died after colliding with ships and getting entangled in fishing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Further complicating the right whales' plight are unexplained reproductive
problems. Scientists believe that the whales may be plagued by a genetic
disorder, that pollutants may somehow be harming their reproductive systems, or
that they may be facing a food shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Kraus, director of research at the New England Aquarium, said just one
calf was born last year, compared to six the year before and 19 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to help the whale population include the 1997 Atlantic Large Take
Reduction Plan. The plan closed areas to certain types of fishing gear when
right whales are around, and placed general restrictions on types of fishing
gear. Its goal was to eliminate all man-caused whale deaths by 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, conservation groups recommended changes to fishing gear,
including eliminating vertical fishing and lobster lines and using lines that
would break apart if a whale became entangled. Fishermen dismissed the proposals
as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mantzaris, chief of the National Marine Fisheries Service's Protected
Resources Division, says he hopes the conference will produce agreement on short
and long-term measures to help the whales.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisherman, conservationists and regulators rarely agree, but Mantzaris said
the string of right whales deaths has united them under a mandate to do
something to prevent the species' extinction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's critical to everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference is scheduled to wrap up Thursday.

<HEADLINE> McCain Keeps Winning GOP Primaries  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain is a winner with a problem. Republicans don't
generally vote for him, but he keeps winning their presidential primaries
anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans, join it, join it'' McCain
said Tuesday night in some of the oddest rhetoric ever uttered in victory by a
major party contender for the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud Reagan conservative,'' he said from a podium in his home
state of Arizona, savoring victories there and in Michigan. ``I love the
Republican Party. It's my home,'' he said, stressing GOP themes such as tearing
up the tax code, supporting the military and opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain commented as exit polls indicated Michigan had continued a trend
begun in earlier primaries in New Hampshire, which McCain won, and in South
Carolina, where Texas Gov. George W. Bush countered. In all three cases, Bush
carried the Republican vote, generally by lopsided margins. McCain's strength
came largely from independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend, in turn, gives the two camps something else to fight over in
addition to tax cuts, campaign financing and negative commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot win the Republican nomination if you only get one out of four
Republican votes,'' argued Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, of McCain's
showing in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Murphy, a McCain strategist, said the Arizona senator won with a
``strong coalition of Republicans, independents and Democrats. It turns out now
they want to padlock the primaries and only hold them in a Republican country
club,'' he jabbed at Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself said he was fashioning a ``new majority ... a McCain
majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate raged all evening as McCain's twin victories played out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've never seen a candidate like John McCain who went out to rent
Democrats for a day,'' Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, argued as
the results were tabulated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party borrowing and there's a big
difference,'' he said. Bush himself asked Republicans not to allow Democrats to
dictate their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's surrogates and staff argued the other side, buttressed by a CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll released earlier Tuesday that showed McCain trumping Gore 59
percent to 35 percent in a hypothetical fall matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said McCain is demonstrating on a
national scale the very cross-party appeal that Bush has shown in Texas and
hopes to ride to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is Al Gore's worst nightmare,'' argued Davis. ``John McCain's creating
a new majority tonight. He showed some of his ability to do that in New
Hampshire and here in one of the key states for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   The primary season is about to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington and Virginia hold primaries next week, and both allow
non-Republicans to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen states hold Republican contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   California, with the biggest number of delegates at stake, allows
independents to vote in the popular ballot, for example, but allocates delegates
based only the votes of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut, Maine, New York and Ohio hold closed primaries -- only
Republicans may vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But contests in Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Vermont and
Rhode Island are open to cross-party voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The pattern the exit polls found in Michigan first emerged in New Hampshire,
site of the first primary Feb. 1. There, McCain, fueled by his call for
government reform, won by 18 points despite running behind Bush among
Republicans. Independents and Democrats accounted for 44 percent of the vote
that night, and McCain won them handily.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush bounced back later in South Carolina, where the GOP faithful turned out
in large numbers. They accounted for 61 percent of the primary vote, and allowed
Bush to swamp McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   That made Michigan round three in the primary campaign, as McCain had billed
it. This time, the exit polls said self-identified Republicans accounted for 47
percent of the vote -- well below the number only three days earlier in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won two-thirds of their votes, roughly the same as in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defeated Bush by a similar margin among independents, who
accounted for roughly a third of the vote, and by an even bigger margin among
Democrats who cast almost 20 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Next Primaries Are on Feb. 29  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   With Michigan and Arizona behind them, Republicans square off Feb. 29 in
Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state. Democrats also compete in a primary
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has his eye on the Republican primary in Virginia,
a conservative Southern state politically similar to South Carolina, where he
decisively beat Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake in Virginia are 56 delegates in a winner-take-all primary. At the
national convention, 33 delegates will come from the state's 11 congressional
districts, joined by 23 at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Virginians are not required to register by party, primary voters
will be asked to sign a pledge promising not ``to participate in the nomination
process of any other party.'' State Republicans were afraid the national
convention committee otherwise ``would look askance'' and not seat the state's
delegation, said state party spokesman Tim Murtaugh.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On the West Coast, McCain has his sights on Washington, an
independent-minded state that has created a unique primary marriage between its
independent voters and the traditional system.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters there may choose from three ballots: Republican, Democratic and
unaffiliated. However, neither party considers the unaffiliated ballots, meaning
as much as two-thirds of the vote may go unnoted as far as delegate selection is
concerned, according to the Washington secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican Party allocates 12 of its 37 delegates by percentage based on
the GOP primary ballots. The remaining delegates will be assigned following
state party rules during a March 7 caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, the Washington primary is a ``beauty contest.'' None of
the state's 75 delegates will be assigned Tuesday, but will be during the March
7 caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota Republicans are shifting from a primary to a caucus this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The state held a February presidential primary election four years ago, but
a snowstorm helped keep turnout to just 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers from both parties also objected to the $250,000 cost, saying
taxpayer money could be better spent elsewhere. North Dakota Republicans are
paying for the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The February 1996 election ended a tradition of June presidential primaries
in North Dakota. ``People thought it was a waste of time,'' Curly Haugland, the
state's Republican Party chairman, said of the previous arrangement. By June,
when the primary was held, ``all the decisions were made.''
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota's 19 delegates will be allocated based on percentage. Voters
will gather in schools, restaurants and other public meeting places Tuesday for
an evening of politics, similar to the Iowa caucuses.

<HEADLINE> No Quick Victory Seen in Drug War  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With production of illicit narcotics rapidly expanding in
Colombia, President Clinton's plan to assist the country's counterdrug program
may not produce serious results for some time, a top U.S. official says.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Pickering, the State Department's third-ranking official, suggested
Tuesday that the United States may have to be involved in Colombia beyond the
two-year time frame for which Congress is being asked to provide $1.6 billion in
assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we should begin to see some serious results in two to five
years,'' he said. ``I think to know and believe that we will see serious results
before then is to be too optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, briefed
reporters Tuesday on his recent swing though Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   The alternative to U.S. involvement in Colombia, he said, ``is a greater and
more rapid increase in production and transportation'' of illicit narcotics.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia is in the throes of not only a war against narcotraffickers but
also leftist guerrillas who support them. The American aid program is focused on
counterdrug activities, but resources also are planned for democratic
development, economic revival and protection of human rights. The fate of the
administration's request is uncertain on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before Pickering spoke, a new CIA estimate showed that opium poppy
production was up 23 percent last year in Colombia. The CIA said last week that
production of coca -- the raw material from which cocaine is made -- was up 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If left unchecked, the rapid expansion of drug production in Colombia
threatens to significantly increase the global supply of cocaine and heroin,''
White House drug control chief Barry McCaffrey told the Senate Finance
international trade subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Pickering, who has become the point man for the administration in Colombia,
brings to the assignment his experience in El Salvador during the first half of
the 1980s when the country was undergoing a civil war that featured the
involvement of both the Soviet Union and Cuba on behalf of a leftist insurgency.

	   Pickering knows that it is unrealistic to expect quick fixes in such
situations. He noted that six years passed between the opening of the peace
process in El Salvador and a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   In Colombia, the situation is perhaps more complex because of the vast
resources of the guerrillas as a result of their profitable ties with drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was difficult to predict how much more the United States should
contribute to Colombia beyond the current two-year request that is before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My thinking is, and certainly the thinking within the government is, that
we will need something above what has been for the past 10 years the normal
amounts provided to Colombia,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, he said, ``I expect that the struggle will go on, and I expect
that we will continue to be in a position, as long as Colombia is able to lead
the fight, to support them as long as others are prepared to help to support
them.''

McCain Beats Bush in Two-State Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, rearmed by a double victory over Gov. George W. Bush,
claimed "a new majority" for his presidential cause and urged Republican
regulars to join him -- not fear his reach for Democratic and independent
voters. Bush tried to ease the blow of his defeat in battleground Michigan by
saying he "won overwhelmingly" among Republican voters, who were narrowly
outnumbered in their own primary, which McCain captured with votes from
independents and Democrats. McCain also won at home in Arizona by a landslide.
So the victorious challenger and the hobbled front-runner turned Wednesday to
the West Coast contests just ahead.

Car Policy for Food Stamp Recipients To Change

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recognizing that many of the working poor live far from

that counted the value of all but the oldest, and thus least reliable, cars
against a family's assets. Too many assets, and a family can't get food stamps,
the national coupon program to subsidize grocery bills. Under existing rules,
food stamp recipients cannot own a car valued at more than $4,651.

town of Cardenas believe she left neither to pursue freedom nor because she was

Violence Plaguing Turkey's Prisons

Turkish officials say they must regain control. Turkey's prisons have been
plagued by violence, including riots, hostage-takings and shootouts. The

that house up to 100 prisoners, who often all belong to a single political group

<HEADLINE> Some Drugs Are Cheaper for Pets  </HEADLINE>
    By CAREN BENJAMIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the pill went down with a Milk Bone chaser, chances
are it cost a lot less than if it had been prescribed for a human.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional investigators compared wholesale prices of 14 popular
prescription drugs marketed to people and pets, often under different brand
names, and found the cost for people can be up to five times higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Delahunt, who requested the study for the House Government Reform
Committee, said Tuesday the prices make some drugs unaffordable for people
without insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm all for healthy pets, but not at the financial and medical expense of
their owners," said Delahunt, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug company representatives called the study ridiculous and said the prices
must be seen in context.
</P>
<P>
	   "The study basically compares apples to oranges, or for that matter, apples
to elephants," said Meredith Art, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicines given to animals "piggyback" on the lengthy and expensive approval
process needed for use in humans, Art said. Costs of that process must be
absorbed by the market for which the drug was originally intended, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Patient advocacy groups say the drug companies are hiding behind research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is the prices of prescription drugs have no rhyme or reason
related to the cost of producing those drugs," said Ron Pollack, executive
director of Families USA.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical companies charge higher prices for drugs for people because
insurance companies often foot the bill, while pet owners usually pay out of
pocket, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If drug companies "could reasonably charge considerably more for pets they
undoubtedly would do that," Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for the drugs in the study were gathered from inside Delahunt's
southeastern Massachusetts district but are comparable nationwide, committee
investigators said. Medications surveyed were among the top 200 sellers
nationally in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found Augmentin, a popular antibiotic marketed as Clavamox for
pets, cost more than three times as much when the drug was intended for humans
instead of a dog, cat or horse.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also looked at "directly comparable drugs" -- medications marketed
under the same name and given in the same dosages to people and pets. For these
drugs, manufacturers charged wholesalers an average of 131 percent more when the
drug was intended for human use.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the study found a one-month supply of Medrol cost $3.90 when
purchased as an anti-inflammatory medication for Fido but $20.10 when bought by
Fido's owner for asthma.
</P>
<P>
	   Disparities appear to be "deliberate pricing strategies of the drug
manufacturers" and cannot be attributed to drug production costs or research and
development expenses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study said "drug manufacturers are engaged in systematic price
discrimination that adversely affects millions of senior citizens and other
consumers who lack prescription drug coverage."

<HEADLINE> Fox Avoiding Wedding Business  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rick Rockwell's whirlwind wedding may be headed for a
quickie annulment, but networks are still in love with reality-based shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the flap following last week's airing of "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire," no less than three new series plan to take the gamble of
putting real people in real-life dramas for fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Making the Band," ABC's behind-the-scenes look at a pop band, debuts March
24. This summer, CBS will air "Survivor," which will strand contestants on an
island to compete for $1 million, and "Big Brother," which will stick players in
a house filled with cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this train has left the station. This one thing is not going to
derail it," said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University. "These shows are huge, and I think
they're going to get huger still."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, other networks said they were taking heed of Fox's misadventure. On
its Feb. 15 "Marry" special, Rockwell picked nurse Darva Conger from among 50
contestants and married her on TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox at first caught a ratings bouquet but was left holding a can of worms
following the disclosure that Rockwell was once accused by an ex-girlfriend of
threatening her.
</P>
<P>
	   "This certainly heightens awareness of the need to be careful," said CBS
spokesman Chris Ender. "We're confident that our casting and screening process
will ensure that everyone involved is appropriate and ready for the experience."
</P>
<P>
	   It was ABC's hit quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" that proved the
potential of reality series, while Fox's "Marry" showed the pitfalls. Fox
canceled a rerun of the program as well as plans for a sequel after Rockwell's
past was exposed by the online news service The Smoking Gun.
</P>
<P>
	   A California judge issued a restraining order against Rockwell in 1991
sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne, who said Rockwell had hit her and
threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" on Tuesday that he never hit Goyne, although he
admitted to once letting the air out of her car's tires. He said he has a temper
but "it doesn't manifest itself too often."
</P>
<P>
	   As for his marriage to Conger, it wasn't consummated during their Caribbean
honeymoon, Rockwell said. The pair, who slept in separate rooms for all but one
night, had signed an agreement that they could seek an annulment -- no questions
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thought that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "She went back with her mom," he said of Conger, a 34-year-old Gulf War
veteran and fellow Californian.
</P>
<P>
	   To those who thought the show mocked the institution of marriage, Rockwell
said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind. Friends have suggested that
Rockwell, who has performed as a comedian, may have been seeking publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said the show's producers, Next Entertainment, had agreed to conduct a
full background investigation on Rockwell and his potential brides. Fox said it
is looking into how extensive those checks were.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Entertainment said in a statement that "a good-faith background check
performed prior to the show by a reputable, independent investigator did not
reveal any information that Mr. Rockwell was anything other than a decent,
successful man."
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage's fate aside, a Fox spokesman said Conger received prizes worth
a total of $100,000: the honeymoon, the $35,000 engagement ring and an Isuzu
Trooper.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull a rerun of the show may reflect Fox's concerns about
legal exposure if anything went awry between Rockwell and Conger, Syracuse's
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted last year's $25 million judgment against the producers and owners
of "The Jenny Jones Show" in the killing of a gay guest who admitted a crush on
another man. The verdict has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Jones case says that liability might be there. I'm calling it the
'morning after story': You've got the show itself, it ends with a kiss,"
Thompson said. "Then there's the day after, or week after, when we begin to see
the results of putting real people together into these contrived situations."

<HEADLINE> Bride Says She Made a Big Mistake  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The woman who married a total stranger on national
television said today she participated in "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" on a lark and made a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I was thinking clearly," nurse Darva Conger told "Good
Morning America" today. "I committed an error in judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she didn't want to disparage her husband, Rick Rockwell, but after
spending some time with him, she concluded, "I was very uncomfortable around
him. He's just not a person that I would ordinarily have a friendly relationship
with."
</P>
<P>
	   She said they spent their "honeymoon" in separate rooms and she told him, "I
am not married to him. In my heart, I'm not married to him."
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 15 Fox television special received smash hit ratings and touched
off widespread debate about the limits of "reality" television. Rockwell,
described as a millionaire through real estate investments, picked Conger from
among 50 contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   She said today she was "was just in complete shock" when she was chosen,
adding, "I wish I had the moral fortitude at that point to walk away." She said
she feared hurting the producers by ruining the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just going to be on TV and wave to my family and friends," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it was just a lark."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the agreement to participate in the show included an annulment
clause, and she would seek the annulment.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox canceled a planned rerun of the show after when an online news service,
The Smoking Gun, revealed Saturday that a California judge issued a restraining
order against Rockwell in 1991 sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne. She said
Rockwell had hit her and threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" that he never hit Goyne, but he admitted to
letting the air out of the tires on her car. He said he has a temper but "it
doesn't manifest itself too often."
</P>
<P>
	   To everyone who thought the show debased the institution of marriage,
Rockwell said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind. But he agreed an
annulment was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the flap, no less than three new series plan to take the gamble of
putting real people in real-life dramas for fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Making the Band," ABC's behind-the-scenes look at a pop band, debuts March
24. This summer, CBS will air "Survivor," which will strand contestants on an
island to compete for $1 million, and "Big Brother," which will stick players in
a house filled with cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, other networks said they were taking heed of Fox's misadventure.
</P>
<P>
	   "This certainly heightens awareness of the need to be careful," said CBS
spokesman Chris Ender. "We're confident that our casting and screening process
will ensure that everyone involved is appropriate and ready for the experience."
</P>
<P>
	   It was ABC's hit quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" that proved the
potential of reality series, while Fox's "Marry" showed the pitfalls. Fox
canceled a rerun of the program as well as plans for a sequel after Rockwell's
past was exposed by the online news service The Smoking Gun.
</P>
<P>
	   A California judge issued a restraining order against Rockwell in 1991
sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne, who said Rockwell had hit her and
threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" on Tuesday that he never hit Goyne, although he
admitted to once letting the air out of her car's tires. He said he has a temper
but "it doesn't manifest itself too often."
</P>
<P>
	   As for his marriage to Conger, it wasn't consummated during their Caribbean
honeymoon, Rockwell said. The pair, who slept in separate rooms for all but one
night, had signed an agreement that they could seek an annulment -- no questions
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thought that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "She went back with her mom," he said of Conger, a 34-year-old Gulf War
veteran and fellow Californian.
</P>
<P>
	   To those who thought the show mocked the institution of marriage, Rockwell
said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind. Friends have suggested that
Rockwell, who has performed as a comedian, may have been seeking publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said the show's producers, Next Entertainment, had agreed to conduct a
full background investigation on Rockwell and his potential brides. Fox said it
is looking into how extensive those checks were.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Entertainment said in a statement that "a good-faith background check
performed prior to the show by a reputable, independent investigator did not
reveal any information that Mr. Rockwell was anything other than a decent,
successful man."
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage's fate aside, a Fox spokesman said Conger received prizes worth
a total of $100,000: the honeymoon, the $35,000 engagement ring and an Isuzu
Trooper.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull a rerun of the show may reflect Fox's concerns about
legal exposure if anything went awry between Rockwell and Conger, Syracuse's
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted last year's $25 million judgment against the producers and owners
of "The Jenny Jones Show" in the killing of a gay guest who admitted a crush on
another man. The verdict has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Jones case says that liability might be there. I'm calling it the
'morning after story': You've got the show itself, it ends with a kiss,"
Thompson said. "Then there's the day after, or week after, when we begin to see
the results of putting real people together into these contrived situations."

	   "Voodoo" (Virgin) -- D'Angelo
</P>
<P>
	   D'Angelo, it's been far too long.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago, masterful crooner D'Angelo debuted with the neo-soul-tinged
"Brown Sugar," a rich testimony to the soul-conscious infiltration of R&AMP;B music.
</P>
<P>
	   His intoxicating sophomore effort, "Voodoo," is at once bewitching, romantic
and beguiling. It's everything the name suggests it to be. D'Angelo's smooth
falsetto stirs up endlessly sultry lyrics in urgent verses, whether he sings an
up-tempo jam or slows it down for a little bedroom banter.
</P>
<P>
	   Jazzy, upbeat tunes like "Chicken Grease," "Greatdayndamornin"' and "Devil's
Pie" are laidback, roll-down-the-car-window jams. They're catered for the dance
floor. "Left and Right," featuring Method Man and Redman, is serviceable party
fare, thrown in for hip-hop heads. But D'Angelo is at his best when he works it
slow.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Line," "Send it On" and "One Mo' Gin" wax reminiscent of a young Mavin
Gaye. Haunting fusions of organ and drums reflect the moodiness of each song,
with D'Angelo's light vocals peppering the instrumentals. The easiness of the
music is like a lullaby, easy to get lost in. But there's one ballad in
particular that sums up the whole disc.
</P>
<P>
	   "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" has received plenty of deserved attention,
mainly because of wide-range video play showcasing a perfectly toned and nude
D'Angelo staring into the camera simply singing.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's more than much ado about nothing. It's the best song that Prince
never wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with Raphael Saadiq (of Tony Toni Tone fame), D'Angelo has penned one
of the hottest singles of the year. It's a man's emotions slowly played out for
the woman he loves and finally intends to do right by. D'Angelo takes his
singing instrument through every conceivable level when it dramatically dives
into a deep-voiced ultimatum. "Untitled" grooves like a Prince song back from
his "Purple Rain" days. Close your eyes and you might think it's The Artist
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   D'Angelo has shown considerable growth in style, continuity and range since
he was first introduced to the music world. Let's hope it's not another five
years before he drops another disc.

	   "Stiff Upper Lip" (Elektra Records) -- AC/DC
</P>
<P>
	   The unmistakable sound of AC/DC rips into the new century with the release
of the album "Stiff Upper Lip." It's obvious to the ear that this band does not
believe in change or trying to keep up with the "flavor of the month" mentality
so prevalent in the hard-rock genre these days.
</P>
<P>
	   The album is vintage AC/DC -- no tricks and no gimmicks -- from the opening
title track to the raunchy blues riff "House of Jazz."
</P>
<P>
	   Lead guitarist Angus Young, one of the most underrated musicians in rock
history, plays with ferocious energy and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Johnson is still singing with the trademark rasp that makes you wonder
if he ever swallowed broken glass. Highlights of this unique singing style
appear on the tracks "Safe in New York City" and "Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll."
</P>
<P>
	   After all these years, the band's only concern seems to be giving the fans
what they want, a winning formula that has brought them multi-platinum success.

	   "Do the Collapse" (TVT) -- Guided By Voices
</P>
<P>
	   "I will deliver to you," promises Guided By Voices maestro Robert Pollard on
the track "Picture Me Big Time." And with the group's 11th album, "Do the
Collapse," GBV gracefully unleashes their clearest guitar pop yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Time during the '80s spent gestating in GBV's home base of Dayton, Ohio --
where Pollard taught elementary school by day and played with ever-evolving
Guided By Voices lineups at night -- allowed the band to hone its sound. By the
early '90s, GBV hit its stride with classic lo-fidelity rock albums such as "Bee
Thousand" and "Alien Lanes." Critical success and grassroots support enabled
Pollard to leave his day job behind, make solo albums between band releases and
prepare the band for its next stage: a shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
	   For "Do the Collapse," Ric Ocasek of The Cars polished the rough gems of
Pollard's compositions to a shine. Tracks such as "Teenage FBI," "Things I Will
Keep" and "Surgical Focus" are infectious appetizers that taste of Cheap Trick
and Wire, Byrds mixed with The Who, and Syd Barrett crossed with Big Star. Such
are the touchstones of Pollard's songwriting.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Stiches," "Zoo Pie," "Optical Hopscotch," "Liquid Indian" and other
tunes are pure Pollard -- poetic beauty, cryptic crunch and infectious anthem.
"Dragon's Awake!" is an acoustic-based folkie in the vein of Tyrannosaurus Rex
and David Jones. However, the ace up the sleeve is GBV's universal super-ballad
of optimism, "Hold on Hope," which recalls the tone of Mott the Hoople's Ian
Hunter at his most tender and reflective.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do the Collapse" is the ideal starting point to investigate the harvest of
song that is Guided By Voices.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Wonder Boys'  </HEADLINE>
    By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Grady Tripp has fallen, and he can't get up. What's worse, he seems to have
no idea that anything's wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   In Curtis Hanson's wonderfully elegiac "Wonder Boys," based on Michael
Chabon's book, Grady (Michael Douglas) is a raffish, graying writer and
Pittsburgh university professor whose first novel propelled him to literary
heights. But his follow-up -- well, that's another story.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not that he can't write it. Just the opposite: He can't stop. Page
after page, he churns forth prose from his gut, writing and writing as his real
life sinks ever deeper into inertia.
</P>
<P>
	   His umpteenth wife has just left. His affair with the university chancellor
(Frances McDormand) is at a crossroads. His agent (Robert Downey Jr.) is pushing
him to publish -- or perish professionally. One of his students, James Leer
(Tobey Maguire), is melting down; another, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), is
trying to seduce him.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the premise for the three-day odyssey of angst and epiphany
chronicled in "Wonder Boys," a memorable, melancholy ride through one lost
soul's slow realization that he has outgrown the shine of his potential.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime reason for the movie's success is, somewhat surprisingly, Michael
Douglas, an actor known more for evoking the testosterone side of male
characters than the sensitive, self-aware side. As played by Douglas, Grady
Tripp is a pot-smoking, womanizing, somewhat egomaniacal lit-crit snot who's
bought into the praise that's been lavished upon him. But in the three days of
his life that we see, the flip side is revealed -- the place where the drugs and
flings and lack of self-discipline have dumped him. It's not pretty.
</P>
<P>
	   What reveals it in stark relief is his relationship with James, a promising
young writer having difficulty separating fiction from reality. Grady takes
James under his wing. But as Grady decays and his life unravels, he begins to
wonder whether he's in any position to help James -- indeed, whether he has any
wisdom at all to offer a young version of himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Maguire is the perfect choice for James. His bemused take on the world,
deployed so well in "Pleasantville" and "The Cider House Rules," takes on a
different dimension here. The interplay of truth and deception that governs
James' life gives Maguire a chance to branch out, to take the good-hearted
characters of his previous films and give them a darker side to conquer. He
looks to Grady for support, and finds Grady, equally confused, staring right
back.
</P>
<P>
	   As Grady's agent, Terry Crabtree, Downey rounds out the triumvirate of
wonder boys. He, too, was a star in his profession, but now he is barely hanging
onto his job, thanks to Grady's unfinished manuscript. Seeing the three of them
try to claw their way through their lives, each as blind as the other two, is
quietly heartbreaking and feels absolutely genuine.
</P>
<P>
	   McDormand is her usual welcome presence, this time as a woman balancing the
rigors of being a university chancellor with the juggling act that infidelity
demands. Holmes, star of the hormones-and-learners'-permits TV show "Dawson's
Creek," shows again that her movie choices are wiser. She was great in "Go" and
"Teaching Mrs. Tingle," and she's great here -- as Grady's temptation, but also
as his critic.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no strict "plot" to "Wonder Boys," simply a rolling, undefined
feeling of forward movement that may not actually be forward -- much like
Grady's life. The pacing is crucial. The textured neighborhoods of Pittsburgh,
rendered in gray winter tones, also fit the mood perfectly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wonder Boys" is a movie about tarnished hopes and making choices -- not
just the right ones, but the act of making choices itself. As Grady's book keeps
growing, Hannah renders her opinion: "It reads as if you didn't make any choices
at all."
</P>
<P>
	   That's what tends to happen in life. Good, caring men like Grady Tripp hurt
themselves and the people they love by shutting down and refusing to make
choices. To be happy, sometimes we have to make the tough choices.
</P>
<P>
	   That's one of the quieter wonders of life, and the exploration of it is the
main reason that "Wonder Boys" turns out to be a relevant, moving piece of
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wonder Boys," a Paramount Pictures release, is scripted by Steve Kloves
based on Chabon's novel. Hanson and Scott Rudin produced. It is rated R.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pair of 'Wild Parties' Hits New York  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York theatergoers are going to be seeing double with
"The Wild Party."
</P>
<P>
	   Two musicals with the same title and based on the same Jazz Age poem are
opening within weeks of each other -- one off-Broadway, the other on.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has never been anything like this," says Ken Mandelbaum, musical
theater historian, author and critic. "But is it a good idea to do both at the
same time? It is difficult to imagine them both being successful. After all,
they are about the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Both are based on a 1920s poem by Joseph Moncure March, a one-time editor at
The New Yorker and screenwriter. It captures the hedonism and cynicism of a
gilded age, a hard-boiled world of show biz, speakeasies and indiscriminate sex.
</P>
<P>
	   The first "Wild Party" arrives Thursday at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater,
a nonprofit theater where such plays as "Crimes of the Heart" and "Love! Valour!
Compassion!" were first done in New York. It has book, music and lyrics by
newcomer Andrew Lippa, who contributed a few new songs to last season's revival
of "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."
</P>
<P>
	   The second, with a score by Michael John LaChiusa, opens April 13 at
Broadway's Virginia Theater, produced by the Public Theater and Hollywood movie
mogul Scott Rudin.
</P>
<P>
	   Musicals based on the same material are not unknown. Andrew Lloyd Webber
wrote "The Phantom of the Opera," but Maury Yeston has a version of "Phantom,"
too, and it has had a successful life -- though outside New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeston also wrote a musical version of "La Cage aux folles" called "The
Queen of Basin Street." It never was produced, but Jerry Herman's version was.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the late 1960s, two musicals based on "Twelfth Night" arrived
off-Broadway. One, "Your Own Thing," was a hit; the other, "Love and Let Love"
died in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Broadway production of "The Wild Party" has an edge in terms of star
power. Its cast includes Eartha Kitt, Mandy Patinkin and Toni Collette, who just
got a supporting-actress Oscar nomination for the movie "The Sixth Sense."
</P>
<P>
	   (There was also a 1975 movie called "The Wild Party," starring Raquel Welch
and James Coco, that was based loosely on the scandal that ruined the career of
silent film comic Fatty Arbuckle. Neither the poem nor the two stage productions
deal with the Arbuckle scandal.)
</P>
<P>
	   Neither "Wild Party" will talk specifically about the other -- at least on
the record.
</P>
<P>
	   Public Theater artistic director George C. Wolfe, who is director and
co-author of the Broadway version, says diplomatically about the competition,
"As a producer I am aware of it, but as a creative artist I can only think about
my show. My job as a director is to focus completely on what happens in my
rehearsal room."
</P>
<P>
	   Lippa, composer of the other one, agrees. "Our commitment was just to our
show and doing it on the timeline that the musical demanded. Our show was ready
to be produced and we had incredible support from Manhattan Theater Club and we
felt confident in going forward," he says. "Frankly, we didn't take into account
the other folks."
</P>
<P>
	   Both musicals began life unaware of the other. The Public Theater has had a
long relationship with composer LaChiusa, and their project came about as a
commission from the Public, Wolfe says.
</P>
<P>
	   Lippa started work on his version more than four years ago after he came
across a copy of the poem in a New York bookstore. "In those days, I didn't
write lyrics. I was in the poetry section, thinking I would find a poem that I
could set to music," he recalls. Lippa opened the book and read the first two
lines, "Queenie was a blonde, and her age stood still, and she danced twice a
day in vaudeville." He knew he had an idea for a musical.
</P>
<P>
	   "This show was going to be my 'Cats.' I was going to set the poem to music,"
Lippa recalls. "But I realized quickly that there was very little in the first
person. So I started to write lyrics. It was the middle of the winter, I was out
of work and I thought, 'I can mope around the house or I can write a musical."'
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan Theater Club held a reading of Lippa's first act in August 1996
and the following summer a two-act version was done at the Eugene O'Neill Center
in Connecticut, where director Gabriel Barre came aboard. He is directing the
show at Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
	   Now both shows have to wait for the reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Is a Broadway transfer possible for the Manhattan Theater Club version if
the notices on Friday are good? No one is saying.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are investigating the usual options after the Manhattan Theater Club run
-- if it is warranted," says Barry Grove, the theater's executive producer. Its
"Wild Party" is scheduled to run through April 2.

<HEADLINE> Bride Says She Made a Big Mistake  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The woman who married a total stranger on national
television said today she participated in "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" on a lark and made a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I was thinking clearly," nurse Darva Conger told "Good
Morning America" today. "I committed an error in judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she didn't want to disparage her husband, Rick Rockwell, but after
spending some time with him, she concluded, "I was very uncomfortable around
him. He's just not a person that I would ordinarily have a friendly relationship
with."
</P>
<P>
	   She said they spent their "honeymoon" in separate rooms and she told him, "I
am not married to him. In my heart, I'm not married to him."
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 15 Fox television special received smash hit ratings and touched
off widespread debate about the limits of "reality" television. Rockwell,
described as a millionaire through real estate investments, picked Conger from
among 50 contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   She said today she was "was just in complete shock" when she was chosen,
adding, "I wish I had the moral fortitude at that point to walk away." She said
she feared hurting the producers by ruining the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just going to be on TV and wave to my family and friends," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it was just a lark."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the agreement to participate in the show included an annulment
clause, and she would seek the annulment.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox canceled a planned rerun of the show after when an online news service,
The Smoking Gun, revealed Saturday that a California judge issued a restraining
order against Rockwell in 1991 sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne. She said
Rockwell had hit her and threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" that he never hit Goyne, but he admitted to
letting the air out of the tires on her car. He said he has a temper but "it
doesn't manifest itself too often."

<P>
	   To everyone who thought the show debased the institution of marriage,
Rockwell said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind. But he agreed an
annulment was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the flap, no less than three new series plan to take the gamble of
putting real people in real-life dramas for fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Making the Band," ABC's behind-the-scenes look at a pop band, debuts March
24. This summer, CBS will air "Survivor," which will strand contestants on an
island to compete for $1 million, and "Big Brother," which will stick players in
a house filled with cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, other networks said they were taking heed of Fox's misadventure.
</P>
<P>
	   "This certainly heightens awareness of the need to be careful," said CBS
spokesman Chris Ender. "We're confident that our casting and screening process
will ensure that everyone involved is appropriate and ready for the experience."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the marriage, it wasn't consummated during their Caribbean honeymoon,
Rockwell told "Dateline." The pair, who slept in separate rooms for all but one
night, had signed an agreement that they could seek an annulment -- no questions
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thought that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "She went back with her mom," he said of Conger, a 34-year-old Gulf War
veteran and fellow Californian.
</P>
<P>
	   To those who thought the show mocked the institution of marriage, Rockwell
said he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind. Friends have suggested that
Rockwell, who has performed as a comedian, may have been seeking publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said the show's producers, Next Entertainment, had agreed to conduct a
full background investigation on Rockwell and his potential brides. Fox said it
is looking into how extensive those checks were.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Entertainment said in a statement that "a good-faith background check
performed prior to the show by a reputable, independent investigator did not
reveal any information that Mr. Rockwell was anything other than a decent,
successful man."
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage's fate aside, a Fox spokesman said Conger received prizes worth
a total of $100,000: the honeymoon, the $35,000 engagement ring and an Isuzu
Trooper.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull a rerun of the show may reflect Fox's concerns about
legal exposure if anything went awry between Rockwell and Conger, Syracuse's
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted last year's $25 million judgment against the producers and owners
of "The Jenny Jones Show" in the killing of a gay guest who admitted a crush on
another man. The verdict has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Jones case says that liability might be there. I'm calling it the
'morning after story': You've got the show itself, it ends with a kiss,"
Thompson said. "Then there's the day after, or week after, when we begin to see
the results of putting real people together into these contrived situations."

<HEADLINE> Woman Who Married on TV Wants Out  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The woman who married a total stranger on national
television said today she participated in "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" on a lark and will seek an annulment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I was thinking clearly," nurse Darva Conger told "Good
Morning America" today. "I committed an error in judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she didn't want to disparage her husband, Rick Rockwell, but after
spending some time with him, she concluded, "I was very uncomfortable around
him. He's just not a person that I would ordinarily have a friendly relationship
with."
</P>
<P>
	   She said they spent their "honeymoon" in separate rooms and she told him "I
don't have those feelings for you, I can't let you believe that I do."
</P>
<P>
	   "I never, ever considered having sexual relations with him," she said. "I
would never consider having sexual relations with anyone I just met."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the agreement to participate in the show included an annulment
clause, and she would seek the annulment. "I never had any claim to his money.
It's his money," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is me. I am an Air Force veteran, I am a college graduate. ... I want
my life back," said Conger, 34, who served in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell has acknowledged that an annulment was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 15 Fox television special received smash ratings and touched off
debate about the limits of "reality" television. Rockwell, described as a
millionaire from real estate investments, picked Conger from among 50
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just going to be on TV and wave to my family and friends," she said
today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it was just a lark."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was "was just in complete shock" when she was chosen, adding:
"I wish I had the moral fortitude at that point to walk away."
</P>
<P>
	   "When I was up there saying my vows to him, I didn't know where to go. I
didn't know how to escape."
</P>
<P>
	   She called the honeymoon "a chaperoned vacation with separate cabins. I
never spent one moment alone with him." However, she said she "felt I should at
least get to know him as a person and give him a chance to be a friend."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox canceled a planned rerun of the show after an online news service, The
Smoking Gun, revealed Saturday that a California judge issued a restraining
order against Rockwell in 1991 sought by his ex-fiancee, Debbie Goyne. She said
Rockwell had hit her and threatened to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell told "Dateline NBC" that he never hit Goyne, but he admitted
letting the air out of the tires on her car. He said he has a temper but "it
doesn't manifest itself too often." Conger said Rockwell was not abusive toward
her but "then again, I didn't give him an opportunity to be."
</P>
<P>
	   He said of the show that he "really had a romantic ideal" in his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the flap, three new series plan to take the gamble of putting real
people in real-life dramas for fun and profit.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, as investors
shifted their attention back to the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
64.53 at 10,240.31.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was up 37.01 at 4,419.13. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 6.39 at 1,345.78.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued their pattern of rotating in and out of selective groups
of stocks. Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned to favor on Tuesday --
helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover a bit from Friday's broad
selloff -- were down again today.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets are trying to fight back from last week's selloff, but there's
still a lot of ambiguity out there," said Brian Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., a Kansas City brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems was leading the technology sector, trading up $3.69 at
$127.63.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, up $4 at $53.75, and Time Warner, up $4.94 at $78.50, were
two of the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. The two stocks had
fallen after announcing their planned merger last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 1.51 today at 542.46.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 50.09 million shares down from the

</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declining issues on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Senators Urge Clinton Pakistan Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and
eight other Democratic senators are asking President Clinton to consider
visiting Pakistan next month if it would help ease U.S. foreign policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter delivered to the White House Tuesday night, they said ``if there
can be progress, we would urge you, equally strongly, to include both India and
Pakistan on your itinerary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has announced plans to go to India and to Bangladesh, but has
delayed a decision on Pakistan, where military rulers took control last October
and raised concerns about democracy's future in the South Asia country.
</P>
<P>
	   The senators said the trip, first by a president to the region since 1978,
offers a chance to make progress on controlling dangerous weapons and on the
territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was circulated by Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and signed also by
Daschle and Sens. Robert G. Toricelli, D-N.J.; Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.;
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.; Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D.; Richard J. Durbin,
D-Ill.; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; and Daniel K. Akaka, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   The senators said U.S. policy had always been aimed at achieving a balance
between India and Pakistan. ``We have often been frustrated in our policies
towards both nations but still have never hesitated to engage them at all levels
of our government,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Court Stops Hawaii Vote Restriction  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today struck down Hawaii's practice of
letting only people with Hawaiian blood vote for leaders of a program that
benefits descendants of the island's original residents.
</P>
<P>
	   The voting restriction allows unlawful racial discrimination, the justices
ruled by a 7-2 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A state may not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, and
this law does so,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court as it
invalidated a provision of Hawaii's constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   A white Hawaii rancher had challenged the state's limits on who can vote for
trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which administers state funds and
proceeds of public land to aid people descended from original Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
	   The office, created in 1978, administers a $300 million trust that provides
economic, social, health and education aid for about 200,000 residents of
Hawaiian blood.
</P>
<P>
	   The state constitution limits voting for the trustees to people descended
from the original Hawaiians on the islands in 1778, date of the first known
arrival by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaii was a kingdom until 1893, when the last queen was overthrown with
U.S. help. In 1993, the Clinton administration acknowledged the action was
illegal and apologized to Hawaiians for the U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaii was a U.S. territory until 1959, when it became the 50th state.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Rice, the Big Island rancher who challenged the voting limit, has no
Hawaiian blood but his family has lived on the islands since the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice's lawyers argued that the voting restriction was racially
discriminatory. He did not challenge the state's right to create a trust to
benefit people with Hawaiian blood.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials, supported by the federal government, argued that the voting
law was valid because Congress and the state have an obligation to native
Hawaiians who lost their land, similar to the government's obligation to
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the culture and way of life of a people are all but engulfed by a
history beyond their control, their sense of loss may extend down through
generations and their dismay may be shared by many members of the larger
community,'' Kennedy said. But he added that Hawaii's attempt ``to address these
realities'' must keep in mind that the federal Constitution ``has become the
heritage of all citizens of Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court refused to treat Hawaii's practice as one similar to federal
programs to aid Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Writing for
the two, Stevens said the decision ``rests largely on the repetition of
glittering generalities that have little, if any, application to the compelling
history of the state of Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision is a rare one for modern times because it rests on the
Constitution's 15th Amendment, a Civil War-era measure aimed at protecting the
rights of former slaves.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Rice vs. Cayetano, 98-818.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Chance for Talks With Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring that ``there may be some change in the
offing,'' the White House reached out today to reformers in Iran who scored a
stunning electoral victory by capturing at least two-thirds of the seats in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote was a major setback to hard-liners opposed to President Mohammad
Khatami's reform program and could offer the possibility of engagement between
Washington and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have said for some time that we want to engage in a constructive and
authorized dialogue to address all the issues that concern us,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the outstanding issues include any Iranian programs to produce
weapons of mass destruction, support of terrorism and opposition to the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think these elections at this stage indicate that there may be some
change in the offing,'' Lockhart said, ``but I think we need to let that process
finish ... and more importantly see what comes of it as far as the (Iranian)
government's ... willingness to address these issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 195 parliamentary seats decided so far, reformists have won 141, more
than 70 percent. Final results are to be announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States severed relations with Iran after radical followers of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took
52 Americans hostage. The United States still maintains economic sanctions
against Iran and accuses it of being a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart brushed aside suggestions that it was up to the United States to
take the first step to renew ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think this is a matter of who takes what step,'' he said. ``If
they are willing to engage in this dialogue, I think that would be a positive
step. We'll have to see.''

<HEADLINE> Court Tightens RICO Suit Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today stiffened the deadline for
lawsuits that invoke a federal anti-racketeering law, killing the case of a
Texas man who says he illegally was held in a psychiatric hospital by
profit-greedy doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   The unanimous decision in a Texas case said the four-year deadline for
filing lawsuits under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) begins to run before someone actually discovers that a defendant's
racketeering activity caused harm.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court stopped short of saying just when the deadline does begin to
run. ``We do not ... settle upon a final rule,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some federal appeals courts have ruled that the deadline begins when someone
first discovers the harm, whether or not they know the cause. That standard
would be far more daunting for people seeking to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   Aimed primarily at fighting organized crime, the RICO law has both criminal
and civil provisions. Past Supreme Court decisions -- a dozen of them in the
past 14 years -- have let plaintiffs invoke the law's civil provisions in a wide
variety of disputes, by anyone allegedly harmed by a ``pattern'' of illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   RICO, unlike most other federal laws, rewards successful plaintiffs with
tripled damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Rotella invoked the RICO law in suing two dozen doctors over his
16-month stay at Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rotella, now a Dallas-Fort Worth area resident, was 16 when in 1985 he was
admitted to Brookhaven on the request of his mother. He remained there until
shortly after his 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital closed down in 1992. Two years later, its parent company
pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy RICO violations in connection with keeping
patients confined longer than necessary to drive up profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Rotella sued in 1997, seeking to collect monetary damages. The doctors
successfully had the lawsuit thrown out on grounds that Rotella missed the
four-year deadline for filing a RICO lawsuit. Lower courts ruled that the
deadline began to run the minute he was released from the psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers argued that the deadline clock should not have begun ticking
until he discovered in 1994 the facts that would lead him to suspect a pattern
of racketeering activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the court today, Justice David H. Souter said the lower courts
were right.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Rotella's lawsuit ``was timely only if the so-called 'injury and
pattern discovery' rule governs the start of the four-year limitations period,''
Souter said, ``We hold that it does not.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Rotella vs. Wood, 98-846.

<HEADLINE> Court Says Appeals Aren't Automatic  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminal defense lawyers are not always required to file
appeals after their clients plead guilty unless the clients specifically ask
them to, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-3 decision in a California murder case said a defense lawyer's failure
to file an appeal did not necessarily violate her client's constitutional right
to adequate legal help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot say, as a constitutional matter, that in every case counsel's
failure to consult with the defendant about an appeal is necessarily
unreasonable and therefore deficient,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for
the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We therefore reject a bright-line rule that counsel must always consult
with the defendant regarding an appeal,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's decision set aside a federal appeals court ruling that gave Lucio
Flores Ortega a new chance to appeal his second-degree murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortega pleaded guilty in a Fresno County court in 1993 to fatally stabbing
someone during a brawl at a bar. During the plea proceeding, he said he did not
commit the crime but was pleading guilty because his court-appointed lawyer,
Nancy Kops, advised him to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortega was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, and the judge told him
he had 60 days to file an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   After the sentencing, Ortega, who speaks only Spanish, had a conversation
with Kops in which Ortega got the impression the lawyer would file an appeal.
The lawyer later said she did not recall such a conversation.
</P>
<P>
	   No appeal was filed within the deadline, and when Ortega filed an appeal
later, state courts turned him down.
</P>
<P>
	   He went to federal court, where a magistrate judge found that while Ortega
did not consent to Kops' failure to file an appeal, he also did not prove she
promised to file one.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ortega must be released
from custody or given a new chance to appeal. Kops' failure to file an appeal
violated Ortega's right to adequate legal help under the Constitution's Sixth
Amendment, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Supreme Court said the 9th Circuit court was wrong about that. It
sent Ortega's case back to the lower courts to determine whether there are other
reasons to conclude that his right to adequate legal help was violated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on the record before us, we are unable to determine whether Ms. Kops
had a duty to consult with (Ortega) ... whether she satisfied her obligations
and, if she did not, whether (Ortega) was prejudiced thereby,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
	   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg
dissented.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the three, Souter favored requiring lawyers to consult with
their guily-pleading clients about possible appeals in virtually all cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Roe vs. Ortega, 98-1441.

<HEADLINE> Trade Accord May Be Endangered  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's new threats to Taiwan and Vice President Al
Gore's apparent ambivalence could combine to kill a market-opening trade
agreement sought by President Clinton, bipartisan Senate leaders warned the
administration today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're going to lose this,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,
senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Moynihan complained after Barshefsky declined to rule out the possibility
that the administration might support amendments seeking additional labor and
environmental protections -- amendments that could help shore up Gore's standing
with organized labor in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite prodding from committee members, Barshefsky also declined to say
exactly when the administration would send the trade deal to Congress -- other
than to reiterate that the administration hopes for passage as early as possible
this year and would produce the bill ``at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moynihan and Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the committee chairman, suggested
any such modifications could end up scrapping the measure to give China
permanent trade benefits to ease its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth called this week's stepping up of pressure on Taiwan by China's
communist leaders ``reckless.'' The threats clearly will intrude in
congressional consideration of the trade bill, Roth suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth suggested the debate might be postponed ``if the broader relationship
between our countries is in question.''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., suggested that
China's menacing comments, contained in a new 11,000-word policy statement,
could end up backfiring on Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What China did this week was very counterproductive,'' Daschle told
reporters. ``They need to take great care in their public pronouncements if they
truly want to become part of the world community.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the Barshefsky pressed the administration's case in support of the China
trade bill before the Finance Committee, both Roth and Moynihan expressed alarm
over reports that Gore showed less than complete support for the trade deal in
meetings last week with AFL-CIO leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Gore later wrote a letter to a leading business organization
reaffirming his support for action this year on the accord the administration
negotiated with China, some business leaders suggested that Gore had hinted he
could negotiate a better agreement as president with stronger worker and
environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment about
getting this done,'' Roth told Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Moynihan also said he was troubled, although he noted that ``the vice
president is campaigning and things are said in campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
	   He asked Barshefsky to assure Congress that administration officials ``want
a bill now and that they will fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Barshefsky did not answer the question directly, noting, ``In terms of
amendments, obviously as always the administration would work with the Congress.
The purpose of the administration is passage.''
</P>
<P>
	   The wording of the trade accord negotiated with China last November cannot
be changed, she said. But she held open the possibility that the administration
might support unspecified side agreements. Among the possibilities being
discussed in Congress is a mechanism to allow continued review of China's
conduct on human rights and labor practices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president has made it very clear that he fully supports the
agreement as negotiated,'' Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That certainly isn't the signal that was given to labor leaders,'' Roth
replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If efforts are made to amend along the lines of what the vice president
was talking about, no matter how desirable, it's going to sabotage the
process,'' Roth said.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks this morning as the technology sector returned to
favor and investors sold big industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   In late morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 74.15 at
10,230.69.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was up 48.97 at 4,431.09. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 4.75 at 1,347.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued their pattern of rotating in and out of selective groups
of stocks. Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned to favor on Tuesday --
helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover a bit from Friday's broad
selloff -- were down again today.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets are trying to fight back from last week's selloff, but there's
still a lot of ambiguity out there," said Brian Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., a Kansas City brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology sector was led by such bellwether computer stocks as Cisco
Systems, up $4 at $127.94 and Sun Microsystems, up $3.25 at $91.25.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, up $4.81 at $54.56, and Time Warner, up $6 at $79.56, were
two of the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. The two stocks had
fallen after announcing their planned merger last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 2.38 today at 543.33.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 291.15 million shares, down from
321.14 million the same time Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Exhibit Showcases Heartland  </HEADLINE>
    By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Seen from an airplane window on the way to either
coast, the Midwest is the country's bulging but boring midsection, a homogeneous
region of farms, fields and factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Seen up close, from Kansas prairies to Ohio city streets, the Midwest is a
heterogeneous landscape of diverse peoples, cultures and values.
</P>
<P>
	   A new show at the Columbus Museum of Art explores the contradictions of the
American Midwest through historical paintings and photographs, and four
contemporary exhibits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland" looks at the Midwest
through the nuanced eyes of such artists as American scene painter Grant Wood,
photographer Margaret Bourke-White and artist-architect Maya Lin.
</P>
<P>
	   The show tries to answer the questions, "What is the nature of the Midwest?"
and "What does it mean to be Midwestern?" said Nannette Maciejunes, the museum's
director of exhibitions and collections.
</P>
<P>
	   People from the Midwest are often torn about the region, glad they have
roots there, but often more than ready to leave it all behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the things running through the heart of the exhibit, both the
historical and contemporary elements, is this ambivalence, this love-hate tug
that people from here have about this region," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The exhibit combines the four contemporary installations with more than 100
paintings and photographs from the 1920s through the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Illusions of Eden" is part of a larger artistic endeavor called "The
Heartland Project." This undertaking -- three traveling museum exhibitions and
an interactive Web site -- considers the impact of culture on everyday life in
the American Midwest and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Columbus show is centered on five motifs of American and Midwestern
culture: journey, garden, home, word and work.
</P>
<P>
	   Eden is fecundity, and Wood's 1936 "Spring Turning" is a mythic ode to
farming and fertility with its curvaceous hills and fields cornered as sharply
as a carpenter's square.
</P>
<P>
	   Directly beside it hangs John Steuart Curry's "Wisconsin Landscape"
(1938-39), commissioned by the Farm Foundation of Chicago and a nonromantic
tribute to scientific farming methods of the day. Towering clouds roll across
the sky, mottling the carefully tended fields in shards of shadow and sunlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Eden is the loss of innocence, and John Rogers Cox's 1942 "Grey and Gold" is
an allusion to the uneasiness in Mid-America as World War II engulfed Europe.
Dark storm clouds billowing skyward are the ominous backdrop to a rural
crossroads surrounded by golden wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Justice," a 1933 painting by Joe Jones, looks the garden's serpent
in the eye, with its robed Klansmen, burning farmhouse and half-naked black
woman in the foreground, a noose hanging from a nearby tree.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones painted "American Justice" while teaching a class for unemployed
blacks in the same St. Louis courthouse where the Dred Scott decision --
declaring slaves could not be counted as citizens -- was handed down 76 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Eden is also a place where people lived, and Clyde Singer's "Street People"
(1936) is the plain pageant of young and old, women and men, thin and fat,
passing up and down a busy thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Bourke-White's photograph, "In the Conversation Club," is a 1937
portrait of an older women's study group in Muncie, Ind., taken for Life
magazine. It hangs in contrast to Wood's "Daughters of Revolution," a smug look
at the Daughters of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   By dwelling on rural landscapes and small towns, as well as images of work,
labor and industry, the exhibit "is an expression of our beliefs, about who we
are, sometimes in great opposition to other people's viewpoints," said Robert
Stearns, senior program director of Arts Midwest, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit
arts council.
</P>
<P>
	   The four contemporary installations offer very different views of the
region. Columbus artist Malcolm Cochran observed the endless stream of large
tanker trucks barreling past Ohio fields and farms on Interstate 71 before
creating "Steel Tanks" last year. Four containers fill an entire gallery like
giant lopsided milk bottles made of iron.
</P>
<P>
	   Cochran, who pondered the region's dual history of mass production and
agriculture as he set about to work, is pleased that some have also seen the
tanks as male or female forms.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me that means there's a perception of fertility in the form -- I think
that's also good in the regional context, this being a fertile part of the
country," Cochran, 51, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and the
Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Ala., contributed a 1997 particle board
sculpture, an untitled topographical landscape of undulating lines that recalls
a wheat field following the contours of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-year-old Lin grew up in Athens, Ohio, the daughter of Chinese
immigrants. Her father was a ceramist and dean of the College of Fine Arts at
Ohio University. She hoped to capture the "magic of the lilting, tilting plain"
of the Midwestern landscape with her piece.
</P>
<P>
	   "For whatever reason, my work has always been about the land," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously I've sort of traced it back, being from Athens, Ohio, growing up
in a very rolling hill, rural landscape, my father being a ceramist, a craftsman
who came to the States, settled in the Midwest, and his medium was clay, which
is a very fluid, plastic medium.
</P>
<P>
	   "What do my landscapes always do? They push and they pull the earth."
</P>
<P>
	   "Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland," runs through April
30.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland," one of three shows
comprising "The Heartland Project," runs in Columbus, Ohio, through April 30.
</P>
<P>
	   From Columbus, the show travels to the Museum of Modern Art in Vienna (June
1-Aug. 15), the Ludwig Museum in Budapest (Sept. 21-Nov. 26), the Madison Art
Center in Madison, Wis. (Feb. 24-May 13, 2001), and the Washington Pavilion of
Arts and Science in Sioux Falls, S.D. (June-August 2001).
</P>
<P>
	   The show is one of the three comprising "The Heartland Project." The others:

<HEADLINE> Polish Filmmaker Gets Last Laugh  </HEADLINE>
    By BEATA PASEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- After decades of sparring with censors, filmmaker
Andrzej Wajda was elated when Polish communism collapsed in 1989. Then he
discovered the downside: Newly unfettered film fans suddenly were snubbing his
steeped-in-history sagas for flashy Hollywood blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
	   If that wasn't enough, the loss of communist-era subsidies threatened to
consign Poland's once-vibrant film industry to the dustbin of history.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting an urge simply to quit, Wajda stuck stubbornly to his time-tested
style. A decade later, he is having the last laugh, with a blockbuster film of
his own in Poland and a coveted Hollywood Oscar that eluded him for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is so moving," Wajda, 73, said after learning he will receive a lifetime
achievement Oscar at the Academy Awards on March 26. "I always thought that if I
managed to convince Poles about my movies, then maybe someone else will also get
interested in them."
</P>
<P>
	   Even sweeter is acclaim for his latest film, "Mr. Tadeusz," a sweeping
adaptation of poet Adam Mickiewicz's verse-novel about life, love and intrigue
among Polish nobility.
</P>
<P>
	   A staple snooze on Polish school reading lists, "Mr. Tadeusz" under Wajda's
hand has enchanted a nation. Even in difficult Polish verse -- subtitles in the
U.S. release are translated into prose -- the movie's sweeping landscapes and
painting-as-film style are drawing viewers at a record pace in Poland.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those moved by the imagery was Polish-born Pope John Paul II, who
watched the film with Wajda in a private Vatican screening after the Academy
announced the lifetime award. "I could never have imagined that this verse novel
could be so well made into a film," the pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Things have rarely looked this bright for Wajda, who was forced during most
of his career to navigate the tricky territory between communist-era ideology
and an audience yearning for freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   He found solace in history, deftly using old themes to circumvent the
censors as he chronicled his homeland's struggles and drove home the values of
heroism, solidarity and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics said Polish history was too perplexing for non-Poles, and that Wajda
risked international isolation by dwelling on it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since my first movie, I was told, 'Who will understand that? Who will watch
that?" Wajda said in a recent interview in Warsaw's Old Town. "But my films
broke through and attracted viewers."
</P>
<P>
	   Wajda's films never caught on with U.S. audiences, although two have been
nominated for Oscars as best foreign film: the 1974 "Land of Promise," a tale of
lost ideals in a rush to get rich, and the 1979 "Maids from Wilko" about the
inevitable demise of love and life.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Wajda's earlier films -- "Kanal" in 1957 and "Ashes and Diamonds" in
1958 -- drew on his experience as an anti-Nazi resistance fighter, and portray
his generation's struggle to preserve patriotic values after surviving the Nazis
only to fall under Soviet domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Wajda says he was shaped by a loving mother, an exacting father, the
Catholic church and, of course, the sweep of history. His father was among
thousands of officers secretly executed in Katyn by the Soviets after Poland's
partition in 1939. Wajda's mother had to find a job, forcing a once well-off
intelligentsia family into a working-class existence that provided more fodder
for Wajda's films.
</P>
<P>
	   Wajda's calm, noble demeanor belies the turbulence he has witnessed and
sought to portray on the screen. Showing no signs of strain from multiple-bypass
heart surgery last October, he speaks with quiet confidence, often underscoring
a point with a warm smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "Poles make lots of mistakes because they often get involved with losers,"
he said. "They have lots of hopes and illusions. They should be warned to be
more realistic."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rigors of communist censorship, he sought to help shape the
social struggle that spawned Solidarity, the trade union that eventually toppled
communist rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his successes of that era were "Man of Marble" and its 1981 sequel,
"Man of Iron," about the disillusionment of a father and son under the communist
system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Man of Iron" won the Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm that year and was
tipped for an Oscar, but the communists banned the film and withdrew it from
competition when they imposed martial law in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   After communism fell in 1989, Wajda said, his films became "an attempt to
rediscover this part of Polish culture that has been concealed for years." They
included "Korczak," about a Polish Jewish teacher who died in Nazi gas chambers,
and "Easter Week," about Polish attitudes toward the uprising in Warsaw's Jewish
ghetto in 1943.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were snubbed by Poles who preferred the flashier Hollywood films. Wajda
denounced the audience as "either absorbed in itself or entertainment" and he
considered giving up films.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, with "Mr. Tadeusz," Wajda decided to make a film just for the fun
of it. "For the first time I told myself, 'I am a director in a free country,
and I have no other duties than making a beautiful film."'
</P>
<P>
	   Like most of Wajda's works, "Mr. Tadeusz" has won praise for painting-like
qualities that reflect his early training at the Art Academy in Krakow, before
he entered the Lodz Film School. Wajda himself describes his 44 works as "a
great mural depicting Polish history."
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes he can drop a scene in the middle, saying 'I'm bored, let's do
something else,"' said Adek Drabinski, Wajda's assistant on "Mr. Tadeusz." "He
works more like a painter than a director. It's very unusual."

<HEADLINE> Series Aims To Re-Create Festival  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUGLAS J. ROWE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For all the attention independent films have gotten in
recent years, many of them still never see the light of day -- or the dark of a
theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Meistrich wants to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman of the independent film studio Shooting Gallery, he's created a
nationwide film series that offers six well-regarded but underexposed indie
movies over 12 weeks. He hopes to appeal to anyone who's ever wanted to attend
Sundance or Cannes, by replicating the film-festival experience.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just want to sort of take that to the consumer who's not going to fly to
Park City for 10 days in January," Meistrich says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shooting Gallery Film Series gets under way Friday (Feb. 25) at Loews
theaters in nearly 20 cities, including New York and Los Angeles, which have a
fair share of art-house cinemas, and Indianapolis and Tucson, Ariz., which
don't.
</P>
<P>
	   It begins with Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin," starring Golden Globe winner
Edie Falco of television's acclaimed "The Sopranos" in the title role. The movie
includes the late Madeline Kahn's last movie performance and won Mendelsohn the
directing award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   The series -- which costs $90 -- also includes a "club night," in which
moviegoers can participate in a Q-and-A with someone from the movie, or a local
film critic or professor. (Tickets can be purchased for individual films, too,
and they'll all air on Encore and Starz! pay cable channels after the series
ends.)
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a program geared towards what many people have an affinity to --
which is a communal experience, sitting in a movie theater, having somebody with
a unique voice telling you a cool story," Meistrich says.
</P>
<P>
	   If it succeeds, it'll expand into more cities come fall, when another
six-film series already is planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Des Moines, Iowa, there are people who will want to see 'Judy Berlin.' I
know it," says Meistrich, whose studio has produced "Sling Blade," for which
Billy Bob Thornton won a 1996 screenwriting Oscar, and "You Can Count On Me,"
winner of two awards at this year's Sundance festival.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's a market that can be cultivated," says Robert Lenihan,
executive vice president for Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which is supplying
the theaters. "Independent films are more popular today than they've ever been
and the time is right to broaden the availability for people to see them."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Meistrich notes, "The market is the only place that tells the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   Many people complain that they don't get to see these kinds of films and can
sound passionate about them. But will they go? "We built the machine. We built
the car. Now you've got to turn it on and use it," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Meistrich's idea grew out of going to film festivals for 10 years and
hearing people say: "Hey, man, you made a great movie. I don't know what to do
with it. ... It's too smart, too good for a mainstream audience."
</P>
<P>
	   Meistrich felt that was "Blah-blah-blah. Excuse after excuse."
</P>
<P>
	   The foremost criterion for selecting the films was critical success. The New
York Times has raved about "Judy Berlin," and Roger Ebert and Variety praised a
comedy in the series, "Adrenaline Drive," about a timid couple in trouble with
the mob.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other films in the inaugural series: "Orphans," a drama set in
Glasgow that focuses on three brothers and a sister dealing with their mother's
death. It won four awards at the 1998 Venice International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   Meistrich makes it clear he's in this to make money, as is Loews and other
corporate sponsors including Heineken and Polo Jeans Co. The demographic of the
independent filmgoer is "through the roof," he says: highly educated, wealthy,
big-spending people.
</P>
<P>
	   He also makes it clear this effort isn't "anti-studio."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not anti-action film or anti-Hollywood. I like those movies, too. We
all do. We all pretend that we don't but we do," Meistrich says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
	   But after seeing a good shoot-'em-up one weekend, he says, the next weekend
it's good to see "something different."

<HEADLINE> Kafka Descendent Knew About Ancestor  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Author Kimberley Kafka was in college before she knew she
was related to Franz Kafka. Another contemporary writer, Paul Kafka, had been
told about his ancestor virtually from the time he was born.
</P>
<P>
	   "My dad is a psychoanalyst, and an Austrian intellectual, so he was
fascinated by the connection," says the 40-year-old Kafka, a novelist and
free-lance book critic who lives in Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Kafka is not as closely related to the famous writer as is Kimberley,
whose grandfather was a first cousin of Franz and a likely model for the novel
"Amerika." Paul Kafka's grandfather was a distant cousin.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike Kimberley, he grew up Jewish and Franz Kafka was a name worth
dropping. Raised in Bethesda, Md., he decided early to become a writer, too, and
majored in English and creative writing at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best thing about the name is that you find readers wherever you are,"
he says. "I remember when I was trying to get in a nightclub and the bouncer
took a look at my ID and said, 'Kafka? Any relation?' That's much more fun than
having a professor say it."
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka has published one novel, "Love: Enter," and hopes to have another out
next year. Although he admires the work of Franz Kafka, he prefers other
writers, including Virginia Woolf and Cynthia Ozick. He's also a fan of Elmore
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think 'The Metamorphosis' is a wonderfully funny story, but I'm not a
thorough reader of Kafka," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   One book he's now anxious to read is Kimberley's novel, "True North." Until
seeing an item in Publishers Weekly he hadn't known about the book. And he had
never heard of Kimberley Kafka.

<HEADLINE> The Kafkaesque Story of Kafka  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LA GRANGE, Wis. (AP) -- For the writer in search of seclusion, this township
of cattle and corn will answer the call. An hour's drive southwest of Milwaukee,
it's a back road off a back road off a narrow highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the residents is an author descended from one of the world's most
famous writers. She lives in a converted farmhouse, built in the 19th century
and enclosed by 12 acres, bare save for an occasional oak or maple tree.
</P>
<P>
	   The look inside is rustic, with exposed beams, oak floors and a brick
fireplace. While volumes of Shakespeare fill a maple bookcase, the active life
is honored more than the contemplative. That tan pelt spread over one of the
living room chairs used to belong to a deer. On the walls hang watercolor prints
of Alaska, black and white sketches of Maine and snow shoes webbed with rawhide.
</P>
<P>
	   The author's name appears at the bottom of one shoe, as unlikely a name in
this setting as a portrait of William Faulkner in a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberley Kafka is the first cousin-twice removed of Franz Kafka, and is
herself a published writer of nearly 20 years. She has written short stories,
journalistic pieces and also completed a novel, "True North," set in the Alaskan
bush and scheduled to come out this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "Writing was always a passion. It seemed like the only thing I could do
without too much of a struggle," the 42-year-old Kafka says. "I started writing
stories in kindergarten; I hadn't even made any connection to Franz Kafka."
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka works out of a tiny attic office where the furniture is old, made of
wood, and passed down from the non-Kafka side of the family. There's a desk, a
scratched-up file cabinet and a rocking chair in which the tall author sits
cross-legged, her knees extending slightly over the chair's arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing jeans and a large purple sweater, Kimberley Kafka appears far more
defined by her upbeat, American first name than her dark, haunted last name.
She's energetic and articulate, with a healthy smile and a friendly, raspy
voice. Cigarettes are her vice and, periodically, she'll step out into the
afternoon cold for a "burn one" break, a phrase Franz Kafka surely didn't hear
in the coffee houses of Prague.
</P>
<P>
	   But her life, in more ways than one, has been Kafkaesque. For years, her own
background was as inscrutable as the Castle in her ancestor's classic novel.
Only in college did she learn there even was a Franz Kafka. And only in the most
unfortunate way did she discover they were related.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still trying to make sense of it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Franz Kafka was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1883 and died a month
before his 41st birthday, having long suffered from tuberculosis. Although "The
Metamorphosis" and other stories were published in his lifetime, he was little
known until the posthumous release of such novels as "The Castle" and "The
Trial."
</P>
<P>
	   As both his fiction and his diaries revealed, Kafka was the most tortured of
artists, touched by everything from Jewish despair to the bureaucratic state. He
never married and lived in terror of his overpowering father, a relationship
made painfully famous by his once-private confession, "Letter to His Father."
</P>
<P>
	   In Kafka's first novel, "Amerika," a teen-age European caught up in a sex
scandal is shipped by his parents to the New World. He's a typically passive
Kafka character, dragged through a variety of jobs and friends in the East
before hitching up with a theater company and boarding a train to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   According to several biographies, "Amerika" was based in part on Kimberley
Kafka's grandfather, Otto Kafka. He was Franz Kafka's first cousin and he
apparently ran away from home as a teen-ager, worked on a ship and settled in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Franz Kafka never spent a moment in America and he didn't finish the novel.
But imagine the story continuing. Suppose the immigrant marries a Christian and
raises children. One of those children has his own children and raises them as a
"typical" American family.
</P>
<P>
	   And suppose no one ever mentions the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever Kimberley Kafka knows about her father's side of the family, she's
learned from books. By the time her father, Philip Kafka, was born, the past had
been wiped out with the savagery of a pogrom. They weren't immigrants or Jews.
They were Americans, period.
</P>
<P>
	   "My grandfather was fleeing anti-Semitism," she says. "There was this whole
sensitivity to it, the fear of it. My mother was Christian and my dad was not
born into any religion. He did not discuss religion in any way."
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Kafka ended up in Jacksonville, Fla., where Frances Kimberley Kafka
was born. (The first name comes from her mother's mother; all her life she has
been called Kimberley). She was the youngest of three siblings and her parents,
both pilots in World War II, were already in late middle age at the time of her
birth.
</P>
<P>
	   When she was 8, her sister slipped her a family secret: Kimberley had been
adopted because their mother no longer could have children.
</P>
<P>
	   "My sister told me that to get back for something I did to her," she
recalls. "All of my childhood, people would say, 'You look just like your
father.' And I would sort of smile and giggle and laugh because I knew I was
adopted."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, writing was in her blood, more than she realized. As a child, she was
under the spell of words, even letters. Staring in wonder at the straight and
curvy lines, she would arrange them in random combinations and show them to her
sister.
</P>
<P>
	   "My poor sister would be trying to do her homework and I'd be asking, 'Is
this a word?' 'No.' 'Is this is a word?' 'No,"' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka read like a demon, everything from children's stories to Shakespeare.
A book was a book, no matter if she understood it. Reaching for whatever she saw
on the family bookshelves, she was once sent home from grade school for having a
copy of Jacqueline Susann's racy novel, "Valley of the Dolls."
</P>
<P>
	   No Franz Kafka books were in the house and at no time was it pointed out
that her father had a cousin with a kindred passion. Neither her parents, her
friends nor her teachers ever mentioned Kafka. Kimberley blames this on the
family taboo against the past and on the schools in her small community.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did the best they could considering they had no money," she says. "It
was a nightmare. The teachers were hammered. It was pathetic. You just got your
diploma and got out."
</P>
<P>
	   But she was bright enough to be admitted to Bennington College, an elite
liberal arts school in Vermont. There, she was initiated. A fellow student asked
if she was related to THAT Kafka. Kimberley had no idea what he meant. After
more students asked, she phoned her parents.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mom said there was no relation. She maintained for the longest time that
there was absolutely no connection," Kafka says.
</P>
<P>
	   While home during her sophomore year, evidence emerged, its discovery right
out of a bad novel. Kimberley Kafka was straightening out a bookcase in the
living room when she came upon a packet of letters to her father at the back of
a shelf. They were from a biographer, asking questions about Otto Kafka.
</P>
<P>
	   For more than a year, she learned nothing more. Her father, who apparently
never answered the biographer, was already dead when the letters were found. Her
mother, who died years later, didn't want to discuss it. Meanwhile, something
else bothered her. She had a dream in which she stood in a tilted room and saw
adjacent pictures of her father and herself. It was an omen, reminding her that
people said they looked alike.
</P>
<P>
	   When an uncle came to visit, she got him to confess.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before I was born my mother wanted another child. And what I had been told
was that my father had informed her that there was a woman who was pregnant and
she was putting the baby up for adoption," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much to my horror I found what really happened. Everybody loved my dad. He
was tall and very attractive and he fooled around a little and got this woman
pregnant."
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka has never met her biological mother and doesn't want to. She didn't
discuss it with her siblings and only briefly mentioned her father's affair to
the mother who raised her. "Do you suppose it's possible?" she once asked when
they were in the car together. "Yes," she was told, "I suppose it's possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Had Kimberley looked carefully at a picture of the young Franz Kafka she
might have suspected sooner. The resemblance is obvious: dark hair and deep,
dark eyes; a wide, sensitive mouth and a wide, strong chin. When she was in
graduate school at Hollins College, in Roanoke, Va., a prankster merged the two
faces.
</P>
<P>
	   "I remember coming into the office one night and there was this picture,
with his hair slicked back, looking very severe," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was mimeographed on a piece of paper, and taped on the door. My hair was
very long at the time and they had drawn hair on it. And the caption said, 'What
grad student does this remind you of?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "She was furious," recalls novelist Madison Smartt Bell, a friend of Kafka's
and a fellow Hollins student. "She didn't want to be overshadowed by the
association."
</P>
<P>
	   But sometimes the reminders amused her. At Bennington, she became the hit of
the English department when she dated a distant relation of Boris Pasternak. And
while most teachers avoided mentioning Franz Kafka in the classroom, at least
one couldn't help himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "One semester there was a visiting German professor and I took a Thomas Mann
course with him. The professor was very old at that point -- he had to be in his
early 80s, and he was a Kafka fanatic. I just adored this man," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we were doing 'Magic Mountain.' It cracked me up; he would be lecturing
to the class and his eyes would be going over a line and instead of saying,
'Hans Castorp' he would be saying, 'Hans Kafka -- I mean Castorp -- excuse me
Miss Kafka!' And he would blush and was all red."
</P>
<P>
	   In college, she read her first Kafka book, "The Trial." She didn't like it,
or better to say she didn't like what he wrote about. Kimberley Kafka lives
within as few boundaries as possible; her ancestor imagined a world of closed
doors or doors that simply opened to other doors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am claustrophobic," she says. "And my heartbeat would go up and down
during 'The Trial."'
</P>
<P>
	   Out of obligation rather than pleasure, she read Kafka. But other authors
spoke to her more: Jack London, whose Alaskan adventures were an inspiration for
her own; contemporary writers such as Barry Lopez and George Garrett. Even among
novelists from the Old World, she preferred others, notably Mann.
</P>
<P>
	   Her times outdoors also inspired her. The further from cities, the closer
she gets to something like religion. In her late 20s, she knew two wilderness
guides and joined them on a two-week canoe trip on the East coast of Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the most physically miserable experience I ever had, and I was
addicted," she says. "You're inundated with black flies. It's just cold and
raining all the time. I had never experienced anything so soul-shattering, being
at the mercy of weather and bugs. I just loved it."
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, she has managed fishing lodges both in the United States and
Canada and became a certified wilderness emergency medical technician. La Grange
is her winter home, and practically cosmopolitan compared to where she goes each
summer: She flies to Alaska and lives in a tent on the state's western coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka began working on "True North" in 1997 and completed her first draft
the following year. Within days of being sent to publishers, the novel was sold
to Dutton, a division of Penguin Putnam Inc., for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought she was wonderfully promising, regardless of the name," says
Elisa Petrini, her editor at Dutton and now a free-lance editor. "She's got a
long career ahead of her."
</P>
<P>
	   Kafka has never read "Amerika," but "True North" also tells the story of a
character who flees to the West. Bailey Lockhart is a Maine native with a tragic
background who ends up in Alaska, working as a bush pilot and living among
Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Billed as a "literary adventure novel" on the back cover, "True North"
offers detailed descriptions of Alaskan wilderness and detailed descriptions of
exploitation by entrepreneurs. It's a world as far from Franz Kafka as the Yukon
River is from Prague, but in one passage Kimberley joins the crimes of the New
World to her ancestor's ancient sigh.
</P>
<P>
	   "The history of usurpation in Alaska was long, often bloody, and always
sad," she writes. "It was the kind of sadness spawned when you allowed yourself
to examine in pure light the chain of cruelty intertwined irrevocably in your
fiber, regardless of what you would do to break it in the course of your own,
infinitesimal lifetime."

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Hears HMO Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today appeared unlikely to let people
sue their health maintenance organizations for offering doctors financial
bonuses to keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
	   In any HMO the interest ``is to hold down health costs because unless they
do so the HMO is going to go out of business,'' Justice David H. Souter said
during arguments in a case brought by a woman who blames her ruptured appendix
on inadequate care.
</P>
<P>
	   Such financial incentives are ``the scheme that Congress has authorized,''
added Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. ``Why should the courts get involved in this
messy business'' of deciding whether some financial incentives go too far?
</P>
<P>
	   James P. Ginzkey, the Illinois woman's lawyer, said he was not asking the
court to outlaw all physician incentives. But lawsuits should be allowed, he
said, when such financial bonuses reach ``the level of undue influence so that
it affects patient care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carter G. Phillips, the lawyer for the organization sued by Ginzkey's
client, argued that the Carle Clinic Association was a ``plain vanilla'' type of
HMO and that allowing a lawsuit against it would make all such organizations
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is no exaggeration to suggest that the future of medical care in its
delivery and its regulations are implicated'' by today's case, Phillips said.
``If Carle's setup violates (federal law) then all managed care does as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips added that patients have ``perfectly valid remedies'' in state
court and that an expansion of the right to sue under federal law would undercut
those remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Herdrich of Bloomington, Ill., collected $35,000 in damages under
state medical malpractice law. But she also wants to pursue a claim that her HMO
violated its legal duty to her under federal law by depriving her of proper
medical care and keeping the cost savings.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he found it ``hard to believe'' that when
Congress passed a 1974 law governing employee benefits, it ``wanted to gut its
own HMO legislation,'' passed a year earlier, by allowing lawsuits over
financial incentives used by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   Breyer asked Ginzkey how courts should decide which financial incentives
would be allowed and which would not. Ginzkey said it may have to be decided on
a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision in the case is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court allowed Herdrich to sue the Carle Clinic Association for
delaying diagnostic tests after she reported a sharp pain in her abdomen. Her
appendix ruptured and she contracted peritonitis, requiring emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The case stakes out one of many fronts in the war over managed care. Other
lawsuits against HMOs accuse them of violating a racketeering law by concealing
financial incentives provided to doctors to hold down treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states have decided to let patients sue HMOs, and Congress is
considering patients' rights legislation that could set new standards for
managed care and might allow patients to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue in today's case is how HMOs are affected by a federal law that
governs employee benefits and pensions, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act. The law requires employee-benefit plan managers to act solely in
beneficiaries' best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich's lawsuit said her appendix ruptured in 1992 because her doctor at
Carle Clinic delayed diagnostic tests for eight days so the tests could be
performed at a facility owned by the HMO. She was awarded $35,000 for medical
malpractice under state law.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich also alleged that Carle Clinic, which is owned by its doctors,
violated its duty to act in beneficiaries' interests by giving doctors financial
rewards to minimize costs.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court dismissed that claim, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the issue could go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Carle Clinic argues that it cannot be sued under the federal law because its
doctors do not act as plan managers. It cannot violate ERISA to operate a health
plan through a design that uses cost-containment measures, the health plan
argues.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Pegram vs. Herdrich, 98-1949.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as investors rotated out of
big industrial companies and returned their attentions to the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
86.56 at 10,218.28.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was up 52.15 at 4,434.27. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 3.61 at 1,348.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors returned to a familiar trading pattern that has characterized the
stock markets for months in which one sector moves higher and another lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned to favor on Tuesday --
helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover a bit from Friday's broad
selloff -- were down again today.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for technology stocks has returned.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets are trying to fight back from last week's selloff, but there's
still a lot of ambiguity out there," said Brian Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., a Kansas City brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech sector was led by such bellwether computer stocks as Cisco Systems,
up 5 1/2 at 129 7/16, Sun Microsystems, up 3 3/8 at 91 3/8, and 3Com Corp., up 4

investors bought the stocks today after Merrill Lynch issued a positive report
on the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 2.26 today at 543.21.

<P>
	   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
	   Director Ron Howard wanted to do something special for his alma mater. So he
donated $750,000 to pay for a new screening room at the University of Southern
California's Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts, part of the film school.
"The school was such an influential part of my training as a filmmaker that I
feel overjoyed at being able to afford future filmmakers the most innovative and
cutting-edge opportunities," said Howard, born on March 1, 1954. His credits as
a director include "Cocoon" and "Apollo 13."
</P>
<P>
	   Bernadette Peters, born on Feb. 28, 1948, won a Tony Award last year for her
portrayal of Annie Oakley in Broadway's "Annie Get Your Gun." Critics and
audiences first took notice of Peters in 1968 in the off-Broadway musical spoof
"Dames at Sea," in which she played a character modeled after Ruby Keeler.
</P>
<P>
	   Actor-director John Turturro, born on Feb. 28, 1957, has appeared in dozens
of films, including "Illuminata," a film he also directed, and "Cradle Will
Rock," directed by Tim Robbins. Turturro has struck a professional balance that
gives him enough clout in Hollywood to open doors while he maintains his
everyday life in New York. "There are some people who are really pure 'movie
stars,' but the whole idea of that doesn't really appeal to me as a person,"
Turturro said. "I think it's a very limiting position to be in. Life isn't like
that, and we all have to have contact with other people."

<HEADLINE> Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young Together  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL AP Newsfeatures Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young made some wonderful music in
the late 1960s and early '70s. There were songs of insight and feeling,
beautiful four-part harmonies and impressive guitar work.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the group split up.
</P>
<P>
	   In the years that followed, each tried solo projects, with Neil Young
scoring the most success. David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash often
worked as a trio.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Stills visited Young and played him a rough track for a Crosby,
Stills and Nash album. Young said he'd like to play on the album. In the studio,
he heard more things he liked. The quartet recorded six songs in four days.
</P>
<P>
	   They realized they were in the midst of a CSN&AMP;Y record.
</P>
<P>
	   "As soon as I showed up, I was on the same page," Young, 54, said. "Then
everybody wanted to do it because it was fun. We discovered the soul and heart
of what we do."
</P>
<P>
	   Young had recorded 15 songs for a solo album. He played some of them and the
other three members chose four songs they thought the quartet could sing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really came together in the midst of two projects," Young said. "We
merged and added stuff and made it into what this record is."
</P>
<P>
	   Reprise Records released "Looking Forward" last October, and the band has
been on tour since early this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The songs showed the direction of where we can go -- stay together and
write new songs," Young said. "We really have the method down. Everybody had a
blast doing it. I think that's what I'm most excited about -- the new music
we're going to make now by looking forward to the next record."
</P>
<P>
	   Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the album the way they first did 30
years ago, singing together into one microphone instead of laying down each
vocal separately, which they did later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We found there's a definite difference between voices electronically mixed
and mixed in the air before they ever touch electronics," Crosby, 58, said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking Forward" has two songs by Crosby, three by Stills, two by Nash and
four by Young. Each writer presented his songs and the four worked together to
shape them.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the songs wrote themselves," said Stills, 55.
</P>
<P>
	   "These guys make me want to write," Crosby said. "It's why this band is so
good for me. It makes me want to play, sing and grow."
</P>
<P>
	   Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young is far from being a nostalgia band trying to
repeat old successes. "I think we've yet to reach our peak," Young said. "I
think we've shown that we can keep doing what we're doing and that we're going
to get higher."
</P>
<P>
	   The new CD includes "Sanibel" by Denny Sarokin, who handed Nash a cassette
of the song on the street. Usually, such offerings are terrible, said Nash, 58.
"This attracted me. It was Neil's idea to close the album with it. He said
'we've put people through some changes. Now let's send them on vacation."'
</P>
<P>
	   Young considers creating new music more important than performing. But, he
said, "if everything continues to be a lot of fun, we'll find a way to do all of
it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're on a roll if we can stick with it and not get distracted with all the
attention we're going to be getting. We had one or two tracks left over. If we
make another record, chances are we've already made a little bit of it."
</P>
<P>
	   The new songs speak of hope, trying to be a good person and keeping love
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's all hard to address without sounding like you're preaching," Young
said. "I hope we haven't crossed the line. If we have, it's because we're
overanxious to make points we want to make. The songs are all sincere."
</P>
<P>
	   Although four egos were a problem in the past, Young doesn't anticipate any
problems. "Now we don't have anything to argue about we can't work out. We are
who we are. We respect each other and realize the value of what each brings to
the table. There aren't many people who have three old friends they hung out
with 30 years ago, let alone can make music with."
</P>
<P>
	   They remember past incidents and laugh, he said. "That's the kind of stuff
that makes music soar, those relationships. The more time we spend together, the
more music we play together, the more it's going to be great."
</P>
<P>
	   He grins. "Like we planned it in 1969."

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Ian Hart  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ian Hart is getting a good look at "real Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   The 35-year-old British actor, who co-starred in "The End of the Affair"
with Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes, expected to see the streets of New York
filled with carbon copies of the beauty queens that Hollywood exports around the
world in movies and on television.
</P>
<P>
	   He is pleased to see some regular folks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Back in England, we have the impression that all Americans are beautiful.
We get the 'Dynasty' viewpoint," said Hart, who was on a press tour to promote
his new film, "The Closer You Get."
</P>
<P>
	   In the film, Hart plays the leader of a group of bachelors who live in a
small village in Ireland and who are in pursuit of suitable mates. The bachelors
place a personal ad in The Miami Herald, offering women a trans-Atlantic
invitation to a dance.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the fantasy of the all-American girl that fuels their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart grew up in Liverpool, England. He decided to become an actor after
landing a part in the TV series "One Summer." But it took 12 years of doing odd
jobs and occasional stage work before he got the role that he considers his big
break -- portraying John Lennon in the 1993 film "Backbeat."
</P>
<P>
	   His other films include "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith and Gene
Hackman and "Michael Collins" with Julia Roberts and Liam Neeson.
</P>
<P>
	   1. How did you support yourself as a struggling actor?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: I have a great ability to do menial tasks without going completely
mad. I drove a van, I worked in a factory, I worked in the post office. ... I
basically had no skills but I could pretend I had skills. I didn't know how to
type, but I could make it look like I could type.
</P>
<P>
	   2. How do you choose your roles?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: I usually choose my next thing based on what I did last and do
something different. I've done quite a few comedies lately, so I was going to do
something bleak. But films aren't doing guns and violence anymore because of the
Columbine (High School) shooting. People are making only comedies, but that will
change in two years when everyone has had enough comedies.
</P>
<P>
	   3. What's the difference between working on an independent film versus a
Hollywood studio movie like "Enemy of the State"?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: You're just part of the wheel in a Hollywood film like 'Enemy of the
State' unless you're one of the stars. That's just how the power structure
works. All the minor roles are interchangeable. ... In England, all the actors
are made to feel important. But in England, they can't say 'you'll never work
for this studio again' because there are no big studios.
</P>
<P>
	   4. Would you like to star in a Hollywood blockbuster?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: Sure, I'd like to do it, but it would be the same once you began doing
the actual work. You go to work and try to do the best you can.
</P>
<P>
	   4 1/2. If you did star in a Hollywood blockbuster, who would be your
co-star?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: You never know if you want to work with someone until after you've
done it. I would like to work with Julianne (Moore) and Ralph Fiennes again.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Are you more comfortable in a small community or a big city?
</P>
<P>
	   Hart: There are pros and cons to both. In a small town, you're not lonely,
you say 'hi' to everyone. In a big city, you don't know everyone on purpose.
People want their privacy. In London, I know 100 people and I've never bumped
into any of them. But back in Liverpool, there are lots of people that I don't
want to see.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Marcus Hummon  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Singer-songwriter Marcus Hummon is a willing guinea
pig as Nashville looks to see if the Internet can pump some life into the
flagging country music industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it may change the face of music," Hummon said. "I'm not saying it
will be me, but it will be someone. It is limited now, but I do believe it is a
brave new world."
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of country music declined 4.5 percent in 1999, while sales for the
record industry overall jumped 6.1 percent. Critics say country music has become
stale and forgettable because conservative record executives have more control
over the music than do musicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Hummon and partner Scott Simon have started Velvet Armadillo Records, an
Internet label that is designed to let Hummon make the music he wants and market
it on the Internet. Armadillo's first release is "Looking for the Child,"
Hummon's new album.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the business side, I feel like the Internet is something we all need
to come to grips with in the industry," said Simon, who manages country artist
Tim McGraw. "So I wanted to be able to touch it, feel it and deal with it on a
day-to-day basis and see what impact it has on artists and their music.
</P>
<P>
	   "The second part of it was truly motivated by Marcus Hummon as an artist."
</P>
<P>
	   Hummon, 39, is a successful songwriter. His credits include Wynonna Judd's
"Only Love" and the Dixie Chicks' "Ready to Run."
</P>
<P>
	   He has worked with nearly every record label in town. But his eclectic
records have never found a home at any radio format, including country. In 1995,
Sony released "All in Good Time" and tried to market him as a male Mary Chapin
Carpenter. The album didn't sell well, although McGraw took "One of These Days"
from it and scored a major hit.
</P>
<P>
	   On "Looking for the Child," Hummon sings overtly about his Christian faith,
a facet of his music that he says record executives preferred to downplay in
their search for the broadest possible audience. His songs include "Get Ye Up
(Into the Hills)" and "Stand Up (Song for Jesus)."
</P>
<P>
	   The album also has "French Quarter Re-run," a song evoking the atmosphere of
the French Quarter in New Orleans, and "Shining Son," which takes a critical
look at the competitive nature of men in American society.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a world that's increasingly about bells and whistles, the album is an
attempt to be a voice of serious writing with integrity," Hummon said. "I aspire
to be a really good American writer. That's what I want to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet can't match the sales power of traditional marketing, at least
not yet. However, Simon said "Looking for the Child" can make a profit on far
fewer sales than a major record company release.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can sell 25,000 to 30,000 CDs and everyone will make money," Simon said.
"But we have to be careful about how much money we spend doing that."
</P>
<P>
	   Velvet Armadillo Records has spent $5,000 on a music video and is working on
partnerships with other Internet sites to promote the CD.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I go out there and create 25,000 Marcus Hummon fans, I think they'll buy
a record from him every year," Simon said. "They'll buy his book of poetry. They
may want to know what he's doing in terms of writing a screenplay. He's got a
duet project Blue Healer that he does with Stuart Adamson of the band Big
Country.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to touch the fan at a different, deeper level. And hopefully
create a fan for a lifetime."

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically
cautioned lawmakers today against spending projected federal budget surpluses
that he said may not occur.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put
in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this
surplus," said Greenspan. "And all I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to
delay for a while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the
federal government accounts is."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was answering questions in an appearance before the Senate Banking
Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual report to Congress. He gave similar
testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan also repeated sentiments today that put financial markets on
notice last week to expect further interest rate increases if the economy
continues to grow at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still largely at bay,
Greenspan said tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending boom
present potential price pressures too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fed policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, "then we are like
the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming
into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have
turned at least partially in order to come into ... a soft landing," Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many private economists are looking for at least two more quarter-point rate
increases from the central bank's next meetings in March and May.
</P>
<P>
	   Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent in four quarter-point
moves, the last one occurring Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said the reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that have
overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in recent years are not
entirely understood by economists yet. Therefore, it is difficult to predict
whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the
national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I've argued
that we should allow the surpluses run and ... reduce the debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great,
the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's final budget projects that the $3.7 trillion publicly
held portion of the $5.7 trillion national debt could be eliminated by 2013,
making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since 1835,
when Andrew Jackson was president.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has also proposed extensive new government programs, however,
including an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage.
Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately today, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said wiping out
the national debt would not harm the ability of the Federal Reserve to fight
inflation through its management of short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Meyer said
the central bank, which uses its holdings of Treasury securities to implement
changes in interest rates, will be able to adapt to a world where the level of
those securities is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "Declining Treasury debt does not pose any insurmountable long-term problem
for the Federal Reserve," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed manages the nation's money supply by buying and selling Treasury
securities. If it wants to increase the money supply and thus lower short-term
interest rates, it buys Treasury securities held by banks, providing money that
the banks can use to make more loans to businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed wants to shrink the money supply and raise interest rates, it
sells Treasury securities to the banks in return for a portion of the banks'
cash reserves. The banks have less money available to make loans and interest
rates increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said that while the central bank now only buys and sells Treasury
securities to expand and shrink the money supply, it could easily shift to other
types of bonds such as those sold by state and local governments or even debt
sold by other nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "A decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately
retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this
option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy," Meyer said.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand Bids $3B for Rival Mirage  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT MACY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- MGM Grand Inc. is offering $3.5 billion in cash and stock
for rival Mirage Resorts Inc., setting up a possible battle between two titans
of the casino industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The entertainment, hotel and gaming company said today it made the offer of
$17 a share for Mirage stock in a letter to Steve Wynn, chief executive and
chairman of Mirage Resorts. The offer is more than 56 percent higher than
Mirage's closing share price of $10.87 1/2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal also includes MGM's assumption of about $2 billion in Mirage debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In early afternoon trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Mirage
shares jumped 30.5 percent, or $3.31 1/4 a share, to $14.18 3/4 a share while
MGM Grand shares were down 25 cents at $40.12 1/2 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   MGM Grand chairman J. Terrence Lanni said in the letter the combined company
"would be the undisputed leader in our industry by any measure."
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage said in a statement that the unsolicited offer would be considered by
the company's board of directors "in the near future."
</P>
<P>
	   MGM's major stockholder, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, bought 4.9 percent of
Mirage's stock in September, then sold it weeks later. The purchase at the time
was described as "for investment purposes only."
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn and Kerkorian have been described in the past as friends. The two have
played a major role in shaping Las Vegas as the world's gambling capital and the
fastest-growing city in America.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been rumors for several weeks that MGM Grand, buoyed by glowing
fourth-quarter and 1999 financial figures, was in a buying mood.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanni said in the letter that a combination would create an opportunity for
more revenue and lower costs that would boost the value of the combined
company's shares.
</P>
<P>
	   He added he hopes to complete the deal on a friendly basis, and said the
board of the combined company would consist of all the current members of both
boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage owns the 3,025-room Bellagio hotel-casino, the biggest earning hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   But it has struggled with its Beau Rivage resort that opened last March in
Mississippi, and its fourth quarter 1999 earnings disappointed some analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, MGM Grand's earnings have been rising and it cited strong casino
and hotel volumes at its 5,005-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas, earnings from the
acquisition of Primadonna Resorts Inc. and the successful opening of the MGM
Grand Detroit Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   It has also announced plans to develop a hotel and casino resort in Atlantic
City, N.J.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sopranos' Gandolfini in a Short Film  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "We had to go shoot a scene out on a boat yesterday," James
Gandolfini is saying. It's the final scene for this season's "The Sopranos," the
HBO hit in which he stars as New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we're all out on a boat, throwing up," he continues. "And it was
freezing and we had to pretend it was July. It was nice." He's very deadpan. "It
was crazy. It was nuts."
</P>
<P>
	   But he isn't here to talk about "The Sopranos." Gandolfini is starring in a
new film, a short film titled "A Whole New Day," which premieres Wednesday at
11:10 p.m. EST on Cinemax as the latest of that network's "Max Shorts"
presentations.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Greenwich Village restaurant Monday he has joined Katherine Narducci,
who plays his excitable wife, and William Garcia, the film's director-writer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jim and I talked about doing something together for a long time," says
Garcia, who, up to now, has concentrated on making documentaries. "I wrote this
for him."
</P>
<P>
	   "And what did he write?" Gandolfini hurrumphs, looking put out. "A drunken
lunatic!"
</P>
<P>
	   "Were you a little insulted?" asks Narducci, goading her co-star.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't ABOUT him," Garcia protests with a laugh. "It was FOR him."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was my fault," Gandolfini sighs. "I gave him Bukowski to read."
</P>
<P>
	   There is clearly a bit of the lowdown-booze-and-smokes ethos of writer
Charles Bukowski in "A Whole New Day." Also a bit of O. Henry: The film ends
with a sly twist when Vincent, the working-class slob waking up from his bender,
discovers he has made a big mistake (a funny mistake that shouldn't be leaked
here).
</P>
<P>
	   "Bukowski was definitely an inspiration," Garcia agrees. "But I realized
after the film was done that one of my uncles actually did what Vincent does,
when I was a kid."
</P>
<P>
	   "This guy I was living with in college did it," says Gandolfini, laughing.
"He was a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-minute film was shot in three days a year ago in a bare apartment in
Manhattan's Washington Heights section.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did a short, 'cause that's what I could get done," explains Garcia, who
sees the film as a stepping stone to features.
</P>
<P>
	   He financed it himself, from the family savings. "We were gonna get a car
and we put that off. God bless my wife!"
</P>
<P>
	   He also called in favors from his friends, especially Gandolfini, who, like
the other players (Ned Eisenberg, Delilah Cotto and baby Gabriel Garcia, as well
as "Sopranos" cast member Narducci), worked for nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the only acting project Gandolfini took on after "The Sopranos"
wrapped last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was exhausted," he says. "My wife was pregnant. I had to find us a new
place to live. And there was all of this other stuff," an oblique reference to
the stardom that blindsided him. "I felt like I was run over by a truck."
</P>
<P>
	   Gandolfini met Garcia a decade ago when they worked at a now-defunct bistro
on Manhattan's Union Square.
</P>
<P>
	   "I used to tend bar," Gandolfini says. "Billy used to talk."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great time, wasn't it?"
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a ball," says Gandolfini, "until the waitresses got together and
compared notes."
</P>
<P>
	   "You went out with all the waitresses?!" Narducci explodes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not all at once," Gandolfini replies with a naughty look. "But in a short
period of time."
</P>
<P>
	   "So you were always a ladies' man."
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah," Garcia jumps in. "I couldn't believe it! Now I think, 'OK, he's
famous.' But then I'm thinking, 'What do they SEE in him?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "They like sweaty fat guys," Gandolfini explains.
</P>
<P>
	   "You wanna hear something funny?" says Narducci, who then describes a recent
visit to a "Sopranos" chat room on the Internet, where the discussion turned to
Gandolfini's charms.
</P>
<P>
	   "One girl wrote, 'He's the man! You guys don't realize it, but we love
chubby bald guys.'
</P>
<P>
	   "Then someone else said, 'You know what, guys?' -- he's telling the rest of
the room -- 'We're all killing ourselves for nothing."'
</P>
<P>
	   Gandolfini laughs heartily at that. "Let yourself go!" he roars. "Forget
about the hair plugs!"
</P>
<P>
	   Even beyond this brand of chat-room adoration, Tony has been good to
Gandolfini. After all his roles in movies and on stage, it was playing Tony that
won him widespread acclaim and, he says, taught him needed technique.
</P>
<P>
	   "TV is a good training ground," he says. "You learn how to prepare quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   "For me before, there was a wall with an opening you gotta get through, and
I'd have to hit the wall 27 times. Then finally I'd go, 'Ohhhhh, OK.' Now, after
hitting just three or four times, I know where to go through."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if "The Sopranos" will be back for a third season, Gandolfini answers
"Yeah" with God-help-us-all foreboding.
</P>
<P>
	   And what will he be doing in the meantime?
</P>
<P>
	   "We're gonna make another movie," he jokes, meaning him and Garcia.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanna get in the festivals," adds his friend. "It will be more
avant-garde."
</P>
<P>
	   "Am I in this one?" Narducci asks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah," Gandolfini assures her. "YOU'RE gonna be the man. I'm gonna be the
woman."

<HEADLINE> Airbus Closer to New Jumbo Jets  </HEADLINE>
    By DEAN VISSER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- European aircraft maker Airbus Industrie will officially
launch a program in December aimed at building the world's largest passenger
jets and plans to deliver the first of them in the second half of 2005, the
company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "About half the demand for the A3XX will come from Asia," senior vice
president John Leahy said. "I am sure that we would not be launching it if there
were not key Asian airlines on board."
</P>
<P>
	   Leahy, speaking to reporters after a news conference at the Asian Aerospace
air show in Singapore, declined to name any specific airlines that had expressed
interest in the massive double-decker plane, designed to carry up to 600
passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company hopes to start making proposals to potential A3XX customers in
May, Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airbus on Wednesday also announced that it is working on a new plane in the
200-seat to 250-seat category, a size usually used for regional flights, to
replace its widely-used A300 and A310 models.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those products (the A300 and A310) are also a little old and are not
selling as much as they used to be sold in former years," Airbus president and
chief executive office Noel Forgeard said at the company's news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we are thinking of a new airplane, a 250-seater or less," Forgeard said,
adding that the new plane would be more cost-effective to fly, particularly in
terms of fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Airbus for the first time beat arch-rival Boeing in new commercial
jet orders last year, Forgeard said he expected Airbus' new orders to drop from
last year's 476 to about 300 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see some slowdown in orders this year," he said. "Our own predictions
for the year are somewhere around 300 new orders."
</P>
<P>
	   Airbus' 476 orders in 1999 compared with 391 for U.S. aircraft maker Boeing,
giving Airbus 55 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the drop in expected orders, Forgeard said he expected the company's
momentum to build, especially with its new products on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Airbus Industrie is a consortium formed of DaimlerChrysler AG's Dasa unit,
Aerospatiale Matra of France, Spain's Casa and Britain's British Aerospace
Systems.

<HEADLINE> Shoney's President Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Stephen C. Sanders, president and chief operating
officer of Shoney's Restaurants, resigned Wednesday to focus on his franchise
businesses and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
	   J. Michael Bodnar, president and CEO of Shoney's, Inc., will handle the
day-to-day operations while the company searches for Sanders' replacement,
spokeswoman Betty Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders, who was company president until leaving in 1993 to become a
Shoney's franchiser, returned in 1998 at the urging of Raymond Schoenbaum, the
son of the chain's founder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nashville-based company has gone through several reorganizations in the
past few years as Shoney's tried to recover from expanding and diversifying too
rapidly in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   The company once operated more than 1,800 stores under the names of
BarbWires, Lee's Famous Recipes, Pargo's, Fifth Quarter, Shoney's and Captain
D's.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers said the quality of the food and the service suffered, the company
became mired in debt. Stock that traded in recent years for more than $30 a
share was trading Wednesday for $1.12 1/2 a share, unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders is a franchisee of three Shoney's Restaurants in Tennessee,
Louisiana and Michigan, and two Copeland's of New Orleans Restaurants located in
Tennessee. He is also president of Sanders Management Services, Inc., a
restaurant consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Shoney's, Inc. owns, operates and franchises about 1,100 restaurants in 28
states including 525 Shoney's. The company also operates Captain D's Seafood
Restaurants and Fifth Quarter Restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Russian Issues New T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MOSCOW (AP) -- In a first, halting step toward reviving the country's
financial markets, the Russian government issued treasury bills on Wednesday,
the first since a spectacular default and market crash a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for the bills far exceeded the amount offered. But analysts said the
snapping up of T-bills largely reflected complex government regulations on how
investors use their money rather than real desire to own securities issued by a
country with one of the lowest credit ratings in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Domestic banks bought $76 million of the $86 million worth of three-month
T-bills offered Wednesday. In all, bids exceeded $241 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such T-bills, known by the Russian acronym GKO, were once a favorite of
high-flying investors in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors watched gleefully as yields climbed up to more than 200 percent at
one point. But the market crashed on Aug. 17, 1998, when the Finance Ministry
froze sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic failure of the GKO market came to emblemize the shortsighted,
fast-money policies of the first attempt at Russian economic recovery in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The new issue was possible despite a rock-bottom credit rating because
government restrictions have limited Russian investors' options, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the previous GKO market, Wednesday's limited issue was designed to
control inflation by removing rubles from the economy rather than plugging holes
in the budget, said Eric Kraus, chief strategist with Nikoil Capital Markets, a
Moscow-based brokerage.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no competing short-term market," he said. And the Russian market
"is awash in liquidity," because the Russian Central Bank is selling rubles to
buy hard currency to meet foreign debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors bought the three-month paper at 20.10 percent annual yield, which
is about the same as the expected inflation rate. A better investment would be
buying dollars and stashing them in a safe, Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
	   But currency restrictions implemented after the 1998 crash stifle dollar
purchases for banks. The T-bills at least prevent a loss to inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A second T-bill auction Wednesday targeted foreign investors who were
hammered in the crash and had funds frozen in ruble accounts. More than a
traditional bond, the issue of six-month paper was used as an instrument for
repatriating capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Finance Ministry offered a similar, specialized issue in December.

<HEADLINE> Dragonair Signs Deal With Airbus  </HEADLINE>
    By DEAN VISSER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Hong Kong-based Dragonair on Wednesday signed a contract
to acquire or lease up to 10 more planes from European consortium Airbus
Industrie over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
	   In the deal, Dragonair placed firm orders for five A320 aircraft and one
A330-300, plus options to buy two A330s, Airbus officials said at a news
conference at the Asian Aerospace 2000 exhibition in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Dragonair will also lease an A330-300 and an A321 aircraft under the
contract, Airbus said.
</P>
<P>
	   The planes will begin arriving in Hong Kong later this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The book value of the planes is likely between $612 million and $654
million, an aviation industry analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The new aircraft will nearly double Dragonair's all-Airbus fleet from its
present 13 planes to 24, Dragonair said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Dragonair will use the planes to add more international and intercontinental
flights, starting with a new flight to China's Hainan island in two months,
Dragonair officials said. The carrier flies to 25 Asia-Pacific destinations,
including 16 in mainland China.

	   A frenzy of speculative buying drove already-soaring palladium futures up
another 16 percent Tuesday to an all-time high on the Comex division of the New

	   In other markets, oil rose to nearly another nine-year high and natural gas

</P>
<P>
	   Palladium prices have been rocketing higher since November and doubled in

trading limits imposed Monday by the Tokyo Commodity Exchange sent buyers
scrambling to other markets to find the metal.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Merc, where trading resumed Tuesday after the Presidents Day
weekend, the result was a whopping increase of $115.55 an ounce, to $816.80,
after the March contract reached as high as $835. That's the largest one-day
gain ever for the metal.
</P>
<P>
	   The palladium market has become so wildly volatile and expensive that some
investors have taken to the sidelines, said analyst Dave Meger, who called the
price rise "insane."
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is trading on pure emotion right now," said Meger, senior metals
analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "The tightness of supply is
something to take note of. But I don't think it's responsible for these surreal
moves now."
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere on the New York Merc, concern over dwindling supplies sent crude
oil up again. The expiring March contract rose 11 cents to $29.62 a barrel,
benefiting from a late trading surge that sent it as high as $30.30 -- just
short of the nine-year high of $30.45 reached last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are worried that heading into a series of key meetings in the next
10 days, there's still no assurance that top world producers led by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will substantially raise
production once their agreement on lowered output expires March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of the meetings is Wednesday when oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, including OPEC countries, gather in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
	   But the most critical one is March 2 in London involving the oil ministers
of Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Those three are behind the 11-month-old
agreement that reduced world production by more than 4 million barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy analyst John Kilduff said that while everyone expects oil prices to
come back down to the low to mid $20s per barrel later this year, another spike
to as high as $34 or $35 is possible depending on what OPEC says and ultimately
does.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is real sensitive right now to the various statements coming out
of OPEC officials," said Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat USA Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a done deal that there will be an increase in production," he
said, noting that nations such as Kuwait still are holding out against an
increase in production, particularly a large one.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on the New York Merc, unseasonably mild weather nationwide sent March
natural gas futures plummeting 11.8 cents to $2.515 per million British thermal
units.
</P>
<P>
	   In other energy commodities, March heating oil fell .58 cent to 74.87 cents
a gallon and March unleaded gasoline rose 1.82 cent to 84.49 cents a gallon. In
London, April Brent crude from the North Sea rose 65 cents to $26.58 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa continued its long slide amid huge harvests coming out of West Africa
onto a glutted world market. May cocoa fell $20 to $795 a ton on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Malaria's Drug Resistance Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK CALLAHAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A mutation-prone gene in the malaria parasite apparently plays a key role in
the deadly organism's growing resistance to drugs, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings could help researchers design new drugs to combat the
mosquito-borne parasite, which kills more than a million people a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in
Melbourne and Australian National University in Canberra reported their findings
in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers studied Plasmodium falciparum, malaria's deadliest strain,
and found that the mutated gene prevents antimalarial drugs from accumulating
within the parasite.
</P>
<P>
	   Somehow, the mutations allow the parasite to either block drugs from
entering or quickly pump them out, said Alan F. Cowman, chief of the division of
infection and immunity at the Hall Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "The drugs only kill the parasite if they get concentrated inside it. Now
it's clear that these mutations prevent that accumulation from occurring,"
Cowman said.
</P>
<P>
	   He and colleagues reported that the mutated gene gives the parasites varying
resistance to five drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The faulty gene, known as pfmdr1, has long been suspected of giving the
parasite resistance to drugs. But studies conflicted over whether it truly plays
any role.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Cowman said his team has found direct proof that mutations in the gene
give the parasite resistance to the drugs quinine, mefloquinine and halofantrine
and also influence resistance to chloroquine and artemisinin.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowman said it is clear that another, as yet unknown gene plays a role in
giving malaria resistance to chloroquine and artemisinin.
</P>
<P>
	   His team came to its conclusions by genetically splicing the mutated gene
into malaria parasites not naturally resistant to drugs. The team then bred
those parasites and tested them against each drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Krogstad, chairman of tropical tropical medicine at Tulane University
in New Orleans, said the finding that the mutated gene influences resistance to
up to five drugs is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line for the public here is that if you get those mutations in
the parasite you're carrying, you've trashed three to four drugs at once, rather
than just one. That's very disturbing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaria is a major drain on the economies of developing nations,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The standard, inexpensive treatment for malaria had been chloroquine, but it
was among the first antimalarials the parasite became resistant to, said William
Rogers, director of preclinical research and development for the Naval Medical
Research Center's malaria program in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it began losing its effectiveness it pushed the cost of treatment up
five- or 10-fold. It's a major, major problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Committed to More WTO Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) -- The European Union is committed to a fresh round
of trade liberalization talks after the failure to reach agreement in Seattle
last November, External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are committed to getting another round going if we can," Patten told
reporters. But he stressed it would have to be an "all-inclusive round, not a
restrictive one."
</P>
<P>
	   The EU has clashed with developing countries over farm subsidies and labor
rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Patten added that the EU is keen to reach an agreement with China, saying
that the deal Beijing cut with the United States on lowering trade barriers
addresses 80 percent of the trade concerns the EU has with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans have specific concerns, notably the telecommunications sector
and certain tariffs.
</P>
<P>
	   EU-China trade talks in Beijing entered a third day on Wednesday, with no
sign of a breakthrough in sight. The talks were to continue Thursday, said Laura
Greebe, a European Union spokeswoman in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as we're concerned, speed (of the talks) is not the problem; it is
substance," Patten said.
</P>
<P>
	   China has been seeking membership in the WTO and its predecessor for 14
years, but needs the agreement of all 135 WTO members before it can join.

</P>
<P>
	   Other sectors didn't fare as well, with auto shares suffering the most
heavily.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Change Food Stamp Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recognizing that many of the working poor live far from
where the jobs are, the White House plans to make it easier for families getting
food stamps to own a decent car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I you want more people to work, you've got to help them get to work,''
Clinton said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he will scrap an eligibility rule that counted the value of all
but the oldest, and thus least reliable, cars against a family's assets. Too
many assets, and a family can't get food stamps, the national coupon program to
subsidize grocery bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Under existing rules, food stamp recipients cannot own a car valued at more
than $4,650. Clinton will replace that dollar limit with an equation that will
enable families with little equity in their cars to qualify for food stamps, no
matter the total value of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   To figure a car's equity, the government will subtract outstanding loans
from the car's fair market value. If the equity value is less than $1,000, the
car would be irrelevant toward determining food stamp eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House estimates the change will help 150,000 people own a car over
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of all new jobs are now created in suburbs, but three-quarters of
welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities where public transit
systems are often sketchy or nonexistent. The White House estimates that even in
metropolitan areas with extensive transit systems, fewer than half the
entry-level jobs are accessible by transit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't take Einstein to figure out that transportation is critical to
matching the available work force with the available jobs,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House cites a recent Urban Institute study that shows twice as
many welfare recipients with cars were working than those without cars.
</P>
<P>
	   The food stamp program, which benefits 19 million people, is expected to
cost $21.2 billion in 2001, up $1.4 billion from this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The food stamp rule change, which does not require approval from Congress,
goes along with a proposal in Clinton's 2001 budget that the White House
estimates would benefit 245,000 people over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   If Congress agrees, each state could set a different automobile limit for
food stamps and key the amount to what they now permit in their respective
welfare programs, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states place no limit on the value of a welfare recipient's car. In
many states, the limit ranges from $7,000 to $9,000. The change would cost
taxpayers an estimated $132 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also wants congressional approval for two spending proposals
intended to help the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   He wants to double, to $150 million, a grant program that finances local
transportation priorities keyed to low-income working people, such as extensions
in the operating hours of public transit systems, commuter van programs or
ride-share operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the Department of Transportation will also set aside $5
million for Indian tribes and designate another $5 million for applicants from
the Mississippi Delta region.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also highlighted a $25 million initiative in his budget to
allow low-income families to use a federally subsidized savings program to save
for a car that will help them get or keep a job. Currently, ``individual
development accounts'' provide incentives through federal matching funds to save
for a first home, post-secondary education or to start a business, but not to
buy a car.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Hears HMO Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices seemed unwilling Wednesday to
allow people to sue health maintenance organizations that offer doctors
financial bonuses to control treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Any HMO involves ``incentives to keep costs down in order to provide the
care and make it pay for itself,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told the lawyer
for an Illinois woman who blames her ruptured appendix on inadequate care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the scheme that Congress has authorized,'' O'Connor said. ``Why
should the courts get involved in this messy business'' of deciding whether some
financial bonuses go too far.

Congress passed a 1974 law governing employee benefits, it ``wanted to gut its
own HMO legislation,'' passed a year earlier, by allowing lawsuits over HMOs'
financial incentive rules.
</P>
<P>
	   James P. Ginzkey, the lawyer for Cynthia Herdrich of Bloomington, Ill.,
contends the 1974 federal law lets Herdrich pursue a claim that her HMO violated
its legal duty by depriving her of proper medical care and keeping the cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
	   Ginzkey said he was not asking the court to outlaw all physician incentives.
But lawsuits should be allowed, he said, when such financial bonuses reach ``the
level of undue influence so that it affects patient care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carter G. Phillips, the lawyer for the organization sued by Ginzkey's
client, argued that the Carle Clinic Association was a ``plain vanilla'' type of
HMO and that allowing a lawsuit against it would make all such organizations
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is no exaggeration to suggest that the future of medical care in its
delivery and its regulations are implicated'' by the case, Phillips said. ``If
Carle's setup violates (federal law) then all managed care does as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips added that patients have ``perfectly valid remedies'' in state
court and that an expansion of the right to sue under federal law would undercut
those remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich collected $35,000 in damages under state medical malpractice law.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court ruled that she also could sue under the federal law
governing employee benefits, known as the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act. The law requires employee-benefit plan managers to act solely in
beneficiaries' best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawsuit contends that when doctors have a financial incentive to hold
down care costs, they become plan managers and can be accused of failing to act
in patients' best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Carle Clinic argues that it cannot be sued under the federal law because its
doctors do not act as plan managers.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected by July in the case, which stakes out one of many
fronts in the war over managed care. Other lawsuits against HMOs accuse them of
violating a racketeering law by concealing financial incentives provided to
doctors to hold down treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some states have decided to let patients sue HMOs, and Congress is
considering patients' rights legislation that could set new standards for
managed care and might allow patients to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   Herdrich's lawsuit said her appendix ruptured in 1992 because her doctor at
Carle Clinic delayed diagnostic tests for eight days so the tests could be
performed at a facility owned by the HMO. Her appendix ruptured and she
contracted peritonitis, requiring emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court dismissed her claim that Carle Clinic violated its
duty to act in beneficiaries' interests. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the issue could go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ERISA provides limited remedies for those who sue successfully. They
generally can collect the cost of the benefits that should have been provided,
but cannot collect damages for pain and suffering. Herdrich's lawsuit seeks to
recover bonuses paid to doctors and have them placed in the health plan's
financial pool for patient treatment.

<HEADLINE> Schwarz undegoes snarling cross; defense rests.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Under a snarling, sarcastic cross-examination, former
police officer Charles Schwarz denied repeatedly Wednesday that he took part in
a precinct house assault on Abner Louima or conspired with other cops to conceal
his role.
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, his voice dripping with scorn,
pummeled Schwarz with questions about a flurry of phone calls and a meeting of
police officers in the days and weeks after the Aug. 9, 1997, incident.
</P>
<P>
	   When the questioning of Schwarz ended, defense attorneys rested their case.
Closing arguments were expected to begin on Thursday, with the case going to the
jury next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Wiese, 34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, are
accused of plotting to conceal Schwarz's role of pinning down the Haitian
immigrant as rogue cop Justin Volpe sodomized him with a broom handle.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe is serving 30 years after pleading guilty to violating Louima's civil
rights. Schwarz faces a possible life sentence after conviction on the same
charge, and up to five years if convicted of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Argumentative one minute, solicitous the next, Schwarz said he could not
recall many details of calls and conversations from years ago, but never
discussed his own part in the brutal assault because he insisted that he was not
there.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad also reviewed the arrest of Louima during a street disturbance in
which he was erroneously alleged to have punched Volpe and Schwarz. It was that
punch that supposedly prompted Volpe to later assault Louima.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Vinegrad asked Schwarz if he considered it a "serious crime"
for a prisoner to strike a police officer. "Well, the Brooklyn district
attorney's office never seems to think so," Schwarz retorted, triggering an
angry response from the federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz contended it was relatively rare for police officers to cover up
each other's misdeeds - often called the "blue wall of silence."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying it doesn't exist ... but my feeling is that if there's real
criminal misconduct, most cops will not like something like that," he said. "If
you mean is it rampant, I'd say no."
</P>
<P>
	   "And no one has ever done that for you?" asked Vinegrad.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, sir," Schwarz replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, in a dramatic conclusion to his direct testimony, Schwarz repeated
his assertion that he was never in the bathroom, and said he would not expect
other cops to lie to protect him, particularly Wiese, his patrol partner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would never do something like that - to ask a man with two children to
put himself in harm's way for me," Schwarz replied to a question from his
lawyer, Ronald Fischetti.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz said earlier that at the time the assault occurred, he was outside
the 70th precinct conducting a routine post-arrest search of his patrol car for
items possibly concealed by a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad hammered at Schwarz over the phone calls, some of them lasting
hours, which the government has held up as evidence that the three officers
plotted feverishly to concoct a cover story for Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz insisted that while they discussed press coverage and speculated on
where the investigation might be heading, they were not trying to conjure up an
alibi for him.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he did "not recall discussing that" during a precinct house
meeting involving the officers and a police union trustee.
</P>
<P>
	   The trustee, Michael Immitt, testified earlier that Schwarz had told him
that Volpe walked Louima to the lavatory alone. Schwarz said he did not recall
saying that to Immitt.
</P>
<P>
	   Replying to Fischetti's questions, Schwarz said he was "concerned" about
what happened to Louima because he had been the arresting officer and later
searched the prisoner at the 70th precinct desk.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Tonight's Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who sealed his
place in rock history a generation ago with an electrifying performance at
Woodstock, headed into the Grammy Awards on Wednesday night with a leading 10
nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark festival, he is
enjoying a musical resurrection thanks to his album "Supernatural," on which he
collaborated with such younger singers as Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill
and Dave Matthews. The multi-platinum album included "Smooth," Santana's first
No. 1 single.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, was looking to join
Eric Clapton and Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by
voters and then made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and
Raitt got three in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, was looking to win
her first Grammy. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with the
hit single "Believe" and was nominated for record of the year and best dance
recording.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Britney Spears had three of the year's four
best-selling albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana and the Backstreet Boys were in competition for record, album and
song of the year, in addition to pop performance by a duo or group. Santana's
competition for pop collaboration with vocals included 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
	   The new-artist category pitted teen divas Spears and Christina Aguilera
against such lesser-selling singers as Macy Gray, Kid Rock and Susan Tedeschi.

<HEADLINE> Americans Seize Weapons in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. paratroopers swooped down on the
Serb part of a divided Kosovo city at dawn Wednesday, arresting eight people and
seizing weapons in a surprise raid only three days after Serbs drove them away
in a hail of stones.
</P>
<P>
	   As a further sign of NATO resolve to maintain control, peacekeepers
announced plans to start moving ethnic Albanians back to their homes in the
Serb-controlled part of Kosovska Mitrovica north of the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers also said demonstrations would be banned in a wide area
encompassing both Serb and ethnic Albanian-dominated neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   But Serb leaders objected to the resettlement plan. One of them, Oliver
Ivanovic, warned that the crisis in Kosovo's most multiethnic city would ``peak
within 10 to 15 days'' unless the NATO-led Kosovo Force abandons its plan.
</P>
<P>
	   As French troops surrounded the search area, about 300 troops of the U.S.
504th Airborne Infantry -- backed by armored vehicles and in full battle gear --
crossed the Ibar River at dawn and swept through ``Little Bosnia,'' an
ethnically mixed neighborhood, searching house-to-house for weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   A NATO spokesman, Flight Lt. Neville Clayton, said the Americans seized a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher, rifles, grenades and ammunition. Maj. Erik
Gunhus, an American spokesman, said eight people were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time the Americans had been on the river's north side since
they and German forces were driven away Sunday by stone-throwing Serbs during a
weapons search. On Monday they were forced to break off a search due to the
violent demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to send a message that KFOR can operate and move freely north
of the Ibar and anywhere in Kosovo they want to go,'' Gunhus said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans later left the city and returned to their base at Camp
Bondsteel in southeastern Kosovo. The U.S. soldiers were among troops from more
than a dozen countries sent to reinforce the French last weekend, when tensions
escalated.
</P>
<P>
	   French troops continued the search after the Americans left, smashing doors
of apartments and garages that would not open. A French soldier, who refused to
give his name, told residents they would be compensated for damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans announced Wednesday by the peacekeeping command involve moving
ethnic Albanians back to homes in three high-rise apartment buildings on the
north bank. U.N. officials said ethnic Albanians would begin registering Friday
and would have to show proof they owned apartments in the buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations hopes to start relocating them next week. Troops also
plan to build a footbridge across the Ibar River in front of the three apartment
houses to provide secure access.
</P>
<P>
	   The KFOR command agreed to establish a security zone, in which
demonstrations will be banned, in an area encompassing the heart of both sides
of the city. The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, called on
his fellow Albanians to avoid demonstrations on the south bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to move ethnic Albanians back, however, enraged Serb leaders,
who said they were not consulted. One leader, Nikola Kabasic, claimed Albanian
snipers had fired on French peacekeepers last weekend from buildings to which
ethnic Albanians will be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Serbs were excluded this time, although we believe we could have given
some suggestions for calming down the situation,'' Kabasic said. Ivanovic
accused the ethnic Albanians of ``building up tensions to the maximum so they
would use the situation to provoke bloodshed in the northern part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ivanovic insisted that no Yugoslav security forces had infiltrated the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Serbs in Mitrovica, he said, ``are ordinary, disappointed people who
have nowhere to go, and 7,000 temporarily displaced people are waiting to see
what will be their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, they are determined to stay here and fight with all means,
first peaceful and then any other,'' Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions have been rising here since a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2
killed two elderly Serbs south of the city. That triggered revenge attacks that
have left nine people dead and scores injured.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Today's Court Actions  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court took these actions Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --The justices seemed unwilling to let people sue health maintenance
organizations that offer doctors financial bonuses to control treatment costs,
during oral arguments in a case filed by an Illinois woman who blames her
ruptured appendix on inadequate care. HMOs involve financial incentives, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor said, adding, ``Why should the courts get involved in this
messy business'' of deciding whether bonuses go too far.
</P>
<P>
	   --Outlawed Hawaii's practice of letting only people of Hawaiian blood vote
for leaders of a program that benefits descendants of the island's original
residents. Voting 7-2, the justices said the voting restriction is a form of
unlawful racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   --Stiffened the deadline for suing under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act. The court said the time limit begins to run before
someone discovers that a defendant's racketeering activity caused harm. The
unanimous ruling killed the case of a Texas man who says profit-greedy doctors
illegally held him in a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allowed people to file lawsuits accusing the government of violating the
Constitution's equal-protection guarantee, even if they do not belong to any
specially protected group. The unanimous, unsigned decision is a victory for a
Willowbrook, Ill., woman who sued the city in a dispute over hooking up her home
to the municipal water system.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruled 6-3 in a California murder case that criminal defense lawyers are
not always required to file appeals after their clients plead guilty unless the
clients specifically ask them to. A defense lawyer's failure to file an appeal
did not necessarily violate her client's constitutional right to adequate legal
help, the justices said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON(AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton still have $4.3 million in legal
debts and their legal defense fund is trying to collect enough donations that it
can close down by the time the president leaves office next January, fund
trustees said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The trust's executive director, Anthony Essaye, told a news conference that
contributors over the last six years have donated nearly $6 million to cover the

	   ``We will continue to ask Americans to contribute to the trust in the hopes
that the president and first lady can leave the White House ... largely free of
the remaining ...debt.'' Essaye said.
</P>

investigations of their activities, as well as in the sexual harassment suit
against President Clinton by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.

<HEADLINE> Senate Looks At Education Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Undeterred by two presidential vetoes, the Senate again
took up legislation that would expand tax-free savings accounts for elementary
and secondary school education, including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a bill whose time I think has come,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday of the legislation that would allow parents to
place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in education savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which would also make savings in prepaid tuition plans tax free
and expand tax breaks for employer-provided educational assistance, is a
mainstay of the Republican agenda for improving K-12 education.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's opposed by teachers unions, and President Clinton vetoed a similar
bill in 1998. He said the benefits mainly go to richer families and that the
plan would drain money away from the public school system. Last year, education
savings accounts were part of the Republican's $792 billion tax cut plan that
the president vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to keep bringing this up, keep bringing it to the public
attention, keep sending it to the president,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
chief sponsor along with Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Senate's Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said the
bill faced the same fate again this year because ``it was bad education policy
before, it is bad education policy now.'' He said Democrats who oppose it would
not use stalling tactics or other parliamentary roadblocks because ``it's not a
bill that's ever going to become law, so we'd rather spend time working on other
pieces of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear when the Senate would finish work on the bill or when the
House would take up its version.
</P>
<P>
	   But Torricelli said it was the president who laid the foundation for
education savings accounts when he pushed the current program that allows
parents to contribute up to $500 a year with tax-deductible earnings available
for college expenses such as tuition and books.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coverdell-Torricelli bill, costing some $7.7 billion over 10 years,
would increase the contribution level to $2,000 and allow the tax-free earnings
to be used for expenses, including transportation and tutors, associated with
any school -- public, private or parochial -- from kindergarten through the 12th
grade. The education IRAs would expire at the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The backers argued that it would lead to an education spending infusion of
$12 billion and that the main beneficiaries would be middle-class families with
children in public schools. ``This can't be a bad idea simply because it is a
Republican idea,'' said Torricelli, who predicted that 10 of the 45 Senate
Democrats would vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, in the budget he submitted to Congress, proposed, at a cost
of $39 billion over 10 years, extending the tax credit for higher education and
for public school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill number is S. 1134.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Judges Consider Moving Trials  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Judges at the U.N. tribunals on Rwanda and
the former Yugoslavia are considering moving parts of their trials to the two
countries in order to bring justice closer to those affected by it.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea, floated by Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, is aimed at
overcoming the widespread doubts in those countries about the court's
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prosecutor is very interested in having these tribunals be as
accessible and as open to the people as possible,'' the prosecutor's spokesman,
Paul Risley, told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav tribunal here was set up by the Security Council in 1993 to
prosecute commanders and perpetrators of the Balkan massacres. A year later, the
Rwanda tribunal was established in Arusha, Tanzania, to try the architects of
the 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunals were set up outside the affected countries for security
reasons and to strengthen the impression of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
	   But since their mission is not only to punish the guilty but also to
facilitate reconciliation by singling out those most responsible, the judges are
sensitive to questions about their objectivity.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Serbs, Croats and Muslims believe the tribunal in The Hague favors
their enemies while some claim it also whitewashes the responses of the United
States and Europe to the carnage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda, which has held its own trials of genocide suspects, temporarily
suspended cooperation with the tribunal after a decision to free a top suspect
on a technicality. On Tuesday, Del Ponte urged an appeals panel in Arusha to
overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released in Arusha on Wednesday, Del Ponte said that during
meetings with Rwandan officials she had ``discussed the possibility of holding
trial hearings in Rwanda, a possibility which she ... felt was desirable.''
</P>
<P>
	   She added that ``the necessary legal basis'' for such hearings exists in the
tribunal's statute.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Swiss prosecutor's proposal involves moving the trials closer to
the scenes of the alleged crimes to hear witness' testimony and for other public
sessions. Verdicts would still be delivered at the tribunals' headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Key stumbling blocks remain, however, including security and the high cost
of moving the judges, prosecutors, lawyers, clerks and interpreters, Risley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, plans for judges to take a walking tour of a massacre scene
in the Bosnian village of Ahmici were canceled because of the danger of
unexploded mines.

	   Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
emphatically cautioned lawmakers today against spending projected
federal budget surpluses that he said may not occur. He told the
Senate Banking Committee that -- in his opinion -- irrevocable or
almost irrevocable programs established now would be a risky thing.
''...All I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a
while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the
federal government accounts is.'' Greenspan also indicated, as he
did last week, that financial markets should expect further
interest rate increases if the economy continues to grow as fast as
it is now.

	   Nasdaq Up 126.69; Dow Down 10.55
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today as a technology rally
pulled big industrial stocks out from under earlier losses. But not
all the way out: Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 10.55 at 10,294.29 after being down nearly 85
points earlier in the session. The technology-focused Nasdaq

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made another
appeal to lawmakers Wednesday to hold off committing projected government
surpluses to new programs, at least until better predictions are available.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until we
have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal government accounts
is," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the nation's central bank was answering questions in an
appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual
report to Congress. He gave similar testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that Fed policy-makers are taking a cautious approach to the
nation's unprecedented economic boom -- remarks that have put financial markets
on notice that another interest rate increase is likely soon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the stock market showed little initial reaction to Greenspan,
compared to a sharp 250-point dropoff Friday, following his House testimony. The
Dow Jones average of industrial stocks was down about 10 points late Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed chairman said he expects the economy to remain strong and noted that
Americans at all income levels are benefitting from the current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   "The distribution of income, which had been increasingly skewed to the upper
incomes through most of the 1980s and 1990s stopped in the middle of the decade
and everybody has been growing by the same amount," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, inflation is still largely absent. "I can't find it no matter
where I look, with the possible exception of oil prices," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he cautioned that tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending
spree present potential price pressures too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fed policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, "then we are like
the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming
into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have
turned at least partially in order to come into ... a soft landing," Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many private economists believe the Fed will opt for at least two more
quarter-point interest rate increases at the central bank's next meetings in
March and May.
</P>
<P>
	   Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent in four quarter-point
moves, the last one occurring Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   For lawmakers, Greenspan said the lingering uncertainties of the economy
should prompt wariness about making new commitments for future government
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put
in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this
surplus," said Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   The reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that have overstuffed government
coffers in recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet, Greenspan
said. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the
national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I've argued
that we should allow the surpluses run and ... reduce the debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses to offer
goodies to voters are too great in this election year, the Fed chairman said, he
would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's final budget projects that the $3.7 trillion publicly
held portion of the $5.7 trillion national debt could be eliminated by 2013,
making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since 1835,
when Andrew Jackson was president.	   Clinton has also proposed extensive new
government programs, however, including an expansion of Medicare to include
prescription drug coverage. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for large tax
cuts.

<HEADLINE> An underground fire disrupts phone services in upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fire in an old subway tunnel Wednesday damaged
a section of fiber-optic cable and disrupted long-distance, Internet and
cellular telephone services for thousands of Frontier Corp. customers in upstate
New York.
<P>
	   The fire, apparently started by vagrants, knocked out long-distance service
for most Frontier customers in and around Rochester, Frontier's hometown, but
local telephone and 911 calls that rely on copper wiring were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   The outages began around 1 a.m. and repairs were completed a little over 12
hours later on Wednesday afternoon, said company spokesman Tor Constantino.
</P>
<P>
	   Vagrants trying to keep warm were suspected of starting a wood fire that
burned out of control in a disused subway line near the Genesee River,
Constantino said. The intense heat melted the tube-encased fiber-optic line, and
about 150 feet of it had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire cut off outgoing, long-distance Frontier calls from the Rochester
region for "a majority of residential and business customers," Constantino said,
adding that he was unable to estimate how many thousands of customers lost
service.
</P>
<P>
	   An unspecified number of Internet users also lost their connection - and
Frontier's reach as an Internet provider extends the breadth of upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the outage disrupted cell phone service as far away as
Binghamton by knocking out incoming and outgoing calls for people served by Bell
Atlantic Mobile.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier, a century-old telephone carrier with a nationwide long-distance
network, was bought out last year by Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based
telecommunications upstart. Founded in 1899, it changed its name from Rochester
Telephone in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier sprouted beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly in Rochester -
a metro region of nearly 1 million people - by buying more than a half-dozen
long-distance carriers in the 1990s and becoming one of the nation's top 10
long-distance providers.

<HEADLINE> Investors May Pick Trading Markets  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day may be coming when in addition to telling your
broker what stocks you want to buy, you also choose the market in which you
believe you can get the best price on a trade, a top securities regulator said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Change has been sweeping the markets, as millions of new investors and
increasing competition from new electronic communications networks have put
pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and
the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   If the traditional exchanges and the networks, known as ECNs, were linked
nationwide, with a central electronic "order book" showing all stock quotes,
individual investors could choose a specific market for a trade, said Annette
Nazareth, director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "It may lead to that," Nazareth told reporters in a telephone conference
call. "Customers will start to require" their brokers to make trades in a
specific market.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that some brokers already have started to offer such choices to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nazareth was discussing a "concept release" which the SEC put out for 60
days of public comment, presenting several possible options for changing how
stocks are traded and quoted. The option likely to arouse the most controversy
is that of a central, nationwide system displaying orders to buy and sell.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the U.S. markets fail to meet investor needs by offering the fairest and
most efficient trading mechanisms possible, an increasingly competitive
international environment will be sure to offer alternatives for investors," the
SEC said in a press release announcing its request for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC would have to approve any linking of the stock exchanges and the
ECNs, some of which have asked the regulators to put them on the same legal
footing as the traditional exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said it has not determined at this time that it needs to take action
to respond to the sprouting of competing markets. The agency issued the concept
release because it wants "all views to be heard," Nazareth said.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned in a November speech that the nation's
stock markets will lose their competitive edge to overseas markets if investors
lose confidence in the ability to get their trades completed at the best prices,
commonly known as best execution.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stakes have never been greater for America's markets," Levitt told
securities industry executives. "We simply cannot afford to let our competitive
edge be dulled."
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, he criticized the practice of payment for order flow, in which
brokerage firms are paid to route their trades through a particular market.
Levitt said the practice raises conflict-of-interest questions if the brokerage
firms are routing trades to make a profit rather than to get their customers the
best execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Zuckerberg, chairman of the Securities Industry Association and advisory
director at brokerage firm Goldman Sachs Group, has rebuffed suggestions that
Wall Street has dragged its feet in responding to the competitive challenges
brought by new technology and ways of trading.
</P>
<P>
	   SIA spokesman Jim Spellman said Wednesday the group welcomed the SEC's
"effort to address these enormously complex market-structure issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with the competition from ECNs, the New York Stock Exchange and the
electronic Nasdaq market are considering selling stock to the public to raise
money and give themselves greater operating flexibility, a move that would
transform them into for-profit businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also reshaping the markets are extended trading hours and an anticipated
switch this year to decimalization -- quoting stocks in dollars and cents,
rather than the 200-year-old tradition of fractions.

<HEADLINE> NATO: Serbia Orchestrating Violence  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY ULBRICH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Intelligence reports have reinforced NATO's belief
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government is behind the rising
violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO also says it has detected radio contacts between police units in Serbia
and Serbs in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   In Southern Serbia, meanwhile, ethnic Albanian guerrillas are believed to
have conducted small-scale infiltration of the Presevo Valley, an ethnic
Albanian enclave where Serbian special police are said to have begun an
aggressive crackdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav army, for its part, has begun new training, and NATO
intelligence has observed a great deal of military movement in the Kosovo border
area. For the moment, the activity appears to be routine training, NATO
officials say, but they suggest it doesn't take much to transform training into
something more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks, as well as these
other reports in and around the province, prompted the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for Friday to discuss Kosovo,
the southern province of Serbia from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO
bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO and the United States have accused Milosevic's government of being
behind the nearly three weeks of violence in Kosovska Mitrovica, which has the
largest remaining Serb enclave in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a senior Yugoslav commander, Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, called
the allegation ``nonsense'' aimed at diverting attention from NATO's failure to
bring peace to the province.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 19-nation defense alliance expects Milosevic to begin stirring up
trouble in Kosovo, a NATO official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said NATO intelligence is keeping track of the disposition of
the various forces, cross-border movements and insuring that new weapons don't
replace the guns being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned the unrest could expand to areas outside Kosovo, Macedonia has put
part of its armed forces stationed near the joint Kosovo-Serbia border on a
higher alert because of violence and tension in Kosovo, army spokesman Gjorgji
Trendafilov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The soldiers and officer of this part of the army have intensified their
guard and monitoring,'' Trendafilov said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, and NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson have made it clear they believe the Yugoslav
leader is behind the current tensions in Kosovo. Both pledge to get tough on any
party, Serb or ethnic Albanian, that attempts to stir unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Presevo Valley, just east of the Kosovo border and home to as many as
80,000 ethnic Albanians, Belgrade is believed to have moved in more than 200
additional paramilitary police. The police allegedly have begun house-to-house
searches, mine-laying and beatings.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the ethnic Albanians' rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has
been officially disbanded, NATO says small military units continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidency of the European Union, meanwhile, issued a statement
Wednesday urging political leaders in Kosovo to exert their influence to stop
the violence and ``to play a restraining role in order to avoid the spread of
disorder.''

<HEADLINE> Summers: Trade Tax Breaks Continuing  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will not abandon an estimated $2.2
billion in annual tax breaks intended to help U.S. companies compete overseas,
despite a challenge from the European Union, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the program will continue even if a World Trade Organization
panel rules that it is an illegal subsidy. A decision was expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to
maintain the important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in
the past. I'm sure we'll find a way to do that,'' Summers said in an AP
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. options for the program include a negotiated settlement with the EU and
a possible legislative fix through Congress, Summers added.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law would be tricky, costly and time-consuming. Also, opponents
might seize the opportunity in an election year to attack the program as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' key lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the 15-nation EU. It permits U.S. companies to
avoid certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax
havens.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break are awaiting nervously the WTO
decision. They fear it could lead to another trade war with the Europeans or
require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software makers such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lemy, said recently that the expanded
program was ``granting an unfair advantage to U.S. products'' in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the EU would retaliate through higher tariffs if
the United States does not make fundamental changes, and some European companies
benefit from the tax breaks through their U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the program could become a bargaining chip in other U.S.-EU
trade disputes over bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace products. Some
observers also believe the dispute could provide an opening for all of these
issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all want to avoid a continuing round of trade disputes,'' Elkins said.
``We are hopeful that the Europeans will realize it.''

<HEADLINE> Not Saving Any Money? You Could Be  </HEADLINE>
    By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With all the talk in the media about Internet stocks,
mutual funds and 401(k) plans, it sounds like everyone is saving. So how could
the nation's savings rate fall to its lowest level ever during 1999?
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a lot of people who need to overcome barriers -- the barrier of 'I
can't afford to save,"' said Donald Blandin, president of the Washington-based
American Savings Education Council, a non-profit group.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported recently that the nation's savings rate
fell to an all-time low of 2.4 percent last year. The savings rate is a
percentage of disposable personal income, or the amount of money left after
taxes are paid, so at a rate of 2.4 percent, a person with $50,000 in disposable
personal income would be saving $1,200 a year, or $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   But 2.4 percent is an average. It means that while some people pour money
into savings, others save nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   For many people, there's a reason (sometimes an excuse) why they're not
saving, or aren't saving enough, for retirement or other needs. While some feel
they just don't have money to set aside each month, others may be trying to cope
with credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Blandin said the problem is that many people "have enough money to save and
have the misconception that they have to have a lot of money to save or invest."
He noted, "there are very few people we find who can't squeeze out $20 a week"
for savings.
</P>
<P>
	   If a person saved $50 a month for 20 years and earned 8 percent a year over
the entire period, he or she would end up with $29,451.02, according to the
savings council. While $12,000 is the money the saver put aside, the other
$17.451.02 is earned through compounding.
</P>
<P>
	   Blandin noted that some mutual funds require as little as $100 to open an
account, with $25 required to be invested monthly. A small amount, but it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
	   This is a good time of year to think about saving. If you're getting a tax
refund, try to put some of it into a bank account or certificate of deposit, or
an investment such as stocks or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Saving is most commonly associated with retirement, or children's education,
but it's also important to set money aside for the proverbial rainy day. Without
a savings cushion, people need to borrow money if they're disabled or suffer a
financial disaster such as damage to their home from floods or a fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when consumers are juggling credit card and other debt, "I would advise
them to try to put most of their money toward the debt but save a nominal amount
in a savings account for emergency," said April Lewis, director of education at
the not-for-profit Consolidated Credit Counseling Services Inc., based in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   If you have debt and aren't saving because you're barely making enough to
cover expenses, consolidate what you owe, Lewis said. If necessary, go to a
credit counseling service, which probably will be able to negotiate a lower
interest rate with your creditors, enabling you to pay down your debts in a few
years and to start saving.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe you're not saving because you're covered by a pension plan at work and
you expect to get Social Security when you retire. The problem here is you might
have a false sense of security -- are you really sure the money you'll earn from
these sources will be enough to live on, or to maintain the kind of lifestyle
you want?
</P>
<P>
	   The savings council has what it calls a Ballpark Estimate worksheet on its
Web site (www.asec.org) that helps consumers calculate what they need to set
aside for retirement. Other retirement calculators on the Internet can be found
through search engines such as Lycos or Metacrawler.
</P>
<P>
	   Blandin, the savings council president, said people planning for retirement
should think in terms of replacing 70 percent their pre-retirement income --
more if they expect to do a lot of traveling or take part in other costly
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Many younger people say they expect to continue working at least part-time
when retirement age arrives, and so they may not save much now. That could limit
their options later on.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're young and healthy and feel good about yourself, you might have
a lot of ideas about how you'll spend your retirement. As you get closer, you
might find yourself feeling like 'I'm tired, I don't want to work till I'm 85,"'
said Noel Mays, a spokesman for the Certified Financial Planner Board of
Standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The board and the Labor Department put together a booklet, "Savings
Fitness," which has advice and ideas about savings, including tips for people
who hope to retire soon but don't have enough money saved. (The booklet is
available on the Internet at wsw.dol.gov/dol/pwba or by calling 800 998-7542.)
</P>
<P>
	   Among the tips: Try to put away at least 20 percent of your income, cut your
expenses and consider selling some assets. If you can, go into a tax-sheltered
retirement plan. And do it now.

<HEADLINE> Domingo Announces Political Operas  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Placido Domingo, singing star and musical director of the
Washington Opera, said Wednesday that four of the eight operas in its next
season will have political themes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2000-2001 season opens Oct. 19, less than three weeks before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
	   But the operas will be about international politics, not the American
presidential race. The closest they come to the problems of today is Gian Carlo
Menotti's "The Consul," which premiered in 1950. It tells of a resistance hero
frustrated in his attempt to escape the firing squad because of the difficulty
of getting a visa to leave his country.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was considered a realistic slice of post World War II times," Domingo
said. "It seems more pertinent today than ever, considering the fate of so many
unfortunate people in eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
	   The political themes in season will go back to Giuseppe Verdi's "Don Carlo,"
which deals with the struggle of the Netherlands for freedom from the tyranny of
Spain more than 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other operas come from plays that Domingo said deeply influenced the
French Revolution. They are Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" and Mozart's "The
Marriage of Figaro." Both plays were written by Pierre Beaumarchais, who
influenced the French king to support the American Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
	   Both plays appeared in Paris while the war was on. Beaumarchais collected
volunteers, money, supplies and a fleet to carry them to Washington's army.
</P>
<P>
	   Domingo is not directing or singing in any of the political operas, but he
will take the title role in Richard Wagner's "Parsifal," which the Washington
Opera is performing for the first time this season, its 45th.
</P>
<P>
	   The season will open with the rarely-produced "Don Quixote" of Jules
Massenet. It also will include Verdi's "Il Trovatore" and Giacomo Puccini's
"Turandot."

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Seeks International Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Mozambique appealed Wednesday for international
aid after a cyclone and two weeks of torrential rains left much of the country
under water and in danger of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid workers flying over some of the worst-hit areas on Wednesday saw huge
swaths of low-lying areas submerged, with just the tips of trees poking out of
the muddy water. Much of southern Gaza and central Inhambane provinces was
accessible only by air.
</P>
<P>
	   The toll inflicted on this impoverished southeast African country by two
weeks of rains and Cyclone Eline, which churned through the country Tuesday
before dissipating into a tropical storm, was staggering.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao, launching the aid appeal to diplomats here,
said more than 70,000 acres of crops had been destroyed and an estimated 300,000
people lost their homes. About 30,000 cattle drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization warned that more than 800,000 people were at
risk from epidemics -- particularly cholera and malaria -- as a result of the
floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of roads and bridges were washed out, hindering delivery of emergency
supplies. On Wednesday, yet another bridge -- one linking the capital Maputo to
the town of Xai-Xai in neighboring Gaza province -- collapsed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main problem is the logistics of getting out to the people,'' said
Inyene Udoyen, a spokesman for the World Food Program. ``We have enough food for
months, because we have a long-term development project we can draw from.''
</P>
<P>
	   Simao put the preliminary death toll from the two weeks of flooding and the
cyclone at 70, up from Tuesday's count of 67.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said $65 million dollars in aid was needed. The United
Nations on Wednesday issued an appeal for $13.63 million to be used by eight
agencies covering food, shelter, health, water and sanitation, education,
communication and coordination, said the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   South African and French air force planes resumed aid flights Wednesday,
mainly to the southern Gaza province.
</P>
<P>
	   The heightened risk of malaria was evident at a food aid depot north of
Maputo where thousands of mosquitos -- which carry the disease and thrive in
stagnant water -- coated the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the displaced have been in makeshift shelters for days. Some were
housed in a disused railway shed with a roof over their heads but no walls to
keep out the wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Maputo resident Elisa Tembe said she had been sleeping when the flood waters
came two weeks ago, tearing away parts of her brick house.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It swept away the beds. There is nothing there. I took my three children,
but did not even take any clothes,'' she said. ``I am just waiting for the
government or someone to do something.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of newly homeless also took shelter in a former cashew nut factory
in Maputo. On Wednesday afternoon they complained that they had not eaten since
midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eline had lost much of its power by the time it reached neighboring
Zimbabwe, but it swelled rivers that swept away a bridge on a main highway and
damaged at least five other bridges, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bridge over the Changazi River collapsed, closing the highway between
the eastern Zimbabwe city of Mutare and the southern provincial center of
Masvingo.
</P>
<P>
	   Uprooted trees blocked streets and highways around Mutare. A woman and her
dog died in the city when struck by a power cable blown down by high winds,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the southern district of Beitbridge, about 22,000 people were being moved
from collapsed mud-and-pole huts on low ground to temporary tented camps,
provincial administrator Angelous Dube said.

<HEADLINE> Government Investigates Fannie Mae  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development is
examining whether Fannie Mae, the nation's largest housing finance company, is
obeying laws that outlaw bias in the granting of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that Fannie Mae is
``cooperating fully'' in the review, which he said is needed to show whether
mortgage applications of whites and minorities are being treated equally.
</P>
<P>
	   Department officials are wading through thousands of pages of documents on
lending practices. The data under review includes information about Fannie Mae's
underwriting systems and computerized records of the nearly 10 million mortgage
loans it has purchased over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference with Cuomo, Fannie Mae chairman and chief executive
officer Franklin D. Raines said the company has nothing to fear from the results
of the review.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HUD and Fannie Mae have the same goals: ensuring fair lending, fighting
discrimination and expanding home ownership opportunities in America,'' Raines
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A study prepared for HUD last year by the Urban Institute concluded that
access to mortgage capital is unequal in the United States and that ``minorities
are less likely than whites to obtain mortgage financing.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A mortgage is the key that unlocks the door to homeownership and a secure
financial future, and too many minorities are being told they can't get the
key,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Buy Newbridge Networks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel is buying
Canada's Newbridge Networks Corp for $6.4 billion in stock in a bold move to
beef up its presence in the key U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian telecoms group will broaden Alcatel's product range as it seeks
to compete with telecommunciations rivals like Cisco Systems Inc., Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Wednesday, Alcatel said it offered 0.81 of its U.S. foreign
shares for each Newbridge share. It said the board of directors of both groups
had approved the deal, which it expected to be completed by the end of the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Takeover rumors had been rife for some time and had pushed Newbridge's
shares 36 percent higher over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Newbridge shares fell $1.93 3/4 to $32.43 3/4 in late trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Alcatel fared even worse, dropping $4.50 to $43.25
and pushing the deal's value down from $7.1 billion when it was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel has been on a buying spree in the United States, which accounts for
one fifth of the group's sales, since it bought telecommunications equipment
maker DSC in 1998. Newbridge is its most expensive acquisition to date.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the deal is confirmed, Newbridge will merge with the French group's
Carrier Data Division, more than doubling that division's annual revenues to
$2.5 billion, Alcatel said. The new entity will be based in Kanata near Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   "For our shareholders, this agreement has the double attraction of
significantly increasing both growth and profits and hence the value of the
company," said Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk.
</P>
<P>
	   Newbridge produces so-called wide-area networks, switches and wireless
products for Internet service providers, phone companies, cable TV and corporate
clients in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   It specializes in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches, which have been
overtaken in recent years by IP -- Internet protocol -- technology. Still, ATM
is widely considered a more reliable service.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel has so far invested in Internet protocol rather than ATM to provide
data carrying services.
</P>
<P>
	   "For years people have thought that this company was likely to be acquired,"
said analyst Duncan Stewart, head of the Navigator Canadian Technology Fund at
Tera Capital Corp. in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   "ATM will have applications, but you don't want to be a stand-alone company
unless you're in a really, really hot (technology)," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel said cost savings should total $150 million next year, reaching $230
million a year by 2002. It said the tie-up should lift operating income this
year by $160 million.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand sets its sights on Mirage Resorts, betting billions on a  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - MGM Grand Inc., buoyed by record earnings, has made an
unsolicited offer to buy Mirage Resorts Inc. for $3.5 billion in cash and stock,
setting up a potential battle between two casino titans.
<P>
	   The offer was 56 percent higher than the market value of Mirage and also
included the assumption of $2 billion in debt, a deal so rich that it could
discourage any other bidders, analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage issued a brief statement Wednesday, saying only that the "unsolicited
proposal" would be considered by the company's board of directors "in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal involves two of the world's largest casino companies and two of the
industry's most powerful figures - Mirage Chairman Steve Wynn and billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian, the majority stockholder in MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men, who helped shape Las Vegas as the gambling capital of the
world, have a relationship that is considered very cordial. While Wynn has
sought a high profile, Kerkorian has chosen to remain in the background while
amassing a fortune in hotel-casinos, MGM film studios and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Casino analysts aren't certain how the drama between the gambling giants
will play out, but they say it's unlikely other suitors will surface.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see anybody else coming up right now," said Jason Ader of Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co. "Harrah's and Park Place have their plates full."
</P>
<P>
	   "There aren't many gaming companies that could do this," said Joe
Coccimiglio of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Park Place will do anything since they just acquired Caesars.
It's a stretch for Harrah's and Mandalay Resorts is too leveraged," Coccimiglio
said, referring to other major casino companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Coccimiglio said egos could play a key role in whether the deal succeeds.
</P>
<P>
	   "People know Wynn is not likely to say yes," Coccimiglio said. "We're
talking about a control issue, which company gets to call the shots. I don't
know if you can get the egos in line. Who gets to run the show? That's always
the sticking point. Wynn has been doing it for 27 years."
</P>
<P>
	   J. Terrence Lanni, MGM chairman, said in a letter to Wynn, "It is our
intention that this powerful combination be accomplished on a friendly basis."
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter offered to acquire the stock at $17 a share, either all cash or
$7 cash and MGM Grand stock valued at $10 per share. The offer would cover 200
million outstanding shares plus stock options, with a total value estimated by
analysts at $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage stock peaked at $26 a share in the spring of 1999, but has declined
in recent months. Wednesday's offer was more than 56 percent higher than
Mirage's closing share price of $10.87 1/2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian bought 4.9 percent of Mirage's stock in September, then sold it
weeks later. The purchase was described as "for investment purposes only."
</P>
<P>
	   When Mirage prices dropped in recent weeks, "people wondered if it showed up
on Kirk's radar screen," Ader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lanni said the deal would create an opportunity for more revenue and lower
costs that would boost the value of the combined company's shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Strategically this is a very good fit," said Coccimiglio. "You have two
companies who are dominant in the high roller business and battle each other for
that business. They could join forces, cut back on their offices in the Far
East, and the degree of rebates could be reduced to those customers."
</P>
<P>
	   "At the end of the day it's a very powerful deal," said Ader. "The two
companies have over 50 percent of the market share in Far East high roller
business."
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it quite clear that this is a friendly offer," James Murren,
president of MGM Grand, Inc. said Wednesday. "We invite the entire (Mirage)
board to be a part of the board of the combined company."
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage owns the 3,025-room Bellagio hotel-casino, the biggest-earning hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   But it has struggled with its $650 million Beau Rivage resort that opened
last March in Biloxi, Miss., and its fourth quarter 1999 earnings disappointed
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, MGM Grand's earnings have been rising and it cited strong casino
and hotel volumes at its 5,005-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas, earnings from the
acquisition of Primadonna Resorts Inc. and the successful opening of the MGM
Grand Detroit Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   MGM has also announced plans to develop a hotel and casino resort in
Atlantic City, N.J., where Mirage is under way with similar plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn has been credited with the current boom in Las Vegas, which dates back
to his opening of the company's flagship Mirage hotel-casino in 1989. The
company also owns the Bellagio, Golden Nugget and Treasure Island hotel-casinos
in Las Vegas, half interest in the Monte Carlo resort here, and the Golden
Nugget in Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian has been a major player in Las Vegas for more than a quarter of a
century. He has built the world's largest hotel here three times. He built the
International, now the Las Vegas Hilton, and later built the old MGM Grand, now
Bally's-Las Vegas. In 1993 he opened the new MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Poor Not Getting Painkillers  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. drug control experts on Wednesday decried the
near absence of morphine in the developing world, saying the poor have just as
much of a right as the rich to get relief from intolerable pain.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal use of morphine and other painkillers is guaranteed by international
drug conventions. Yet painkillers are almost never used in the developing world,
particularly in Africa, the International Narcotics Control Board said in its
annual report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cost is not an issue. Morphine has been around for hundreds of years and
it's not expensive,'' board member Herbert S. Okun told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather, a host of other ``smoking guns'' are to blame, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes, governments fail to focus attention on providing painkillers,
often because they are overwhelmed with fighting other basic medical problems,
such as malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, some governments and doctors are overly restrictive in
distributing morphine because they fear it can be diverted to illegal markets,
Okun said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sad reality is that people all over the world are suffering from the
lack of adequate supply of drugs, particularly morphine and the opiates for
cancer-related pain and other kinds of pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the next 15 years, two-thirds of the estimated 15 million new cancer
cases a year are expected to occur in the developing world, U.N. statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
	   While opium-based drugs, including morphine, have proven effective in easing
pain in cancer patients, most of the world's morphine supply is consumed in
wealthy countries. Denmark alone has an annual consumption rate of 74.4 grams
per 1,000 people, while Madagascar's rate is .0001 grams per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The board urged governments to lift restrictions on legal morphine use, and
called for drug companies and nonprofit organizations to make morphine readily
available for prescription use in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
	   The board is a 13-member, quasi-judicial organization that oversees the
implementation of U.N. drug treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   In its annual report, the board also warned governments that they risked
violating international law by allowing drug injection rooms, where heroin
addicts can get clean needles and a safe place to shoot up.
</P>
<P>
	   So-called ``shooting galleries'' have sprouted up in the Netherlands, Spain,
Germany and Switzerland as an experimental way to get drug users off the street
and to decrease transmission of infectious diseases, such as HIV, which can be
spread by shared needles.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board said such drug injection rooms ``facilitated'' drug
trafficking and represented the first step toward legalizing narcotics
altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss Federal Health Office said the Swiss rooms were legal, and that
the country ``will continue to pursue its policy, which has been praised from
many sides,'' spokesman Georg Amstutz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Jose Cabrera, director of the Madrid regional government's drug abuse
program, said he was not worried about the Spanish program's legality.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the Madrid regional government offers is an aid center with a doctor,
a social worker and nurse, where the main goal is to provide health care for
drug addicts who have never had such assistance,'' Cabrera told La Vanguardia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   But Okun said the failure of injection rooms to offer any treatment for the
addiction -- which is the case in Germany -- was the real problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an illicit substance. So the rooms also serve unfortunately to aid
and abet the abusers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Britain's top official for Northern Ireland, in talks
with Clinton administration officials on rescuing the peace process for the
province, implored the parties to the conflict on Wednesday to act like
statesmen and stop engaging in ``tribal politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No more heads in the sand, no more walking away, no more laying down the
law, no more sulking,'' Mandelson told a news conference at the British Embassy
before a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From now on, the test of everyone's commitment will not be how powerfully
they articulate their own tribal politics, but how constructively they seek to
accommodate others' fears and needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Northern Ireland fell back into crisis earlier this month
after the Irish Republican Army refused to initiate a disarmament process. This
prompted Britain to withdraw powers from the province's power-sharing Cabinet
that had been formed only in December.
</P>
<P>
	   There is a sharp contrast in the mood between Mandelson's current visit to
Washington and his previous visit last fall, a time of heady expectations about
the peace process. He warned of the dangers of allowing the situation to
languish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the lessons of the past is that if we do not keep moving forward,
we run the risk of stalling completely,'' he said. ``In the coming weeks, I will
bend every sinew in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton had invested considerable effort in the peace process,
including the period leading up to the April 1998 ``Good Friday Accords,''
perhaps the most significant agreement in the 30 years since violence in the
province began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
	   For a time, Northern Ireland appeared ripe for inclusion as a rare,
unambiguous foreign policy victory for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin saw the setback earlier this month as
part of the normal ups and downs that are inevitable in a situation as complex
as the one in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are extraordinarily difficult things to do,'' Rubin said. ``They
don't succeed overnight, they succeed over time, and they only succeed through
persistence. And we will adopt the same persistence in the coming days as we
have in the past, based on the circumstances and our best judgment as to how we
can be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he did not expect former Sen. George Mitchell, who has played
a key role in past negotiating breakthroughs, to undertake a review process
similar to the one he carried out last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he understands the reservations of the Irish Republican Army about
disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA does not want to be seen to act under duress,'' he said, adding
that he believes that decommissioning is about ``good faith and good will. Not
about surrender.''
</P>
<P>
	   While disarming is difficult for the IRA, it is an issue of extreme
importance for Unionists, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unionists need to know the war is over, and will not believe that is truly
over until they hear it and see real signs that the IRA no longer wishes to use
its arms and intends to put them permanently beyond use,'' Mandelson added.

<HEADLINE> Official: Iran Will Be More Liberal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's foreign policy will become more liberal following
last week's defeat of hard-liners in parliamentary elections, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The positive actions of other countries will receive positive reaction
from the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' he was quoted as saying by state
television.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kharrazi said Iran's relations with the United States will still depend
on Washington's taking ``practical steps'' -- a position his government has
stated before.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington earlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said it
``is a matter of who takes what step.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they are willing to engage in this dialogue, I think that would be a
positive step. We'll have to see,'' Lockhart said, commenting on Friday's
parliamentary elections that reformists appeared to dominate.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the successful candidates are many who advocate better ties with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But Washington's agenda for the talks may not go down well in Tehran. The
United States says it wants to discuss Iran's alleged program to produce weapons
of mass destruction, its alleged support of terrorism and its opposition to the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharrazi hinted the United States was not taking positive steps to improve
the atmosphere for talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is preventing the transport of central Asian oil by a
planned pipeline running through Iranian territory and prohibits the import of
Iranian goods, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union said Wednesday it was interested in closer ties with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The European Union recalls its interest in consolidating the broad
dialogue it has maintained with Iran and reiterates its will to promote closer
ties with the Iranian government,'' said a statement released in Lisbon, which
currently holds the six-month rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-nation Union also hailed the Iranian people for the ``massive''
electoral turnout -- 83 percent of 38.7 million registered voters -- saying it
was a sign of ``engagement in the democratic process.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Adjourns Ocalan Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court on Wednesday opened and quickly
adjourned a second trial against Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who
already is on death row for treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Ihsan Akcin adjourned the trial in the case against Ocalan, his
estranged wife, Kesire, and 99 other members of his organization until April 24.
All of the accused face the death penalty for separatism.
</P>
<P>
	   Akcin said the court must learn the whereabouts of 82 of the other
defendants before the trial can continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan was sentenced to death in June. His lawyers fear that the new charges
could increase pressure in Turkey to hang the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan's first trial was based on charges related to the armed insurgency of
his rebel Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which peaked in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The current charges relate to events prior to the 1980 military coup in
Turkey. Before the coup, PKK guerrillas were working to recruit members and
funding in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan did not appear before the court in Ankara on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors, meanwhile, interrogated three pro-Kurdish mayors, a move that
threatened to strain relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the three mayors, who won landslide victories in April's
elections, had ties with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Parliament President Nicole Fontaine called on Turkey to release the
mayors, all from the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, or HADEP. The mayors
were seized shortly after meetings with European officials in which they
discussed Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The arrest of these elected representatives is unacceptable,'' Fontaine
said in a statement. ``These arrests seriously damage Turkey's image.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit signaled that Turkey would not bow to
European pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (EU countries) have a plan to put us under harsher pressure than
before,'' Ecevit told Cumhuriyet newspaper. ``We won't be part of this game.''
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey was named as a candidate to join the European Union in December, but
EU members stressed that Turkey must improve its human rights record and enact
more democratic laws before it is granted full membership.
</P>
<P>
	   EU countries also have said Turkey cannot be accepted if Ocalan is hanged.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament must approve any death sentence in Turkey. The government has
postponed debate on Ocalan's execution until the European Court of Human Rights
reviews his appeal. Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his capture by Turkish commandos early last year, Ocalan has called on
his fighters to lay down their weapons and pursue a peaceful campaign for
Kurdish rights. Earlier this month, the PKK announced an end to its armed
rebellion.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Deal in Peril  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's escalation of threats against Taiwan could
jeopardize Beijing's battle for market-opening trade agreements, members of
Congress cautioned Wednesday. Lawmakers from both parties said a U.S-China
accord is also being hurt by Vice President Al Gore's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the Senate Finance
Committee that the Clinton administration remains united behind winning approval
of a China trade deal this year, despite new belligerence by China and a
controversy over statements by Gore to labor leaders. But committee members told
her the damage may have already been done.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second day, administration officials and congressional leaders
condemned China for threatening to use force if Taiwan stalls on reunification
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What China did this week was very counterproductive,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``They need to take great care in their
public pronouncements if they truly want to become part of the world
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any suggestion that this situation can be resolved through the use of
force, that is something that our policy opposes,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   China's statements, contained in a 11,000-word policy paper, comes at a
difficult time for the administration's effort to win approval for granting
China permanent trade benefits. The vote, expected in late spring or early
summer, would ease the way for China's long-sought entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers stressed that the administration continued to believe it was
``enormously in our commercial interests'' for China to win permanent normal
trade relations with the United States as well as gaining WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very hopeful that the national interests will prevail and we will see
China's admission to the WTO this year,'' Summers said. ``I am glad to see Gov.
(George W.) Bush and others supporting that proposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration can no longer take Senate approval for granted, Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., told Barshefsky. It has always been
assumed that the bill had wide support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reckless threat to use force against Taiwan and the recurring human
rights violations will necessarily affect the Senate's consideration of the
agreement,'' said Roth.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's senior
Democrat, also suggested the bill was being undercut by Gore's courtship of
labor in his presidential campaign. Labor has made defeat of the China trade
bill a top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're going to lose this,'' Moynihan warned Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the administration has no intention of losing this,'' Barshefsky
replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore complicated the issue last week by sitting down privately with labor
leaders in New Orleans at the AFL-CIO's annual winter meeting. Some of those
attending said Gore left the impression he could write stronger environmental
and workers-rights protections if the China trade were renegotiated in a Gore
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign and the White House insisted he meant future agreements,
and Gore wrote to business leaders to pledge his continued support for the
administration's position.
</P>
<P>
	   But Roth and Moynihan said that the mixed signals persist -- and will make
it harder to win over undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky and the committee disagreed on Gore but not on Beijing's conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We insist on a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. And, certainly,
sabre-rattling is not remotely productive in that direction,'' Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhao
Xing and indicated U.S. concern over ``the substance, the timing, and the tone''
of China's pronouncements on Taiwan, said State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said Li told Talbott at their meeting
that the U.S. comments constituted interference in China's internal affairs --
and were inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig told reporters he doubts China
would take the risk of attacking Taiwan. ``I don't think there is a realistic
likelihood that the PRC would do something as extraordinary as invade Taiwan,''
he said. ``I think the costs would be way too high for them.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blocks Suspects' Assets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department took steps Wednesday to block two
alleged Colombian drug kingpins from accessing their U.S. assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury added Ivan and Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales to its list of
specially designated narcotics traffickers. The action not only blocks the men's
access to any assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction but also bars U.S. companies
from doing business with them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two drug kingpins ... have risen to prominence with the decline of the
Cali cartel and are responsible for huge volumes of drugs that have entered the
United States,'' Treasury said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Treasury said it added to the list nine people and 20
businesses that it has determined ``are acting as fronts for the North Valle and
Cali drug cartels.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton in 1995 authorized certain government agencies to apply
economic sanctions against Colombian drug cartels. The action taken Wednesday
boosts the total number of businesses and individuals whose assets have been
blocked under that order to 527.

<HEADLINE> Weather Sinks Grains, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wet weather in the Midwest and prospects for more
sent grain and soybean prices sharply lower Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat and soybean prices both tumbled 3 percent as the rain
boosted crop outlooks but dragged futures prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. winter wheat belt, which has been drier than average
all year, is poised to see moisture levels climb significantly
based on storm systems that are expected to advance across the
region.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans fell to their lowest price in over a month after new
forecasts called for rain in the Midwest during the next seven to
10 days, heaping more pressure on an already bearish market. The
plunge sent the spot contract for soybeans just below the
$5-a-bushel benchmark.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices dived somewhat less steeply on both the wet, mild
Midwestern weather, which brightens the crop outlook as spring
planting approaches, and more Chinese corn sales to South Korea,
which left U.S. farmers shut out again.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; March
corn fell 4 cents to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1 cent to
$1.07 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 13 1/4 cents to $4.99 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures retreated sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle rose .48 cent to 70.35 cents a pound; March
feeder cattle rose .30 cent to 82.60 cents a pound; April lean hogs
fell 1.45 cent to 56.20 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 2.40
cents to 88 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Jury begin deliberations in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After receiving lengthy instructions Wednesday,
jurors began deliberating the fate of four white police officers charged with
murder in the shooting of Amadou Diallo on his Bronx doorstep.
<P>
	   As expected, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi gave the jury the option to
convict on such less serious charges as manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also stressed the officers could be acquitted if jurors believe
their claim that they fired 41 bullets at the unarmed black victim because they
were convinced he had a gun and wanted to shoot them. Diallo was reaching for a
wallet in his pocket when shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of any crime," said Teresi.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge spent more than three hours carefully going over the legal
instructions for each of 24 criminal counts before deliberations began at about
1:20 p.m. The jury quickly sent out a note asking for supplies including a
yardstick, easels, masking tape and pens. It later asked for a readback of
testimony from officers Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon, and from a civilian
eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Teresi replaced one juror - a woman - for talking about the case
outside of court and replaced her with a male alternate. The jury is now
comprised of four black women, one white woman and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, free on
$100,000 bail each, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. If convicted
of that charge, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the lesser charges being considered were second-degree manslaughter
and criminally negligent homicide. They have a minimum penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were members of a roving unit of plainclothes officers that
has been accused of stopping and frisking young black men without cause.
Diallo's slaying sparked so much pretrial publicity and protesting that an
appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, small protests have erupted outside the courthouse, but civil
rights leaders have appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, during closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Warner stopped short
of accusing the officers of racism. But he repeated claims they accosted Diallo
in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning
or justification before unleashing 41 bullets. The 22-year-old West African
immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor accused the defendants of jumping to false conclusions and of
failing to back off despite signs Diallo was a "decent man" who lived on a
quiet, working-class street.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner cited Carroll's testimony that he wanted to stop Diallo on a "hunch"
that he might be a wanted rapist or robber. Carroll and McMellon both fired 16
shots. Boss shot five times and Murphy four while backing up their partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting "wasn't a mistake," said Warner, holding the wallet up for the
jury. "It was a terrible series of conscious decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims Diallo sealed his own fate by ignoring the officers
repeated orders to halt and pulling a black object in a threatening manner.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi told jurors they could find that the officers were justified in
responding with deadly force if they "reasonably believed" that they needed to
defend themselves against a threat, or that they were arresting an armed bandit.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should figuratively put yourselves in the shoes of each defendant and
consider how the situation appeared to him," the judge said. "You should
consider what Amadou Diallo did before or during the encounter."
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also reminded jurors that the law allows police officers to stop and
question someone if wrongdoing is suspected.

<HEADLINE> Senate Ponders Fetus Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would make harming a fetus during a violent
act a federal crime is a ``flawed federal response'' to assaults against women,
the Clinton administration told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Republicans continued to push the measure as ``only just,'' abortion
rights supporters viewed it as an election-year stalking horse for abortion
opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We owe this country a serious response, not debate on ideological
proposals that ignore effective programs designed to help women crime victims,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, denied any intent to
make the legislation a litmus test in the fight over abortion, but acknowledged
that it was a hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only opposition that I can suppose is that some in the pro-choice
movement believe that our bill draws attention to the effort to dehumanize,
desensitize and depersonalize the unborn child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleanor D. Acheson, an assistant attorney general, said the Justice
Department would recommend President Clinton veto the legislation if it reaches
his desk. She said its ``identification of a fetus as a separate and distinct
victim of crime is unprecedented as a matter of federal statute.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``is in our view, a flawed federal response to the evils of such
violence'' and ``may be perceived as gratuitously plunging the federal
government into one of the most difficult and complex issues of religious and
scientific consideration,'' Acheson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she said, the administration favors alternative legislation that
would strengthen punishment for ``intentional violence against women whom the
perpetrator knows or should know is pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee said, ``Everyone
knows in these crimes there are two victims.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sonja Inge, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said
the bill's effect would be ``legally separating a woman from her fetus, which is
like the beginning step of eroding her right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, passed by the House last September, would make it a
separate offense to injure or kill a fetus in the commission of a crime of
violence against a pregnant woman. It would not apply to abortions performed
with the mother's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-four states already have laws that recognize the unborn as potential
victims. Supporters said federal laws should also allow prosecutors to bring
non-capital murder charges in cases of violence where a fetus dies, even if the
mother survives.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Eds: The bill numbers are S.1673 and H.R.2436.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Ministers Hint at Oil Boost  </HEADLINE>
   By ABDULLAH AL-SHIHRI
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Gulf Arab states are leaning toward a slight
increase in oil production, officials said Wednesday after a meeting of Gulf oil
ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the ministers called for a stable market but gave little
away on what position they would adopt at next month's meeting of the 11-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ministers stressed their countries' desire to maintain the market's
stability in the coming period in cooperation with other producing nations,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``OPEC wants to ensure stability in the market,'' Saudi Oil Minister Ali
Naimi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The skyrocketing price of oil, which has nearly tripled over the past year,
has led to spikes in heating oil and gas prices in the United States and
prompted calls for the government to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. U.S. officials have also been lobbying OPEC and non-OPEC countries to
increase oil production to alleviate the high energy costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gulf officials said Wednesday the ministers favored an increase in
production of between 2 million and 2.5 million barrels a day to reach a price
of between $20 and $25 a barrel. Oil for delivery in April was trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at $29.39 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say how such an
increase should be apportioned among OPEC and non-OPEC member states.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Saudi Arabia, which towers over its fellow Gulf states as the
world's largest oil exporter, say their government favors prices of $20 to $25 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saudis are scheduled to meet March 2 with Mexico and Venezuela to
discuss whether to increase production. Whatever decision they reach is expected
to influence the OPEC meeting on March 27 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone has agreed on how to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuwait is believed to oppose any increase in production and Iran, the
second-largest producer in OPEC, has come out against a rise in output.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Wednesday's meeting, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obeid bin Saif
Al-Nasseri said a price in the $20-$25 range would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
	   He said any decision taken on the timing or volume of a possible increase in
output by OPEC should be subject to a study of demand, prices and oil stocks at
the time.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is touring the Middle East, said
in Cairo Wednesday he would be talking to oil officials in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait about increasing production to ease prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to see oil prices go down,'' Richardson told reporters. ``I am
going to Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia. These are two nations that are very good
friends to the U.S. I look forward to a constructive dialogue with these two
countries. It's going to be a friendly, positive discussion. I'm not going there
to pressure anybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson refused to say what price he wanted for oil, saying the market
should dictate that.
</P>
<P>
	   A Saudi official concurred.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prices are subject to supply and demand, and our aim is to have stability
in the market,'' the Saudi official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson's trip was prompted by U.S. consumer concern over soaring fuel
prices. The United States is the world's biggest oil importer.
</P>
<P>
	   The participants at Wednesday's meeting were members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
	   At a GCC meeting last year, OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates and non-OPEC members Oman and Bahrain agreed to cut
production in order to raise prices. Oil was then at its lowest prices in
decades, hovering near $10-$11 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, some OPEC and non-OPEC members such as Mexico have
called for the organization to increase production beyond the current 22.976
million barrels a day set by the agreement, which expires March 31.

<P>
    WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A transsexual lawmaker from New Zealand said
she felt belittled during an interview with talk show host Roseanne and asked
that it not be aired.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgina Beyer, who began life as George, said Wednesday that Roseanne did
not stick to the agreed-upon questions in their Jan. 29 interview. Beyer would
not detail the offending questions but described them as "tacky."
</P>
<P>
	   She refused to sign a consent form allowing her interview to be aired, and
she wrote to the producers, requesting that the interview be taken out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand that as the first transsexual (lawmaker) there will be a lot
of media interest and I am happy to talk about my journey, but I felt
belittled," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Roseanne" spokeswoman Stacey Davis said the show complied with the
lawmaker's request and edited it out of an episode that has yet to air.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Birthday Bashes Canceled  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will turn 70 without
fanfare after two planned birthday celebrations were canceled Wednesday amid his
party's growing scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   After Kohl asked state party officials to cancel a planned celebration in
his hometown on the Rhine, federal party headquarters also said a Berlin gala
planned for thousands of guests was off. Kohl's birthday is April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the scandal erupted in December after Kohl admitted accepting up to $1
million in off-the-books donations, the statesman who presided over German
unification and led the country for 16 years has been increasingly reclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, he skipped the 100th anniversary gala of the German soccer
federation. He also has yet to take his seat in parliament since it reconvened
last week, and has been absent from party meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rhineland-Palatinate state Christian Democrats said they had been asked
to cancel the party planned in Kohl's hometown of Ludwigshafen because he told
them ``this event should not take place in the current situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bonn prosecutors had searched the state party's offices Tuesday, looking for
evidence against Kohl in their pursuit of possible breach of trust charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands had been expected to attend the Berlin celebration on the
fashionable Gendarmenmarkt square in a hall that had been reserved long before
the scandal came to light. Party spokeswoman Eva Christiansen said the event was
canceled ``by mutual agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl also was a no-show at a ceremony in January to receive a $15,000 prize
for promoting European unity. His spokesman said participating in the event
would have been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   On Kohl's 60th birthday celebration in Bonn, held while he was still in
power, 3,000 people turned out -- including many foreign heads of state.
</P>
<P>
	   But since he celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin
Wall in November to the cheers of thousands, Kohl's popularity has plunged. The
scandal has grown to include revelations about secret accounts, false
bookkeeping and allegations of influence peddling. In interviews, Kohl has
repeatedly maintained he did nothing wrong and was only working to serve the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament has launched its own inquiry into the scandal, examining whether
payoffs influenced decisions by Kohl's government -- including the privatization
of the Leuna oil refinery in former East Germany, which was bought by France's
Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Missing files from the chancellery have fueled speculation that the
Christian Democrats received kickbacks for the deal.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: workers, women and children should benefit more from boom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bill Bradley told university students Wednesday that
America cannot sustain its booming economy unless it fortifies a basic pillar of
its success: working families.
<P>
	   "Despite our success, far too many Americans are on the outside looking in,"
the Democratic presidential candidate said in a speech at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing such statistics as the 13.5 million children living in poverty, the
44 million citizens without health insurance and the income gap between men and
women, he said: "Workers and families are at the top of my economic agenda."
</P>
<P>
	   The nation now has a powerful tool - fiscal surplus - that could be used to
set a new economic agenda, said Bradley, who is battling Vice President Al Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley urged America to take the lead in opening markets around the world,
a position he acknowledged could mean fewer jobs in the United States. He
proposed direct financial assistance for those forced to work for lower pay.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called Earnings Insurance Program would reimburse half the lost wages
for three years, up to a maximum of $10,000 per year. Bradley estimates the
program would cost no more than $200 million a year, once a new trade agreement
takes effect.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to wise public policies and entrepreneurial efforts, the
candidate said, the "pillars" of the economy are its workers and future workers
- children.
</P>
<P>
	   For them, Bradley proposed a $100 million pilot program to teach children
below the poverty level how to use computers in this information-driven age.
Each family would get a $400 "Infostamp," and the computer industry would be
challenged to create a package of hardware, software and Internet access for
that price.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not have true prosperity until all our citizens share in the
prosperity of our economic growth," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking under a mammoth American flag, he faced a friendly audience of
mostly students who greeted him with warm applause and a standing ovation. Then
he laid out his economic vision as president.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time in a half century, he said, the country's economy has
broken free of the post-Depression and World War II economic legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   But he accused Gore of offering an economic policy that would harm the
country rather than prolong its prosperity. He said the vice president would
pursue national debt reduction even if the economy were slow, the kind of
management Bradley believes once contributed to the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   The former U.S. senator from New Jersey praised America's "spectacular"
economic performance under the Clinton administration and said the pro-growth
policies should remain in place.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the base of economic revival must be broadened. Prosperity is
inclusive, not exclusive," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech, sponsored by the Columbia University Economic Society, marked
Bradley's third straight day on the New York campaign trail as the March 7
"Super Tuesday" primaries - including the New York vote - draw near.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, the former New York Knicks star debated Gore at the Apollo
Theatre; on Tuesday he campaigned on Long Island. The primary in New York is
considered key to his presidential bid.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Search, Terror in Jamaica  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. MARGARET'S BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Deserted streets. Residents cowering
behind locked doors. Others hiding in the hills.
</P>
<P>
	   That has been the scene since a large cache of Colombian cocaine
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   The drama began last Wednesday when a group of men made off with a
``substantial'' amount of cocaine that was to be loaded onto a propeller
airplane at Ken Jones Aerodrome, said Detective Inspector Canute Hamilton of the
police narcotics unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The clandestine flight was bound for the United States, officials say.
Details are murky. Hamilton said there was a lot of cocaine -- it's just not
clear how much.
</P>
<P>
	   Canute Wilson, a laborer in the fishing village of St. Margaret's Bay, said
he saw the heist taking place, when police drove into the small airfield
mid-afternoon as the men were preparing to load the cocaine onto the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane took off, and the men on the ground grabbed what they could and
made for the hills, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (police) look like a bunch of ... fools chasing men into the bush.
They didn't get one of them,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police will not discuss what happened at the airport, and have not made
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   The single-strip airport about five miles outside the northeast resort town
of Port Antonio is supposed to handle only domestic air traffic -- but ``illegal
flights take off quite frequently,'' Hamilton said. ``It's not a secret.''
</P>
<P>
	   News spreads quickly in this island nation, and by Thursday morning angry
drug smugglers and their rivals searching for the missing contraband began
pouring into St. Margaret's Bay and Port Antonio, a decaying but elegant resort
that once was the playground of dashing film star Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have seen strangers, suspected criminals from all over the island ...
the area is tense,'' Detective Sgt. Derrick Hart said at Port Antonio police
station.
</P>
<P>
	   In St. Margaret's Bay, residents are living in fear.
</P>
<P>
	   Two families have been burned out of their homes and one man has allegedly
been kidnapped and beaten. Residents believe that's fallout from the drug theft.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a few people lingered Monday night at the rum shops and small stores
lining the main road.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You hear and see certain things ... people don't want to go out at
night,'' said John Scott, who sells coconuts from a shack next to the blackened
heap of burned wood and singed aluminum sheets that was the home of man who now
is ``hiding up in the bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scott claimed his neighbor stole some of the cocaine and that on Friday ``it
get stolen back and they burn him out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Burke said he knew a woman who lost her home just up the road
because her son allegedly grabbed a few pounds of the cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guys come to take it away but couldn't find him,'' Burke said, pointing at
the charred remains of a small tin-roofed home. The mother and son fled to
escape further reprisals, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man, who police say was kidnapped over the weekend and beaten before
being released, also left town, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The stolen shipment followed a new path of cocaine moving through Jamaica to
North America. It came by boat from Colombia, was stored here, and was going to
be flown to the United States, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Local authorities and foreign analysts estimate that at most a fifth of the
cocaine passing through Jamaica is intercepted.
</P>
<P>
	   A record 5,500 pounds was seized last year, more than double the year
before. While the increase may reflect better detection efforts, it also
suggests a rise in trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This a quiet town,'' Scott said. ``But sometimes a movement (of cocaine)
goes bust and the beating and burning starts up.''

<HEADLINE> Cable, TV Makers Agree on Digital  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers soon can buy digital television receivers that
work with their cable systems under an agreement between television makers and
cable operators announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal ends an impasse over technical standards that let digital sets
communicate with digital cable boxes. It also removes one of the stumbling
blocks that has slowed consumers' embrace of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The industries expect cable customers should be able to buy cable-ready
digital sets within 18 months, allowing them to see any cable show in a new
format that promises razor-sharp pictures and sound. About two-thirds of
Americans get their television signals via cable.
</P>
<P>
	   "With these agreements, many more consumers will soon be able to access the
wonders of digital television through cable," said Gary Shapiro, president of
the Consumer Electronics Association. "This is yet another giant step forward in
the transition to DTV."
</P>
<P>
	   Digital television allows broadcasters to squeeze more video and data into
existing channel space, offering sharper pictures, more channels, stock quotes
or other data transmitted to home computers.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement includes specifications to ensure consumers can get their
cable signals on digital sets, said Robert Sachs, head of the National Cable
Television Association.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the pact should prevent the need for government intervention, but
regulators at the Federal Communications Commission said they still may need to
step in if two key disputes remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency chairman, Bill Kennard, had set an April 1 deadline for a
compromise on some issues and said he was circulating draft rules to his
colleagues in case the differences were not resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, he praised the industries for deals on the direct connection
of digital receivers to cable, and how to pass tuning and schedule information
through cable systems so consumers can use them with on-screen program guides.
The latter will be increasingly important as digital service greatly expands the
number of channels available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The "industry agreement on digital TV technical standards will jump start
the digital revolution for television," Kennard said. "It means that Americans
are one giant step closer to enjoying digital television over their cable
systems."
</P>
<P>
	   Two other matters still need to be worked out, Kennard said:
</P>
<P>
	   --labeling sets so consumers know whether their digital set connects to
other digital appliances, such as a digital VCR.
</P>
<P>
	   --copy protection technology to prevent cable shows from being illegally
intercepted, or pirated, while still letting consumers make copies for their own
use.
</P>
<P>
	   Until those matters are resolved, FCC Commissioner Susan Ness warned against
declaring "victory when the game's only at halftime."

<HEADLINE> Record Nasdaq Gain; Dow Ends Off 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A huge rally in technology stocks today pushed the Nasdaq
composite index to its biggest one-day point gain ever -- but offered no help to
the big industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite closed up 168.02 at 4,550.14,
according to preliminary calculations. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial
average, which seesawed in and out of positive territory late in the session,
ended the day down 79.11 at 10,225.73.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for technology stocks that wavered yesterday returned in today's
session, especially after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a
congressional committee that high stock prices weren't driving the Fed's
interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The total craze for technology stocks has gripped this market, and that
situation remains in control," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president at
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington noted that today's rally was fed by so-called "second-line
technology stocks" instead of the household name technology companies that have
traditionally commanded investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strength has moved down a notch," Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Names such as Sun Microsystems and 3Com were the leaders of Wednesday's
rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have returned to a familiar trading pattern that has characterized
the stock markets for months, in which technology stocks simply dominate all
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned briefly to favor on Tuesday
-- helping the Dow recover a bit from Friday's broad decline -- were ignored or
sold off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Old line sectors such as aerospace and defense, chemicals, consumer product

<HEADLINE> Alleged ecstasy drug network smashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A multi-million dollar network responsible for smuggling
the popular "club drug" ecstasy into New York and several other states has been
dismantled after a lengthy investigation, authorities said Wednesday.
<P>
	   A total of 61 people were under arrest or being sought, all allegedly part
of an international ring that allegedly conducted business in New York,
California, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
Authorities believe the drugs were smuggled into the United States by six
Israeli nationals.
</P>
<P>
	   The ring, operating out of a Forest Hills, Queens apartment, allegedly
poured 100,000 ecstasy tablets a week into the New York metropolitan region from
the Netherlands and Belgium, said Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown.
Authorities have seized 300,000 tablets worth an estimated $7.5 million, and
$550,000 in cash, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "With these arrests we hope to drive home the message that, despite its
name, this drug is a nightmare for users and dealers alike," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant
amphetamine chemically known as MDMA. It has been shown in previous studies to
cause brain damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug, also known as XTC or X, has become the most popular of the
so-called club drugs, said Donnie R. Marshall, acting administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case demonstrates that the Netherlands and Belgium have become the
main location for manufacturing and exporting MDMA," Marshall said. "To add to
the globalization of this problem, Israeli and Russian organized crime
syndicates have gained control of the smuggling of MDMA from Europe into the
U.S."
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities began focusing in on the ring after two undercover investigators
learned that an Israeli national living in Forest Hills - identified as Oshri
Amar - was allegedly selling large quantities of ecstasy. Undercover agents
purchased tablets from Amar, and then received court authorization to install
wiretaps on Amar's telephone and other telephones his alleged associates
controlled, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over several months, Amar and his associates allegedly engaged in hundreds
of wholesale transactions in several states. They allegedly paid between $1 and
$2 per tablet, and then charged $6 to $8 per pill, Brown said. The tablets
usually sell for $20 to $30 apiece at clubs, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 61 defendants, 32 were either arrested Wednesday or were being sought
in New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. Amar was one of the defendants being
sought, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five defendants were previously arrested. In addition, 24 people were either
arrested or were being sought in the Providence, Rhode Island area.
</P>
<P>
	   All the defendants were charged with conspiracy to sell and distribute a
controlled substance, and various counts of criminal possession and/or sale of a
controlled substance. Each faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand Bids $3B for Rival Mirage  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT MACY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- MGM Grand, Inc., buoyed by record earnings, has made an
unsolicited offer to buy Mirage Resorts, Inc. for $3.5 billion in cash and
stock, setting up a potential battle between two casino titans.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer revealed Wednesday was 56 percent higher than the market value of
Mirage and also included the assumption of $2 billion in debt, a deal so rich
that it could discourage any other bidders, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage issued a brief statement Wednesday, saying only that the "unsolicited
proposal" would be considered by the company's board of directors "in the near
future."	   Shares of Mirage surged 32 percent on the news, rising $3.50 to
$14.37 1/2, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of MGM Grand rose
$1.43 3/4 to $41.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal involves two of the world's largest casino companies and two of the
industry's most powerful figures -- Mirage chairman Steve Wynn and billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian, the majority stockholder in MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men, who helped shape Las Vegas as the gambling capital of the
world, have a relationship that is considered by analysts as very cordial. While
Wynn has sought a high profile, Kerkorian has chosen to remain in the background
while amassing a fortune in hotel-casinos, MGM film studios and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Casino analysts aren't certain how the drama between the gambling giants
will play out, but they say it's unlikely other suitors will surface.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see anybody else coming up right now," said Jason Ader of Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co. "Harrah's and Park Place have their plates full."
</P>
<P>
	   "There aren't many gaming companies that could do this," agreed Joe
Coccimiglio of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Coccimiglio said egos could play a key role in whether the deal succeeds.
</P>
<P>
	   "People know Wynn is not likely to say 'Yes,' " Coccimiglio said. "We're
talking about a control issue, which company gets to call the shots. I don't
know if you can get the egos in line. Who gets to run the show? That's always
the sticking point. Wynn has been doing it for 27 years."
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it quite clear that this is a friendly offer," James Murren,
president of MGM Grand, Inc. said Wednesday. "We invite the entire (Mirage)
board to be a part of the board of the combined company."
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter offered to acquire the stock at $17 a share, either all cash or
$7 cash and MGM Grand stock valued at $10 per share. The offer would cover 200
million outstanding shares plus stock options, with a total value estimated by
analysts at $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage stock peaked at $26 a share in the spring of 1999, but has declined
in recent months. Wednesday's offer was more than 56 percent higher than
Mirage's closing share price of $10.87 1/2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian has led takeover bids before, most notably in 1995 when he tried
to launch a $23 billion bid for Chrysler. The bid ultimately failed, though
Kerkorian still remains a top shareholder in the company, now known as
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian bought 4.9 percent of Mirage's stock in September, then sold it
weeks later. The purchase was described as "for investment purposes only."
</P>
<P>
	   When Mirage prices dropped in recent weeks, "people wondered if it showed up
on Kirk's radar screen," Ader said.
</P>
<P>
	   J. Terrence Lanni, MGM chairman, said in a letter to Wynn that the deal
would create an opportunity for more revenue and lower costs that would boost
the value of the combined company's shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Strategically this is a very good fit," said Coccimiglio. "You have two
companies who are dominant in the high roller business and battle each other for
that business. They could join forces, cut back on their offices in the Far
East, and the degree of rebates could be reduced to those customers."
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage owns the 3,025-room Bellagio hotel-casino, the biggest-earning hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip.	   But it has struggled with its $650 million Beau
Rivage resort that opened last March in Biloxi, Miss., and its 1999 fourth
quarter earnings disappointed some analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, MGM Grand's earnings have been rising and it cited strong casino
and hotel volumes at its 5,005-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas, earnings from the
acquisition of Primadonna Resorts Inc. and the successful opening of the MGM
Grand Detroit Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   MGM has also announced plans to develop a hotel and casino resort in
Atlantic City, N.J., where Mirage is under way with similar plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn has been credited with the current boom in Las Vegas, which dates back
to his opening of the company's flagship Mirage hotel-casino in 1989. The
company also owns the Bellagio, Golden Nugget and Treasure Island hotel-casinos
in Las Vegas, half interest in the Monte Carlo resort here, and the Golden
Nugget in Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian has been a major player in Las Vegas for more than a quarter of a
century, having built the world's largest hotel here three times. He built the
International, now the Las Vegas Hilton, and later built the old MGM Grand, now
Bally's-Las Vegas. In 1993 he opened the new MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip.

<HEADLINE> Senate Looks At Education Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Undeterred by two presidential vetoes, the Senate again
took up legislation that would expand tax-free savings accounts for elementary
and secondary school education, including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a bill whose time I think has come,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday of the legislation that would allow parents to
place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in education savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which would also make savings in prepaid tuition plans tax free
and expand tax breaks for employer-provided educational assistance, is a
mainstay of the Republican agenda for improving K-12 education.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's opposed by teachers unions, and President Clinton vetoed a similar
bill in 1998. He said the benefits mainly go to richer families and that the
plan would drain money away from the public school system. Last year, education
savings accounts were part of the Republican's $792 billion tax cut plan that
the president vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to keep bringing this up, keep bringing it to the public
attention, keep sending it to the president,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
chief sponsor along with Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Senate's Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said the
bill faced the same fate again this year because ``it was bad education policy
before, it is bad education policy now.'' He said Democrats who oppose it would
not use stalling tactics or other parliamentary roadblocks because ``it's not a
bill that's ever going to become law, so we'd rather spend time working on other
pieces of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Education Secretary Richard Riley urged senators to vote against what he
said was a ``distraction from meaningful progress in education.'' He said the
bill ``offers little or no practical benefit'' for the vast majority of the
nation's students who attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear when the Senate would finish work on the bill or when the
House would take up its version.
</P>
<P>
	   But Torricelli said it was the president who laid the foundation for
education savings accounts when he pushed the current program that allows
parents to contribute up to $500 a year with tax-deductible earnings available
for college expenses such as tuition and books.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coverdell-Torricelli bill, costing some $7.7 billion over 10 years,
would increase the contribution level to $2,000 and allow the tax-free earnings
to be used for expenses, including transportation and tutors, associated with
any school -- public, private or parochial -- from kindergarten through the 12th
grade. The education IRAs would expire at the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The backers argued that it would lead to an education spending infusion of
$12 billion and that the main beneficiaries would be middle-class families with
children in public schools. ``This can't be a bad idea simply because it is a
Republican idea,'' said Torricelli, who predicted that 10 of the 45 Senate
Democrats would vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, in the budget he submitted to Congress, proposed, at a cost
of $39 billion over 10 years, extending the tax credit for higher education and
for public school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill number is S. 1134.

<HEADLINE> Record Nasdaq Gain; Dow Ends Off 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A huge rally in technology stocks today pushed the Nasdaq
composite index to its biggest one-day point gain ever -- but offered no help to
the big industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite closed up 168.02 at 4,550.14,
according to preliminary calculations. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial
average, which seesawed in and out of positive territory late in the session,
ended the day down 79.11 at 10,225.73.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for technology stocks that wavered yesterday returned in today's
session, especially after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a
congressional committee that high stock prices weren't driving the Fed's
interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The total craze for technology stocks has gripped this market, and that
situation remains in control," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president at
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington noted that today's rally was fed by so-called "second-line
technology stocks" instead of the household name technology companies that have
traditionally commanded investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strength has moved down a notch," Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Names such as Sun Microsystems and 3Com were the leaders of Wednesday's
rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have returned to a familiar trading pattern that has characterized
the stock markets for months, in which technology stocks simply dominate all
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned briefly to favor on Tuesday
-- helping the Dow recover a bit from Friday's broad decline -- were ignored or
sold off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Old line sectors such as aerospace and defense, chemicals, consumer product
makers, and utilities were all down across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets are trying to fight back from last week's selloff, but there's

<HEADLINE> Domingo Announces Political Operas  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Placido Domingo, singing star and musical director of the
Washington Opera, said Wednesday that four of the eight operas in its next
season will have political themes.
</P>
<P>
	   Affairs of state were also on Domingo's own schedule for Wednesday evening,
when he is the scheduled to perform at a White House state dinner for Spain's
King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Opera's 2000-2001 season opens Oct. 19, less than three weeks
before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
	   But the operas will be about international politics, not the American
presidential race. The closest they come to the problems of today is Gian Carlo
Menotti's "The Consul," which premiered in 1950. It tells of a resistance hero
frustrated in his attempt to escape the firing squad because of the difficulty
of getting a visa to leave his country.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was considered a realistic slice of post World War II times," Domingo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems more pertinent today than ever, considering the fate of so many
unfortunate people in eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
	   The political themes in season will go back to Giuseppe Verdi's "Don Carlo,"
which deals with the struggle of the Netherlands for freedom from the tyranny of
Spain more than 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other operas come from plays that Domingo said deeply influenced the
French Revolution. They are Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" and Mozart's "The
Marriage of Figaro." Both plays were written by Pierre Beaumarchais, who
influenced the French king to support the American Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
	   Both plays appeared in Paris while the war was on. Beaumarchais collected
volunteers, money, supplies and a fleet to carry them to Washington's army.
</P>
<P>
	   Domingo is not directing or singing in any of the political operas, but he
will take the title role in Richard Wagner's "Parsifal," which the Washington
Opera is performing for the first time this season, its 45th.
</P>
<P>
	   The season will open with the rarely-produced "Don Quixote" of Jules
Massenet. It also will include Verdi's "Il Trovatore" and Giacomo Puccini's
"Turandot."

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- France is sending 600 to 700 more troops to help quell the
rising violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo, and the United States may
send in a Marine unit, U.S. and French officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have already decided'' to dispatch a French Army battalion to the city
of Kosovska Mitrovica, in a part of Kosovo controlled by French peacekeepers,
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William
Cohen, the U.S. defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia
from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Army Gen. Welsey Clark and the German general in charge
of the NATO peackeeping operation in Kosovo had requested three additional NATO
battalions for the French sector. That would be roughly 1,800 to 2,000 soldiers,
in addition to the approximately 30,000 NATO troops in all of Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard said France immediately would dispatch one battalion. NATO
authorities were to meet later this week to decide how to allocate the other two
battalions Clark said are needed to control the ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. They reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit.

</P>
<P>
	   She's a class act, but prefers fast bikes to limousines and disco dances to
debutante balls.
</P>
<P>
	   By day she wears black leather. By night she shines in gold. The daughter of
an uptown girl with a hippie heart, she flaunts a sparkling brooch with the same
ease she wraps a transgressive scarf around her head.
</P>
<P>
	   American designer Tom Ford, who turned the dusty Gucci label into a red-hot
fashion ticket in the mid-1990s, says he's done with "overt" sexy styles and is
now into a more "intelligent" sexy look.
</P>
<P>
	   For his fall-winter collection, which previewed Tuesday night, this means a
"skinny but not skintight" silhouette, a graceful slingback with a three-inch
heel, long but gathered hair and played-down makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   One sex symbol Ford does not let go of is black leather, which this round he
fashions into quilted biker pants and jackets. A touch of ruffle peering from
the sleeve softens the look.
</P>
<P>
	   Coats make a big comeback this round of "moda Milanese," and Ford has 25 in
his new collection, ranging from simple wool to luxurious black and white
geometric patterned mink.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gucci biker gal moves fast. Come 5 o'clock, she tosses off her leather
and dons a chic black cocktail dress with ruffles on the plunging neckline, long
sleeve and above-the-knee hemline. Stockings are superfluous.
</P>
<P>
	   Another quick change and she is ready for nightlife in a soft shimmering
gold long-sleeved shift, with a matching head scarf. Smart girl that she is, she
leaves her jewelry at home, except for the tiger head brooch she has pinned to
her black coat.
</P>
<P>
	   Giorgio Armani has been into intelligent fashion for several decades. So you
can forgive the maestro if, for his younger Emporio line, he decided to be
frivolous for a change.
</P>
<P>
	   The winter collection has the overall look of a teen-ager who is not quite
sure what she wants to wear when she grows up.
</P>
<P>
	   Classic pantsuits share the limelight with ultra-soft leather dresses.
Models in long skirts brush by others in clinging hot pants.
</P>
<P>
	   While Miss Armani likes the feel of black stockings by day, she takes them
off at night. During the same morning, she can wear an ethnic asymmetric skirt
under a tight-fitting jacket, a pair of navel-baring short shorts under a pale
pastel overcoat or a classic blazer with neatly pressed trousers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fabrics no longer have a time zone. Chiffon and velvet are fine by day, and
what's wrong with leather at night?
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking of night, a few sequins on her velvet training shorts combined with
a glittery top and the Armani girl is all set for the disco.
</P>
<P>
	   By day or night, the fashion toddler clings to her security blanket -- a
stole -- in knobby wool, fluffy feathers, or fur-trimmed chiffon.
</P>
<P>
	   Front-row guest Spanish model Ines Sastre, who left San Remo, where she is
co-hosting the annual Italian song festival, to be at the Wednesday afternoon
show, was clearly amused. "I always have an Armani in my closet," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Armani and Valentino have been commissioned to dress Sastre during the
festival.
</P>
<P>
	   The story continues Saturday, when Armani is scheduled to unveil his
signature collection, the last word of the weeklong Italian ready-to-wear
preview presentations for fall-winter 2000-2001.

<HEADLINE> Senator says Thruway Authority kills plan to raise prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After criticism from Gov. George Pataki and state
lawmakers, the state Thruway Authority on Wednesday formally abandoned a plan to
raise tolls on the superhighway.
<P>
	   The authority's three-member board unanimously adopted a resolution killing
its Jan. 27 plan for toll hikes based on increases in a 20-city Construction
Cost Index.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year increase would have been 1.8 percent under that plan and
would have gone into effect June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continuing to reduce taxes on New Yorkers is the right thing to do to
ensure our future prosperity, raising Thruway tolls is not," said state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican who had led the
fight against the toll hikes. "Fortunately, this plan has now been rejected."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall had all come out against the toll hikes after the previously unannounced
plan became public. The authority board is appointed by the governor, but he
said at the time that he had not been told about the toll-hike plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of weeks ago, I made it plain that we had not seen a toll hike in
my five and a half years as governor and I do not want to see a toll hike as we
go forward," Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the Thruway Authority's original plan to raise tolls, word of its
abandoning the plan first came from Bruno. The authority later issued a
statement confirming that.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials had said they needed the extra money to pay for roadway
improvements over the next five years, from lane additions in some urban
stretches to things like a "flyover" at the Thruway's busiest exit, No. 24 in
Albany. The flyover would be a special link between the Thruway and Interstate
87 only for E-Z Pass users.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how the Thruway Authority would now pay for
these projects, but Thruway Executive Director John Platt said "we look forward
to working with the governor and Legislature on solutions to these pressing
needs."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls last increased on the Thruway in 1988, by 31 percent.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire Bride:' It Was Mistake  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Darva Conger described her odyssey on "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" as a vacation spun out of control. Now she wants her life
back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I was thinking clearly," Conger, a nurse and Gulf War
veteran, said on "Good Morning America" Wednesday, a week after marrying a
stranger in a national television spectacle. "I committed an error in judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours later, her new husband, Rick Rockwell, taped an interview across
town with ABC's Diane Sawyer to air Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fox special Feb. 15 was a ratings sensation that quickly backfired after
criticism by women's groups and revelations that Rockwell been accused of
threatening an ex-girlfriend. He denies the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Conger, 34, said Rockwell wasn't abusive toward her, but she said they
didn't spent much time together. They barely spoke on their one-week "honeymoon"
cruise to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
	   "The honest truth is I was very uncomfortable around him, and I spent most
of the time with the girl that chaperoned me," she said. "He's just not a person
... that I would ordinarily have even a friendly relationship with."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was taken aback when Rockwell, 42, kissed her on the lips after
his television proposal was accepted. Conger said she was terrified but went
along with the wedding because she didn't want to disappoint the show's
producers.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she only got involved because she wanted a Las Vegas vacation and a
chance to wave to her family on TV. Rockwell chose her from among 50 women vying
for his nod in bathing suits and wedding gowns.
</P>
<P>
	   "Never in a million years did I ever think that I was going to be selected,"
Conger said. "And somewhere in the back of my mind I thought, OK, if I am
selected by the man to be his bride, he's got to take it in the same way that I
do. It's a TV show.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe we'll like each other and get along. Maybe we'll even date, but I
never in a million years ever thought of it as an actual marriage."
</P>
<P>
	   Within 36 hours, she said she told Rockwell she wasn't attracted to him and
that the marriage wouldn't work out.
</P>
<P>
	   Conger, who gets to keep her diamond wedding ring and was given an Isuzu
Trooper and the Caribbean cruise by Fox, said she just wants a normal life
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have worked my whole life to be a credible person, a person of
integrity," she said. "Unfortunately, in two hours I destroyed much of that
credibility. And that's one of the reasons that I'm here. I'd like it back."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger also found herself enmeshed in a spat between two morning television
programs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While she was appearing on "Good Morning America," NBC's "Today" show
advertised that Conger would be interviewed after 8 a.m. "Today" had a car
waiting by ABC's studio to whisk her away to NBC, but Conger instead stayed with
Sawyer and continued the interview, bypassing "Today."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC believes ABC intentionally tried to derail its interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm surprised that they would do something like that, but that's OK,
because we don't play that way," said "Today" executive producer Jeff Zucker.
"In this business, what goes around comes around."
</P>
<P>
	   But "Good Morning America" executive producer Shelley Ross said ABC planned
all along to keep Conger past 8 a.m. "Good Morning America" believes NBC was
attempting to blunt ABC's exclusive story after ABC paid for Conger's trip.
</P>
<P>
	   "Competition is very healthy," Ross said, "but you never want to put your
guest in the middle of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger is scheduled to appear on "Today" Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Flee Smoldering City  </HEADLINE>
   By GILBERT DA COSTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Charred bodies and burned-out cars littered the
streets of the north-central Nigerian city of Kaduna on Wednesday, as hundreds
of residents fled the scene of two days of religious clashes that left at least
200 dead.
</P>
<P>
	   An overwhelming stench filled the morgue at the main hospital, where dozens
of bodies were piled up on slabs, on the floor, and even the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Smoke wafted from burned buildings and from the remnants of bonfires built
in the streets during the rioting, which erupted Monday morning during a
demonstration by local Christians against a proposal to bring Islamic law to
Kaduna state.
</P>
<P>
	   Guns, cutlasses and other weapons were used in the clashes, said workers
sifting through the bodies at the morgue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People, especially the Christians in my area, were slaughtered like
chickens and goats,'' said Nkechi Nwosu, a Christian, who sought refuge with her
15-year-old son at the Army Referral Hospital. ``I haven't seen anything like
this in the 10 years I have lived in the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police maintained, however, that just 13 bodies had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of thousands of people live in Kaduna, one of the largest cities in
northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds grabbed what belongings they could Wednesday and picked their way
through debris-filled streets to flee the city, most on foot. Others gathered at
police and military facilities for protection.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of fighting Wednesday, but looting continued in some
neighborhoods despite a 20-hour curfew that kept residents inside except between
8 a.m. and noon.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents still in the city raced to the few stores open, stocking up on
supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Police reinforcements were brought in from five neighboring states, and
soldiers fanned out through the city to contain the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are looking for some ringleaders of the crisis who have gone into
hiding,'' said police official Taba Balogun, adding that more than 100 arrests
have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic law, or sharia, has become an increasingly divisive issue in
Nigeria, a nation of 120 million people sharply divided along ethnic, religious
and geographic lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, sharia officially went into affect in neighboring Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. A number of other states in Nigeria's largely
Muslim north -- including Kaduna -- have considered following suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaduna state is about 40 percent Christian.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Gov. Abdulkadir Kure of Niger state, south of Kaduna, signed
into law a sharia bill, and Sokoto state to the northwest followed suit
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kure assured non-Muslims that they would not be tried under the sharia law
and appealed to them to show understanding of the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But such assurances, repeated by sharia supporters in other states, have
meant little to Christians, who fear becoming marginalized or discriminated
against. Their fears are fed by the country's newspapers in the largely
Christian south, which have filled pages with dire warnings of the punishments
Christians will face.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim law prohibits such things as drinking alcohol, and also calls for
separate schools and public transportation for males and females. Islamic courts
were established to hold trials and mete out punishment to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, one man was lashed 80 times in Zamfara state for drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent Nigerian lawyer and human rights activist, Olisa Agbakoba, filed
a suit Wednesday asking the Zamfara state high court to declare sharia
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, an emergency debate in Parliament's lower house degenerated into
a shouting match Wednesday, as Christians and Muslims argued over the
constitutionality of sharia and sought to blame each other for the Kaduna
clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The House of Representatives passed a motion Wednesday condemning the
fighting and supporting the deployment of soldiers to contain the violence. A
hastily added amendment asked the justice minister to refer the question of
sharia to the Supreme Court for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected a year ago after 15 years of
military rule, has remained largely silent on the issue, apparently afraid of
sparking an even larger crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   His only comment Wednesday was to condemn the violence as ``not only
criminal but highly unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need most now is love, caring for each other and joining of hands
to rebuild the nation together,'' Obasanjo said in an address on national
television. ``Let us bind our wounds and accept the challenge of the time.''

<HEADLINE> Marrow Exam May Help Cancer Victims  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Looking for malignant cells lurking in the bone marrow of women getting
breast cancer surgery may help doctors better predict patients' chances of
survival, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, doctors assess a patient's odds by two means: gauging the size of
the tumor, and removing and examining some of the lymph nodes in the armpit for
signs the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
	   A new study conducted in Germany raises the possibility that the bone marrow
is an even better predictor of the chances of a relapse or a cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Used together, the three methods could help doctors decide with more
precision which patients should get aggressive chemotherapy after surgery,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the second large study to suggest that bone marrow is an important
predictor," said Dr. Michael P. Osborne, director of the Strang-Cornell Breast
Center in New York and the first researcher credited with the discovery. "It may
have significant potential to improve breast cancer treatment."
</P>
<P>
	   The study was reported in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, chemotherapy is given after surgery to patients who are thought
to have a high risk of a relapse. That usually means women who had large tumors
or whose cancer has spread to adjacent lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the lymph nodes are not an especially reliable predictor. In 20 percent
to 30 percent of patients with cancer-free nodes, breast cancer re-emerges
elsewhere in the body within a decade. And 40 percent of those with cancerous
lymph nodes are fine 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest work was conducted by Dr. Wolfgang Janni and others from Ludwig
Maximilians University in Munich. They followed 552 women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   After four years, those whose cancer had spread to the bone marrow by the
time of breast surgery were 4.2 times more likely to have died or to have a
relapse than those who had no cancer cells in their marrow. Women whose cancer
had spread to lymph nodes were 2.9 times as likely to have died or relapsed as
those with healthy lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Osborne is nearing the end of a 10-year follow-up -- the point at which
breast cancer patients are considered unlikely to have a relapse -- on a few
hundred patients from his original study. He said if those results and another
large, lengthy study under way confirm the German group's findings, doctors will
have another means of tailoring treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The German researchers withdrew bone marrow from the hips of 743
anesthetized patients with suspected breast or gynecological cancer at the same
time as surgery to remove a tumor.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 552 women who had malignant breast tumors, 36 percent had cancer cells in
their marrow, compared with 1 percent of those with benign tumors. Among the 199
women who had cancer cells in their marrow, 25 percent died during the study,
compared with only 6 percent of those with cancer-free marrow.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Robert Wieder, a cancer specialist at New Jersey Medical School in
Newark, called the study a landmark but said more research is needed to learn
whether chemotherapy will save the lives of women who have cancer in their bone
marrow but not their lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Larry Norton, chief of medical oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said it is premature to start taking bone marrow -- a
painful procedure -- from all breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Norton noted that hundreds of possible predictors of whether cancer will
return or kill have been proposed over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most don't pan out," Norton said. "What makes this one little more
interesting is it corroborates the work of others."
</P>
<P>
	   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Barbara L. Smith of Massachusetts
General Hospital said that knowing the status of the lymph nodes and marrow also
could help doctors spare some patients the side effects of chemotherapy by
finding those at lowest risk of the cancer spreading.

<HEADLINE> Medical Journal Apologizes  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   In an extraordinary apology to readers, the prestigious New England Journal
of Medicine admitted violating its financial conflict-of-interest policy 19
times over the past three years in its selection of doctors to review new drug
treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston-based weekly journal, considered one of the world's premier
medical publications, disclosed in Thursday's issue that it let doctors who had
financial ties to the drug makers write the articles.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was carelessness on our part," Dr. Marcia Angell, editor in chief since
September, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal review was prompted by a news report about one such violation
last fall. It found 18 additional instances since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The violations involve the journal's "Drug Therapy" feature, a series of
reviews of the latest drug treatments for particular illnesses. In each case,
the journal failed to disqualify authors even though they had revealed their
financial ties up front, Angell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said the journal solicits authors to write the reviews but is
supposed to bar those have directly or indirectly received "major research
support" or payment as a consultant from companies that make drugs prominently
discussed in those articles.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Drug Therapy" series is overseen by an outside editor, Dr. Alistair
J.J. Wood, a pharmacology professor at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said Wood disqualified authors who personally received significant
research funding from the maker of drugs discussed prominently in an article,
but failed to disqualify authors whose institutions received such grants or
authors who served as consultants to the drug companies. She said some in-house
editors knew of the practice and overlooked it.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she suspects there were violations before 1997, too, but the
in-house review went back only three years. Wood has been editing the series for
about a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to readers, Angell apologized for the lapse and said steps have
been taken to ensure against any recurrence. She said no action was taken
against Wood. He and a deputy editor who helps edit the series also signed the
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter listed the 18 newly uncovered articles along with the drug
makers, which ranged from little-known biotech companies to pharmaceutical
giants like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck &AMP; Co., Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and
Wyeth-Ayerst.
</P>
<P>
	   The journal regularly publishes original, unsolicited articles on clinical
trials of particular drugs written by academic scientists who have received
major research funding from a drug manufacturer involved. In those cases, the
article notes those funding sources at the end.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said the stricter policy for review articles is difficult to maintain
because "there's so much connection between academia and the private sector
now."

<HEADLINE> Czar: Colombia Suffering Ignored  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, in the
world's leading cocaine-producing nation to promote a huge U.S. aid package,
said Wednesday that Colombia's suffering has been ignored for too long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attention of the world has been carefully fixed on Kosovo and
Bosnia,'' he told a news conference after meeting with President Andres
Pastrana. ``Here we are three hours flight from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey's visit to the South American country comes as Congress debates
the Clinton administration's proposed $1.6 billion counternarcotics package for
Colombia and its Andean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   While dropping in Bolivia and Peru in recent years, cocaine and heroin
production have soared in Colombia as leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary
groups protect the trade in return for huge payoffs from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Poor Colombia is facing as many as 25,000 heavily armed (members of)
narco-terrorist organizations,'' McCaffrey said, using the combined figure for
rebel and paramilitary fighters. ``This is a special challenge.''
</P>
<P>
	   New CIA estimates show a 20 percent increase in cocaine production and a 23
percent rise in heroin production in Colombia last year. U.S. officials say the
South American country now supplies 90 percent of the world's cocaine and the
majority of the heroin sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of funds in the proposed U.S. aid package would finance a
Colombian military push into southern regions where drug crops are expanding
most rapidly under guerrilla protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups and some liberal lawmakers say stepped up U.S. military
aid and training could undermine peace talks with leftist rebels and draw the
United States into decades-old conflict that has claimed more than 35,000 lives,
most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report issued Wednesday, the U.S.-based organization Human Rights Watch
presented new charges of army links to the paramilitary groups who routinely
kill villagers they suspect to be rebel collaborators.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing still-confidential investigations by prosecutors, the rights group
charged the army set up a new paramilitary squad last year and that three major
brigades have ongoing ties to right-wing death squads.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey, a retired general and highly decorated Vietnam war hero, said
complaints against the military have ``dwindled to near zero.'' He said the
police and army have a better image in Colombia than the Catholic Church --
something surveys in major cities have suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   Before returning to Washington on Thursday, McCaffrey plans to tour a
southern anti-narcotics base where a new, 950-man U.S.-trained army battalion is
based -- the first of three anti-drug units that would be created with the aid
package.
</P>
<P>
	   The post at Tres Esquinas is on the border between Caqueta and Putumayo
states, an area McCaffrey labeled a ``giant drug producing region'' where 20
percent of the land mass is devoted to cultivating coca, the raw material for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the military component of the U.S. aid package was necessary
to clear a path through the rebels so that police can fumigate illegal drug
crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But he stressed that one-fifth of the funds support human rights and justice
reforms, as well as providing loans to help poor peasants grow legal crops
instead of coca or opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to critics who fear an expanding American military involvement,
McCaffrey said he did not foresee a large U.S. ``footprint'' in Colombia. U.S.
officials say there are 150-200 servicemen in the country on any given day and
they are prohibited from accompanying Colombians into combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Although U.S. officials have repeatedly insisted their only goal with the
aid plan is to battle drugs, McCaffrey said the United States was also trying to
send a message to the guerrillas that ``it's more effective to talk rather than
fight.''

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire Bride:' It Was Mistake  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The woman who married a multimillionaire on national TV has
something in common with other Las Vegas brides: She woke up shortly after her
wedding wondering, "what was I thinking?"
</P>
<P>
	   Darva Conger described her odyssey on "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire" as a vacation spun out of control. Now she wants her life
back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I was thinking clearly," Conger, a nurse and Gulf War
veteran, said on "Good Morning America" Wednesday, a week after marrying a
stranger in a television spectacle. "I committed an error in judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours later, her new husband, Rick Rockwell, taped an interview across
town with ABC's Diane Sawyer to air Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fox special Feb. 15 was a ratings sensation that quickly backfired after
criticism by women's groups and revelations that Rockwell been accused of
threatening an ex-girlfriend. He denies the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Conger, 34, said Rockwell wasn't abusive toward her, but she said they
didn't spent much time together. They barely spoke on their one-week "honeymoon"
cruise to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
	   "The honest truth is I was very uncomfortable around him, and I spent most
of the time with the girl that chaperoned me," she said. "He's just not a person
... that I would ordinarily have even a friendly relationship with."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was taken aback when Rockwell, 42, kissed her on the lips after
his television proposal was accepted. Conger said she was terrified but went
along with the wedding because she didn't want to disappoint the show's
producers.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she only got involved because she wanted a Las Vegas vacation and a
chance to wave to her family on TV. Rockwell chose her from among 50 women vying
for his nod in bathing suits and wedding gowns.
</P>
<P>
	   "Never in a million years did I ever think that I was going to be selected,"
Conger said. "And somewhere in the back of my mind I thought, OK, if I am
selected by the man to be his bride, he's got to take it in the same way that I
do. It's a TV show.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe we'll like each other and get along. Maybe we'll even date, but I
never in a million years ever thought of it as an actual marriage."
</P>
<P>
	   Within 36 hours, she said she told Rockwell she wasn't attracted to him and
that the marriage wouldn't work out.
</P>
<P>
	   Conger, who gets to keep her diamond wedding ring and was given an Isuzu
Trooper and the Caribbean cruise by Fox, said she just wants a normal life
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have worked my whole life to be a credible person, a person of
integrity," she said. "Unfortunately, in two hours I destroyed much of that
credibility. And that's one of the reasons that I'm here. I'd like it back."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger also found herself enmeshed in a spat between two morning television
programs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While she was appearing on "Good Morning America," NBC's "Today" show
advertised that Conger would be interviewed after 8 a.m. "Today" had a car
waiting by ABC's studio to whisk her away to NBC, but Conger instead stayed with
Sawyer and continued the interview, bypassing "Today."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC believes ABC intentionally tried to derail its interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm surprised that they would do something like that, but that's OK,
because we don't play that way," said "Today" executive producer Jeff Zucker.
"In this business, what goes around comes around."
</P>
<P>
	   But "Good Morning America" executive producer Shelley Ross said ABC planned
all along to keep Conger past 8 a.m. "Good Morning America" believes NBC was
attempting to blunt ABC's exclusive story after ABC paid for Conger's trip.
</P>
<P>
	   "Competition is very healthy," Ross said, "but you never want to put your
guest in the middle of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger is scheduled to appear on "Today" Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Urge Kid Safety Seat Testing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three senators, all with young children of their own, on
Wednesday outlined legislation that would require the government to establish
tougher testing standards for child safety seats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Crash tests performed on children's car seats involve the use of
technology that dates back to the 1970s,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill.,
sponsor of the measure with Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and Rick Santorum,
R-Pa. ``Improvements to the federal standards are long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would require the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to update testing to reflect changes in automobiles. Currently
the NHTSA uses a test bench modeled after a 1975 Chevy Impala, the senators
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHTSA would also be directed to increase the number of test dummies to
reflect children of different ages and sizes, test some car seats in actual cars
and provide parents with accurate, easy-to-understand information.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency would also be required to work on closing the ``child safety
gap'' which leaves kids too big for car seats but too small for adult safety
belts unprotected.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitzgerald said his seven-year-old child fits in this category. Lincoln, who
has three-year-old twins, said it was ``risky and unnecessary'' to allow car
seat manufacturers to ``self-regulate. Santorum said that as the father of five
small children he has first-hand understanding of the need for legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the bill is supported by major child safety and medical
organizations.

<HEADLINE> An underground fire disrupts phone services in upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fire in an old subway tunnel Wednesday damaged
a section of fiber-optic cable and disrupted long-distance, Internet and
cellular telephone services for thousands of Frontier Corp. customers in upstate
New York.
<P>
	   The fire, apparently started by vagrants, knocked out long-distance service
for most Frontier customers in and around Rochester, the company's hometown, but
local telephone and 911 emergency calls that rely on copper wiring were
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   The outages began around 1 a.m. and repairs were completed a little over 12
hours later on Wednesday afternoon, said company spokesman Tor Constantino.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester's nine-mile-long subway, which ran underground for just 1 1/2
miles, opened in 1927. Ridership peaked at 5 million in 1947, but the growing
popularity of automobiles and the demise of five connecting railroads led to the
last passenger run in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Vagrants trying to keep warm were suspected of starting a wood fire that
burned out of control in a disused subway line near the Genesee River,
Constantino said. The intense heat melted the tube-encased fiber-optic line, and
about 150 feet of it had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire cut off outgoing, long-distance Frontier calls from the Rochester
region for "a majority of residential and business customers," Constantino said,
adding that he was unable to estimate how many thousands of customers lost
service.
</P>
<P>
	   An unspecified number of Internet users also lost their connection - and
Frontier's reach as an Internet provider extends the breadth of upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the outage disrupted cell phone service as far away as
Binghamton by knocking out incoming and outgoing calls for people served by Bell
Atlantic Mobile.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier, a century-old telephone carrier with a nationwide long-distance
network, was bought out last year by Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based
telecommunications upstart. Founded in 1899, it changed its name from Rochester
Telephone in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier sprouted beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly in Rochester -
a metro region of nearly 1 million people - by buying more than a half-dozen
long-distance carriers in the 1990s and becoming one of the nation's top 10
long-distance providers.

<HEADLINE> Hasbro To Create GI Joe Doll of JFK  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- John F. Kennedy will be introduced to a new
generation -- as a GI Joe action doll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy Library Foundation in Boston has reached an agreement with
toymaker Hasbro Inc. to produce a figure of the war hero and president as part
of a collector's line that celebrates U.S. military heroes and famous battles.
</P>
<P>
	   The foot-high doll dressed in PT-109 khakis will hold a coconut shard
bearing a rescue plea Kennedy carved after the Japanese sank his boat in World
War II. His hair will be molded in plastic and painted a light brown, and he
will carry a knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Some proceeds from the sales will be donated to the library foundation. No
specifics were released.
</P>
<P>
	   Pawtucket-based Hasbro approached the library about the project in April,
promising to create a respectful and tasteful figure, said Tom McNaught,
spokesman for the library foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had a record of doing it with dignity," McNaught said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, president of the library foundation, knows of
the Hasbro agreement, which was approved by foundation executive director
Charles Daly, a Kennedy aide in the White House, McNaught said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., referred calls to
McNaught.
</P>
<P>
	   A Hasbro designer traveled to the library in December to review pictures of
Kennedy during the war and helped the production team choose the PT-109 outfit,
said Bill Hartglass, head of the toymaker's GI Joe team.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Japanese sank PT-109, Kennedy and his crew swam to a nearby
island. The message on the coconut was entrusted to islanders who brought it to
the sailors' rescuers.
</P>
<P>
	   Library foundation directors requested changes after reviewing a prototype
head.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were asked to make some alterations to the nose ... to make a more
authentic shape," Hartglass said.
</P>
<P>
	   Designers considered reproducing the boat, but felt it couldn't properly be
recreated in such a small size, Hartglass said.
</P>
<P>
	   A version of the doll was shown to some retailers at last week's American
International Toy Fair in New York City, but Hasbro would not allow the figure
to be photographed.
</P>
<P>
	   The doll was expected to cost between $30 and $35 and be available in stores
in the fall. The Kennedy library will sell the figure in its gift shop.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasbro created GI Joe 36 years ago. As of last year, the company had sold
370 million of the dolls, company spokeswoman Holly Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, GI Joe enthusiasts could buy figures modeled after such
famous U.S. generals as Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton and Colin
Powell.

<HEADLINE> Thruway Authority kills plan to raise prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After criticism from Gov. George Pataki and state
lawmakers, the state Thruway Authority on Wednesday formally abandoned a plan to
raise tolls on the superhighway.
<P>
	   The authority's three-member board unanimously adopted a resolution killing
its Jan. 27 plan for toll hikes based on increases in a 20-city Construction
Cost Index.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year increase would have been 1.8 percent under that plan and
would have gone into effect June 1. The Thruway's per-mile charge for passenger
cars would have gone from 3.1 cents to 3.2 cents with the anticipated toll
increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continuing to reduce taxes on New Yorkers is the right thing to do to
ensure our future prosperity, raising Thruway tolls is not," said state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican who had led the
fight against the toll hikes. "Fortunately, this plan has now been rejected."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall had all come out against the toll hikes after the previously unannounced
plan became public. The authority board is appointed by the governor but he said
at the time that he had not been told about the toll-hike plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of weeks ago, I made it plain that we had not seen a toll hike in
my five and a half years as governor and I do not want to see a toll hike as we
go forward," Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the Thruway Authority's original plan to raise tolls, word of its
abandoning the plan first came from Bruno. The authority later issued a
statement confirming that.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an ill-conceived plan," Silver said. "I'm glad that the authority
has seen the light that we pointed out to them a couple of weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials had said they needed the extra money to pay for roadway
improvements over the next five years, from lane additions in some urban
stretches to things like a "flyover" at the Thruway's busiest exit, No. 24 in
Albany. The flyover would be a special link between the Thruway and Interstate
87 only for E-Z Pass users.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how the Thruway Authority would now pay for
these projects, but Thruway Executive Director John Platt said "we look forward
to working with the governor and Legislature on solutions to these pressing
needs."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls last increased on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in 1988
by 31 percent. However, since 1994, Thruway Authority operating expenses have
increased by just 1 percent while the number of Thruway employees have been
reduced by 500, Platt said.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Reaches Ratings Milestone  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite the prime-time obsession with millionaires and
instant brides, it was NBC's "ER" that reached a ratings milestone last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical drama's episode Thursday, in which Kellie Martin's character
died after being stabbed the previous week, drew the most viewers for any
regular entertainment series since the "Seinfeld" finale in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The 39 million people who watched "ER" last week was more than any episode
of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has ever drawn and more than twice the
audience of Fox's special, "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC was also buoyed by the crossover editions of "Law &AMP; Order" and "Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit," which helped the network to its best Friday night
ratings since 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with all that good ratings news, ABC still won the week with a
prime-time average of 15 million viewers (9.7 rating, 16 share). The reason?
Three editions of the consistent "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" were the
second, third and fourth most-watched shows of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC is certain to win the February ratings "sweeps" period, but is still
locked in a tight battle with NBC for dominance among the 18-to-49-year-old
audience that advertisers prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire" drew 16 million viewers and
was particularly a hit among young women. But with the marriage on the rocks
after a week and Fox taking heat for not knowing its bridegroom was accused of
hitting an ex-girlfriend, it's an empty victory for the network.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC was the runner-up in the ratings race with 14 million average viewers
(9.6 rating, 16 share), CBS had 12.6 million viewers (8.7, 14), Fox had 11.2
million (7.3, 12), UPN had 4.1 million (2.7, 4), the WB had 3.7 million (2.7, 4)
and Pax TV had 1 million (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
	   The evening news ratings race was nearly a dead heat. ABC's "World News
Tonight" had 11.1 million viewers (8.0 rating, 16 share) and NBC's "Nightly
News" had 11 million viewers (8.0, 16). The "CBS Evening News" had 9.1 million
viewers (6.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Feb. 14-20, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were:
</P>
<P>
	   "ER," NBC, 25.0; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, 18.1; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 18.0; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 17.9; "Friends," NBC, 16.7; "Frasier," NBC, 14.2;
"The Practice," ABC, 13.6; "Law &AMP; Order" special, NBC, 13.2; 'Frasier" special,
NBC, 12.9; "Law &AMP; Order," NBC, 12.8.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A huge rally in technology stocks today pushed
the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest one-day point gain ever --
but offered no help to the big industrial stocks. The

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, which seesawed in and
out of positive territory late in the session, ended the day down
79.11 at 10,225.73. Demand for technology stocks that wavered
yesterday returned in today's session, especially after Federal

	   Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made
another appeal to lawmakers today to hold off committing projected
government surpluses to new programs, at least until better
predictions are available. ``All I say, all I'm asking in effect,
is just to delay for a while,'' he said. He told the Senate Banking
Committee that until surplus projections are more certain, he has
advocated that the surpluses be allowed to come in and the national
debt be reduced. If political pressures on lawmakers to use
surpluses to please voters are too great in an election year, he
added, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.

	   Summers: Trade Tax-Breaks Stay
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will not abandon an
estimated $2.2 billion in annual tax breaks intended to help U.S.
companies compete overseas, despite a challenge from the European
Union, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told The Associated
Press today. The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S.
makers of computer software, chemicals, machinery and many other
products to shield some export income from taxes. Summers said the
program will continue even if a World Trade Organization panel
rules that it is an illegal subsidy. A decision is expected
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) -- The European Union is committed to a
fresh round of trade liberalization talks after the failure to
reach agreement in Seattle last November, External Affairs
Commissioner Chris Patten said. ``We are committed to getting
another round going if we can,'' Patten told reporters. But he
stressed it would have to be an ``all-inclusive round, not a
restrictive one.'' The EU has clashed with developing countries
over farm subsidies and labor rights and the environment.

	   Gulf Ministers Hint at Oil Boost
</P>
<P>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Gulf Arab states are leaning toward
a slight increase in oil production, officials said today after a
meeting of Gulf oil ministers. In a statement, the ministers called
for a stable market but gave little away on what position they
would adopt at next month's meeting of the 11-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, Austria. ``The
ministers stressed their countries' desire to maintain the market's
stability in the coming period in cooperation with other producing
nations,'' the statement said. Gulf officials said the ministers
favored an increase in production of between 2 million and 2.5
million barrels a day to cut prices to between $20 and $25 a
barrel.

workers and hooking up more Germans to the Internet. Schroeder
commented at the opening ceremony of CeBITT, a weeklong computer
and technology fair starting Thursday. The fair features 7,800
companies from 60 countries. ``Our goal is ambitious. I am certain
we will succeed,'' he said. He said the country is prepared to

Academy of Sciences, today called on the health and information
technology industries to work together to solve potential problems.
Edward H. Shortliffe of Columbia University, chairman of the

health care applications create distinctive requirements and must

	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Fred Fergerson, a second-generation
funeral director, is offering to broadcast funerals on the
Internet. He said he decided to do it out of compassion -- for loved
ones and friends who cannot attend funeral services in person, so
they won't feel left out. ``I don't think there's going to be a big
demand for it,'' said Fergerson, who is providing the service for
free. ``But we've got it if anybody wants it.'' He has had no
takers yet.

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- MGM Grand, Inc., buoyed by record earnings, has
made an unsolicited offer to buy Mirage Resorts, Inc. for $3.5
billion in cash and stock, setting up a potential battle between
two casino titans. The offer disclosed today was 56 percent higher
than the market value of Mirage and also included the assumption of
$2 billion in debt, a deal so rich that it could discourage any
other bidders, analysts said. Mirage issued a brief statement,
saying only that the ``unsolicited proposal'' would be considered
by the company's board of directors.'' in the near future. Shares
of Mirage soared about 33 percent, up 3 5/8 at 14 1/2. MGM Grand was up 1

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made another
appeal to lawmakers Wednesday to hold off committing projected government
surpluses to new programs, at least until better predictions are available.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until we
have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal government accounts
is," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the nation's central bank was answering questions in an
appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual
report to Congress. He gave similar testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that Fed policy-makers are taking a cautious approach to the
nation's unprecedented economic boom -- remarks that have put financial markets
on notice that another interest rate increase is likely soon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks fell about 79
points to close at 10,225.73, compared with a sharp 250-point drop Friday that
followed Greenspan's House testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed chairman said he expects the economy to remain strong and noted that
Americans at all income levels are benefitting from the current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   "The distribution of income, which had been increasingly skewed to the upper
incomes through most of the 1980s and 1990s stopped in the middle of the decade
and everybody has been growing by the same amount," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, inflation is still largely absent. "I can't find it no matter
where I look, with the possible exception of oil prices," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he cautioned that tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending
spree present potential price pressures too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fed policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, "then we are like
the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming
into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have
turned at least partially in order to come into ... a soft landing," Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many private economists believe the Fed will opt for at least two more
quarter-point interest rate increases at the central bank's next meetings in
March and May.
</P>
<P>
	   Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent in four quarter-point
moves, the last one occurring Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   For lawmakers, Greenspan said the lingering uncertainties of the economy
should prompt wariness about making new commitments for future government
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put
in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this
surplus," said Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   The reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that have overstuffed government
coffers in recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet, Greenspan
said. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the
national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I've argued
that we should allow the surpluses run and ... reduce the debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses to offer
goodies to voters are too great in this election year, the Fed chairman said, he
would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's final budget projects that the $3.7 trillion publicly
held portion of the $5.7 trillion national debt could be eliminated by 2013,
making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since 1835,
when Andrew Jackson was president.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has also proposed extensive new government programs, however,
including an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage.
Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for large tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Singer Ofra Haza Dies at 41  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Ofra Haza, who melded ancient Yemenite Jewish devotional
poetry with 1980s techno music to become Israel's first international pop music
success, died Wednesday. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Haza, who was admitted to Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv 13 days ago,
died of massive organ failure, Dr. Zeev Rortenstein said. He refused to say why
she was hospitalized or what led to the organ failure, saying that was her wish.
</P>
<P>
	   Haza, the youngest of nine siblings in a Yemenite Jewish family who lived in
the Hatikvah slum of Tel Aviv, was discovered at age 12 by a talent scout. She
attributed her full-throated voice to singing at home with her mother. By the
time she was 19, she was a bubble gum pop success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was Israel's first female pop idol,'' said Benny Dudkevitch, Israel
radio's pop music editor.
</P>
<P>
	   Her signature song was the defiant 1979 hit, ``The Tart's Song,'' a
celebration of being everything -- funny, flirtatious, consumerist -- a young
woman of the time was not supposed to be, with the chorus declaring, ``I wanna
shout out loud, `I'm a tart!'''
</P>
<P>
	   Later in her career, Haza was among the artists who distanced themselves
from efforts to consolidate an ``Israeli'' sound and delved into their parents'
ethnic roots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yemenite Songs,'' released in 1985 with a photo of her in full Yemenite
wedding gear on the cover, was an instant Israeli hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Its signature track, ``Im Ninalu,'' (``If the Gates of Heaven were Locked'')
expanded a devotional poem by 17th century rabbi Shalom Shabazi into a modern
love song. The melody was pure Persian Gulf, a climactic assemblage of rising
quarter tones; the beat was pure 1980s drum machine.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was not until 1988, when American rap artists Eric B. and Rakim
sampled ``Im Ninalu'' on their dance hit ``Paid in Full,'' that Haza became an
international phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
	   A savvy self-promoter, she rereleased ``Im Ninalu'' worldwide with English
lyrics. It was an outstanding success.
</P>
<P>
	   The rerelease of ``Yemenite Songs,'' and her next album, ``Shaday,'' brought
her worldwide attention -- suddenly Ofra Haza was the byword for world music.
Reviewers would describe other ethnic music phenomenons as ``the Bulgarian Ofra
Haza'' or ``the Indian Ofra Haza.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For audiences in Europe and the Far East, this was something completely
new,'' Dudkevitch said. ``In Germany alone, it was selling 15,000 copies a
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haza's insistence on privacy only stoked the Israeli public's interest in
her life. She made headlines in 1987 when she survived a small airplane crash.
She kept her marriage two years ago to businessman Doron Ashkenazi out of the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
	   After a flush of attention that lasted into the early 1990s, her fame
receded, although she continued to make high-profile appearances. She performed
in Oslo when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, and she sang
the role of Moses' mother in the 1998 film ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Haza's last days, fans gathered at the hospital, anxious for word of her
recovery. After her death was announced, Israeli radio stations switched to
retrospectives of her music.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said she represented the Israeli success story.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ofra emerged from the Hatikvah slums to reach the peak of Israeli
culture,'' he said. ``She has left a mark on us all.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word on funeral arrangements, or information about survivors
other than her husband.

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- France is sending 600 to 700 more troops to help quell
the rising violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo, and the United States
may send in a Marine unit, U.S. and French officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France has decided to dispatch an Army battalion to the city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, in a part of Kosovo controlled by French peacekeepers, French Defense
Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William Cohen, the U.S.
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia
from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Army Gen. Wesley Clark and the German general in charge
of the NATO peackeeping operation in Kosovo had requested three additional NATO
battalions for the French sector. That would be roughly 1,800 to 2,000 soldiers,
in addition to the approximately 30,000 NATO troops in all of Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard said France immediately would dispatch one battalion. NATO
authorities were to meet later this week to decide how to allocate the other two
battalions Clark said are needed to control the ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. They reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said reinforcing NATO's peacekeeping operations will complicate
efforts by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to heighten ethnic tensions in
Kosovo in defiance of the June agreement to end NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Milosevic will take advantage of every opportunity he can'' to undermine
NATO's authority and to foment ethnic unrest, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said NATO needs to add to its existing force in order
to show Milosevic that he cannot get away with such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this robust reinforcement, we think we will send the right signal''
to both Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said NATO
intelligence was keeping track of the disposition of the various forces and
cross-border movements, and ensuring that new weapons did not replace the guns
being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned the unrest could expand to areas outside Kosovo, Macedonia has put
part of its armed forces stationed near the joint Kosovo-Serbia border on a
higher alert because of violence and tension in Kosovo, army spokesman Gjorgji
Trendafilov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson have made it clear they
believe the Yugoslav leader is behind the current tensions in Kosovo. Both
pledge to get tough on any party, Serb or ethnic Albanian, that attempts to stir
unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Presevo Valley, just east of the Kosovo border and home to as many as
80,000 ethnic Albanians, Belgrade is believed to have moved in more than 200
additional paramilitary police. The police allegedly have begun house-to-house
searches, mine-laying and beatings.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the ethnic Albanians' rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has
been officially disbanded, NATO says small military units continue to operate.

<HEADLINE> Court Dismisses Disabilities Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday narrowed its planned review
of whether state employees are protected by a federal anti-discrimination law,
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices dismissed a Florida case on which it had planned to hear
arguments in April. Assistant Florida Attorney General Louis F. Hubener said the
case, involving a lawsuit by a prison guard who sued the state after failing to
get a promotion, had been settled.
</P>
<P>
	   Still on the court's April 26 argument calendar is an Arkansas dispute that
also asks whether Congress exceeded its power by giving all state employees the
right to sue in federal court over the ADA.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Arkansas case, a police officer sued the state police training
commission after it refused to certify him to perform law enforcement duties
because of his poor vision.
</P>
<P>
	   The ADA is best known for requiring equal access to public buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on how broadly the justices decide to rule on the law and states'
11th Amendment immunity from being sued in federal courts, the court's ruling in
the Arkansas case could determine whether anyone can invoke the ADA and sue a
state for alleged discrimination based on a disability.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the court barred state employees from going into federal court
to sue over age discrimination. The ruling further trimmed back the federal
government's power over the states.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida case dismissed by the court Wednesday was filed by prison guard
Wellington Dickson, who said his failure to win a promotion was the result of
discrimination because of his age and heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was Florida vs. Dickson, 99-829.

<HEADLINE> Summers: Trade Tax Breaks Continuing  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Wednesday rejected a U.S.
appeal aimed at saving tax breaks that help U.S. companies compete overseas, but
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon the
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the WTO decision was to be officially released Thursday, two
sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
appellate panel had sided with the European Union position that the Foreign
Sales Corporation program was an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a decision adverse to the United States,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Summers said the Clinton
administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain the
important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past. I'm
sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. options for the program include a negotiated settlement with the EU and
a possible legislative fix through Congress, Summers added.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law would be tricky, costly and time-consuming. Also, opponents
might seize the opportunity in an election year to attack the program as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the 15-nation EU. It permits U.S. companies to
avoid certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax
havens.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break are awaiting nervously the WTO
decision. They fear it could lead to another trade war with the Europeans or
require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software makers such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lemy, said recently that the expanded
program was ``granting an unfair advantage to U.S. products'' in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the EU would retaliate through higher tariffs if
the United States does not make fundamental changes, and some European companies
benefit from the tax breaks through their U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the program could become a bargaining chip in other U.S.-EU
trade disputes over bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace products. Some
observers also believe the dispute could provide an opening for all of these
issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all want to avoid a continuing round of trade disputes,'' Elkins said.
``We are hopeful that the Europeans will realize it.''

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Protest Deadly Car Blast  </HEADLINE>
   By CIARAN GILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people packed the sidewalks of
the Basque capital Wednesday, applauding the passing funeral procession for a
Socialist politician killed with his bodyguard in a bombing blamed on a Basque
separatist group.
</P>
<P>
	   People showered the coffin with roses -- the party symbol -- as it passed
through the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, several thousand people huddled under umbrellas in the
city's Plaza de Espana square in a silent vigil as a steady rain fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The solemn protest was mirrored all over Spain as people gathered outside
town halls and other public buildings to observe several minutes of silence in
condemnation of the separatist group ETA, whose name is an acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom. Evening rallies were held in towns and cities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   In Madrid, some 200 miles to the south, protesters crowded the central
Puerta del Sol plaza carrying banners reading ``Basque Yes, ETA No'' and ``Peace
Yes, ETA No.''
</P>
<P>
	   ETA, which called off a 14-month cease-fire in December, is blamed for a
similar bombing last month in Madrid that killed an army colonel. That attack
brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets to clamor for an end to more than
three decades of killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's procession carrying the body of Fernando Buesa to a funeral Mass
in the Vitoria cathedral was led by relatives and prominent Socialists,
including party leader Joaquin Almunia and former Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Buesa, 53, and Jorge Diez, his 27-year-old bodyguard, were killed by Tuesday
on a university campus as they walked from Buesa's house to the city center. A
car bomb exploded some 200 yards from the Basque government headquarters. There
was no claim of responsibility, but the government immediately blamed ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   Buesa, married with three children, was the Socialist party's spokesman in
the Basque parliament and an outspoken critic of ETA and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying coincided with a state visit to the United States by King Juan
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This new and heinous crime clearly shows an absolute contempt for human
rights and the most precious of them all, the right to live, by those who try to
impose their totalitarian ideas by force,'' Juan Carlos said in a joint press
conference with President Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio
Guterres, joined EU leaders in expressing outrage over the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast came in the run-up to general elections on March 12, and all
parties suspended campaigning. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who is ahead in
opinion polls, promised Tuesday to continue his stance against Basque
independence. The Socialists also oppose concessions to ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Basque regional government, controlled by the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party, severed parliamentary ties with Euskal Herritarrok, the party
seen as ETA's political wing, because it failed to condemn the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Euskal Herritarrok said it regretted the deaths, but said the attack
resulted from a ``collective failure'' to bring about a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA ended its cease-fire because it said politicians were not making
progress toward its demands for an independent Basque state, which straddles
northern Spain and southwestern France. The organization has killed nearly 800
people since 1968.

<HEADLINE> YankeeNets Selling Junk Bonds  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The YankeeNets LLC, the new company that controls the New
York Yankees baseball team and the New Jersey Nets basketball team, is selling
$250 million in junk bonds to complete the acquisition of Yankees baseball club.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-year bonds recently were branded as "junk" by two major credit
agencies because of the high risks in running the sports teams.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, for example, the Yankees' troubled designated hitter Darryl
Strawberry was sent home from spring training after testing positive for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Big salaries, unpredictable performance, player walkouts and lockouts were
just some of the reasons the YankeeNets will have to pay investors more to
borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the Yankees doubled the salary of shortstop Derek Jeter
to $10 million, and it's possible that a long-term contract for Jeter, if
reached, could cost the team more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent seven-year junk bonds have paid out at about an 11.5 percent interest
rate. That means the YankeeNets will pay about $203 million in interest over the
life of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   Moody's, which assigned the notes a B1 rating, said that more than half of
the YankeeNets' revenues comes from variable sources, such as ticket sales,
which is vulnerable to a change in the teams' performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees, which won the 1999 World Series, bring in more than 80 percent
of the company's revenue and are operating in the black. The Nets franchise,
which has one of the worst records in the National Basketball League, is running
in the red, according to Standard &AMP; Poor's, which rated the notes B-minus.
</P>
<P>
	   YankeeNets, which already has $380 million in debt, also is negotiating to
buy the New Jersey Devils hockey team, one of the NHL's best.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the YankeeNets' are expected to get a boost in revenue
when they negotiate new contracts for broadcasting and media rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees' 12-year, $486 million agreement with the MSG Network expires
after next season, while the Nets have a contract with Fox Sports New York
through the 2001-2002 season.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand Bids $3B for Rival Mirage  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT MACY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- MGM Grand, Inc., buoyed by record earnings, has made an
unsolicited offer to buy Mirage Resorts, Inc. for $3.5 billion in cash and
stock, setting up a potential battle between two casino titans.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer revealed Wednesday was 56 percent higher than the market value of
Mirage and also included the assumption of $2 billion in debt, a deal so rich
that it could discourage any other bidders, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage issued a brief statement Wednesday, saying only that the "unsolicited
proposal" would be considered by the company's board of directors "in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Mirage surged more than 33 percent on the news, rising $3.62 1/2
to $14.50, in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of MGM
Grand rose $1.43 3/4 to $41.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal involves two of the world's largest casino companies and two of the
industry's most powerful figures -- Mirage chairman Steve Wynn and billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian, the majority stockholder in MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men, who helped shape Las Vegas as the gambling capital of the
world, have a relationship that is considered by analysts as very cordial. While
Wynn has sought a high profile, Kerkorian has chosen to remain in the background
while amassing a fortune in hotel-casinos, MGM film studios and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Casino analysts aren't certain how the drama between the gambling giants
will play out, but they say it's unlikely other suitors will surface.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see anybody else coming up right now," said Jason Ader of Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co. "Harrah's and Park Place have their plates full."
</P>
<P>
	   "There aren't many gaming companies that could do this," agreed Joe
Coccimiglio of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Coccimiglio said egos could play a key role in whether the deal succeeds.
</P>
<P>
	   "People know Wynn is not likely to say 'Yes,' " Coccimiglio said. "We're
talking about a control issue, which company gets to call the shots. I don't
know if you can get the egos in line. Who gets to run the show? That's always
the sticking point. Wynn has been doing it for 27 years."
</P>
<P>
	   "We made it quite clear that this is a friendly offer," James Murren,
president of MGM Grand, Inc. said Wednesday. "We invite the entire (Mirage)
board to be a part of the board of the combined company."
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter offered to acquire the stock at $17 a share, either all cash or
$7 cash and MGM Grand stock valued at $10 per share. The offer would cover 200
million outstanding shares plus stock options, with a total value estimated by
analysts at $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage stock peaked at $26 a share in the spring of 1999, but has declined
in recent months. Wednesday's offer was more than 56 percent higher than
Mirage's closing share price of $10.87 1/2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian has led takeover bids before, most notably in 1995 when he tried
to launch a $23 billion bid for Chrysler. The bid ultimately failed, though
Kerkorian still remains a top shareholder in the company, now known as
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian bought 4.9 percent of Mirage's stock in September, then sold it
weeks later. The purchase was described as "for investment purposes only."
</P>
<P>
	   When Mirage prices dropped in recent weeks, "people wondered if it showed up
on Kirk's radar screen," Ader said.
</P>
<P>
	   J. Terrence Lanni, MGM chairman, said in a letter to Wynn that the deal
would create an opportunity for more revenue and lower costs that would boost
the value of the combined company's shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Strategically this is a very good fit," said Coccimiglio. "You have two
companies who are dominant in the high roller business and battle each other for
that business. They could join forces, cut back on their offices in the Far
East, and the degree of rebates could be reduced to those customers."
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage owns the 3,025-room Bellagio hotel-casino, the biggest-earning hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
	   But it has struggled with its $650 million Beau Rivage resort that opened
last March in Biloxi, Miss., and its 1999 fourth quarter earnings disappointed
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, MGM Grand's earnings have been rising and it cited strong casino
and hotel volumes at its 5,005-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas, earnings from the
acquisition of Primadonna Resorts Inc. and the successful opening of the MGM
Grand Detroit Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   MGM has also announced plans to develop a hotel and casino resort in
Atlantic City, N.J., where Mirage is under way with similar plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn has been credited with the current boom in Las Vegas, which dates back
to his opening of the company's flagship Mirage hotel-casino in 1989. The
company also owns the Bellagio, Golden Nugget and Treasure Island hotel-casinos
in Las Vegas, half interest in the Monte Carlo resort here, and the Golden
Nugget in Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerkorian has been a major player in Las Vegas for more than a quarter of a
century, having built the world's largest hotel here three times. He built the
International, now the Las Vegas Hilton, and later built the old MGM Grand, now
Bally's-Las Vegas. In 1993 he opened the new MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip.

<HEADLINE> Sean 'Puffy' Combs and bodyguard indicted on bribery charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Rap impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, already facing gun
possession charges in connection to a nightclub shooting, was indicted Wednesday
along with his bodyguard on charges of bribing a witness.
<P>
	   Combs and Anthony "Wolf" Jones were indicted for offering Combs' driver
$50,000 and a diamond ring to say he owned a gun police recovered from the car
the three were riding in along with singer/actress Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Combs offered the ring -
a birthday present from Lopez - as a bribe to Wardel Fenderson, 41, sometime
between Dec. 27 to Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' attorney, Benjamin Brafman, did not immediately return a message
seeking comment. Both Combs and Lopez were up for Grammy Awards to be presented
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, Fenderson and Jones were arrested early Dec. 27 after one of Combs'
proteges allegedly shot three people inside Club New York. The gunman, Jamal
"Shyne" Barrow, 19, was arrested separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the shooting stemmed from an argument in which an
unidentified man threw money in Combs' face. Both Combs and Barrow are accused
of pulling guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapon Combs allegedly wanted Fenderson to claim as his own was an
illegal 9 mm automatic - loaded - that police found on the floor of a 1999
Lincoln Navigator owned by Combs' record company, Bad Boy Entertainment.
Fenderson was driving.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped the pricey sports utility vehicle around 3 a.m. as it raced
through a red lights about 10 blocks from the club. Combs, Lopez, Fenderson and
Jones were in the Lincoln. Barrow was arrested at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was arraigned on weapons charges earlier this month. The bribery
charge carries a penalty of seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow was indicted on three counts of attempted murder in connection with
shooting Robert Thompson of Danbury, Conn.; Julius Jones, 27, and Natanya Ruben,
29, both of Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Buy Newbridge Networks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel is buying
Canada's Newbridge Networks Corp for $6.4 billion in stock in a bold move to
beef up its presence in the key U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian telecoms group will broaden Alcatel's product range as it seeks
to compete with telecommunciations rivals like Cisco Systems Inc., Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Wednesday, Alcatel said it offered 0.81 of its U.S. foreign
shares for each Newbridge share. It said the board of directors of both groups
had approved the deal, which it expected to be completed by the end of the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Takeover rumors had been rife for some time and had pushed Newbridge's
shares 36 percent higher over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Newbridge shares fell $1.50 to $32.87 1/2 in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange. Alcatel fared even worse, dropping $4 to $43.75
and pushing the deal's value down from $7.1 billion when it was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel has been on a buying spree in the United States, which accounts for
one fifth of the group's sales, since it bought telecommunications equipment
maker DSC in 1998. Newbridge is its most expensive acquisition to date.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the deal is confirmed, Newbridge will merge with the French group's
Carrier Data Division, more than doubling that division's annual revenues to
$2.5 billion, Alcatel said. The new entity will be based in Kanata near Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   "For our shareholders, this agreement has the double attraction of
significantly increasing both growth and profits and hence the value of the
company," said Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk.
</P>
<P>
	   Newbridge produces so-called wide-area networks, switches and wireless
products for Internet service providers, phone companies, cable TV and corporate
clients in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   It specializes in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches, which have been
overtaken in recent years by IP -- Internet protocol -- technology. Still, ATM
is widely considered a more reliable service.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel has so far invested in Internet protocol rather than ATM to provide
data carrying services.
</P>
<P>
	   "For years people have thought that this company was likely to be acquired,"
said analyst Duncan Stewart, head of the Navigator Canadian Technology Fund at
Tera Capital Corp. in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   "ATM will have applications, but you don't want to be a stand-alone company
unless you're in a really, really hot (technology)," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcatel said cost savings should total $150 million next year, reaching $230
million a year by 2002. It said the tie-up should lift operating income this
year by $160 million.

<HEADLINE> EPA Runoff Regs Concern Agriculture  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration needs to clarify its plan for
reducing water pollution from farms and logging operations and determine how
much the rules will cost landowners, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency in August proposed rules that would
require states to submit plans within 15 years to clean up every waterway that
fails to meet water quality standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman, testifying before the Senate Agriculture Committee, disavowed a
letter that a senior USDA official sent to EPA last fall questioning the
agency's legal authority to regulate farm runoff and other indirect sources of
water pollution. EPA has until now concentrated on regulating direct sources,
such as pollution from factories and sewage plaints.
</P>
<P>
	   But Glickman said he still had concerns about the plan, including the lack
of a comprehensive cost estimate. The rules are ``very complex and would present
a challenge to any expert on the issue,'' Glickman told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   They also should make it clear that regulators will take into account steps
farmers have taken to limit runoff, such as planting trees along a stream.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Farmers demand clarity. ... What they don't need is more uncertainty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who appeared before the committee alongside
Glickman, emphasized that it would be up to each state to decide how to meet the
reductions in pollutants required by their plans. She said the agency's proposal
was a ``very, very sensible way to do the final work to ensure clean water for
everyone in this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   But congressional Democrats also have expressed concern about EPA's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, D-Ark., introduced legislation earlier this
month that would prohibit EPA from regulating runoff from private logging
operations. She said it should be left up to states to decide whether to
regulate such pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA plan would ``get us nowhere closer to a cleaner environment than we
would get from a voluntary program,'' Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA estimates that there more than 20,000 streams and lakes that don't meet
water-quality standards, including long sections of the Mississippi and Colorado
rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   States have primary responsibility for identifying streams that fall short
of water quality standards and making plans to clean them up under the 1972
Clean Water Act. From 1972 to 1998, states only approved 1,000 of the 40,000
runoff-control plans that are needed, according to EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   Under EPA's plan, landowners would be required to get a pollution discharge
permit only if the agency found they were contributing to nearby water quality
problems, and only if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for improving
water quality, the agency says.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Board member Edward W. Kelley Jr.
underwent a procedure to clear a blocked artery Wednesday and is recovering in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve, in a statement, said that a balloon angioplasty was
successfully performed on Kelley, 68, at Georgetown University Medical Center in
the afternoon to clear a blockage in a coronary artery.
</P>
<P>
	   He was taken there after experiencing ``chest discomfort'' at about 11 a.m.,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelley is among the officials who serve on the Federal Open Market Committee
which sets interest rate policy. A Fed spokesman said Kelley is expected to
attend the group's next meeting on March 21. Many analysts widely believe the
central bank at that meeting will boost interest for a fifth time since June to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The FOMC is composed of Fed board members in Washington and the presidents
of the Fed's 12 regional banks. Kelley has been a member of the Fed's Board of
Governors since May 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelley is expected to remain in the hospital over the weekend and then
recuperate at home for about two weeks, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> US Air Workers Begin Cool-Off Phase  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL W. KAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The clock began ticking Wednesday toward a possible
showdown between US Airways and the union representing its flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Mediation Board has started a 30-day cooling-off period. If no
deal is reached, the carrier's 10,000 attendants will be free to walk off the
job at 12:01 a.m. EST on March 25.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a letter to employees, US Airways officials vowed to ground the
airline rather than endure the surprise strikes threatened by the Association of
Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   "While US Airways will continue to negotiate to reach a fair and equitable
agreement, if no agreement is reached with the AFA, US Airways is left with no
choice but to shut down the airline immediately after the 30-day cooling-off
period," read the letter. It was signed by US Airways chairman Stephen M. Wolf
and president and CEO Rakesh Gagwal.
</P>
<P>
	   They wrote that trying to operate under the threat of unannounced strikes
would cause customers to "lose all confidence that they can rely on US Airways."
</P>
<P>
	   After going four years without a raise, the AFA has threatened series of
unannounced job actions they call Create Havoc Around Our System, or CHAOS.
Union officials said that could take the form of a systemwide walkout, or
strikes against individual flights.
</P>
<P>
	   During the cooling-off period, the National Mediation Board said it will
make another attempt to resolve the dispute.

	   Wheat prices tumbled 3 percent Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
heavy rains soaked a winter wheat crop in urgent need of moisture.
</P>
<P>
	   The wet U.S. weather and forecasts for more precipitation also sent soybeans
and corn sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, palladium rocketed 12 percent lower a day after
its biggest one-day gain ever, and pork futures fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat futures have risen this winter based on the bleak outlook for the U.S.
winter wheat crop, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's wheat
production.
</P>
<P>
	   When the crop went into dormancy in December in the winter wheat belt --
Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas -- only 46 percent was deemed in
good to excellent condition, down from 72 percent the previous year. Farmers
blamed La Nina, which brought dry conditions to the western Plains states.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, timely rains are brightening prospects for the crop just as the wheat
is poised to come out of dormancy. Kansas, Nebraska and parts of Oklahoma
received an inch to 1 1/2 inches of rain Tuesday night and Wednesday, and storm
systems are expected to dump more across most of the region through this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rain is critical now," said Tim Hannagan, head grains analyst for Alaron
Trading Corp. in Chicago. "The wheat crop went into dormancy in very poor
condition, and it's going to be very challenged now to make it up. But it can
improve fast with weather like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans also slipped by 3 percent, falling to their lowest price in over a
month after new forecasts called for rain in the Midwest during the next seven
to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans fell through the $5-a-bushel level and have only been this low
about twice in the past 20 years at this time of year, so the downside is
limited, Hannagan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices dived somewhat less steeply on both the wet, mild Midwestern
weather, which brightens the crop outlook as spring planting approaches, and
more Chinese corn sales to South Korea, cutting into U.S. exports. Some
two-thirds of U.S. feed grain exports, primarily corn, go to Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans fell 13 1/4 cents to $4.99 3/4 a bushel, March corn fell 4
cents to $2.15 1/4 a bushel and May oats fell  3/4 cent to $1.14 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium's drop on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange
wiped out most of Tuesday's dizzying 16 percent climb. The correction was
encouraged by the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, which set a limit up on prices to
head off a new frenzy of short-covering -- the buying of futures to balance
previous sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanessa Motto, a metals analyst for CPM Group in New York, said the fallback
was inevitable after such a rapid rise. Palladium prices had soared from $605 an
ounce at the beginning of last week to a peak of $835 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The metal, used in catalytic converters, semiconductors, dentistry and
jewelry, has been in heavy demand. But the key factor in the runup has been
Russia's refusal to ship many of its abundant supplies, driving prices sky high.
</P>
<P>
	   March platinum settled down $96.80 at $720 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Pork futures tumbled between 2 percent and 3 percent on expectations that
the markets for hogs and pork bellies may have peaked for now. April lean hogs
fell 1.45 cent to 56.20 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 2.40 cents to 88
cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Deal in Peril  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's escalation of threats against Taiwan could
jeopardize Beijing's battle for market-opening trade agreements, members of
Congress cautioned Wednesday. Lawmakers from both parties said a U.S-China
accord is also being hurt by Vice President Al Gore's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the Senate Finance
Committee that the Clinton administration remains united behind winning approval
of a China trade deal this year, despite new belligerence by China and a
controversy over statements by Gore to labor leaders. But committee members told
her the damage may have already been done.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second day, administration officials and congressional leaders
condemned China for threatening to use force if Taiwan stalls on reunification
talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What China did this week was very counterproductive,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``They need to take great care in their
public pronouncements if they truly want to become part of the world
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any suggestion that this situation can be resolved through the use of
force, that is something that our policy opposes,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   China's statements, contained in a 11,000-word policy paper, comes at a
difficult time for the administration's effort to win approval for granting
China permanent trade benefits. The vote, expected in late spring or early
summer, would ease the way for China's long-sought entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers stressed that the administration continued to believe it was
``enormously in our commercial interests'' for China to win permanent normal
trade relations with the United States as well as gaining WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very hopeful that the national interests will prevail and we will see
China's admission to the WTO this year,'' Summers said. ``I am glad to see Gov.
(George W.) Bush and others supporting that proposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration can no longer take Senate approval for granted, Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., told Barshefsky. It has always been
assumed that the bill had wide support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reckless threat to use force against Taiwan and the recurring human
rights violations will necessarily affect the Senate's consideration of the
agreement,'' said Roth.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's senior
Democrat, also suggested the bill was being undercut by Gore's courtship of
labor in his presidential campaign. Labor has made defeat of the China trade
bill a top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're going to lose this,'' Moynihan warned Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the administration has no intention of losing this,'' Barshefsky
replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore complicated the issue last week by sitting down privately with labor
leaders in New Orleans at the AFL-CIO's annual winter meeting. Some of those
attending said Gore left the impression he could write stronger environmental
and workers-rights protections if the China trade were renegotiated in a Gore
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign and the White House insisted he meant future agreements,
and Gore wrote to business leaders to pledge his continued support for the
administration's position.
</P>
<P>
	   But Roth and Moynihan said that the mixed signals persist -- and will make
it harder to win over undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky and the committee disagreed on Gore but not on Beijing's conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We insist on a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. And, certainly,
sabre-rattling is not remotely productive in that direction,'' Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, White House economic adviser Gene Sperling told a business audience
that the administration agrees with AFL-CIO President John Sweeney's
characterizaton that ``China suppresses independent worker organizing and
crushes the protests that result.'' But it disagrees that the remedy is
rejecting the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Rejection or delay would not advance workers' rights in China but would
``undercut the forward-looking thinkers in China on economic liberalization and
play right into the hands of those who would hamstring reform,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhao
Xing and indicated U.S. concern over ``the substance, the timing, and the tone''
of China's pronouncements on Taiwan, said State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said Li told Talbott at their meeting
that the U.S. comments constituted interference in China's internal affairs --
and were inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig told reporters he doubts China
would take the risk of attacking Taiwan. ``I don't think there is a realistic
likelihood that the PRC would do something as extraordinary as invade Taiwan,''
he said. ``I think the costs would be way too high for them.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Owe $4.3M in Legal Fees  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trustees of the Clintons' legal defense fund said
Wednesday they are uncertain they will be able to cover all $4.3 million in
legal bills the president and first lady still owe.
</P>
<P>
	   Donations to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust slowed to $800,000 in the last
six months of 1999, down from $2.4 million in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons still managed to get some five-figure help from several
celebrities, including $10,000 each from film mogul Lew Wasserman and Miramax
Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein. Actor Chevy Chase donated $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, the trustees suggested the decline may be due to the
president's legal problems receding with the end of the Senate impeachment trial
in the Monica Lewinsky scandal in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   One person connected to the Lewinsky scandal, wealthy New York businessman
Walter Kaye, was among the 17 people who each donated $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Befriended by Mrs. Clinton in the president's first term, Kaye became a
major Democratic contributor and subsequently helped place Ms. Lewinsky in the
White House intern program.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense fund donations so far this year are $400,000, giving the trustees
some reason to believe the Clintons will not have to deal with the bills, said
Anthony Essaye, the fund's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to ask Americans to contribute to the Trust in the hopes
that the president and first lady can leave the White House ... largely free of
... debt,'' Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Essaye said that if the Clintons still have substantial legal bills next
January, the trustees will have to decide whether the fund should stay in
business, but that ``in all probability it will not'' continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has said he might be entitled to government reimbursement for his
legal expenses, but ``his instinct'' is not to seek it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' have run up $10.7 million in legal bills since the Whitewater
investigation began in 1993. Lawyers for the president and first lady have been
paid $5.9 million, with $500,000 more collected and on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Trustee Roger Johnson, Clinton's former head of the General Services
Administration, said ''$6.4 million is really good news; the bad news is the
$10.7 million total.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' legal bills stem from various criminal investigations of their
activities, as well as in the sexual harassment suit against the president by
former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Independent Counsel statute, subjects of criminal investigations
who are not indicted may seek reimbursement of reasonable attorney fees from the
special panel of judges that appoints the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the reimbursement question regarding Clinton is murky because he was
impeached by the House on perjury and obstruction charges, then acquitted by the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Proposes Rebuke of University  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Senate Democratic campaign committee said
Wednesday he will try to force a vote critical of Bob Jones University, the
school at the heart of a racial and religious controversy in the GOP
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush has not had the last word on Bob Jones University's outrageous
comments about Catholics, minorities or other Americans,'' said Sen. Bob
Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's proposal accuses the university of enforcing a segregationist
policy by prohibiting the free association of interracial couples on campus. It
also alleges that officials of the university have likened the pope to a
``possessed demon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's proposal condemns ``practices, such as those prevalent at Bob
Jones University'' that are discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   The school is a Christian university in Greenville, S.C., that prohibits
interracial dating and is accused by its critics of being anti-Catholic. The
institution lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s because of racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaigned there earlier this month as part of an effort to win votes
in the South Carolina presidential primary, which he won handily over John
McCain. His visit drew criticism from Democrats as well as GOP rivals McCain and
Alan Keyes, both of whom have said the Texas governor should have challenged the
school's policy and viewpoints while on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, interviewed earlier in the day on ABC, said, ``When I went there, I
got off an airplane and went in there and gave my speech. ... I don't have to
accept their tenets. I was trying to get those college students to accept my
tenets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign contacted voters in Michigan with recorded phone messages,
criticizing Bush for appearing at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's proposal marks the second attempt in recent days by Democrats
to make political gains over the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   One Democratic political official criticized Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri
recently for having accepted an honorary degree from the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli likened his proposal to a provision the Senate adopted in 1994
condemning a speech made at Kean College in New Jersey by an associate of the
Rev. Louis Farrakhan. The amendment, adopted 97-0, said the remarks by Khalid
Abdul Mohammed were ``false, anti-Semitic, racist, divisive, repugnant, and a
disservice to all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   That amendment was brought to the floor by a Republican and voted on as part
of an education bill that was pending at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli said he wanted to do likewise, and would seek a vote on his
proposal as part of debate over education legislation on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Senate's rules, Republicans could either agree to vote on the
proposal, debate it at length or attempt to supplant it with one of their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli said he had not discussed his proposal with Southern Democratic
senators, one of whom, Sen. Ernest Hollings, represents South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Pataki proposes DNA expansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Calling DNA the "scientific miracle for human
justice," Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday proposed legislation that would
require shoplifters, bar fighters, and others convicted of most misdemeanors to
submit genetic information to a statewide crime lab.
<P>
	   The measure would make New York the first state in the nation to require DNA
samples from those convicted of most misdemeanors, aides to Pataki said. It
would expand the state's seven-year-old DNA databank by as many as 96,000
samples per year, up from about 18,600 samples annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's bill would also end the current five-year statute of limitations on
Class B violent felonies such as first-degree rape, manslaughter and robbery. It
would apply to offenses committed within five years of the law's effective date.
In other words, if the crime had been committed during that five-year period,
there would be no statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, there is no statute of limitations on Class A felonies such as
murder, first-degree arson and first-degree kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no statute of limitations on anguish. There is no statute of
limitations on pain. If my bill becomes law, there will be no statute of
limitations on justice here in New York," Pataki said during a news conference
at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Liske, executive director of the New York State Coalition Against
Sexual Assault, lauded the measure, saying it would "send a clear signal to
survivors that the criminal justice system takes the crime of rape seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly said they would consider the
Pataki legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, noted that Silver had advocated creation of a DNA database in 1992, two
years before one began.
</P>
<P>
	   Louise Roback, executive director of the New York branch of the American
Civil Liberties Union, questioned whether DNA samples would be adequately
guarded. The ACLU believes that "stain cards" should be destroyed once the
identifying information police need is on the database.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a whole lot more than identifying characteristics of individuals," she
said, "it's their entire genetic makeup - genetic information about their
relatives, their extended family."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about those concerns, Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Criminal Justice, said it is a felony to misuse DNA information.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton congratulated leaders of a 10-year
effort to sign up and energize more young voters Wednesday, and said it is vital
that young people vote in the first election of the new century.
</P>

efforts that offer voter registration alongside car registration, and said it

<HEADLINE> Large fire rages at southern New Jersey junkyard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW GRETNA, N.J. (AP) - About 200 firefighters from three southern New
Jersey counties fought a stubborn blaze at an auto junkyard Wednesday afternoon.
<P>
	   The fire broke out at about 2:30 p.m. and spread to dozens of scrap cars at
Cranmer's Auto Recycling, sending clouds of black smoke hundreds of feet into
the air.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported. There was no immediate word on the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Some trees were burning but the state Forest Fire Service was trying to
prevent flames from leaving the junkyard and engulfing parts of the million-acre
Pinelands. Firefighters were using water and foam trucks to try to drench and
suffocate the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   The junkyard is located about a quarter mile from Route 542 in the sparsely
populated Pinelands region of southern Burlington County, about 15 miles north
of Atlantic City.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall As Tech Stocks Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell modestly Wednesday amid
competition from new corporate issues and as investors rushed to buy technology
stocks that had been hammered earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/16 point, or $5.62 1/2 per
$1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price,
rose to 6.12 from 6.08 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A stock market rally in technology shares drew some money that had been
parked in bonds. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index surged 168.21, its
biggest one-day point gain ever, to close at a record 4,550.33.
</P>
<P>
	   Also hurting Treasurys was a flurry of higher-yielding corporate bonds that
are being offered this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the major offerings is a $2 billion five-year note sale by KFW
International Finance - the U.S-based funding unit of German state development
bank Kreditanstalt Fuer Wiederaufbau.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no fresh shocks to the market as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan returned to Congress for more testimony about the economy. He again
suggested interest rates will be raised to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of short-term Treasury securities
slipped 3/16 point and intermediate maturities fell by  1/4 point to 9/16 point,
according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.81 percent, with the discount
unchanged from Tuesday's Treasury auction at 5.64 percent. Six-month yields were
6.01 percent as the discount was down 0.02 percentage point from the weekly
Treasury auction to 5.75 percent. One-year yields were 6.22 percent, with the
discount rising 0.04 percentage point from late Tuesday to 5.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.68 3/4 from 5.81 1/4 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 92 1/2. The yield to
maturity of the index rose to 6.19 percent from Tuesday's 6.18 percent.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A huge rally in technology stocks Wednesday gave the Nasdaq
composite index its biggest one-day point gain -- but the high-tech advance
offered no help to big industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite closed up 168.21 at 4,550.33, a new
closing high that surpassed the previous record of 4,548.92 set last Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, which seesawed in and out of
positive territory late in the session, ended the day down 79.11 at 10,225.73.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 8.52 to 1,360.69.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for technology stocks that wavered on Tuesday returned in Wednesday's
session, especially after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a
congressional committee that high stock prices weren't driving the Fed's
interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The total craze for technology stocks has gripped this market, and that
situation remains in control," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president at
Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington noted that Wednesday's rally was fed by so-called "second-line
technology stocks" instead of the household name technology companies that have
traditionally commanded investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strength has moved down a notch," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems, which rose 14 11/16 to 138 5/8, Sun Microsystems, up 6 5/8 at
94 5/8, and 3Com, up 6 3/4 at 77 5/8, led the rally, while the traditional
technology bellwethers -- Microsoft, which gained 7/16 to 94 1/4, Dell Computer,
up 1 9/16 at 41 3/8, and Intel, up 2 5/16 at 109 1/16 -- stayed out of the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have returned to a familiar trading pattern that has characterized
the stock markets for months, in which technology stocks simply dominate all
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies such as eBay, up 20 7/16 to 154 15/16, Yahoo!, up 12
25/64 to 166 13/64, and Amazon.com, up 6 7/8 to 70 7/16, also participated in
Wednesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   EBay, an Internet auctioneer, rose early in the session and continued to
climb after influential Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodgett issued a "buy"
rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-neglected industrial stocks that returned briefly to favor on Tuesday
-- helping the Dow recover a bit from a broad decline Friday -- were ignored or
sold off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Old line sectors such as aerospace and defense, chemicals, consumer product
makers, and utilities were all down across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Chemical maker DuPont fell 15/16 to 53 1/4; metal company Alcoa shed 1 3/8
to 71 1/8, and pharmaceutical maker Merck dipped 2 1/8 to 63 1/8. Even IBM felt
the sting, falling 2 1/8 to 108 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets are trying to fight back from last week's selloff, but there's
still a lot of ambiguity out there," said Brian Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., a Kansas City brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which rose 7 to 56 3/4, and Time Warner, up 7 15/16, both
regained some of the ground lost since the two companies announced a proposed
merger last month. Investors bought the stocks Wednesday after Merrill Lynch
issued a positive report on the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a 3
to 2 margin, with 1,264 up, 1,762 down and 474 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   Composite NYSE Volume totaled 1.2 billion shares, about the same as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.96 to 549.91, a new
record.
</P>
<P>
	   In overseas trading, the Nikkei stock index in Tokyo rose 0.66 percent. In
Europe, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index rose 2.2 percent, while the
CAC 40 index in Paris rose 1.14 percent and Frankfurt's DAX index rose 1.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Against Yen and Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against other major currencies on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 111.30 yen, up from
Tuesday's late quote of 110.70 yen, but shy of the six-month high of 111.73
reached earlier in Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro, meanwhile, was quoted at $1.0029, down from $1.0036 at the same
point on Tuesday, when it pushed back above $1 for the first time since Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar's gains came as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
delivering the second half of his semiannual report to Congress, told a Senate
panel he expects the economy to remain strong and that there's little sign of
inflation on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   But, warning anew that the Fed is prepared to boost interest rates again to
contain inflation, Greenspan added that strong labor markets and a continued
consumer spending spree present price pressures too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6071 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6021 on Tuesday, and 1.4618 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4626. The
British pound fell to $1.6028 from $1.6119.
</P>
<P>
	   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9504 German marks,
up from 1.9490 on Tuesday; 6.5413 French francs, up from 6.5367; and 1,930.86
Italian lire, up from 1,929.52.

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- France is sending 600 to 700 more troops to help quell
the rising violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo, and the United States
may send in a Marine unit, U.S. and French officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France has decided to dispatch an Army battalion to the city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, in a part of Kosovo controlled by French peacekeepers, French Defense
Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William Cohen, the U.S.
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is simply normal military business to decide ... to make the real
provisions so that we take control of the situation there,'' Richard said.
France already has about 4,500 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We frankly don't anticipate that this is going to be a long-term problem
but rather a flashpoint that has erupted in the last few days or weeks, and
that's the reason we think that a greater show of force and a greater capability
is going to be essential,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marine unit normally has about 2,200 Marines aboard amphibious ships. It
was not immediately clear how many Marines might be called upon if the United
States decided to commit more troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia
from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Army Gen. Wesley Clark and the German general in charge
of the NATO peackeeping operation in Kosovo had requested three additional NATO
battalions for the French sector. That would be roughly 1,800 to 2,000 soldiers,
in addition to the approximately 30,000 NATO troops in all of Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
	   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, however, officials said Clark was seeking
a reallocation of NATO peacekeepers already in Kosovo, rather than an increase
in their overall number.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard said France immediately would dispatch one battalion. NATO
authorities were to meet later this week to decide how to allocate the other two
battalions Clark said are needed to control the ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. They reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said reinforcing NATO's peacekeeping operations will complicate
efforts by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to heighten ethnic tensions in
Kosovo in defiance of the June agreement to end NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Milosevic will take advantage of every opportunity he can'' to undermine
NATO's authority and to foment ethnic unrest, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said NATO needs to add to its existing force in order
to show Milosevic that he cannot get away with such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this robust reinforcement, we think we will send the right signal''
to both Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said NATO
intelligence was keeping track of the disposition of the various forces and
cross-border movements, and ensuring that new weapons did not replace the guns
being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned the unrest could expand to areas outside Kosovo, Macedonia has put
part of its armed forces stationed near the joint Kosovo-Serbia border on a
higher alert because of violence and tension in Kosovo, army spokesman Gjorgji
Trendafilov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson have made it clear they
believe the Yugoslav leader is behind the current tensions in Kosovo. Both
pledge to get tough on any party, Serb or ethnic Albanian, that attempts to stir
unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.

<HEADLINE> Bush May Find Fund Raising Harder  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush faces two challenges as he tries to
replenish his campaign treasury. He has fewer people to ask for money, and
contributors may be less eager to give after watching him spend most of his
record $70 million while losing in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain, on the other hand, continues to see his fund raising surge. He
took in $250,000 over the Internet in the 24 hours after winning GOP primaries
Tuesday in Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush already has collected the maximum $1,000 from 48,458 people -- almost
as much as all the Republican presidential candidates combined in the last
election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research
that studies money and campaigns. There were 48,786 people who gave $1,000 to
GOP presidential candidates in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Because contributors can't give more than $1,000, Bush must find new donors,
and he plans some big-ticket fund-raisers next month to do just that.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts caution that the search for additional contributors may get more
difficult because Bush's aura of invincibility has been shattered by his string
of losses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has a spotty record, to say the least,'' said Herbert Alexander,
professor emeritus of political science at the University of Southern
California. ``It's not certain that he's a winner and under those circumstances,
it's not certain as to why people might want to give to him at this late date.
There's absolutely no question that it will be harder to find as many new
contributors as he already has.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush may find support among some of the 85,000 people who gave at least
$1,000 to the Republican Party or a GOP congressional candidate in 1996 but
skipped the presidential race, according to the research center. Alexander
suggested Bush also might find fertile ground for new donors among the spouses
of people who already gave or among recent Internet millionaires, who are just
now beginning to contribute to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, McCain has raised half of his money in contributions of less
than $1,000. That means he can ask the same donors to give again because they
have not reached the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has experienced a windfall on the Internet, where he has raised
more than $5 million. Since most of that money came in contributions of less
than $250, it is eligible to be matched by the federal government. Bush is not
accepting federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain now has $9 million to spend, including future federal funds. Though
Bush had $20 million in the bank at the start of February, he has been spending
at the rate of more than $3 million a week and raised just $1.5 million through
Feb. 16. His campaign balance is below $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's biggest advantage may be that he already has spent millions in states
holding primaries through March 14, when the nomination likely will be decided.
He is on the air in California, North Dakota, Virginia and Washington state.
McCain, meanwhile, reported spending just $93,021 in California thru Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush is confident he'll be able to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We always said it would be a competitive primary,'' McClellan said. ``We
built strong, broad based support early in order to maximize our resources
toward voter contact in the early primary states. We're continuing to build on
that support.''

<HEADLINE> Debit Case Gets Class-Action Status  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge granted class-action status Wednesday to several of
the nation's largest retailers and smaller merchants in an $8.1 billion
antitrust challenge to fees charged by Visa and Mastercard for debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn gave the retailers and
merchants the pre-trial legal victory, but otherwise made it clear in his
45-page written decision that he was not ruling on the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   He also encouraged that the parties appeal his ruling on class-action
status, saying the issue "raises substantial and novel questions involving the
standards a district court should apply in evaluating a class motion and the
interaction of those standards with antitrust principles."
</P>
<P>
	   The 3-year-old lawsuit accuses Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard International of
using a monopoly in credit cards since 1992 to force businesses to pay
exorbitant transaction fees to accept debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The $8.1 billion damage estimate is the amount businesses contend they were
overcharged by the credit-card companies. If the retailers win, the damage award
could triple under antitrust law to $24.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Gleeson acknowledged that the litigation "poses enormous financial risks for
the defendants, risks that are obviously increased drastically by certification
of the class."
</P>
<P>
	   A trial is set to begin Nov. 27. The class of plaintiffs will now consist of
about 4 million merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Safeway Stores Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and the National Retail
Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly Presta, a Visa spokesman, said the company will appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   He said class-action status means even those merchants who have
enthusiastically promoted the debit cards would become adversaries of the
company in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Including them is illogical," he said. "This is a far reaching class that
isn't really appropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted Visa will win the case at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Gamsin, a spokeswoman for Mastercard, said the company also planned
an appeal, saying the "lawsuit is without merit."
</P>
<P>
	   She said rules requiring merchants to accept all Mastercard credit and debit
cards are meant to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses typically pay fees ranging from 1 percent to 2 percent of the
amount spent by a customer each time a credit or debit card is used. The cards
provide numerous advantages for businesses by making it easier for consumers to
make purchases and decreasing the amount of cash susceptible to theft. It also
guarantees payment to a merchant, whereas a check can bounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, the amount of each credit or debit card transaction is deposited
into the bank account of the business within a day or so.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lawsuit contends that the transaction fee for debit cards should be
much lower because the cards pose a much lower risk for credit card companies
since money is taken directly out of a customer's bank account.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchants say that debit card competitors of Visa and Mastercard charge
as little as a nickel for the same transaction for which Visa and Mastercard
charge more than a dollar.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Sides With Amtrak  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties rallied to Amtrak's defense on
Wednesday, strongly endorsing the railway's plan to expand rather than cut
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Senate Commerce Committee's panel on surface transportation
also got a key concession when the chairman of the Amtrak Reform Council, which
monitors Amtrak for Congress, agreed to lower the threshold it set for
determining whether the railway can wean itself from government operating
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The council released a report in January challenging Amtrak's claim that it
is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year 2002, as
required by Congress. The council questioned Amtrak's contention that some
costs, like equipment depreciation, should not be counted against it because the
government pays for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson told the subcommittee the council was ``just
plain wrong'' in proposing to factor in those costs, estimated at $567 million,
when projecting the railway's finances through fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone knows that adjusting these measurements effectively dooms our
chance to be self-sufficient,'' said Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin. ``Who
wants to invest in a company that's already doomed?''
</P>
<P>
	   The subcommittee's chairwoman, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
ranking Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, concurred and urged the
council to adopt the lower standard. Council chairman Gilbert Carmichael said
the panel will do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmichael, sensitive to charges the council has an anti-Amtrak agenda, told
the subcommittee he is ``a strong believer in a national rail passenger system''
and came to Congress merely for guidance, not for a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kind of feel like the messenger. Don't kill me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing showcased how Amtrak, criticized over the years for needing
billions in government support, has attracted new support by pledging to expand
and improve intercity rail throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urged Amtrak to resurrect service between Portland,
Ore., and Boise, Idaho, which was part of the Chicago-to-Seattle ``Pioneer''
route that fell victim to budget cuts in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison urged the railway to consider increasing service on the
Chicago-to-San Antonio ``Texas Eagle'' route, which now operates just three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., encouraged Amtrak to expand a rail corridor slated
to receive high-speed train service so it includes Birmingham, Ala., to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act imposed the 2002 deadline for
self-sufficiency and created the council to monitor the railway's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   If the panel determines Amtrak will need government operating subsidies
after fiscal 2002 it will submit to Congress a plan for a ``restructured and
rationalized national intercity rail passenger system,'' while Amtrak will offer
a plan for its own ``complete liquidation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison said she doubts it will come to that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Congress will be flexible if we see there's a good chance of
operational self-sufficiency,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> UN Backs Indonesia's E. Timor Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council has thrown its support behind
Indonesian prosecution of those responsible for the violence in East Timor last
year, making no recommendation for an international tribunal in a document
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. human rights experts recommended last month that the council establish
an international rights tribunal to try leading members of Indonesia's military
and police who were behind the wave of terror that swept through East Timor
after its Aug. 30 vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a letter reacting to the recommendations, the Security Council said
instead that it welcomed the commitment of the Indonesian government ``to bring
those responsible to justice through Indonesia's national judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The council urged Indonesia to create a transparent, legal process that
conforms with international standards, and said swift and effective action by
the government would help mend relations with East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The council did, however, suggest the United Nations might have some role to
play, although it didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has been running East Timor since shortly after its
people voted overwhelmingly to separate from Indonesia, which invaded the former
Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, U.N. peacekeepers officially took over from an Australian-led
intervention force that moved in after the Aug. 30 vote to rein in rampaging
militias.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence destroyed most of the territory, left at least 300 people dead
and forced tens of thousands of people to flee into neighboring West Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia has said it should be allowed to prosecute those responsible for
the violence, and an Indonesian human rights commission has implicated top
Indonesian military and police members by name.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has supported Indonesia's right to mount its
own trial.

<HEADLINE> Cable, TV Makers Agree on Digital  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers soon can buy digital television receivers that
work with their cable systems under an agreement between television makers and
cable operators announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal ends an impasse over technical standards that let digital sets
communicate with digital cable boxes. It also removes one of the stumbling
blocks that has slowed consumers' embrace of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The industries expect cable customers should be able to buy cable-ready
digital sets within 18 months, allowing them to see any cable show in a new
format that promises razor-sharp pictures and sound. About two-thirds of
Americans get their television signals via cable.
</P>
<P>
	   "With these agreements, many more consumers will soon be able to access the
wonders of digital television through cable," said Gary Shapiro, president of
the Consumer Electronics Association. "This is yet another giant step forward in
the transition to DTV."
</P>
<P>
	   Digital television allows broadcasters to squeeze more video and data into
existing channel space, offering sharper pictures, more channels, stock quotes
or other data transmitted to home computers.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement includes specifications to ensure consumers can get their
cable signals on digital sets, said Robert Sachs, head of the National Cable
Television Association.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the pact should prevent the need for government intervention, but
regulators at the Federal Communications Commission said they still may need to
step in if two key disputes remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's broadcasting lobby balked at the agreement, saying it leaves
out some important issues, including the definition of what constitutes a
cable-ready receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is only a piece of the solution, and represents a transparent attempt
by both cable operators and TV manufacturers to avoid an FCC rule desperately
needed by consumers," said Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the National
Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency chairman, Bill Kennard, had set an April 1 deadline for a
compromise on some issues and said he was circulating draft rules to his
colleagues in case the differences were not resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, he praised the industries for deals on the direct connection
of digital receivers to cable, and how to pass tuning and schedule information
through cable systems so consumers can use them with on-screen program guides.
The latter will be increasingly important as digital service greatly expands the
number of channels available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The "industry agreement on digital TV technical standards will jump start
the digital revolution for television," Kennard said. "It means that Americans
are one giant step closer to enjoying digital television over their cable
systems."
</P>
<P>
	   Two other matters still need to be worked out, Kennard said:
</P>
<P>
	   --labeling sets so consumers know whether their digital set connects to
other digital appliances, such as a digital VCR.
</P>
<P>
	   --copy protection technology to prevent cable shows from being illegally
intercepted, or pirated, while still letting consumers make copies for their own
use.
</P>
<P>
	   Until those matters are resolved, FCC Commissioner Susan Ness warned against
declaring "victory when the game's only at halftime."

<HEADLINE> Sean 'Puffy' Combs and bodyguard indicted on bribery charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Rap impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, already facing gun
possession charges in connection to a nightclub shooting, was indicted Wednesday
along with his bodyguard on charges of bribing a witness.
<P>
	   Combs and Anthony "Wolf" Jones were indicted for offering Combs' driver
$50,000 and a diamond ring to say he owned a gun police recovered from the car
the three were riding in along with singer/actress Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Combs offered the ring -
a birthday present from Lopez - as a bribe to Wardel Fenderson, 41, sometime
between Dec. 27 to Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Combs and Lopez were up for Grammy Awards to be presented Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' attorney, Benjamin Brafman, refuted the charges against his client.
</P>
<P>
	   "Charging Mr. Combs with bribing a witness will ultimately prove to be a
terrible abuse of prosecutorial discretion," Brafman said. "Mr. Combs did not
bribe or attempt to bribe any witness. He is not guilty of this crime, just as
he is not guilty of the weapons charges that were filed earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   Brafman, referring to the Grammy awards show, called the timing of the
indictment "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
	   "If this indictment was in fact timed to embarrass Mr. Combs on the evening
of the Grammy awards, I would be terribly disappointed in the Manhattan district
attorney," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, Fenderson and Jones were arrested early Dec. 27 after one of Combs'
proteges allegedly shot three people inside Club New York. The gunman, Jamal
"Shyne" Barrow, 19, was arrested separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the shooting stemmed from an argument in which an
unidentified man threw money in Combs' face. Both Combs and Barrow are accused
of pulling guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapon Combs allegedly wanted Fenderson to claim as his own was an
illegal 9 mm automatic - loaded - that police found on the floor of a 1999
Lincoln Navigator owned by Combs' record company, Bad Boy Entertainment.
Fenderson was driving.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped the pricey sports utility vehicle around 3 a.m. as it raced
through a red lights about 10 blocks from the club. Combs, Lopez, Fenderson and
Jones were in the Lincoln. Barrow was arrested at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was arraigned on weapons charges earlier this month. The bribery
charge carries a penalty of seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow was indicted on three counts of attempted murder in connection with
shooting Robert Thompson of Danbury, Conn.; Julius Jones, 27, and Natanya Ruben,
29, both of Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel sides with Amtrak in dispute over federal subsidies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senators from both parties rallied to Amtrak's defense
on Wednesday, strongly endorsing the railway's plan to expand rather than cut
services.
<P>
	   Members of the Senate Commerce Committee's panel on surface transportation
also got a key concession when the chairman of the Amtrak Reform Council, which
monitors Amtrak for Congress, agreed to lower the threshold it set for
determining whether the railway can wean itself from government operating
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The council released a report in January challenging Amtrak's claim that it
is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year 2002, as
required by Congress. The council questioned Amtrak's contention that some
costs, like equipment depreciation, should not be counted against it because the
government pays for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson told the subcommittee the council was "just
plain wrong" in proposing to factor in those costs, estimated at $567 million,
when projecting the railway's finances through fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone knows that adjusting these measurements effectively dooms our
chance to be self-sufficient," said Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin. "Who
wants to invest in a company that's already doomed?"
</P>
<P>
	   The subcommittee's chairwoman, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
ranking Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, concurred and urged the
council to adopt the lower standard. Council chairman Gilbert Carmichael said
the panel will do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmichael, sensitive to charges the council has an anti-Amtrak agenda, told
the subcommittee he is "a strong believer in a national rail passenger system"
and came to Congress merely for guidance, not for a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of feel like the messenger. Don't kill me," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing showcased how Amtrak, criticized over the years for needing
billions in government support, has attracted new support by pledging to expand
and improve intercity rail throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urged Amtrak to resurrect service between Portland,
Ore., and Boise, Idaho, which was part of the Chicago-to-Seattle "Pioneer" route
that fell victim to budget cuts in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison urged the railway to consider increasing service on the
Chicago-to-San Antonio "Texas Eagle" route, which now operates just three times
a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., encouraged Amtrak to expand a rail corridor slated
to receive high-speed train service so it includes Birmingham, Ala., to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act imposed the 2002 deadline for
self-sufficiency and created the council to monitor the railway's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   If the panel determines Amtrak will need government operating subsidies
after fiscal 2002 it will submit to Congress a plan for a "restructured and
rationalized national intercity rail passenger system," while Amtrak will offer
a plan for its own "complete liquidation."
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison said she doubts it will come to that.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Congress will be flexible if we see there's a good chance of
operational self-sufficiency," she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs class-action status in $8 billion suit against Visa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge granted class-action status Wednesday to several
of the nation's largest retailers and smaller merchants seeking $8.1 billion
from Visa and MasterCard for alleged antitrust violations.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn gave the retailers and
merchants a pretrial legal victory, helping them challenge the fees charged by
Visa and MasterCard when customers use debit cards. But the judge made it clear
in his 45-page written decision that he was not ruling on the merits of the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   He also encouraged the parties to appeal his ruling on class-action status,
saying the issue "raises substantial and novel questions involving the standards
a district court should apply in evaluating a class motion and the interaction
of those standards with antitrust principles."
</P>
<P>
	   He also acknowledged that the litigation "poses enormous financial risks for
the defendants."
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is set to begin Nov. 27, with the class of plaintiffs now
consisting of about 4 million merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores, Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co., Safeway Stores Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and the National
Retail Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3-year-old lawsuit accuses Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard International of
using a monopoly in credit cards since 1992 to force businesses to pay
exorbitant transaction fees when customers use debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly Presta, a Visa spokesman, said the company will appeal the ruling, in
part because it turns even merchants who enthusiastically promoted the debit
cards into adversaries of the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Including them is illogical," he said. "This is a far reaching class that
isn't really appropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted Visa will win the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Gamsin, a spokeswoman for MasterCard, said the lawsuit is without
merit and that her company also planned to appeal the ruling on class-action
status.
</P>
<P>
	   "We disagree with the legal standard applied by Judge Gleeson," Gamsin said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said rules requiring merchants to accept all MasterCard credit and debit
cards are meant to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lloyd Constantine, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called Gleeson's ruling a
"big victory."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the case would now "be resolved comprehensively for all the stores,
consumers and banks in the country in one shot. There will be one comprehensive
resolution to a very important set of issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses typically pay fees ranging from 1 percent to 2 percent of the
amount spent by a customer each time a credit or debit card is used. The cards
provide numerous advantages for businesses by making it easier for consumers to
make purchases and decreasing the amount of cash susceptible to theft. The cards
also guarantee merchants will receive payment, whereas a check can bounce.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit contends that the transaction fee for debit cards should be much
lower because they pose a lower risk for credit card companies since payment is
taken directly out of a customer's bank account.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchants say that debit card competitors charge as little as a nickel
for transactions Visa and MasterCard charge more than a dollar for. The
plaintiffs say $8.1 billion is the amount they have been overcharged since 1992.
The damage award could be tripled under antitrust law.

<HEADLINE> Americans Seize Weapons in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. paratroopers swooped down on the
Serb part of a divided Kosovo city at dawn Wednesday, arresting eight people and
seizing weapons in a surprise raid only three days after Serbs drove them away
in a hail of stones.
</P>
<P>
	   As a further sign of NATO resolve to maintain control, peacekeepers
announced plans to start moving ethnic Albanians back to their homes in the
Serb-controlled part of Kosovska Mitrovica north of the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers also said demonstrations would be banned in a wide area
encompassing both Serb and ethnic Albanian-dominated neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   But Serb leaders objected to the resettlement plan. One of them, Oliver
Ivanovic, warned that the crisis in Kosovo's most multiethnic city would ``peak
within 10 to 15 days'' unless the NATO-led Kosovo Force abandoned its plan.
</P>
<P>
	   As French troops surrounded the search area, about 300 troops of the U.S.
504th Airborne Infantry -- backed by armored vehicles and in full battle gear --
crossed the Ibar River at dawn and swept through ``Little Bosnia,'' an
ethnically mixed neighborhood, searching house-to-house for weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   A NATO spokesman, Flight Lt. Neville Clayton, said the Americans seized a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher, rifles, grenades and ammunition. Maj. Erik
Gunhus, an American spokesman, said eight people were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time the Americans had been on the river's north side
since they and German forces were driven away Sunday by stone-throwing Serbs
during a weapons search. On Monday they were forced to break off a search due to
a violent demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Americans left Wednesday, they marched beside a cafe frequented by
Serb militants, who shouted abuse but made no attempt to stop them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to send a message that KFOR can operate and move freely north
of the Ibar and anywhere in Kosovo they want to go,'' Gunhus said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans later left the city and returned to their base at Camp
Bondsteel in southeastern Kosovo. French troops continued the search in
Mitrovica, smashing doors of apartments and garages that would not open. A
French soldier, who refused to give his name, told residents they would be
compensated for damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. soldiers were among troops from more than a dozen countries sent to
reinforce the French last weekend, when tensions escalated.
</P>
<P>
	   France announced Wednesday it was sending another 600 to 700 troops to help
quell the violence in Kosovska Mitrovica, while a U.S. official said on
condition of anonymity that the United States may send in a Marine Expeditionary
Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have already decided'' to dispatch a French Army battalion to the city,
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said in Washington. NATO authorities were
to meet later this week to decide how to allocate another two battalions
requested to reinforce the French sector of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials said they hoped to begin moving ethnic Albanians back home to
three high-rise apartment buildings on the north bank next week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, ethnic Albanians could begin registering and showing proof they
owned apartments in the buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Troops also plan to build a footbridge across the Ibar River in front of the
three apartment houses to provide secure access.
</P>
<P>
	   The KFOR command agreed to establish a security zone, in which
demonstrations will be banned, in an area encompassing the heart of both sides
of the city. The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, called on
his fellow Albanians to avoid demonstrations on the south bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to move ethnic Albanians back, however, enraged Serb leaders,
who said they were not consulted. One leader, Nikola Kabasic, claimed Albanian
snipers had fired on French peacekeepers last weekend from buildings to which
ethnic Albanians will be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Serbs were excluded this time, although we believe we could have given
some suggestions for calming down the situation,'' Kabasic said. Ivanovic
accused the ethnic Albanians of ``building up tensions to the maximum so they
would use the situation to provoke bloodshed in the northern part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ivanovic insisted that no Yugoslav security forces had infiltrated the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Serbs in Mitrovica, he said, ``are ordinary, disappointed people who
have nowhere to go, and 7,000 temporarily displaced people are waiting to see
what will be their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, they are determined to stay here and fight with all means,
first peaceful and then any other,'' Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions have been rising here since a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2
killed two elderly Serbs south of the city. That triggered revenge attacks that
have left nine people dead and scores injured.

<HEADLINE> Russia Issues New T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MOSCOW (AP) -- In a first, halting step toward reviving the country's
financial markets, the Russian government issued treasury bills on Wednesday,
the first since a spectacular default and market crash a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for the bills far exceeded the amount offered. But analysts said the
snapping up of T-bills largely reflected complex government regulations on how
investors use their money rather than real desire to own securities issued by a
country with one of the lowest credit ratings in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Domestic banks bought $76 million of the $86 million worth of three-month
T-bills offered Wednesday. In all, bids exceeded $241 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such T-bills, known by the Russian acronym GKO, were once a favorite of
high-flying investors in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors watched gleefully as yields climbed up to more than 200 percent at
one point. But the market crashed on Aug. 17, 1998, when the Finance Ministry
froze sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic failure of the GKO market came to emblemize the shortsighted,
fast-money policies of the first attempt at Russian economic recovery in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The new issue was possible despite a rock-bottom credit rating because
government restrictions have limited Russian investors' options, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the previous GKO market, Wednesday's limited issue was designed to
control inflation by removing rubles from the economy rather than plugging holes
in the budget, said Eric Kraus, chief strategist with Nikoil Capital Markets, a
Moscow-based brokerage.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no competing short-term market," he said. And the Russian market
"is awash in liquidity," because the Russian Central Bank is selling rubles to
buy hard currency to meet foreign debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors bought the three-month paper at 20.10 percent annual yield, which
is about the same as the expected inflation rate. A better investment would be
buying dollars and stashing them in a safe, Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
	   But currency restrictions implemented after the 1998 crash stifle dollar
purchases for banks. The T-bills at least prevent a loss to inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A second T-bill auction Wednesday targeted foreign investors who were
hammered in the crash and had funds frozen in ruble accounts. More than a
traditional bond, the issue of six-month paper was used as an instrument for
repatriating capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Finance Ministry offered a similar, specialized issue in December.

<HEADLINE> High Turnouts Show Voter Enthusiasm  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- It happened again in Michigan. Just like in South Carolina
and New Hampshire. In state after state, voters are flooding to the polls in
record numbers as the presidential contest rolls through.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout is up week after week, sometimes more than double the primary
election totals of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For all the talk of people turned off by negative campaigning, voters say
they're energized by having a real choice among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, nearly nine of 10 Republican voters in South Carolina and New
Hampshire said they were satisfied with their choice of candidates, exit polls
found. That's a striking contrast to 1992 and 1996, when only about half the
voters in states across the country were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, those happy voters don't all agree with each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle Smith, who referred to herself as ``a hard-core Democrat,'' jumped
into Michigan's GOP primary to vote for John McCain because she thought both
McCain and Democrat Al Gore would be effective presidents. She hopes both are on
the ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The opportunity to watch the two of them debate would be an awesome
experience,'' said Smith, 37, of Traverse City.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire insurance examiner Matt Swank, 38, said he chose George W.
Bush because he was ``more level-headed, not as hot-tempered and he has a good
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richard St. Hilaire, a 70-year-old retiree and registered Democrat, said he
voted for Gore in New Hampshire because ``I want the economy to continue in the
same direction it's been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's election in Michigan attracted more voters than any other GOP
presidential primary in the state's history. The 1.3 million turnout far
eclipsed the 1996 total of just over half a million, and McCain alone captured
more votes than were cast in Michigan's 1996 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina three days earlier, Bush beat McCain as voter turnout more
than doubled what it was in the GOP primary four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, where both Republicans and Democrats held primaries, a
record number of voters went to the polls. McCain beat Bush and Gore topped Bill
Bradley as 396,385 residents cast ballots -- 14 percent more than the previous
record in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The surge in Michigan, South Carolina and New Hampshire resulted from a
combination of competitive races and McCain's appeal to non-traditional voters,
said David Rohde, a presidential elections expert at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
	   About three in 10 voters in the South Carolina and Michigan primaries were
voting in a GOP primary for the first time, according to exit polls conducted by
Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and the television
networks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, half the new voters were young, between 18 and 29 years old. A
third of union members who voted were first-timers. The newcomers were split
evenly among Democrats, Republicans and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, half of the new voters were Republicans, and the rest
split between Democrats and independents. Slightly more were women than men.
Most were not South Carolina natives.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Conner, 45, and his wife, Debbie, 47, both backed McCain. ``I think
McCain is for the working-class people,'' said Debbie Conner, of Florence, S.C.
``He was in a Vietnam prisoner-of-war camp and passed up a chance to get out. I
think he'll carry those convictions as president.''
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout surge didn't happen in Iowa, where fewer party regulars turned
out for the precinct caucuses. McCain didn't compete in Iowa and interest was
lackluster in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
	   Among new voters this year, many have a favorable view of McCain and an
unfavorable one of Bush, exit polls say. Most are looking for a candidate not
tied to political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are frustrated voters who are looking for a change,'' said pollster
Ed Sarpolus of EPIC/MRA, based in Lansing, Mich. By voting, ``they can actually
do something. They can make a difference.''

<HEADLINE> School-Bound Chicken Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 114,000 pounds of chicken nuggets and patties that
were produced for schools in six states have been recalled because they may be
contaminated with deadly bacteria, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The meat was produced Jan. 25 at a Gold Kist Inc. plant in Boaz, Ala., and
sent to schools in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, Colorado and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department began investigating the plant after officials in
Ohio found listeria monocytogenes in an open package of chicken nuggets. USDA
said it had received no reports of illnesses; none of the nuggets and patties
are believed to have been eaten.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a test ordered by Ohio officials confirmed the presence of
listeria in a closed package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gold Kist's actions should reassure parents, school administrators and
students,'' said Thomas Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeria is a common pathogenic bacteria found in the environment. It is
killed in the cooking process if the chicken is prepared at the proper
temperature.
</P>
<P>
	   Food contaminated by listeria can cause listerosis, an uncommon but
potentially fatal disease. Healthy people rarely contract the disease, with
symptoms like high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
	   It can be deadly to the elderly or young children and can cause stillbirths
and miscarriages in pregnant women, even if they experience no symptoms.

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- France is sending 600 to 700 more troops to help quell
the rising violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo, and the United States
may send in a Marine unit, U.S. and French officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France has decided to dispatch an Army battalion to the city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, in a part of Kosovo controlled by French peacekeepers, French Defense
Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William Cohen, the U.S.
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is simply normal military business to decide ... to make the real
provisions so that we take control of the situation there,'' Richard said.
France already has about 4,500 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We frankly don't anticipate that this is going to be a long-term problem
but rather a flashpoint that has erupted in the last few days or weeks, and
that's the reason we think that a greater show of force and a greater capability
is going to be essential,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marine unit normally has about 2,200 Marines aboard amphibious ships. It
was not immediately clear how many Marines might be called upon if the United
States decided to commit more troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia
from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Army Gen. Wesley Clark and the German general in charge
of the NATO peackeeping operation in Kosovo had requested that France send
another battalion of peacekeepers, numbering 600 to 700. The generals also asked
that two other battalions be put on a higher state of readiness to deploy, in
case it is decided they are needed. The two other battalions, numbering about
1,200 troops, could include American troops.
</P>
<P>
	   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, however, officials said Clark was seeking
a reallocation of NATO peacekeepers already in Kosovo, rather than an increase
in their overall number.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. They reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said reinforcing NATO's peacekeeping operations will complicate
efforts by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to heighten ethnic tensions in
Kosovo in defiance of the June agreement to end NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Milosevic will take advantage of every opportunity he can'' to undermine
NATO's authority and to foment ethnic unrest, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said NATO needs to add to its existing force in order
to show Milosevic that he cannot get away with such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this robust reinforcement, we think we will send the right signal''
to both Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said NATO
intelligence was keeping track of the disposition of the various forces and
cross-border movements, and ensuring that new weapons did not replace the guns
being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned the unrest could expand to areas outside Kosovo, Macedonia has put
part of its armed forces stationed near the joint Kosovo-Serbia border on a
higher alert because of violence and tension in Kosovo, army spokesman Gjorgji
Trendafilov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson have made it clear they
believe the Yugoslav leader is behind the current tensions in Kosovo. Both
pledge to get tough on any party, Serb or ethnic Albanian, that attempts to stir
unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel sides with Amtrak in dispute over federal subsidies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senators from both parties rallied to Amtrak's defense
on Wednesday, strongly endorsing the railway's plan to expand rather than cut
services.
<P>
	   Members of the Senate Commerce Committee's panel on surface transportation
also got a key concession when the chairman of the Amtrak Reform Council, which
monitors Amtrak for Congress, agreed to lower the threshold it set for
determining whether the railway can wean itself from government operating
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   The council released a report in January challenging Amtrak's claim that it
is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year 2002, as
required by Congress. The council questioned Amtrak's contention that some
costs, like equipment depreciation, should not be counted against it because the
government pays for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson told the subcommittee the council was "just
plain wrong" in proposing to factor in those costs, estimated at $567 million,
when projecting the railway's finances through fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone knows that adjusting these measurements effectively dooms our
chance to be self-sufficient," said Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin. "Who
wants to invest in a company that's already doomed?"
</P>
<P>
	   The subcommittee's chairwoman, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
ranking Democrat, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, concurred and urged the
council to adopt the lower standard. Council chairman Gilbert Carmichael said
the panel will do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmichael, sensitive to charges the council has an anti-Amtrak agenda, told
the subcommittee he is "a strong believer in a national rail passenger system"
and came to Congress merely for guidance, not for a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of feel like the messenger. Don't kill me," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing showcased how Amtrak, criticized over the years for needing
billions in government support, has attracted new support by pledging to expand
and improve intercity rail throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urged Amtrak to resurrect service between Portland,
Ore., and Boise, Idaho, which was part of the Chicago-to-Seattle "Pioneer" route
that fell victim to budget cuts in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison urged the railway to consider increasing service on the
Chicago-to-San Antonio "Texas Eagle" route, which now operates just three times
a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., encouraged Amtrak to expand a rail corridor slated
to receive high-speed train service so it includes Birmingham, Ala., to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act imposed the 2002 deadline for
self-sufficiency and created the council to monitor the railway's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   If the panel determines Amtrak will need government operating subsidies
after fiscal 2002 it will submit to Congress a plan for a "restructured and
rationalized national intercity rail passenger system," while Amtrak will offer
a plan for its own "complete liquidation."
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison said she doubts it will come to that.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Congress will be flexible if we see there's a good chance of
operational self-sufficiency," she said.

<HEADLINE> McCain to Bush GOP: Get With It  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- John McCain is inviting George W. Bush's supporters to ``get
with it'' and join him after his latest primary victories, even as he seeks to
convince critics of his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a proud conservative Republican. I am a Reagan Republican. Have no
doubt about that,'' McCain told the Rotary Club here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to convince and tell our Republican Party establishment: It's great
over here,'' he added. ``Come on in. Join us. Join us in this effort to be an
inclusive party. Join us in this effort to reach out.''
</P>
<P>
	   After winning handily in his home state and beating Bush in Michigan, McCain
turned his attention to upcoming battlegrounds on the West Coast. He cast the
nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can win the White
House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have proven -- I
hope to my Republican friends and I believe to most Americans -- that we can
reassemble a coalition'' of bipartisan support in the tradition of President
Reagan, McCain told an overflow crowd at Gonzaga University in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a crusade. Get with it, and you will enjoy the ride,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Washington, a McCain win on Tuesday would only guarantee him 12 of
the state's 37 delegate votes. The rest would be picked by a caucus March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's effort is more about momentum than math, and on Wednesday he
campaigned in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone can come onboard this train because we're leaving the station, my
friends,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   But in epic, pop-culture terms, McCain returned to a metaphor he has used
often to acknowledge he had not won the nomination yet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still Luke Skywalker trying to escape from the Death Star,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is focusing for the next two days on Washington, which votes on
Tuesday, and California, whose residents go to the polls on ``Super Tuesday'' a
week later. The Arizona senator also planned some down time Thursday with a
24-hour rest at his vacation home in Sedona before heading to San Diego on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, his schedule brings him east to Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio on
Saturday, then back to Washington, D.C. through Sunday. No longer planning to
cede Virginia to Bush, McCain planned a town hall meeting in the Washington
suburbs on Monday before swinging through Atlanta on his way back to California.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the odyssey, McCain plans to concentrate on his signature issue,
campaign finance reform, and on such other matters as his intent to use federal
budget surpluses to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate plans to resist being drawn into distracting squabbles with
Bush over whose campaign made which negative calls to voters, one senior aide
said. A day earlier, McCain's aides were caught denying that the campaign was
making such calls to Catholic voters, until confronted with a transcript
provided by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain early Wednesday said he ``had nothing to do'' with those calls, then
defended their accuracy. ``That was an accurate phone call. I didn't call anyone
a bigot,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The days of engaging in distracting yes-no haggling ``are over,'' senior
adviser Mike Murphy said later. ``The reform message is very powerful, combined
with the message of fiscal conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the second time in the same speech, McCain declared his conservatism.
And, without being asked, he explained his sponsorship in 1998 of an
anti-tobacco bill that made him an enemy of many on the right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a strong loyal conservative Republican,'' McCain said. ``There are
times when you have to stand up for what you believe in.''

<HEADLINE> Florio leads Corzine, but must be wary of party leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The political warhorse is holding an early lead
over the rich rookie in the race for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac College poll released Wednesday gives former Gov. Jim Florio a
57 percent to 22 percent lead over former Goldman Sachs chairman Jon Corzine
among those who say they're registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   But poll director Maurice Carroll cautioned that this poll may not reflect
those who will actually show up to vote on Primary Day. He noted that Corzine
has an edge in the behind-the-scenes battle for county party endorsements -
something that translates into votes from party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not bad news for Jim Florio, because it shows he still has a name
and voters know who he is," said Carroll. "For all the money Corzine is
spending, most Democrats still don't have an impression of him. You can't
underestimate the effect of endorsements. The key is who shows up at the polls
in June."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said Florio still causes negative feelings for raising taxes while
governor, but retains a name that's better known than Corzine's. Carroll said
the results showing that more than 80 percent polled have no opinion of Corzine
means he still needs to introduce himself to New Jersey voters. He said there is
ample time for that: New Jersey's primary is June 6.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the benchmark," Carroll said. "Everything works from here."
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic race for Senate pits Florio, a veteran of campaign wars
dating back to the 1960s, against Corzine, who sees politics as a second career
after meteoric success on Wall Street. Florio is known to New Jersey voters,
many who still dislike his gubernatorial tax increases. Corzine's wealth scared
off several Democratic opponents and made an impression on leaders who know
money can greatly aid a "new voice" for the party.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign has not spilled into New Jersey's political spotlight yet. The
Corzine and Florio camps have sniped at each other in fax attacks they share
with the media, and both candidates have staked out policy positions and made
campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   The early campaign sound bites: Corzine's camp says Florio represents a
politics of the past, while Florio's camp portrays the fight as Main Street vs.
Wall Street, charging Corzine with attempting to buy support with well-placed
donations to Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   The current battle is over county Democratic leader endorsements. Florio
locked up seven southern New Jersey counties from his political base, and has
gained support in Warren, Sussex, Morris and Passaic counties. Corzine has
nabbed support in the more populous northern and central New Jersey counties of
Union, Essex, Hudson, Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex. Bergen and Mercer county
leaders will decide which candidate will get their support this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Corzine's campaign says if he gets the Bergen nod, he will have endorsements
representing more than 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats. The
support from county leaders was pivotal to Jim McGreevey's Democratic nomination
for governor in 1997. About 55 percent of the Democrats who responded to the
poll said the party organization support for a candidate is at least "somewhat
important" to their decision on Primary Day.
</P>
<P>
	   With this as a backdrop, both campaigns saw rays of light in the poll
results.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy they've been saying for the last six to eight weeks is unpopular
and unelectable, frankly is quite popular with Democrats and on his way to
victory," said Michael Murphy, the cochairman of the Florio campaign. "We expect
this to narrow, especially if they spend big. We're encouraged but by no means
complacent."
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Goldstein, co-manager of the Corzine campaign, noted that Florio
retains only a 39 percent positive rating within his own party.
</P>
<P>
	   "For someone who has been running, on and off, for 30 years, this is
political anemia," said Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein said Corzine gained 22 percent even though the campaign has not
launched any television commercials. "To us, this is terrific news," Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said he is looking to Republican presidential candidate John McCain's
early success against the highly financed George W. Bush "as proof that
endorsements and money don't control outcomes."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, a gaggle of GOPers would be trailing former
presidential candidate Steve Forbes if he jumped into the race, according to the
poll. About one-third of Republicans chose Forbes, who has not said he will run,
and another third said they were undecided. The announced candidates - state
Sen. William Gormley, U.S. Rep. Robert Franks, Essex County Executive James
Treffinger and former Libertarian gubernatorial contender Murray Sabrin - got
from 4 percent to 10 percent, basically within the poll's margin of error.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll surveyed registered voters from February 16 to February 21. These
included 307 registered Republicans and 374 registered Democrats. The margin of
error for the survey of Democrats is 5.1 percentage points. It is 5.6 percentage
points for the survey of Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Giant blaze in Pinelands auto junkyard challenges firefighters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW GRETNA, N.J. (AP) - A fire broke out in a rural auto junkyard
Wednesday, consuming abandoned cars, loose tires and trees and sending plumes of
thick, gray smoke hundreds of feet into the air.
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 firefighters from three counties and foam-spraying trucks from
the Lakehurst naval base and Atlantic City International Airport were called in
to battle the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-alarm fire broke out about 2:30 p.m. in Cranmer's Auto Recycling
located in this southeastern Burlington County village. It was concentrated in a
400-by-400-foot area, according to Ocean County Fire Coordinator Brian Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
	   No evacuations were necessary. The nearest homes are located about 1 1/2
miles from the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a major mess in there," said firefighter Carl Wescoat of the Nesco
Volunteer Fire Department, who helped fight the fire. "Everything's burning -
cars, tires, woods. There's so many cars stacked on top of each other and it's
hard to get in between them."
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous small explosions rang out as the fire reached cars that still had
gasoline or gas vapors in their tanks, he said. "It's like gunfire going off in
there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was hard to get at the fire because of the stacked cars and the
quarter-mile distance between it and the nearest road, Route 542, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't pick it apart. We're dropping foam on it to try to suffocate the
fire," Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pumpers, ladder trucks and tanker trucks from 40 fire departments in
Atlantic, Burlington and Ocean counties were being used. New Jersey state Forest
Fire Service crews worked the perimeter to make sure the fire did not spread
into adjoining woods in the million-acre Pinelands National Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   At 5:30 p.m., Gabriel predicted it would be hours before the fire could be
brought under control.

<TEXT>
    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - The murder trial of New Milford police officer
Scott Smith began Wednesday with jurors listening to recordings of police calls
made just before and after Smith shot a suspect in the back.
<P>
	   On the recordings, Smith's fellow police officers can be heard trying to
track down Franklyn Reid, 27, and scrambling to mobilize after Smith shot Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was said to be in custody, but less than a minute later, Detective
David Shortt calls for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Robert Cramer testified that he speculated in a call to the police
station that Smith's gun "AD'd," or accidentally discharged, during Reid's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, you know what we've got. We've got a gunshot wound, apparently Smith
AD'd on a take-down," Cramer said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who was brought in as a special
prosecutor, chastised Cramer for speculating and not asking Smith what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "A man is shot by a police officer, and you're guessing what happened?"
Connelly asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't say, 'Hey, Smitty, what happened?"' Connelly asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer responded: "He was upset, and I just wanted to make sure he was OK."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is the first officer in Connecticut history to be prosecuted for
murder for an on-duty shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   He has claimed that he thought Reid was reaching for a weapon when he shot
him at point-blank range on Dec. 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury of seven men and five women was chosen to hear the case. There is one
black man on the jury. Reid was black and Smith is white.
</P>
<P>
	   The families of Reid and Smith both were in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are here to get a fair trial," said Reid's mother, Pearlylyn Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   The police communication tapes reveal that Reid was well-known to police
-officers recognized his name and appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was wanted in New Milford on several warrants, including threatening
and breach of peace, which are misdemeanors, and failure to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time he was shot, he was out on $1,350 cash bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer encountered Reid just after 11 a.m. The officer was driving a cruiser
along a road when Reid came from the other direction, crossing twice into the
oncoming lane and missing the cruiser by about a foot, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer turned around to follow Reid, but when he caught up to Reid's car, he
found it abandoned with the engine running.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer stayed with the car while other officers in the area went to look for
Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   Connelly pointed out that Cramer, who was in charge of the patrol officers
that day, did not call in any additional help until after Reid was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you knew it was Franklyn Reid, did you say, 'Hey, this is Reid out
there. Get more men out there?"' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith and Shortt found Reid shortly after he fled the car, walking along
Route 202. They pulled into a nearby gas station and Reid fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith ran after him, and Shortt followed in an unmarked police car.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer testified that Shortt told him he was calling police headquarters and
was trying to control the car in slippery conditions when he heard a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortt told Cramer he did not see the shooting, but he looked up to see Reid
lying on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   More testimony from police officers on the scene is expected Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Boy Dragged to Death During Carjack  </HEADLINE>
   By MARGARET STAFFORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- As 6-year-old Jake Robel waited in the car while
his mother dashed into a sandwich shop, a thief jumped behind the wheel and
tried to shove the boy outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the shop, someone yelled that Christy Robel's car was being stolen.
She ran outside, pulled open the rear door and frantically tried to free her
son, who was tangled in a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver took off, the door closed and Jake remained entangled and trapped
outside the rear driver's side door. The boy screamed for help and his mother
yelled for the driver to stop. He didn't. It was the last time Robel saw her boy
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Jake D. Robel of Blue Springs died Tuesday before the driver of the
Chevrolet Blazer could be stopped by pursuing motorists. Witnesses said a
five-mile chase reached speeds of 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim L. Davis, 34, of Kansas City, Mo., was charged Wednesday with
second-degree murder, robbery, child abuse and kidnapping. He was jailed without
bail. Bob Beaird, Jackson County prosecutor, said he knew very little about him.
</P>
<P>
	   As the horror unfolded Tuesday, Sharon Irwin was sitting in her car at the
strip mall waiting for her granddaughter's dental appointment to end.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Suddenly, I heard somebody screaming and hollering. I turned my head and
saw this woman screaming and this Blazer driving by. I thought they had got in a
fight and it was a husband or boyfriend driving off,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then I turned my head again and saw he was dragging something. I heard the
woman scream, `That's my baby, that's my son.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin said the Blazer, which Robel had left running while she dashed inside
the sandwich shop, flew out of the parking lot at a high speed.
</P>
<P>
	   During the chase, motorists along Interstate 70 east of Kansas City flashed
their lights and honked horns in an attempt to stop the vehicle. It ended when
motorists in two trucks and a car surrounded the Blazer at a stoplight.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said motorists wrestled the man to the ground and waited for
police to arrive; they also tied the man's legs with a rope.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, Jake lay dead, most of his clothes ripped away. An 11-year-old boy
who emerged from one of the vehicles took a large white blanket and placed it
over him.
</P>
<P>
	   Beaird would not speculate about whether the driver knew the child was being
dragged.
</P>
<P>
	   But Irwin said it is difficult to believe the driver didn't see the boy,
because he was on the driver's side of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that man needs to be dragged himself, just like he dragged that
kid,'' she said. ``He needs to get the death penalty. He killed an innocent
kid.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's family released a statement Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We love him, miss him and will always keep his spirit with us. We want to
take this opportunity to extend thanks and appreciation to the people who ended
this tragedy. We also want to thank friends, neighbors and the community for the
outpouring of offers and sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile a 4-foot cross, a stuffed baby lamb, balloons and flowers stood at
the corner where the chase ended. One of the bouquets held a note that read,
``God Bless You, Jake. From Dad.''

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Torch Bearers'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Theater people love plays about theater people.
</P>
<P>
	   And "The Torch-Bearers," George Kelly's 1922 comedy about the tribulations
of community theater certainly will make them smile, if not exactly chuckle or
laugh out loud. Civilians, though, may scratch their heads at the foolish antics
of folks who want to get up on stage and try to act.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, which opened Wednesday, is being revived by off-Broadway's
enterprising Drama Dept. and is quite an antique. Condensed by director Dylan
Baker from three acts into two, it still feels overlong, despite a story that
doesn't seem to go much of anywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   The slim plot concerns Paula Ritter, a cheerful suburban matron drawn into
an amateur theatrical production directed by the grandest of grand dames, an
imperial woman named Mrs. J. Duro Pampinelli.
</P>
<P>
	   As played by Marian Seldes, Mrs. Pampinelli is a joy. Seldes doesn't just
command this production, she hijacks it, getting every possible laugh out of the
moldy script.
</P>
<P>
	   The actress excels at verbal pyrotechnics. She can coo, cajole, scold,
warble and then nail a laugh line with the skill of a vaudeville comic. Seldes
turns into a physical comedian, too, swirling across the stage to demonstrate to
her band of intrepid amateurs how to make an exit or entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   Faith Prince portrays the eager Paula with a sweetness that makes the
character's subservience to her husband at least explainable if not defensible.
David Garrison, her skeptical husband, is admirably restrained. He sees through
the hokum of these aspiring performers who make up in enthusiasm what they lack
in acting ability.
</P>
<P>
	   As Mrs. Pampinelli's talentless thespians, Don Mayo, Ralph Cole Jr., Judith
Blazer and Paul Mullins, wear their ineptitude bravely. The disasters that
occurred on and off stage are not quite as funny as the characters' desperation
would have you believe. Joan Copeland flutters and flirts effectively as Mrs.
Pampinelli's cohort, and Albert Macklin simpers with style as the woman's abused
underling.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly, who was one of the theater's most popular playwrights in the 1920s,
has fallen into neglect. The Roundabout did a fine production of "The Show-Off,"
his best play, several years ago. "The Torch-Bearers" appears unlikely to revive
his reputation among today's audiences.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Relaxes Food Stamp Rule  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton relaxed rules for food stamp
eligibility Wednesday so that owning a trusty old car -- say, a '95 Ford
Thunderbird about to hit 100,000 miles -- won't keep a poor family from putting
dinner on the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he will scrap an eligibility rule that counted the value of all
but the oldest, and thus least dependable, cars against a family's assets when
their eligibility for food stamps is calculated.
</P>
<P>
	   Under existing rules, if a family has too many assets, it can't get food
stamps, the federal coupons that subsidize grocery bills.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want more people to work, you've got to help them get to work,''
Clinton said. ``The first step is to eliminate the roadblocks that keep them
from getting or keeping a car.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rule change does not require congressional approval. The White House
estimated it would benefit 245,000 people over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action means more families will be eligible for food stamps even
if the values of their cars exceed $4,650, a limit established by Congress 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   So a family won't lose its food stamps if it owns a model such as the 1995
Ford Thunderbird -- with 94,511 miles on it -- that was offered for $6,500 at
the Central Avenue Public Auto Auction in Capitol Heights, Md., just outside the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing costs what it did 20 years ago,'' Clinton said. ``As I prepare to
return to the ranks of ordinary citizen, I find that nothing costs what it did
eight years ago. I can tell you, it's hard to find a reliable car for under
$4,650.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Alexander, 24, a single father from Brockton, N.Y., said the change
means the 1992 Chevrolet Corsica he obtained through a training program won't
hurt his ability to feed his children, Erica, 6, and Christopher, 4. Getting the
car, Alexander said, removed an obstacle to finding a job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the past, I've been able to borrow a car to get to work,'' Alexander
said. ``But even those often were unreliable and broke down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, Clinton issued an order allowing states to use more generous
asset tests in determining food stamp eligibility for people leaving the welfare
rolls. He said Wednesday that there clearly was a need to cover all low-income
working families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that, but for a bump in the road, a lot of others of us could be
in the same fix they're in,'' Clinton said. ``Such people should not be held
back by the absence of transportation, or punished if they have the initiative
and enterprise to buy a car.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would replace the $4,650 limit with an equation that will
enable families with little equity in their cars to qualify for food stamps, no
matter the total value of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   To figure a car's equity, the government will subtract outstanding loans
from the car's fair market value. If the equity value is less than $1,000, the
car would be irrelevant toward determining food stamp eligibility.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: NIH Sent Wrong Medicine  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health mistakenly shipped the
wrong gene-based medicine to a university that administered it to six patients
in a gene therapy experiment, a congressman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Providing the wrong medication to patients is an act of inexcusable
incompetence," Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., wrote the NIH in asking what steps
the government was taking to ensure it never happens again.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgetown University spokesman Paul Donovan said Wednesday that university
researchers did not catch the error and consequently administered the wrong
medicine to six cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   But "all patients were immediately notified and no patient experienced any
adverse effect," Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cancer Institute, the NIH branch that made the error, agreed
that no patients were harmed -- they received an experimental gene-based drug
that would not work for their tumors, but that was being prepared for testing in
patients with other types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no safety issue," said Dr. Michaele Christian, NCI's associate
director of cancer therapy evaluation.
</P>
<P>
	   But because drug mixups have the potential to be very serious, she said she
already has taken steps to prevent future errors.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is the label on these vials of medicine is small and the first
five letters of two drugs' names are identical, setting the stage for an easy
mixup, she explained.
</P>
<P>
	   So NCI is training workers who collect and ship the medicines to doublecheck
the full names, has strengthened the computer system that sorts these drug
orders, and is hunting ways to make the drug labels safer.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman's discovery of the problem came as part of an investigation into how
the NIH oversees gene therapy, in wake of the September death of an Arizona
teen-ager in a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Although people dying of incurable diseases have enrolled in gene therapy
studies that proved unable to save them, 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger is
considered the first person actually killed by experimental gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman claimed Wednesday that NIH's records show no sign the agency
investigated 38 other deaths in two gene therapy experiments. One was a 1996
death in a University of Pennsylvania cystic fibrosis study; the others were
among 38 people with end-stage lung cancer enrolled in a Texas study.
</P>
<P>
	   "This new information ... suggests that NIH's oversight has been
inadequate," Waxman wrote Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, NIH's acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kirschstein responded that the NIH did investigate -- and found the gene
therapy involved to be safe. "These cases were reviewed and appropriately
addressed," she wrote Waxman late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman's questions sparked fury from the Houston biotechnology company that
funded the lung cancer study.
</P>
<P>
	   Those 38 deaths were caused by cancer, not gene therapy, insisted Introgen
Therapeutics vice president Dr. James Merritt, who said a separate government
agency -- the Food and Drug Administration -- investigated each one, agreed the
therapy was safe and consequently has allowed it to be tested in several hundred
additional patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman's office noted that researchers are supposed to report deaths to the
NIH as well as the FDA, so both agencies can investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   Merritt disagreed, saying he only told the NIH about the deaths to help
scientists sort out gene therapy questions in wake of the Gelsinger case.
</P>
<P>
	   "People who are reacting to these reports are unqualified to do so," Merritt
said, adding that "it's sure galling" to be singled out for "diligent research."

<HEADLINE> Jury begin deliberations in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After receiving lengthy instructions Wednesday,
jurors began deliberating the fate of four white police officers charged with
murder in the shooting of Amadou Diallo on his Bronx doorstep.
<P>
	   As expected, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi gave the jury the option of
convicting the officers on the less serious charge of manslaughter, rather than
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also stressed the officers could be acquitted if jurors believe
their claim that they fired 41 bullets at the unarmed black victim because they
were convinced he had a gun and wanted to shoot them. Diallo was reaching for a
wallet in his pocket when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of any crime," said Teresi.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge spent more than three hours carefully going over the legal
instructions for each of 24 criminal counts before deliberations began at about
1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury later asked to hear a transcript of testimony from officers Sean
Carroll and Edward McMellon, and from a civilian eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott.
The readback was expected to continue until late Wednesday night, and the jurors
were to be sequestered.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to confront and shoot Diallo. Elliott,
who lives in Diallo's neighborhood, testified that she heard an officer shout
"Gun!" before shots erupted - proof, the defense says, of the cops' belief that
Diallo was armed.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, Teresi removed one juror - a woman - for talking about
the case outside of court. She was replaced by a male alternate. The jury is now
comprised of four black women, one white woman and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also rejected a request by defense attorney Stephen Worth to bar
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson from the audience. Worth complained it
was unfair to allow Johnson to stay after the judge decided to keep out a
well-known defense supporter - paralyzed New York City police officer Steven
McDonald - because he might prejudice the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 37, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent
to second-degree murder. If convicted of that charge, they face a maximum
sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the lesser charges being considered were second-degree manslaughter
and criminally negligent homicide. They have a minimum penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were members of a roving unit of plainclothes officers that
has come under fire by civil rights activists who claim it stops and frisks
young black men without cause. Diallo's slaying sparked so much pretrial
publicity and protesting that an appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, small protests have erupted outside the courthouse, but civil
rights leaders have appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, during closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Warner stopped short
of accusing the officers of racism. But he repeated claims they accosted Diallo
in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning
or justification before unleashing 41 bullets. The 22-year-old West African
immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor accused the defendants of jumping to false conclusions and of
failing to back off despite signs Diallo was a "decent man" who lived on a
quiet, working-class street.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said Carroll had no reason to stop Diallo on a "hunch" that he might
be a wanted rapist or robber.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting "wasn't a mistake," said Warner, holding the wallet up for the
jury. "It was a terrible series of conscious decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   In sometimes tearful testimony, the officers claimed Diallo sealed his own
fate by ignoring their repeated orders to halt and pulling a black object in a
threatening manner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want to die," McMellon testified.
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon and Carroll both fired 16 shots. Boss shot five times and Murphy
four while backing up their partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi told jurors they could find that the officers were justified in
responding with deadly force if they "reasonably believed" that they needed to
defend themselves against a threat, or that they were arresting an armed bandit.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should figuratively put yourselves in the shoes of each defendant and
consider how the situation appeared to him," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also reminded jurors that the law allows police officers to stop and
question someone if wrongdoing is suspected.

<HEADLINE> Web Used Negative Campaigning  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rolling the Internet into an increasingly negative
presidential campaign, Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore each have crafted Web
sites criticizing the other. Bradley is airing radio ads urging voters to check
out his ``More About Gore'' cyber slam.
</P>
<P>
	   The new sites are the latest attack tactics being employed by both Democrats
and Republicans as the campaign spreads across the country after a month of
focus on just a few early primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, the telephone is the weapon of choice: Sen. John
McCain paid for calls branding George W. Bush anti-Catholic, while McCain has
endured a phone campaign in Michigan, and now in Virginia, suggesting one of his
top supporters is ``a vicious bigot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican race has tightened to one of the closest in memory, and each
side is looking for an edge. With a bigger gap on the Democratic side, Gore is
looking for a knockout punch while Bradley tries to shake up the race.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are higher with more than a dozen states up for grabs in the next
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a boxing match and people are responding instantly to the jabs
and posture of the opponent,'' said W. Russell Newman, who is monitoring the
campaign at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowhere is the increasingly bitter tone more apparent than on the Web, where
candidate sites until this week had been mostly positive, featuring baby
pictures, policy papers and video clips from the road.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Gore unveiled his negative site -- ``the Bradley Information
Bureau'' -- located at www.algore2000.com. On Wednesday, Bradley put up
www.moreaboutgore.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley site features an unflattering picture of Gore and asks in large
letters: ``Who is the real Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a conservative congressman, Al Gore was anti-choice, pro-gun,
pro-tobacco and indifferent to education and health care,'' the site says on its
opening page, echoing a theme Bradley began sounding on the stump this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A radio ad now airing in Washington state, a prime Bradley target, hits the
same the message. ``When it comes right down to it, what does Al Gore really
stand for?'' an announcer asks, suggesting that listeners check out the new Web
site ``to see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
	   By tying the two mediums together, the campaign hopes voters will get more
negative information about Gore than they could from a single ad. ``You simply
can't provide all that information in a 60-second radio ad,'' Bradley
spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the New Jersey senator trailing across the country, the Gore camp
dismisses the Bradley effort as desperate and unveiled a new radio ad of its own
for Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley promised to run a positive campaign. But now, trailing in the
polls, Bill Bradley is running attack ads,'' says an announcer in the Gore spot.
``Attack ads, negative campaigning -- Bill Bradley sounds more like a Republican
every day.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, thousands of phone calls blanketed Michigan and,
according to McCain, have now arrived in Virginia, where voters go to the polls
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, a Bush supporter, recorded a phone call
accusing a top McCain official of being ``a vicious bigot'' who called
conservative Christians ``anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be
censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the calls, Robertson criticizes McCain for refusing to repudiate the
statements by the official, former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says he has had nothing to do with the calls.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, the Texas governor is fuming over calls made by the McCain
camp in Michigan that suggested Bush was anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's spokesman initially denied campaign responsibility for the calls,
which were targeted to Catholic voters, but acknowledged it late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The calls told voters: ``Governor George Bush has campaigned against Senator
John McCain by seeking the support of Southern fundamentalists who have
expressed anti-Catholic views,'' according to a script provided by Bush's camp.
The call then noted that Bush spoke at Bob Jones University in South Carolina
and the caller said: ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements,
including calling the pope the antichrist and the Catholic Church a satanic
cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a campaign stop Tuesday night, Bush had a Catholic priest standing
behind him. And on Wednesday, Bush went after McCain's campaign for first
denying the calls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't accept that kind of campaigning and I don't appreciate it one
bit,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain responded, ``That was an accurate phone call. I didn't call anyone a
bigot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign was hoping to capitalize, preparing TV ads criticizing
McCain's ``Washington-style'' attacks, a campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   The negativity can backfire. In South Carolina, where McCain pulled an ad
comparing Bush to President Clinton, many voters found the attack unfair. In
Michigan, where McCain ran no attack ads, more voters found Bush to be unfair.

<HEADLINE> FBI Joins LAPD Probe  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI entered the city's ongoing police corruption
investigation Wednesday at the request of Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty officers have been suspended and 40 criminal convictions have been
reversed since a former anti-gang officer accused of stealing cocaine from an
evidence locker began regaling prosecutors with tales of fellow officers framing
innocent people, lying in court and attacking suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is looking into as many as
3,000 criminal convictions that may have been tainted by police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Six FBI agents will work with police and the district attorney to
investigate the allegations and decide whether to seek state or federal
prosecutions, U.S. Attorney Alejandro Majorkas said .
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no greater trust than what we give to our police, the right to
take away a person's freedom,'' said James V. DeSarno Jr., the FBI's assistant
director in charge of the Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came amid calls for an independent investigation. The City
Council on Tuesday delayed a decision on an independent investigation by asking
a committee to further review it.
</P>
<P>
	   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced Wednesday that he has
ordered an expanded review of the police investigation. A team of state
prosecutors and special agents will monitor and review the methods and findings
of the police and district attorney investigations, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The LAPD has submitted three corruption cases to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office, but so far none of the officers has been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing 9,500
officers, said in a statement Wednesday that it supports ``a fair and objective
review and investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is unfair that 20 police officers have been relieved of duty and tried
and convicted in the media without a single indictment,'' the union said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Stirs Outrage  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Drawing outrage from his own colleagues, Israel's foreign
minister on Wednesday described an avenging Lebanon policy, saying all acts of
violence would be repaid in kind: ``Blood for blood, soul for soul, child for
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave his strongest suggestion yet that
Israel would withdrawal from south Lebanon by this summer with or without
agreement from Syria, the main power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister David Levy told Parliament the knowledge that Israel would
meet any attacks in kind has prevented the militant Islamic Hezbollah guerrilla
army from expanding a recent escalation of violence beyond engaging Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a warning signal ... and this warning prevents disaster,'' he
said, red-faced and wagging his finger at Arab legislators who expressed outrage
at his inclusion of children as legitimate targets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Kiryat Shemona burns, the ground of Lebanon will burn,'' Levy said,
referring to an Israeli border town targeted by guerrilla rockets in the past,
but which has escaped attack in the latest round of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to withdraw from Lebanon by July, but has repeatedly said
he prefers to do so as part of a peace agreement with Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments to a group of Jewish war veterans Wednesday night came closer
than ever to saying that Israel would be ready for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulling back without an agreement would likely be bloody and show surrender
-- but it would also deprive the Syrians of their main bargaining chip with
Israel: the prospect of bringing peace to its last war front.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even without an agreement the government of Israel will know how to act,
and we are determined to redeploy by July to the international borders,'' Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with Syria collapsed last month over the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has used Levy in the ``bad cop'' role in the past, allowing him to
pummel Israel's Arab peace partners with warnings that Israel does not need
their agreement to thrive -- while Barak himself issues soothing calls for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   But the foreign minister's outburst on the Knesset podium on Wednesday
shocked even his Cabinet colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not appropriate to the character and aims of this government,''
said Education Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
	   Within days of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks breaking down, the Hezbollah
was intensifying its attacks on Israeli troops who occupy a buffer zone in south
Lebanon to protect Israel's northern villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Within three weeks, seven Israeli soldiers were dead, and Israel hit
Lebanese infrastructure targets in intensive airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Arab legislators, prompted by Levy's remarks to leave the plenum, said the
language was unprecedented for a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Levy said today explicitly, that under certain circumstances, under
certain conditions, the State of Israel will knowingly murder Lebanese
children,'' Ahmed Tibi told Israel television. That, Tibi said, was a ``moral
lapse.''

<HEADLINE> Smurfit-Stone Buys Packaging Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. has agreed to purchase St.
Laurent Paperboard, Inc. for $1.03 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal calls for Smurfit-Stone, one of the world's largest manufacturers
of paperboard and paper-based packaging products, to pay $625 million in cash,
$400 million in stock, said Timothy McKenna, a Smurfit-Stone vice president. The
company also will assume $400 million of St. Laurent's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Laurent's paperboard operations include four containerboard mills and 16
packaging plants. McKenna said the acquisition will expand Smurfit-Stone's
ability to produce specialty packaging and increase its containerboard capacity
from 5 million tons to 6.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
	   Combining the Montreal-based St. Laurent with the Chicago-based
Smurfit-Stone will generate approximately $50 million a year in cost savings,
Raymond M. Curran, Smurfit-Stone's president and chief executive officer, said
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   McKenna said while the acquisition will result in some jobs being
eliminated, he said it was too soon to say how many.
</P>
<P>
	   Smurfit-Stone was created in 1998 with the merger of Jefferson Smurfit Corp.
and Stone Container Corp. The 35,000-employee company operates about 300
facilities around the world. Last year, sales were $7.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Laurent is a six-year-old company with more than 4,500 employees. Last
year, it had sales of $916 million. The company also owns 920,000 acres of
forest land in Quebec and solid wood products operations.

<HEADLINE> Senate president calls for comprehensive study of health care ills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's health care system needs a thorough
review to battle escalating drug prices, unavailable health insurance, stingy
managed care companies, failing hospitals and a host of other ills, Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco said Wednesday.
<P>
	   "New Jersey's health care system is in need of emergency treatment, and this
Legislature must intervene," DiFrancesco told the Senate Health Committee, which
held the first of a series of hearings on the state of health care.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate president asked the committee for a comprehensive review, and
also directed lawmakers to hold off pursuing any piecemeal solutions until a
full report is ready in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's hearing concentrated on insurance issues. Future hearings will
deal with the condition of hospitals, concerns of doctors and other health care
providers, and the quality of health care for minorities, elderly residents and
children.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco asked the committee to explore encouraging more private self
insurance plans, promoting greater variety in health benefit plans and expanding
the use of medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate president also asked the committee to consider whether patients
ought to be given the right to sue health maintenance organizations, and whether
the state ought to more tightly regulate financially ailing HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco noted that New Jersey hospitals are also suffering. They have a
higher level of debt and a lower level of cash than the national average, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasing historically low Medicaid reimbursement rates could be a boon to
hospitals, and doctors too, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While DiFrancesco said he warned lawmakers to resist pursuing legislation
while the review is ongoing, he announced he is backing one new bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsored by Sen. Martha Bark, R-Burlington, it would give physicians the
power to join together and negotiate provider reimbursement rates with an
insurer that has market dominance in a geographic area.
</P>
<P>
	   But an insurance company executive pooh-poohed the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to be part of an industry that creates a cartel," said Dennis
Marco, vice president of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. He complained that
Bark's bill would violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco also said improving the quality and controlling the cost of care
for senior citizens is a high priority. Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey,
a health committee member, said spiraling drug prices hurt elderly residents on
fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco, who is considering a run for governor next year, said he called
for the special legislative review after hearing months of complaints from
health care consumers, insurers and providers.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that the task will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a huge undertaking complicated by the simple fact that public policy
and health care are contradictory in their objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Practitioners seek to provide care that is in the best interests of the
individual patient regardless of cost, while managed care seeks to contain
cost."

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Lavish State Dinner  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton took a breather from the
hurly-burly of New York politics to serve grilled rack of lamb and California
pinot noir to the king and queen of Spain at a sparkling White House state
dinner Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The lavish affair for 170 guests, featuring a performance by tenor Placido
Domingo, topped off the first lady's first official day back at work in the
executive mansion since launching her political campaign in New York on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton has always taken an active role in the planning for state
dinners, and despite her busy schedule in New York she was able to be involved
in all aspects of the usual preparations for the Spain dinner,'' said
spokeswoman Toby Graff.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton and the first lady greeted King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday morning in an official
ceremony punctuated by reminders of the threat terrorism poses to freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The king condemned a car bombing that killed two people in the Basque
capital of Vitoria, accusing Basque separatists blamed for the attack of trying
to ``impose their totalitarian ideas by force'' at the expense of human life.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Juan Carlos for his ``stand against the forces of terror and
the enemies of freedom,'' particularly for his stand against an armed militia
that stormed the Spanish parliament in a coup attempt on Feb. 23, 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many feared Spain's two-year experiment with democracy was over,'' Clinton
said. ``But when angry generals urged King Juan Carlos to join their rebellion,
he replied defiantly, 'Your coup will proceed over my dead body.'
</P>
<P>
	   ``Freedom was secure in Spain,'' Clinton continued. ``When the task of
building an undivided, democratic, peaceful Europe is completed, all friends of
freedom will owe a very great debt to Juan Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
	   The king and queen returned to the White House later Wednesday for dinner.
Guests were seated around 17 tables in the State Dining Room and the Red Room
that were bedecked with white orchids, Virginia roses and slender tapers in
golden candelabras.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those invited were actors Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and
Whoopie Goldberg, several lawmakers and administration officials and Vice
President Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who studied in Spain, and her
husband, Dr. Andrew Schiff.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rigors of campaigning, Mrs. Clinton was at the White House to
choose the place settings and set the menu, which included for dessert a topiary
of white chocolate styled like a crate filled with sherbet oranges, lemons and
limes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton chose the Eisenhower china, white with wide rims of gold, to
accompany champagne-colored brocade tablecloths. The menu featured the sort of
full-flavored dishes best appreciated on a chilly night: lobster and maine
shrimp served with risotto and chorizo; grilled rack of lamb with blood orange
and rosemary sauce.
</P>
<P>
	   The wine served with the main course was a robust pinot noir from the Artesa
vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif.; with dessert the royals were treated to a
Gloria Ferrer ``Royal Cuvee'' brut, which was developed in honor of their visit
to Napa Valley in 1983.

<HEADLINE> 9 Inmates Shot, One Killed in Riot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot nine inmates, killing one, to quell
a race riot Wednesday at a prison that houses some of California's most
dangerous criminals, a prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons began fighting in
a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State prison, Lt. Ben Grundy
said. The violence ended a half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas
and pepper spray, opened fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy did not know what sparked the violence, although he noted, ``We've
had racial incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum-security prison was built for 2,280 inmates but has 3,400. About
1,200 are in permanent lockdown conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight prisoners wounded by guards were taken to hospitals, and one was
in critical condition, said Grundy, who would not give details on the others'
conditions. KIEM-TV reported that 19 inmates suffered injuries related to the
melee, such as stabbings and beatings. No guards were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of forest land 20
miles south of the Oregon state line. Many inmates are sent there when they are
involved in violence at other California prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were able to put down another riot at Pelican Bay last August by
firing tear gas and rubber bullets. A guard suffered a fractured cheekbone, but
no inmates were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparently unrelated case, two former guards are charged with
violating the civil rights of Pelican Bay inmates. A federal grand jury
indictment made public Wednesday accuses E. Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia
of conspiring to arrange assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is already serving a state prison sentence on similar charges.
Another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, was convicted of civil rights
charges Feb. 14 for shooting a prisoner after a fight in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Superior Court Judge on hot seat for reappointment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The family of a homicide victim told a
legislative committee Wednesday that Judge David Fineberg's handling of a 1995
murder trial should prevent him from being reappointed to the bench.
<P>
	   Fineberg presided over the trial of John Tyler Fuessenich, who was found
innocent of murder after he admitted killing James Irwin Jr. and dumping his
body off a back road in Morris. Fuessenich, who said the killing was in
self-defense, was tried twice on the murder charge. The first trial ended in
1992 with a deadlocked jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg's critics say the judge displayed a dislike for the prosecutor, Guy
Wolfe III, and the victim's family. They said his demeanor tainted the jury, and
they blasted the judge for setting up a rope in the courtroom that separated the
family from Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judiciary Committee was expected to decide Friday whether to recommend
Fineberg for reappointment to a second, 2-year term. If they do, it will be up
to the General Assembly to keep Fineberg on the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin's mother, Rosaria Irwin, told members of the Judiciary Committee that
she was ordered by Fineberg not to cry during the trial. Her daughter, Kathleen
O'Toole, said Fineberg did not allow her to sit in the courtroom during
testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin and O'Toole said Fineberg threatened to dismiss the case if family
members spoke to the media during the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout the trial, Judge Fineberg displayed overt hostility toward
myself, my family and the prosecutor," Irwin said. "I feel that the people of
the state of Connecticut need to be protected from individuals such as Judge
Fineberg. In my eyes, the way in which he conducts his trials, exhibiting total
disregard for the law, makes him no different than the people he tried."
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg presided over the Fuessenich case as a Litchfield Superior Court
judge. He currently sits in Hartford Superior Court and hears civil cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, he was admonished by the state Judicial Review Council for
threatening Wolfe with contempt of court in front of a jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council concluded Fineberg's comment was "an unfavorable judicial
practice."
</P>
<P>
	   Such an admonishment is the least serious action the Council can take
against a judge. State law permits admonishment when there is no legal basis for
removal, suspension, or censure.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake which I regret, and I assure all of you it will not happen
again," Fineberg said about his threats to Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg said he wanted the victim's mother and sister out of the courtroom
because they were potential witnesses. He said they may have heard testimony
that would have influenced their own. They were never called to testify, and
Irwin's mother was allowed to observe the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg explained he had the rope strung up to keep a sense of calm in his
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was doing right, but it probably left the wrong message with
the family," Fineberg said. "I regret doing it, and I apologize for doing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Glenn Coe, who investigated Fineberg's handling of the Fuessenich
trial for the state Judge's Association, said the judge never threatened to
dismiss the case if family members spoke to the press.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I did read in the transcripts was vigorous advocacy by experienced
counsel, a judge open to considering and reconsidering the arguments of counsel,
a judge who carefully read cases ... and a judge who treated the attorneys with
courtesy and respect," Coe said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fineberg is not reappointed, the 68-year-old judge will lose his $106,558
annual salary and the $70,000-a-year state pension he would start receiving in
two years. Judges are required by law to retire at age 70.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court rejects using crime 'profiler' to pinpoint killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
prosecutors cannot use experts in the ritual behavior of criminals to provide
evidence that identifies a suspect.
<P>
	   The court touched on a subject that has drawn interest in the world of crime
fiction, with behavioral experts known in TV parlance as "profilers" appearing
in movies, novels and television series.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where analysts devise psychological
portraits of repeat offenders, was featured prominently in the 1991 film that
started it all, "Silence of the Lambs."
</P>
<P>
	   But Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern, speaking for an unanimous court, said
Hollywood and the Behavioral Science Unit shall not intrude into the New Jersey
courtrooms in the guise of scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled that retired FBI agent Robert Hazelwood, who spent 16 years
as a behavioral sciences analyst, could not be relied on for primary evidence to
connect a Maine rape convict, Steven Fortin, with a rape-murder in Woodbridge in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Hazelwood has written a book on serial killers and is currently employed by
the Academy Group, a collection of retired FBI and Secret Service agents
specializing as crime consultants.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Hern said Hazelwood could be used to help jurors understand any
similarities in the Maine and New Jersey crimes, but his testimony could not be
used as a basis to identify Fortin as the Woodbridge killer.
</P>
<P>
	   However, O'Hern did rule that information about the Maine attack, which
occurred against a female state trooper, could be used in Fortin's trial as a
means to identify him as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   On this point, one of the court's newest appointees, Associate Justice
Virginia Long, dissented, saying any mention of the Maine case would make a fair
trial impossible in a case in which Middlesex County authorities intend to seek
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Long's lone dissent showed for the first time her willingness to move away
from her colleagues on criminal trial issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Fortin pleaded guilty to a savage sex attack in 1995 of a Maine trooper who
had stopped to assist him along a highway. Fortin overpowered the trooper, broke
her nose, strangled her to semiconsciousness with his hands, tore off her pants
but left her blouse on, raped her and bit her hard enough on the left cheek and
left breast to leave teeth wounds. She suffered vaginal and anal injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The trooper, Vicki Gardner, had already called for backup, and Fortin was
captured after a chase in which he stole and crashed the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
	   The details of the case set off alarms with Woodbridge police, who were
investigating a 1994 incident in the Avenel section in which Melissa Padilla was
attacked by a man who tore off her clothes in the same manner as the Gardner
attack and left her with exactly the same injuries and bite marks.
</P>
<P>
	   When authorities learned that Fortin had lived in Avenel at the time of the
Padilla attack, he was indicted and Hazelwood was brought in to testify that,
based on 35 years experience on 7,000 cases, he had never seen two rape-assaults
with these parallels.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hazelwood determined that the likelihood of different offenders committing
two such extremely unique crimes was highly improbable," O'Hern wrote. But he
said the link "lacked sufficient scientific reliability to establish that the
same perpetrator committed the Maine and New Jersey crimes."
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the famous cases of the Atlanta child murders and the Boston
Strangler, O'Hern said, "The history of success in profiling serial killers is
uneven." On these points Long agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   But O'Hern for a six-member majority went further and said the evidence from
the Maine assault could be used to identify Fortin as Padilla's assailant.
O'Hern said the judge must give a careful warning to the jury that they could
not allow the information about the Gardner attack to color their assessment of
Fortin's guilt or innocence for the Padilla murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Long in her dissent said this was impossible. "It is inconceivable to me
that a jury will be able to render an honest verdict as to whether Fortin killed
Melissa Padilla," Long wrote. "That is not because the jurors are not sober and
conscientious, but because they are human and, realistically, will be unable to
abide by a limiting instruction."
</P>
<P>
	   Long also protested O'Hern's decision to permit Hazelwood to provide
testimony on how the two crimes have similarities. She said the common elements
of the two rapes are not all that unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a case where two crimes were committed wearing medieval
knight's helmets or masks of dead presidents," Long wrote. "There is nothing
obvious about this case."
</P>
<P>
	   Public defender Matthew Astore said it was incredible that the court would
permit the information about the Maine crime to be used.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to hear that he is a bad guy," Astore said. "Can a jury
possibly find him not guilty after hearing about that crime from Maine?"
</P>
<P>
	   Astore said Hazelwood's testimony is irrelevant because of a striking
difference separating the two crimes: Padilla is dead, Gardner is alive.
</P>
<P>
	   "A jury hears that kind of stuff (about profiling) and thinks, that must be
right. It's not right. They are wrong as often as they are correct," Astore
said.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Jury Begins Deliberations  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The jury began deliberating Wednesday in the case of
four white policemen charged with killing an unarmed black man, after the judge
said the jurors could acquit if they believed the officers acted in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers claim they fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo because they
thought he had a gun and was threatening them. Justice Joseph Teresi told the
jury, ``A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of any crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The judge spent more than three hours going over the legal instructions for
each of 24 criminal counts before deliberations began. The jurors were to be
sequestered if they could not finish deliberating Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi gave the jurors the option of considering charges other than murder,
and told them the law allows police officers to stop and question someone if
wrongdoing is suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should figuratively put yourselves in the shoes of each defendant and
consider how the situation appeared to him,'' the judge said. ``You should
consider what Amadou Diallo did before or during the encounter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Teresi replaced a female juror for talking about the case outside
of court. The jury is now composed of four black women, one white woman and
seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy,
27, each have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. They face a maximum
prison sentence of 25 years to life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Lesser charges being considered include second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide, which could result in a sentence of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were members of a roving unit of New York City plainclothes
officers that has been accused of stopping and frisking young black men without
cause. Diallo's slaying sparked such intense publicity and so many protests that
the case was moved to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Diallo, 22, was accosted in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning or justification. He
was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims Diallo ignored the officers' repeated orders to halt and
pulled out a black object in a threatening manner. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   During deliberations, the jury asked to hear a transcript of testimony from
Carroll and McMellon, and from an eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to confront and shoot Diallo. Elliott,
who lives in Diallo's neighborhood, testified that she heard a policeman shout
``Gun!'' before shots erupted -- proof, the defense said, of the officers'
belief that Diallo was armed.

<HEADLINE> McCain to Bush GOP: Get With It  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- John McCain is inviting George W. Bush's supporters to ``get
with it'' and join him after his latest primary victories, even as he seeks to
convince critics of his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a proud conservative Republican. I am a Reagan Republican. Have no
doubt about that,'' McCain told the Rotary Club here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to convince and tell our Republican Party establishment: It's great
over here,'' he added. ``Come on in. Join us. Join us in this effort to be an
inclusive party. Join us in this effort to reach out.''
</P>
<P>
	   After winning handily in his home state and beating Bush in Michigan, McCain
turned his attention to upcoming battlegrounds on the West Coast. He cast the
nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can win the White
House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have proven -- I
hope to my Republican friends and I believe to most Americans -- that we can
reassemble a coalition'' of bipartisan support in the tradition of President
Reagan, McCain told an overflow crowd at Gonzaga University in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a crusade. Get with it, and you will enjoy the ride,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Washington, a McCain win on Tuesday would only guarantee him 12 of
the state's 37 delegate votes. The rest would be picked by a caucus March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's effort is more about momentum than math, and on Wednesday he
campaigned in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone can come onboard this train because we're leaving the station, my
friends,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   But in epic, pop-culture terms, McCain returned to a metaphor he has used
often to acknowledge he had not won the nomination yet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still Luke Skywalker trying to escape from the Death Star,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is focusing for the next two days on Washington, which votes on
Tuesday, and California, whose residents go to the polls on ``Super Tuesday'' a
week later. The Arizona senator also planned some down time Thursday with a
24-hour rest at his vacation home in Sedona before heading to San Diego on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been going nonstop for weeks and the senator wanted to take a day to
spend a day with his family and take a little rest,'' said Howard Opinsky,
McCain's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, his schedule brings him east to Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, on
Saturday, then back to Washington, D.C., through Sunday. No longer planning to
cede Virginia to Bush, McCain planned a town hall meeting in the Washington
suburbs on Monday before swinging through Atlanta on his way back to California.
</P>
<P>
	   In California on Wednesday, Gov. Gray Davis rebuked McCain for describing
his Vietnam war captors as ``gooks.'' McCain apologized Monday for using the
term. But at the same time, Davis warned critics of McCain to ``just mentally
put themselves in his place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the odyssey, McCain plans to concentrate on his signature issue,
campaign finance reform, and on such other matters as his intent to use federal
budget surpluses to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate plans to resist being drawn into distracting squabbles with
Bush over whose campaign made which negative calls to voters, one senior aide
said. A day earlier, McCain's aides were caught denying that the campaign was
making such calls to Catholic voters, until confronted with a transcript
provided by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain early Wednesday said he ``had nothing to do'' with those calls, then
defended their accuracy. ``That was an accurate phone call. I didn't call anyone
a bigot,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The days of engaging in distracting yes-no haggling ``are over,'' senior
adviser Mike Murphy said later. ``The reform message is very powerful, combined
with the message of fiscal conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the second time in the same speech, McCain declared his conservatism.
And, without being asked, he explained his sponsorship in 1998 of an
anti-tobacco bill that made him an enemy of many on the right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a strong loyal conservative Republican,'' McCain said. ``There are
times when you have to stand up for what you believe in.''

<HEADLINE> Sean 'Puffy' Combs and bodyguard indicted on bribery charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Rap impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, already facing gun
possession charges in connection to a nightclub shooting, was indicted Wednesday
along with his bodyguard on charges of bribing a witness.
<P>
	   Combs and Anthony "Wolf" Jones were indicted for offering Combs' driver
$50,000 and a diamond ring to say he owned a gun police recovered from the car
the three were riding in along with singer/actress Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Combs offered the ring -
a birthday present from Lopez - as a bribe to Wardel Fenderson, 41, sometime
between Dec. 27 to Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Combs and Lopez were up for Grammy Awards to be presented Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am outraged by this new charge," Combs said in a statement. "I am not
guilty. From the outset I have firmly believed that the Manhattan district
attorney's office has unfairly targeted me for baseless charges."
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' attorney, Benjamin Brafman, also denied the charges against his
client.
</P>
<P>
	   "Charging Mr. Combs with bribing a witness will ultimately prove to be a
terrible abuse of prosecutorial discretion," Brafman said. "Mr. Combs did not
bribe or attempt to bribe any witness. He is not guilty of this crime, just as
he is not guilty of the weapons charges that were filed earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   Brafman, referring to the Grammy awards show, called the timing of the
indictment "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
	   "If this indictment was in fact timed to embarrass Mr. Combs on the evening
of the Grammy awards, I would be terribly disappointed in the Manhattan district
attorney," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, Fenderson and Jones were arrested early Dec. 27 after one of Combs'
proteges allegedly shot three people inside Club New York. The gunman, Jamal
"Shyne" Barrow, 19, was arrested separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the shooting stemmed from an argument in which an
unidentified man threw money in Combs' face. Both Combs and Barrow are accused
of pulling guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapon Combs allegedly wanted Fenderson to claim as his own was an
illegal 9 mm automatic - loaded - that police found on the floor of a 1999
Lincoln Navigator owned by Combs' record company, Bad Boy Entertainment.
Fenderson was driving.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped the pricey sports utility vehicle around 3 a.m. as it raced
through a red lights about 10 blocks from the club. Combs, Lopez, Fenderson and
Jones were in the Lincoln. Barrow was arrested at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was arraigned on weapons charges earlier this month. The bribery
charge carries a penalty of seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow was indicted on three counts of attempted murder in connection with
shooting Robert Thompson of Danbury, Conn.; Julius Jones, 27, and Natanya Ruben,
29, both of Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Man Said Admits Killing Sheppard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Richard Eberling, the man Sam Reese Sheppard believes
killed his mother in 1954, confessed to the slaying in a late-night
conversation, a woman who once worked with Eberling testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard is suing the state of Ohio claiming his late father, Dr. Sam
Sheppard, was wrongfully imprisoned for the beating death of Marilyn Sheppard in
the couple's home.
</P>
<P>
	   The highly publicized case partly inspired ``The Fugitive'' television
series and movie.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Kathie Collins Dyal testified that Eberling confessed to
Marilyn Sheppard's murder in 1983, when she was a home health care worker for an
elderly widow. Eberling hired her for the job and later fired her.
</P>
<P>
	   Eberling later was convicted of killing the widow and died in prison while
serving a life sentence for her slaying. He never confessed to having any role
in Marilyn Sheppard's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sheppard, convicted of murder, spent a decade in prison before the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the verdict. He was acquitted at retrial and died four
years later.
</P>
<P>
	   He had claimed that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife and knocked him
unconscious when he heard her cries and ran to help her.
</P>
<P>
	   Eberling worked as a window washer for the Sheppards in 1954 and got to know
the widow, Ethel May Durkin, years later.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyal testified that Eberling asked her one night while they were discussing
a Vietnam War movie if she had ever seen someone die. He then told her he killed
Mrs. Sheppard, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that he had killed her and that he hit her husband on the head
with a pail,'' Dyal said. She said Eberling told him that Mrs. Sheppard ``bit
the hell out of him'' and that ``somebody else paid the bill'' for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Ronald Suster questioned jurors
individually Wednesday but didn't remove any following local news reports about
a statement Prosecutor William Mason made regarding failed settlement talks in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason told reporters that Sheppard recently asked for $3.2 million as part
of a proposed settlement. Prosecutors refused the offer. Suster chastised Mason
on Tuesday for releasing the figure.

<HEADLINE> Council Nears Congo Agreement  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council closed in on an agreement
Wednesday on a U.S.-sponsored resolution to send military observers to Congo to
monitor a shaky cease-fire, and the United States said it hoped for a vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very close,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said. ``I'm hopeful
that we'll wrap this up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States had been pushing for the council to approve the mission
Wednesday to send a message to a summit of leaders from six African nations and
rebel groups involved in the 1 1/2-year war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   But the one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia ended before the council meeting
even started.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, the 500 U.N. observers, supported by 5,037 security
and logistics personnel, would verify the separation and redeployment of
opposing troops in Congo and lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a
much larger U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued in Lusaka on Wednesday by two rebel groups and the six
nations with troops in the vast central African nation urged the United Nations
to ``move speedily'' to deploy a peacekeeping force with a mandate to disarm
opposing troops.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resolution being debated by the Security Council gives no timetable
for even considering a peacekeeping force, and it does not authorize the U.N.
observers to forcibly disarm the fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   It states that Secretary-General Kofi Annan should make recommendations to
the council for further deployments ``on the basis of concrete and observed
military and political progress on the implementation of the cease-fire
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three rebel groups that launched an insurrection in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, as well as their backers Rwanda and Uganda,
signed the cease-fire agreement in Lusaka last summer. So did Kabila and his
supporters, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though the six nations reaffirmed their support for the Lusaka
accord last month directly to the Security Council, intermittent fighting has
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Wednesday's summit statement from Lusaka was helpful in
clearing up some of the remaining issues in the text.
</P>
<P>
	   A key issue still being debated is a call for implementation of sanctions
authorized in previous resolutions on Rwanda that cover the Hutu militiamen who
helped carry out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and now back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States supports inclusion of the reference to these sanctions,
but diplomats said the 11-nation Southern African Development Community wants it
dropped because the resolution deals with Congo -- not Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Czar: Colombia Suffering Ignored  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, in the
world's leading cocaine-producing nation to promote a huge U.S. aid package,
said Wednesday that Colombia's suffering has been ignored for too long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attention of the world has been carefully fixed on Kosovo and
Bosnia,'' he told a news conference after meeting with President Andres
Pastrana. ``Here we are three hours flight from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey's visit to the South American country comes as Congress debates
the Clinton administration's proposed $1.6 billion counternarcotics package for
Colombia and its Andean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   While dropping in Bolivia and Peru in recent years, cocaine and heroin
production have soared in Colombia as leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary
groups protect the trade in return for huge payoffs from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Poor Colombia is facing as many as 25,000 heavily armed (members of)
narco-terrorist organizations,'' McCaffrey said, using the combined figure for
rebel and paramilitary fighters. ``This is a special challenge.''
</P>
<P>
	   New CIA estimates show a 20 percent increase in cocaine production and a 23
percent rise in heroin production in Colombia last year. U.S. officials say the
South American country now supplies 90 percent of the world's cocaine and the
majority of the heroin sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of funds in the proposed U.S. aid package would finance a
Colombian military push into southern regions where drug crops are expanding
most rapidly under guerrilla protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups and some liberal lawmakers say stepped up U.S. military
aid and training could undermine peace talks with leftist rebels and draw the
United States into decades-old conflict that has claimed more than 35,000 lives,
most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report issued Wednesday, the U.S.-based organization Human Rights Watch
presented new charges of army links to the paramilitary groups who routinely
kill villagers they suspect to be rebel collaborators.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing still-confidential investigations by prosecutors, the rights group
charged the army set up a new paramilitary squad last year and that three major
brigades have ongoing ties to right-wing death squads.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey, a retired general and highly decorated Vietnam war hero, said
complaints against the military have ``dwindled to near zero.'' He said the
police and army have a better image in Colombia than the Catholic Church --
something surveys in major cities have suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian military leaders called the new accusations unfounded and
Pastrana, addressing the nation's governors, vowed stronger military efforts
against paramilitary ``barbarism, cruelty and cowardice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before returning to Washington on Thursday, McCaffrey plans to tour a
southern anti-narcotics base where a new, 950-man U.S.-trained army battalion is
based -- the first of three anti-drug units that would be created with the aid
package.
</P>
<P>
	   The post at Tres Esquinas is on the border between Caqueta and Putumayo
states, an area McCaffrey labeled a ``giant drug producing region'' where 20
percent of the land mass is devoted to cultivating coca, the raw material for
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the military component of the U.S. aid package was necessary
to clear a path through the rebels so that police can fumigate illegal drug
crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But he stressed that one-fifth of the funds support human rights and justice
reforms, as well as providing loans to help poor peasants grow legal crops
instead of coca or opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to critics who fear an expanding American military involvement,
McCaffrey said he did not foresee a large U.S. ``footprint'' in Colombia. U.S.
officials say there are 150-200 servicemen in the country on any given day and
they are prohibited from accompanying Colombians into combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Although U.S. officials have repeatedly insisted its new military assistance
is only for battling drugs, McCaffrey said the United States was also trying to
send a message to the guerrillas that ``it's more effective to talk rather than
fight.''

<HEADLINE> Exiled Professor Returning To U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A black man who refused induction into the Army in the 1960s
because the all-white draft board wouldn't address him as ``Mr.'' returned to
the United States for the first time in 39 years Wednesday after receiving a
presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   With tears streaming down his face, Preston King greeted 20 members of his
family -- some of whom he had never met and others he had not seen in decades --
at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   King, 63, fled his hometown of Albany, Ga., in 1961 after being sentenced to
18 months in prison. Over the years, he made a life for himself as a professor
in England, where his daughter is a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, President Clinton granted King a pardon so he could return to
Albany for the funeral Thursday of his oldest brother, Clennon W. King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a wonderful homecoming,'' King said at the airport Wednesday.
``This is my turf. These are my folks. I feel a great sense of love for this
terrain.''
</P>
<P>
	   King's daughter Oona, a member of Britain's House of Commons, flew with her
father from London and said the homecoming was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't get those 39 years back,'' she said. ``He thought he would die
without ever seeing his home again.''
</P>
<P>
	   King thanked Clinton for having the courage to pardon what he called ``a
simple issue of common decency and mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1958, King, who had been granted time by his draft board to pursue a
master's degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science, was
told to report for induction.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft board addressed him as ``Mr. Preston King'' before learning he was
black and ``Preston'' after that. He refused to report for an Army physical
until the board addressed him as ``Mr.,'' as they did white draftees. He was
eventually convicted of draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   King, now a professor of political science at Lancaster University, said he
felt no bitterness about the time he spent away from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a veritable Rip Van Winkle -- I go out one day, and 39 years later, I
come back,'' he said. ``But we Georgians are relatively tough people. You get on
with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   King praised federal retired U.S. District Judge William A. Bootle, who
presided over his trial in 1961 and petitioned Clinton to pardon him.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, now 97, said King had suffered enough, having missed the funerals
of his parents and three other brothers. He said that the sentence was
appropriate but that King had established himself as a good citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   King's family drove him to Albany on Wednesday night. King said burying his
brother was the most important part of his return, adding that he would return
to London on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Nicholas King, who is married to one of King's nephews, had only
corresponded with him through letters before meeting him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the children look at uncle Preston as sort of a legend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I admire him for what he did -- at that time blacks would not stand up for
what they believed in,'' said his sister-in-law Catherine King Cummings, who had
last seen him during a visit to Montreal 30 years ago. ``I really hate that
America has missed out on his talent.''

<HEADLINE> 9 Inmates Shot, One Killed in Riot  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot nine inmates, killing one, to
quell a race riot Wednesday at a prison that houses some of California's most
dangerous criminals, a prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons began fighting in
a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State prison, Lt. Ben Grundy
said. The violence ended a half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas
and pepper spray, opened fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy did not know what sparked the violence, although he noted, ``We've
had racial incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum-security prison was built for 2,280 inmates but has 3,400, many
of whom were sent there after being involved in violence or escape attempts at
other prisons. About 1,200 of the inmates are in permanent lockdown conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight prisoners wounded by guards were taken to hospitals, and one was
in critical condition, said Grundy, who would not give details on the others'
conditions. KIEM-TV reported that 19 inmates suffered injuries related to the
melee, such as stabbings and beatings. No guards were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of forest land 20
miles south of the Oregon state line.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were able to put down another riot at Pelican Bay last August by
firing tear gas and rubber bullets. A guard suffered a fractured cheekbone, but
no inmates were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparently unrelated case, two former guards are charged with
violating the civil rights of Pelican Bay inmates. A federal grand jury
indictment made public Wednesday accuses E. Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia
of conspiring to arrange assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is already serving a state prison sentence on similar charges.
Another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, was convicted of civil rights
charges Feb. 14 for shooting a prisoner after a fight in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Parolee  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A parolee who clubbed a Dallas man to death with a
two-by-four during a burglary was executed by injection Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   From the gurney where he was strapped Wednesday night, Cornelius Gross, 38,
apologized to his victim's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think I can say anything that will help, but I hope through your
God, you can forgive me,'' Goss said. ``I'm definitely not the person now that I
was then. I was sick, afraid, looking for love and friends in all the wrong
ways.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also told his mother, watching through a nearby window, that he loved
her.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss did not deny killing 66-year-old Carl Leevy as he dozed in an easy
chair at his home May 20, 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Goss had been on parole three weeks after serving six months of
a seven-year prison term for burglary.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before the slaying, he had been sentenced to a day in jail for a
misdemeanor conviction of illegally carrying a weapon. Police had found an
illegal long-blade knife in his car while arresting him for trying to steal a
chainsaw from a store.
</P>
<P>
	   Police tracked down Goss after he had a friend try to pawn the victim's
Rolex watch.

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Tonight's Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, won six Grammys at Wednesday's
pre-show awards ceremonies for his commercial comeback album "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing a black hat and dark glasses, Santana repeatedly climbed the Staples
Center stage to accept trophies during the presentations before a three-hour CBS
telecast featuring the top award categories.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist won for rock album, rock performance by a duo or
group with vocal, pop performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop instrumental
performance, pop collaboration with vocals and rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of Santana's victories was for a track from "Supernatural," a
multi-platinum album that included "Smooth," his first No. 1 single.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana came in with a leading 10 nominations, including nods for record,
album and song of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, won her first Grammy
for dance recording. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with
the hit single "Believe" and was also nominated for record of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Feuding soul divas TLC picked up three Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues
song and R&AMP;B performance by a group for their frank put-down of men, "No
Scrubs," and best R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail."
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Two '70s icons took home their first trophies ever: love god Barry White's
"Staying Power" won best male R&AMP;B performance and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was
honored as best metal performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The sassy trio Dixie Chicks won a Grammy for "Ready to Run" and a more
veteran trio -- Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton -- won for a
cover of Neil Young's "After the Gold Rush." Shania Twain's "Come on Over" was
honored as best country song.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, a familiar winner in the traditional pop vocal performance
category, was honored with his ninth Grammy for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark Woodstock festival,
he collaborated with younger singers Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill and
Dave Matthews to make "Supernatural," which won the rock album Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smooth," featuring Thomas on vocals, won for pop collaboration with vocals.
"Maria Maria," sung by hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean, was honored for pop
performance by a duo or group with vocal.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for all the people who don't have running water or electricity,"
said Santana, a native of Mexico. "If I could do it, you could do it."
</P>
<P>
	   "El Farol" won for pop instrumental performance, while "The Calling,"
featuring Eric Clapton, earned rock instrumental performance honors.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for my daddy who taught me the value of music," Santana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's teaming with rapper Everlast for "Put Your Lights On" won for rock
performance by a duo or group with vocal.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana lost in the instrumental composition category and competed against
himself for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when he wasn't on stage, Santana was on the minds of his fellow
performers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I was conceived to his music. He's an influence to me as a guitar
player," said Chris Perez, the widower of Tejano singer Selena and a winner for
Latin rock/alternative performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Crow, whose cover of the Guns 'n Roses tune "Sweet Child O'Mine" won
for female rock vocal, thanked Santana for not being nominated in her category.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, joined Clapton and
Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by voters and then
made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and Raitt got three in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Britney Spears had three of the year's four
best-selling albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana beat out Backstreet Boys in the pop duo or group category and
defeated 'N Sync for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   The new-artist category pitted teen divas Spears and Christina Aguilera
against Macy Gray, Kid Rock and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, the jazz singer-pianist who garners nearly as much attention
for her striking blond appearance, won for jazz vocal performance for "When I
Look in Your Eyes."

<HEADLINE> FBI Joins LAPD Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HARRIGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI entered the city's ongoing police corruption
investigation Wednesday at the request of Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty police officers have been suspended and 40 criminal convictions have
been reversed since a former anti-gang officer accused of stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker began telling prosecutors about fellow officers framing
innocent people, lying in court and attacking suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is looking into as many as
3,000 criminal convictions that may have been tainted by police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Six FBI agents will work with police and the district attorney to
investigate the allegations and decide whether to seek state or federal
prosecutions, said U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no greater trust than what we give to our police, the right to
take away a person's freedom,'' said James V. DeSarno Jr., the FBI's assistant
director in charge of the Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came amid calls for an independent investigation. The City
Council on Tuesday delayed a decision on an independent investigation by asking
a committee to further review it.
</P>
<P>
	   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced Wednesday that he has
ordered an expanded review of the police investigation. A team of state
prosecutors and special agents will monitor and review the methods and findings
of the police and district attorney investigations, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The LAPD has submitted three corruption cases to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office, but so far none of the officers has been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Gil Garcetti rejected the suggestion that his office has
gone too slowly, and said he did not want to submit a weak case that might be
thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
	   All investigative agencies are seeking ``successful prosecutions and state
prison sentences for these evil cops,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing 9,500
officers, said in a statement Wednesday that it supports ``a fair and objective
review and investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is unfair that 20 police officers have been relieved of duty and tried
and convicted in the media without a single indictment,'' the union said.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Professor Returns to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A black man who refused induction into the Army in the 1960s
because the all-white draft board wouldn't address him as ``Mr.'' returned to
the United States for the first time in 39 years Wednesday after receiving a
presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   With tears streaming down his face, Preston King greeted 20 members of his
family -- some of whom he had never met and others he had not seen in decades --
at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   King, 63, fled his hometown of Albany, Ga., in 1961 after being sentenced to
18 months in prison. Over the years, he made a life for himself as a professor
in England, where his daughter is a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, President Clinton granted King a pardon so he could return to
Albany for the funeral Thursday of his oldest brother, Clennon W. King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a wonderful homecoming,'' King said at the airport Wednesday.
``This is my turf. These are my folks. I feel a great sense of love for this
terrain.''
</P>
<P>
	   King's daughter Oona, a member of Britain's House of Commons, flew with her
father from London and said the homecoming was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't get those 39 years back,'' she said. ``He thought he would die
without ever seeing his home again.''
</P>
<P>
	   King thanked Clinton for having the courage to pardon what he called ``a
simple issue of common decency and mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1958, King, who had been granted time by his draft board to pursue a
master's degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science, was
told to report for induction.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft board addressed him as ``Mr. Preston King'' before learning he was
black and ``Preston'' after that. He refused to report for an Army physical
until the board addressed him as ``Mr.,'' as they did white draftees. He was
eventually convicted of draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   King, now a professor of political science at Lancaster University, said he
felt no bitterness about the time he spent away from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a veritable Rip Van Winkle -- I go out one day, and 39 years later, I
come back,'' he said. ``But we Georgians are relatively tough people. You get on
with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   King praised federal retired U.S. District Judge William A. Bootle, who
presided over his trial in 1961 and petitioned Clinton to pardon him.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, now 97, said King had suffered enough, having missed the funerals
of his parents and three other brothers. He said that the sentence was

<HEADLINE> Summers: Trade Tax Breaks Continuing  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Wednesday rejected a U.S.
appeal aimed at saving tax breaks that help U.S. companies compete overseas, but
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon the
program.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, in a statement released by
her office Wednesday, confirmed that a WTO appellate panel had sided with the
European Union position that the Foreign Sales Corporation program was an
illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling,'' Barshefsky said.
``Our view remains that the FSC is completely consistent with U.S.-WTO
obligations. We respect our WTO obligations, and will seek a solution that
ensures that U.S. firms and workers are not at a competitive disadvantage with
their European counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Summers said the Clinton
administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain the
important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past. I'm
sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. options for the program include a negotiated settlement with the EU and
a possible legislative fix through Congress, Summers added.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law would be tricky, costly and time-consuming. Also, opponents
might seize the opportunity in an election year to attack the program as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the 15-nation EU. It permits U.S. companies to
avoid certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax
havens.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break have been nervously awaiting the WTO
decision, which was to be officially released by the organization Thursday. They
fear it could lead to another trade war with the Europeans or require a major
rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software makers such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lemy, said recently that the expanded
program was ``granting an unfair advantage to U.S. products'' in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the EU would retaliate through higher tariffs if
the United States does not make fundamental changes, and some European companies
benefit from the tax breaks through their U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the program could become a bargaining chip in other U.S.-EU
trade disputes over bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace products. Some
observers also believe the dispute could provide an opening for all of these
issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all want to avoid a continuing round of trade disputes,'' Elkins said.
``We are hopeful that the Europeans will realize it.''

<HEADLINE> PROFILE: Camden Mayor Milton Milan dogged by allegations from his  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Weeks before Camden Mayor Milton Milan became the
first Hispanic mayor of this desperately poor city, allegations from his past
nearly derailed his election bid.
<P>
	   Milan emerged from the fierce campaign to make political history in May
1997, despite rumors that linked him to drug dealers years before.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the past is again coming back to haunt Milan - this time during
testimony in the federal trial of two reputed drug lords that is wrapping up in
Camden this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Five convicted drug dealers have testified that Milan sold $20 bags of
cocaine on a street corner in the 1980s and that he bought several cocaine
shipments before becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, 37, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He has called the
accusations "a desperate attempt" to ruin him politically.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those people are battling for their lives. You don't expect them to say
anything different," Milan said during an interview Wednesday in his City Hall
office.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're going to have to come more than just with a paper tiger and gossip
to bring me character-wise and morally down," said a defiant Milan. "There's
nothing they can do to me."
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic accusations have shifted the public spotlight away from the
trial's defendants, who are charged with running the largest and most entrenched
drug cartel in Camden's history. Authorities say the ring distributed hundreds
of tons of cocaine in the city before it was toppled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of it may turn out to not be true, but it looks bad," said Camden
resident William Johnson, 45, a machinist. "Until he clears his name, he
shouldn't have a position like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Closing arguments in the trial were scheduled for Thursday, and observers
speculate that the verdict will be the precursor of a round of indictments that
could snare city police officers and political figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities raided Milan's home and City Hall office in August,
carting away boxes of documents. Prosecutors have refused to say whether Milan
is the focus of the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Carlos Martir, however, has said Milan is a target of an
investigation into political corruption in the city and that an indictment is
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody here is waiting for the mayor to be indicted," said community
activist Frank Fulbrook. "Camden has a history of bad government. So Milan is
not unique, but certainly he has carried corruption to a whole new level."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the defendants in the conspiracy trial, Jose "J.R." Rivera, bragged
that he bankrolled Milan's mayoral campaign, according to one witness. Witnesses
have also said that after becoming mayor, Milan tipped off drug dealers about
upcoming raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan grew up with Rivera, the alleged financier and procurer for the
multimillion-dollar drug ring, but has said he was unaware of the alleged drug
activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time for the mayor to step and say, 'I'm innocent,"' said Councilman
Ali Sloan-El, one of Milan's most vocal critics. "There's too many people
talking. He's going to have to address those things."
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony has made headlines daily and fueled calls for Milan to resign.
A recall petition drive was launched several months ago, but so far has failed
to garner the needed signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he should step down as soon as possible. This man is an ineffective
leader," said Roy Jones, a community activist. "The image of the city has
literally been torn apart."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone agrees, and some say the issue is dividing blacks and
Hispanics in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to have something in hand, something solid that indicates Mayor
Milan is guilty," said Councilman Israel Nieves, one of his staunchest
supporters. "We want something substantial, not allegations, not investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's doing his job. He's doing what he's supposed to do," Nieves said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Hernandez, assistant director of the Camden County Office of Hispanic
Affairs, credits Milan for supporting plans for a Hispanic and Latino Cultural
Center in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't have any complaints," said Hernandez. "If it wasn't for the support
of the mayor we wouldn't have that. We're finally getting somewhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, meanwhile, is carrying on his duties, making numerous public
appearances, and has even suggested he might run for reelection in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "Come hell or high water, I will continue to be the mayor," said Milan. "If
they're going to hang me it's going to be at a public square."
</P>
<P>
	   It is not the first time that Milan has weathered a political firestorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks before the 1997 mayoral election, the campaign heated up when The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Milan was a suspect in a 1988 gangland-style
murder of a drug dealer. Milan filed a $33 million libel lawsuit against the
newspaper but dropped it several months later.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest controversy comes at a time when Camden is on the brink of a
revitalization boost, with plans to build a baseball stadium, an aerial tram
linking the city's riverfront with Philadelphia and an economic development
center.
</P>
<P>
	   Located on the Delaware River opposite Philadelphia, with about 87,000
residents, Camden is the poorest city in New Jersey and the fifth-poorest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan has championed what he calls "quality of life" issues in the
9-square-mile city. He has focused on putting more police officers on the
streets, cleaning up drug corners and cracking down on loitering.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he's done a fair job with the resources he has to work with," Earl
Williams, 57, a former police officer and disabled Vietnam veteran, said this
week. "He's done a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   A former contractor, Milan entered public life as a city councilman in 1995,
became council president a year later and parlayed his popularity into a run for
mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   After winning an unofficial primary in the Hispanic community, Milan
defeated three black candidates and a white candidate in the general election.
His election was a major feat in a city where blacks represent about 55 percent
of the population and Hispanics about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Hispanics were proud because Milton Milan was Hispanic. The
expectation was high," said Nieves.
</P>
<P>
	   Hernandez paused when asked if Milan is still the pride of his community,
saying, "That I don't know. I don't know what the people really think."

<HEADLINE> Travel Co. Settles Bilking Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As part of a federal crackdown on travel fraud, a south
Florida company has settled charges that it bilked consumers who signed up for a
travel club, the Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   All Around Travel Club of Lauderdale Lakes, Fla.., was banned from making
false claims to consumers about travel clubs and credit cards. The agreement is
the first resulting from the FTC's ``Operation Trip Trap,'' a series of travel
fraud complaints brought against firms last August.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the government's complaint, the travel club offered consumers
with poor or no credit histories cruises, travel discounts and a credit card.
The cost of the club, nearly $500, was to be billed to the credit card after the
consumers joined the club.
</P>
<P>
	   The company billed many consumers even though they never agreed to the
charges or declined the offer. Many consumer who did sign up never received the
promised trips or discounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The travel club could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, the travel club has to stop collecting membership
fees on the disputed accounts. Consumers who said they were bilked don't have to
pay what they were billed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last August the FTC filed suit against five businesses demanding that they
stop their deceptive practices and seeking refunds for consumers. An additional
20 companies faced charges by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Between July of 1998 and 1999, the FTC received nearly 2,500 travel-related
complaints worth more than $610,000 in alleged consumer losses. Of those
complaints, nearly a third were against companies based in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Sioux Tribal Members End Takeover  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MacDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AGENCY VILLAGE, S.D. (AP) -- Members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe
ended a takeover of the tribal headquarters Wednesday after the council agreed
to suspend the panel that governs the tribe's casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators had barricaded themselves in the council chambers Tuesday
afternoon, demanding an investigation of alleged tribal corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This started out as a council meeting,'' said Paul McCabe, special agent
with the FBI in Minneapolis. ``When the council meeting was adjourned, some
people who were in attendance there asked for the resignation of the council and
the gaming board.
</P>
<P>
	   They adjourned the council, and then these people were joined by some armed
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
	   No shots were fired, and several protesters and their supporters denied they
had any weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest ended Wednesday afternoon after the tribal council agreed to a
90-day suspension of the seven-member panel that governs the tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   During that time, the protesters' concerns and complaints will be studied,
said Rosebud Marshall, judicial representative from the Old Agency District, one
of the tribe's seven districts.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second tribal standoff in the state this year. In the
southwestern corner of South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux tribal headquarters at
Pine Ridge has been occupied by protesters since Jan. 16 in a stalemate with a
faction representing the tribal treasurer, whom the occupiers accuse of
mismanaging funds.

<HEADLINE> Jury begin deliberations in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The jury in the trial of four white police officers
charged with murdering an unarmed black man on his Bronx doorstep ended its
first day of deliberations Wednesday without a verdict.
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi sequestered jurors after they
deliberated about six hours. As expected, the judge had given them the option of
convicting the officers on less serious charges, rather than second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also stressed the officers could be acquitted if the jury believed
their claim that they fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo because they were
convinced he had a gun and wanted to shoot them. Diallo was reaching for a
wallet in his pocket when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of any crime," said Teresi.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge spent more than three hours going over the legal instructions for
each of 24 criminal counts before deliberations began at about 1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury later asked to hear a transcript of testimony from officers Sean
Carroll and Edward McMellon, and from a civilian eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott.
The readback was expected to continue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to confront and shoot Diallo. Elliott,
who lives in Diallo's neighborhood, testified that she heard an officer shout
"Gun!" before shots erupted - proof, the defense says, of the cops' belief that
Diallo was armed.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, Teresi removed one juror - a woman - for talking about
the case outside of court. She was replaced by a male alternate. The jury is now
comprised of four black women, one white woman and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also rejected a request by defense attorney Stephen Worth to bar
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson from the audience. Worth complained it
was unfair to allow Johnson to stay after the judge decided to keep out a
well-known defense supporter - paralyzed New York City police officer Steven
McDonald - because he might prejudice the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 37, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent
to two counts of second-degree murder. If convicted of that charge, they face a
maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the lesser charges being considered were second-degree manslaughter
and criminally negligent homicide. They have a minimum penalty of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were members of a roving unit of plainclothes officers that
has come under fire by civil rights activists who claim it stops and frisks
young black men without cause. Diallo's slaying sparked so much pretrial
publicity and protesting that an appeals court moved the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, small protests have erupted outside the courthouse, but civil
rights leaders have appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, during closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Warner stopped short
of accusing the officers of racism. But he repeated claims they accosted Diallo
in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning
or justification before unleashing 41 bullets. The 22-year-old West African
immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor accused the defendants of jumping to false conclusions and of
failing to back off despite signs Diallo was a "decent man" who lived on a
quiet, working-class street.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said Carroll had no reason to stop Diallo on a "hunch" that he might
be a wanted rapist or robber.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting "wasn't a mistake," said Warner, holding the wallet up for the
jury. "It was a terrible series of conscious decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   In sometimes tearful testimony, the officers claimed Diallo sealed his own
fate by ignoring their repeated orders to halt and pulling a black object in a
threatening manner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want to die," McMellon testified.
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon and Carroll both fired 16 shots. Boss shot five times and Murphy
four while backing up their partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi told jurors they could find that the officers were justified in
responding with deadly force if they "reasonably believed" that they needed to
defend themselves against a threat, or that they were arresting an armed bandit.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should figuratively put yourselves in the shoes of each defendant and
consider how the situation appeared to him," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also reminded jurors that the law allows police officers to stop and
question someone if wrongdoing is suspected.

<HEADLINE> Gore's racial profiling jab at Bradley splatters New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Everyone calls some place home, no matter how
saturated they might be in the national spotlight at a given moment.
<P>
	   Missourian Bill Bradley, for instance, hails from Denville, by way of
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Vice President Al Gore on Monday decided to take a swipe at Bradley
during a debate, he shot past the opponent and splattered his opponent's home.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had been teasing him for inaction by the White House on the racial
profiling issue and Gore angrily fired back: "Racial profiling practically began
in New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   News reporters and political analysts understood the essence of Gore's gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Bradley was U.S. senator for the New Jersey Turnpike and its plethora
of exits for 18 years - a period when drug interdiction became a top goal - the
suggestion was Bradley was in some way negligent.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are statements made in the heat of a debate that are somewhat over
the top, but I think the more important point is that it was a serious problem
that has been ignored for all too long, and Bill Bradley has been a part of
that," said state Sen. Ray Lesniak, D-Union, Gore campaign chief in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   But residents will not care about such political nuances. The fact is, a jab
was directed at the Garden State on a profoundly serious matter.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate, so did Gore represent
Tennessee, where a growing number of people might take issue with the vice
president's views as to the geographically exclusive nature of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly we have anecdotal information to make us believe this is
commonplace in communities of color," said Hedy Weinberg, director of the
Tennessee chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which last month
launched a statewide study of the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee legislature is contemplating a law to require all police
departments to report traffic stop statistics, and the Nashville Tennessean
newspaper has published a stream of reports on the controversy, including a
recent story documenting how black motorists get a third of all traffic tickets
in that city but represent only a fifth of the motoring population.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper quoted a black city councilman, Ronnie Greer, saying, "As a
48-year-old black man, I can guarantee you I know a whole lot of folks who've
been stopped simply because they're black."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a problem in Nashville. I think it's a problem in America," Greer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore evidently missed the Tennessean's reporting, which might strike some as
odd, considering he was a reporter at the newspaper 30 years ago before
venturing into politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman pitched into the fray, firing off a letter to Gore
upbraiding him for his sarcasm. "New Jersey was the first in the nation with
respect to eradicating racial profiling," the governor proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
	   But ever the partisan, Whitman could not resist a stab at Bradley, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand that you were trying to make the point that Sen. Bradley did
little, if anything at all, to address the problem of racial profiling in the
past 18 years as a United States Senator. On that point you are absolutely on
target."
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, a Gore supporter who was at Harlem's Apollo
Theater for the debate, leveled the same criticism, claiming when he drew
Bradley's attention to suspected police problems 10 years ago, the senator
minimized it as a "local issue."
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't call it racial profiling. We didn't know what it was," said
James, who is black. "I myself had been stopped a number of times."
</P>
<P>
	   "He did nothing, he had no interest in it," James complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the song of a loyal Gore man. To hear the same song from the Republican
governor seems somewhat off-tune.
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling emerged as a public concern under the tenure of Republican
Attorneys General Deborah Poritz and Peter Verniero. Its origin is traced to the
drug crackdowns when former Gov. Thomas Kean was in charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Is Whitman suggesting Bradley was somehow lax in pressing Republican state
appointees to perform their constitutional duty?
</P>
<P>
	   Toxic smears have beset New Jersey before.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey in the 1980s became the birthplace of the Superfund program,
initially a black mark as the state topped the national list for hazardous waste
sites. Only later would we learn New Jersey was at the top of the list because
of its extraordinary effort to find and document chemical dumps in order to
qualify for cleanup money.
</P>
<P>
	   Compare New Jersey, for instance, to Colorado, where the Rocky Flats
compound was worse than all of the Garden State problems combined. Rocky Flats
was never so ranked by the federal government for a simple reason: It was run by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The analogy fits the New Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
	   Is New Jersey exclusive in somehow recruiting and arming a band of racists?
None have ever suggested this.
</P>
<P>
	   Closer to the truth is the fact that the New Jersey State Police has endured
some public relations pain because New Jersey officials were the first to expose
their beloved corps to the kind of overdue scrutiny now awaiting other highway
patrols across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   As in, perhaps, Tennessee.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Thursday on
optimism over the strength of the American economy. Japanese stocks rose
moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.28 yen, up 0.70 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but
slightly lower than its late New York level of 111.30 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 69.21 points, or 0.35
percent, to 19,588.76 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the
average closed up 128.97 points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar largely followed through from its strength
in New York, where the greenback gained after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's testimony Wednesday before a Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, delivering the second half of his semiannual report to Congress,
said he expects the U.S. economy to remain strong and that there's little sign
of inflation on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan warned anew that the Fed is prepared to boost interest rates
again to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.72 yen, up from 111.10 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices opened higher Thursday following a rally by high
technology and Internet stocks in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Early gainers included major high technology blue chips and information
technology-related issues as investors were encouraged by a steep rise in the
Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York on Wednesday, the technology-rich Nasdaq closed up 168.21 at
4,550.33. A huge rally in technology stocks pushed the index to its biggest

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Offer New Gov't Help  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat that John
McCain says he'll ``beat like a drum,'' shot back at his GOP presidential rivals
on Wednesday, saying McCain and George W. Bush ``echo one another in their
efforts to attract the extreme right wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley, also offered dueling new
government programs aimed at attracting the votes of union members and senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   From Bradley: ``earnings insurance'' for American workers who lose their
jobs to overseas trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   From Gore: a bigger prescription-drug entitlement under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore dubbed his plan ``Medi-coverage,'' a repackaging of earlier Clinton
administration proposals plus unlimited new coverage for catastrophic drug costs
that resembles the coverage Bradley put on the table last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president declared his own proposal the ``third great pillar'' in
American health care -- after Medicare and Medicaid. Bradley dismissed Gore with
a new version of an old Bill Clinton line: ``This is yet another example of the
'Co-opt Kid' at work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, increasingly frustrated by his inability to gain on Gore in polls,
told WCBS-TV in New York, ``I'll propose something and soon as people think it's
a good idea, he'll propose the same thing. It's 'me too.' This act today is not
leadership, it is followership.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an economic address at Columbia University in New York, Bradley advanced
what he called an Earnings Insurance Program to supplement -- through annual
payments of up to $10,000 for three years -- the income of workers who lose
their jobs because of future trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore favor free trade. The AFL-CIO endorsed Gore last fall
despite the labor federation's vehement disagreement with him over trade. The
Painters and Allied Trades union separately endorsed Gore on Wednesday. Bradley
is still hoping for a breakthrough with rank-and-file workers.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the $35 billion to $40 billion 10-year cost of Gore's added drug
benefit, Bradley proposed using the federal budget surplus to pay the estimated
$200 million annual price tag on his income subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also released a radio ad in Washington state that, for the first
time, moves his harshest criticism of Gore into paid advertising. It says Gore
was a ``conservative congressman'' with an anti-abortion and pro-gun record, and
it also points listeners to a new, anti-Gore Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democrats have found it difficult to break into headlines as long as
McCain and Bush have been locked in a nail-biter on the other side of this
year's primary battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Republicans frequently make Gore the target of their barbs.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, in the heart of auto country, Bush knocked Gore for being
critical of the internal combustion engine in a book several years ago. ``I look
forward to him campaigning up here and saying, 'My vision for America is one
where you won't be working,''' Bush said Monday, quoting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   One of McCain's recent TV ads featured him telling a crowd that, in the
general election, ``I'm gonna beat Al Gore like a drum.'' And, rallying
supporters after his victory in Michigan Tuesday night, McCain cried out: ``We
are Al Gore's worst nightmare!''
</P>
<P>
	   As Gore greeted Floridians at the Boca Raton airport Wednesday, he brushed
off a reporter's question about McCain's ``nightmare'' comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concentrating on the Democratic semifinals and we'll let the
Republicans settle their disputes among themselves,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Within the hour, after campaign aides alerted TV news producers to have
cameras rolling for a sharper reaction, Gore had rejiggered his speech to senior
citizens at the Century Village retirement community, to lead with criticism of
Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, I've been following their debate,'' said Gore, asking voters to
focus on issues he sees as Republican weaknesses in the general election.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain both favor ``weakening Medicare'' through private medical
savings accounts, Gore said. And both agree that South Carolina should be
allowed to fly the Confederate flag over its Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They echo one another in their efforts to attract the extreme right wing
and to dismantle some of the protections that we have in our country for seniors
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore last campaigned in Florida on Feb. 8, at another Century Village
community near Hollywood, he praised McCain for proposing that part of the
budget surplus be dedicated to shoring up Medicare for the baby boom's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore share plans to provide Medicare coverage for prescriptions,
but they have bickered over the details.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has proposed that Medicare pay half of an individual's annual drug
costs up to a $5,000 limit in exchange for a $44 monthly premium. Seniors near
poverty would pay no premium or copayment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley proposed a $500 annual deductible, $25 monthly premium and 25
percent copayment.
</P>
<P>
	   From the start, Bradley argued that his plan was better because it gave
unlimited help to senior citizens with the most unwieldy drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the addition Gore advanced Wednesday, once a beneficiary has reached
an annual floor of $4,000 in out-of-pocket prescription expenses, Medicare would
pick up all additional costs.
</P>
<P>
	   From Florida, Gore continued on to an education forum in South Carolina,
where h was endorsed by Gov. Jim Hodges. He said he was not observing the
NAACP-led boycott of the state over its flying of the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that a president or a vice president should ever boycott an
individual state because national unity is too important. For those who feel
strongly about it in the private sector, that is their prerogative,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Inmates Shot, One Killed in Riot  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot nine inmates, killing one, to
quell a race riot Wednesday at a prison that houses some of California's most
dangerous criminals, a prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons began fighting in
a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State prison, Lt. Ben Grundy
said. The violence ended a half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas
and pepper spray, opened fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy did not know what sparked the violence, although he noted, ``We've
had racial incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum-security prison was built for 2,280 inmates but has 3,400, many
of whom were sent there after being involved in violence or escape attempts at
other prisons. About 1,200 of the inmates are in permanent lockdown conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight prisoners wounded by guards were taken to hospitals, and one was
in critical condition, said Grundy, who would not give details on the others'
conditions. KIEM-TV reported that 19 inmates suffered injuries related to the
melee, such as stabbings and beatings. No guards were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of forest land 20
miles south of the Oregon state line.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were able to put down another riot at Pelican Bay last August by
firing tear gas and rubber bullets. A guard suffered a fractured cheekbone, but
no inmates were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparently unrelated case, two former guards are charged with
violating the civil rights of Pelican Bay inmates. A federal grand jury
indictment made public Wednesday accuses E. Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia
of conspiring to arrange assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is already serving a state prison sentence on similar charges.
Another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, was convicted of civil rights
charges Feb. 14 for shooting a prisoner after a fight in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmate Executed  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A parolee who clubbed a Dallas man to death with a
two-by-four during a burglary was executed by injection Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   From the gurney where he was strapped Wednesday night, Cornelius Goss, 38,
apologized to his victim's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think I can say anything that will help, but I hope through your
God, you can forgive me,'' Goss said. ``I'm definitely not the person now that I
was then. I was sick, afraid, looking for love and friends in all the wrong
ways.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also told his mother, watching through a nearby window, that he loved
her.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss did not deny killing 66-year-old Carl Leevy as he dozed in an easy
chair at his home May 20, 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Goss had been on parole three weeks after serving six months of
a seven-year prison term for burglary.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before the slaying, he had been sentenced to a day in jail for a
misdemeanor conviction of illegally carrying a weapon. Police had found an
illegal long-blade knife in his car while arresting him for trying to steal a
chainsaw from a store.
</P>
<P>
	   Police tracked down Goss after he had a friend try to pawn the victim's
Rolex watch.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee Philippine Volcano  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) -- A volcano in southeastern Philippines spewed
lava and clouds of ash Thursday as officials stepped up evacuations, warning
that a more powerful eruption could come at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   The pre-dawn eruption sent a glowing river of lava part way down Mayon
Volcano's slope and rained ash over several villages. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials called for more residents near the mountain to evacuate. At least
4,150 people from 14 villages had fled their homes as of noon Wednesday, said
Cedric Daep, head of the Albay provincial disaster management office.
</P>
<P>
	   For about a week, the mountain has been emitting ash plumes and occasional
flows of lava. The crater's lava dome has swelled, occasionally sending molten
rocks the size of automobiles crashing down the 8,100-foot volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernesto Corpuz, chief of volcano monitoring at the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology, said the continuing supply of magma to the dome
suggests that volcanic activity will intensify, leading to an explosive
eruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon, known for its conical shape, is about 215 miles southeast of Manila
in Albay province.
</P>
<P>
	   Most residents of the village of Bonga, directly in the path of a possible
lava flow, have been evacuated, but many men stayed home to watch over crops and
farm animals.
</P>
<P>
	   Florentino Mina, a 60-year-old farmer who survived five previous eruptions,
said he was confident he could escape another since he and his neighbors have
several vehicles ready in which to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano has been showing signs of unrest since last June, spewing
ash-laden smoke high in the sky several times last year, but causing no
injuries. An explosion in September forced more than 5,700 people to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon's most violent eruption on Feb. 1, 1814, killed more than 1,200 people
and buried an entire town in volcanic mud flows. Its last eruption in February
1993 killed more than 70 villagers.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants' Deaths Ruled Accidental  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The deaths of three Chinese men, found dead in a shipboard
cargo container last month with 15 other men trying to reach the United States,
have been ruled accidental, the King County medical examiner's office announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The men died of acute malnutrition and dehydration, the medical examiner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The soft-topped container contained plenty of food and water but the three
men apparently were so ill from seasickness they could not eat or drink, said
chief investigator Jerry Webster.
</P>
<P>
	   The cargo ship docked in Washington state on Jan. 10, 16 days after it left
Hong Kong. The container, on the bottom deck of the vessel, also contained
crushed cardboard, plastic bottles, bags of human waste and blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Hui Zhang died about Jan. 1, eight days after the ship departed Hong Kong,
the medical examiner's office determined. Dian Biao Jiang died about Jan. 7, and
Ben Quig Zhu died Jan. 9, the day before the ship docked in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Lai, a social worker with the Chinese Information and Service Center,
said he had contacted Dian Biao Jiang's wife and informed her of her husband's
death. It was uncertain whether the other men's relatives had been notified,
Webster said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15 men who survived the crossing have requests for asylum in the United
States pending, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 Chinese stowaways have been arrested at West Coast ports since
Jan. 1, immigration officials said.

<HEADLINE> Sioux Tribal Members End Takeover  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MacDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AGENCY VILLAGE, S.D. (AP) -- Members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe
ended a takeover of the tribal headquarters Wednesday after the council agreed
to suspend the panel that governs the tribe's casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators had barricaded themselves in the council chambers Tuesday
afternoon, demanding an investigation of alleged tribal corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This started out as a council meeting,'' said Paul McCabe, special agent
with the FBI in Minneapolis. ``When the council meeting was adjourned, some
people who were in attendance there asked for the resignation of the council and
the gaming board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They adjourned the council, and then these people were joined by some
armed individuals.''
</P>
<P>
	   No shots were fired, and several protesters and their supporters denied they
had any weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest ended Wednesday afternoon after the tribal council agreed to a
90-day suspension of the seven-member panel that governs the tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   During that time, the protesters' concerns and complaints will be studied,
said Rosebud Marshall, judicial representative from the Old Agency District, one
of the tribe's seven districts.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second tribal standoff in the state this year. In the
southwestern corner of South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux tribal headquarters at
Pine Ridge has been occupied by protesters since Jan. 16 in a stalemate with a
faction representing the tribal treasurer, whom the occupiers accuse of
mismanaging funds.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Town Resumes Danube Use  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian authorities declared water from the Danube
River fit for water supplies in a southern town Wednesday, three weeks after a
major cyanide spill contaminated the river, the news agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Ukrainian authorities in the Odessa region made the decision after
determining that cyanide levels had dropped to a safe level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The authorities claimed the water from the Danube was clear enough for city
needs, the news agency said. It did not specify if residents were told they can
drink the tap water.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental officials said that herring have come to the region for
spawning, indicating the water is clearing, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Vilkovo and other settlements in Ukraine's southern Odessa and western
Zakarpattia regions have used water transferred from the other regions since an
accident cyanide engered the Danube from a Romanian gold mine.
</P>
<P>
	   Other settlements in Ukraine are still banned from fishing and using the
water until March 9.

<HEADLINE> Suspect charged in 1995 killing of Camden girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Nearly five years after a 13-year-old girl was
sexually assaulted and stabbed to death, authorities on Wednesday charged a
former neighbor with the killing.
<P>
	   Miguel Figueroa, 29, formerly of Camden, was charged with the August 1995
killing of Shaline Seguinot, said Camden County Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon. He
faces an arraignment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa was returned to New Jersey earlier this month from Tampa Bay, Fla.,
to face an unrelated sexual assault charge in another case. But he had long been
a suspect in Shaline's death.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim's mother, Lourdes Vasquez, said she was relieved that the ordeal
of waiting for an arrest is finally over. Figueroa had been wanted for
questioning in the case for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm kind of in shock," a teary-eyed Vasquez said. "I can go home at night
now and say finally they caught someone. There's a face now to the whole
mystery."
</P>
<P>
	   Shaline disappeared Aug. 4, 1995 while riding a bicycle outside her
grandparent's house in North Camden. Her nude body was found three days later in
a weed-choked field near the Pyne Point Elementary School, where she was an
honor student. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed.
</P>
<P>
	   A popular teen-ager, Shaline was a cheerleader and an avid reader. She
dreamed of becoming a child psychiatrist and would often go to the library to
read medical books.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa knew the victim's family and even helped search for her, Vasquez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why would he do this to an innocent little girl? Why?" said Shaline's
father, Noel Seguinot. "She was a wonderful little girl, a wonderful future. Why
would he do something like this?"
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon said a decision will be made later on whether Figueroa will face the
death penalty if convicted on the murder charge.
</P>
<P>
	   "Personally, I believe an eye for an eye," said Noel Seguinot, of Woodbury.
"It's important to send a clear message out ... to everyone else that commits
this sort of a crime. It was senseless. She never hurt anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon credited exhaustive work by investigators in cracking the case, but
would not disclose the breakthrough that led to the arrest. An $8,000 reward
will be given to an anonymous tipster who helped police, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had some pretty rough cases in this office - none rougher than this,"
Solomon said at a news conference. "The only thing that keeps you awake at night
are cases like this. They're the ones you think about."
</P>
<P>
	   The murder struck a nerve in Camden, a city where a record 60 people were
killed that year; she was among its youngest victims. Since then, relatives and
friends crisscrossed the community, putting up yellow ribbons to encourage
anyone with information about the killing to come forward.
</P>
<P>
	   "We worked it so hard," said Camden Police Detective Frank Ruiz, who choked
back tears when the arrest was announced. "It's just good to have the person
we've been searching for a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   Ruiz has been assigned to the case since the beginning, along with his
younger brother, Miguel, also a Camden detective. The brothers grew up in North
Camden and know the victim's parents and Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   "To find out that it was someone you knew that hurt somebody that you also
knew, it was hard," said Frank Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials say DNA evidence in the case linked Figueroa to
the killing. Authorities made three trips to Puerto Rico last year looking for
Figueroa before learning he had recently moved to the Tampa area.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't close anything as far as my life is concerned," said Vasquez.
"All it does is close a chapter to a book."

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Tonight's Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, won six Grammys Wednesday for
his commercial comeback album "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing a black hat and dark glasses, Santana repeatedly climbed the Staples
Center stage to accept trophies during the presentations before a three-hour CBS
telecast featuring the top award categories.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist won for rock album, rock performance by a duo or
group with vocal, pop performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop instrumental
performance, pop collaboration with vocals and rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of Santana's victories was for a track from "Supernatural," a
multi-platinum album that included "Smooth," his first No. 1 single.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana came in with a leading 10 nominations, including for record, album
and song of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, won her first Grammy
for dance recording. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with
the hit single "Believe" and was also nominated for record of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Feuding soul divas TLC picked up two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues
performance by a group for their frank put-down of men, "No Scrubs," and best
R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No Scrubs" was also named best R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting sprang an upset in the male pop vocal category with a victory for
"Brand New Day," beating out younger, Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and
Ricky Martin. Sting also won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Two '70s icons took home their first trophies ever: love god Barry White's
"Staying Power" won best male R&AMP;B performance and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was
honored as best metal performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The sassy trio Dixie Chicks won two Grammys, for best country album "Fly"
and the song "Ready to Run." A more veteran trio -- Emmylou Harris, Linda
Ronstadt and Dolly Parton -- won for a cover of Neil Young's "After the Gold
Rush." Shania Twain's "Come on Over" was honored as best country song.
</P>
<P>
	   George Jones, who had a near-fatal traffic wreck last year, won male country
vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, a familiar winner in the traditional pop vocal performance
category, was honored with his ninth Grammy for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark Woodstock festival,
he collaborated with younger singers Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill and
Dave Matthews to make "Supernatural," which won the rock album Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for all the people who don't have running water or electricity,"
said Santana, a native of Mexico. "If I could do it, you could do it."
</P>
<P>
	   "El Farol" won for pop instrumental performance, while "The Calling,"
featuring Eric Clapton, earned rock instrumental performance honors.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for my daddy who taught me the value of music," Santana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana lost in the instrumental composition category and competed against
himself for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when he wasn't on stage, Santana was on the minds of his fellow
performers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I was conceived to his music. He's an influence to me as a guitar
player," said Chris Perez, the widower of Tejano singer Selena and a winner for
Latin rock/alternative performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Crow, whose cover of the Guns 'n Roses tune "Sweet Child O'Mine" won
for female rock vocal, thanked Santana for not being nominated in her category.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, joined Clapton and
Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by voters and then
made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and Raitt got three in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Britney Spears had three of the year's four
best-selling albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana beat out Backstreet Boys in the pop duo or group category and
defeated 'N Sync for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   In other categories, bluesman B.B. King won his ninth Grammy for traditional
blues album; Tito Puente won for traditional tropical Latin performance; Tom
Waits won for contemporary folk album.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, the jazz singer-pianist who garners nearly as much attention
for her striking blond appearance, won for jazz vocal performance for "When I
Look in Your Eyes."
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Belafonte, Woody Guthrie, John Lee Hooker, Mitch Miller and Willie
Nelson received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston and Bruce
Springsteen as president and founder of Arista Records, and Phil Spector, whose
famed "wall of sound" defined rock music of the 1960s, were presented with
Trustees Awards.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Jury Begins Deliberations  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The jury began deliberating Wednesday in the case of
four white policemen charged with killing an unarmed black man, after the judge
said the jurors could acquit if they believed the officers acted in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers claim they fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo because they
thought he had a gun and was threatening them. Justice Joseph Teresi told the
jury, ``A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of any crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The judge spent more than three hours going over the legal instructions for
each of 24 criminal counts, and then the jury spent about six hours
deliberating. They were sequestered for the night and were scheduled to return
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi gave the jurors the option of considering charges other than murder,
and told them the law allows police officers to stop and question someone if
wrongdoing is suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should figuratively put yourselves in the shoes of each defendant and
consider how the situation appeared to him,'' the judge said. ``You should
consider what Amadou Diallo did before or during the encounter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Teresi replaced a female juror for talking about the case outside
of court. The jury is now composed of four black women, one white woman and
seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy,
27, each have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. They face a maximum
prison sentence of 25 years to life if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Lesser charges being considered include second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide, which could result in a sentence of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were members of a roving unit of New York City plainclothes
officers that has been accused of stopping and frisking young black men without
cause. Diallo's slaying sparked such intense publicity and so many protests that
the case was moved to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Diallo, 22, was accosted in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning or justification. He
was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims Diallo ignored the officers' repeated orders to halt and
pulled out a black object in a threatening manner. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   During deliberations, the jury asked to hear a transcript of testimony from
Carroll and McMellon, and from an eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon were the first to confront and shoot Diallo. Elliott,
who lives in Diallo's neighborhood, testified that she heard a policeman shout
``Gun!'' before shots erupted -- proof, the defense said, of the officers'
belief that Diallo was armed.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Pricing Lawsuit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge dismissed the state's lawsuit against Rite
Aid that alleged the nation's third-largest drugstore chain intentionally
overcharged 29,000 uninsured customers more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit accused Rite Aid of racketeering, saying the chain set two
prices for the same prescriptions, adding an average surcharge of $1.15 per
prescription for uninsured customers. The lawsuit said the practice continued
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Tallahassee circuit court judge Nikki Ann Clark said in the ruling Tuesday
that no laws or regulations showed the company's former pricing policies were
unfair or deceptive.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision "confirms what the company has believed all along, that our
pricing practicers were, and continue to be, well within the law and consistent
with pricing practices in many other industries," the Camp Hill, Pa.-based
company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Leontakianakos, the attorney general's chief of economic crimes, said
motions to amend the lawsuit and to reconsider its dismissal will be filed
Monday. She said Wednesday that her office has new evidence showing Rite Aid

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- France is sending 600 to 700 more troops to help quell
the rising violence in a divided city in northern Kosovo, and the United States
may send in a Marine unit, U.S. and French officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France has decided to dispatch an Army battalion to the city of Kosovska
Mitrovica, in a part of Kosovo controlled by French peacekeepers, French Defense
Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William Cohen, the U.S.
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is simply normal military business to decide ... to make the real
provisions so that we take control of the situation there,'' Richard said.
France already has about 4,500 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We frankly don't anticipate that this is going to be a long-term problem
but rather a flashpoint that has erupted in the last few days or weeks, and
that's the reason we think that a greater show of force and a greater capability
is going to be essential,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marine unit normally has about 2,200 Marines aboard amphibious ships. It
was not immediately clear how many Marines might be called upon if the United
States decided to commit more troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia
from which Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Army Gen. Wesley Clark and the German general in charge
of the NATO peackeeping operation in Kosovo had requested that France send
another battalion of peacekeepers, numbering 600 to 700. The generals also asked
that two other battalions be put on a higher state of readiness to deploy, in
case it is decided they are needed. The two other battalions, numbering about
1,200 troops, could include American troops.
</P>
<P>
	   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, however, officials said Clark was seeking
a reallocation of NATO peacekeepers already in Kosovo, rather than an increase
in their overall number.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. They reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said reinforcing NATO's peacekeeping operations will complicate
efforts by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to heighten ethnic tensions in
Kosovo in defiance of the June agreement to end NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Milosevic will take advantage of every opportunity he can'' to undermine
NATO's authority and to foment ethnic unrest, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said NATO needs to add to its existing force in order
to show Milosevic that he cannot get away with such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this robust reinforcement, we think we will send the right signal''
to both Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said NATO
intelligence was keeping track of the disposition of the various forces and
cross-border movements, and ensuring that new weapons did not replace the guns
being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerned the unrest could expand to areas outside Kosovo, Macedonia has put
part of its armed forces stationed near the joint Kosovo-Serbia border on a
higher alert because of violence and tension in Kosovo, army spokesman Gjorgji
Trendafilov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson have made it clear they
believe the Yugoslav leader is behind the current tensions in Kosovo. Both
pledge to get tough on any party, Serb or ethnic Albanian, that attempts to stir
unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.

<HEADLINE> Grammys Notebook  </HEADLINE>
    By CYNTHIA L. WEBB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A band leader for 50 years and 118 albums to his credit,
Latin legend Tito Puente says he has another accomplishment: role model.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very honored to be here and I hope I continue to be a role model to all
the young Latin people coming up in this profession," Puente said backstage.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente got his fifth Grammy on Wednesday for best traditional tropical Latin
performance for "Mambo Birdland."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the explosion of Latin music chart-toppers has helped bolster his
own career, which has seen 10 Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, it doesn't hurt, but I'm not Ricky Martin, I'm not Marc Anthony --
I'm sure not Jennifer Lopez," said Puente, wiggling his behind in an apparent
reference to the actress and her much-hyped derriere.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente also introduced his son backstage, Tito Puente Jr., who has a music
career of his own. His style is different from his dad's classic tunes -- he
plays house music. He towered over his dad, thanks to thick platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Blues guitar master B. B. King, his ninth Grammy in hand, said he has
already made plans for a posthumous career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had some friends encourage me to retire and they ask me when I would
and my answer is five to 10 years after I am dead," said the 74-year-old
musician.
</P>
<P>
	   King got his first Grammy in 1970. On Wednesday, he won for best traditional
blues album for "Blues on the Bayou."
</P>
<P>
	   He is working on an album with Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   "What can I tell you -- I just wish I could do more," King said backstage.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Santana wasn't the only rock elder recognized Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Sabbath, a heavy-metal band that came of age in the 1970s, won for
best metal performance for "Iron Man," off the album "Reunion."
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think that 31 years ago, I'd be standing up in a suit. I feel more
like an accountant than the guy who plays drums in Black Sabbath," said Bill
Ward, whose only sign of being a rocker was multiple earrings adorning his ear.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the recognition of older artists gratifying.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's totally cool," Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Crooner Tony Bennett got his ninth Grammy on Wednesday -- a win that the
prolific singer said inspires him to turn out another hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boy, I just feel like going back in the recording studio and doing another
one," Bennett said backstage. He won for best traditional pop vocal performance
for his "Bennett Sings Ellington -- Hot &AMP; Cool."
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't reveal what project he's working on next, saying he thinks it
"would be lifted by someone else."
</P>
<P>
	   At 73, Bennett says he has no plans to stop singing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love what I'm doing ... it's such an adventure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Council Nears Congo Agreement  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council closed in on an agreement
Wednesday on a U.S.-sponsored resolution to send military observers to Congo to
monitor a shaky cease-fire, and the United States said it hoped for a vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very close,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said. ``I'm hopeful
that we'll wrap this up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States had been pushing for the council to approve the mission
Wednesday to send a message to a summit of leaders from six African nations and
rebel groups involved in the 1 1/2-year war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   But the one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia ended before the council meeting
even started. A statement issued by two rebel groups and the six nations with
troops in the vast central African nation urged the United Nations to ``move
speedily'' to deploy a peacekeeping force with a mandate to disarm opposing
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit participants said that they were prepared to provide security
guarantees to U.N. and related personnel stationed in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, the 500 U.N. observers, supported by 5,037 security
and logistics personnel, would verify the separation and redeployment of
opposing troops in Congo and lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a
much larger U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resolution being debated by the Security Council gives no timetable
for even considering a peacekeeping force, and it does not authorize the U.N.
observers to forcibly disarm the fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   It states that Secretary-General Kofi Annan should make recommendations to
the council for further deployments ``on the basis of concrete and observed
military and political progress on the implementation of the cease-fire
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three rebel groups that launched an insurrection in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, as well as their backers Rwanda and Uganda,
signed the cease-fire agreement in Lusaka last summer. So did Kabila and his
supporters, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though the six nations reaffirmed their support for the Lusaka
accord last month directly to the Security Council, intermittent fighting has
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Wednesday's summit statement from Lusaka was helpful in
clearing up some of the remaining issues in the text.
</P>
<P>
	   A key issue still being debated is a call for implementation of sanctions
authorized in previous resolutions on Rwanda that cover the Hutu militiamen who
helped carry out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and now back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States supports inclusion of the reference to these sanctions,
but diplomats said the 11-nation Southern African Development Community wants it
dropped because the resolution deals with Congo -- not Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> UK's N. Ireland Envoy Urges Civility  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Britain's top official for Northern Ireland, in talks
with Clinton administration officials on rescuing the peace process for the
province, implored the parties to the conflict on Wednesday to act like
statesmen and stop engaging in ``tribal politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No more heads in the sand, no more walking away, no more laying down the
law, no more sulking,'' Peter Mandelson, the secretary of state for Northern
Ireland, told a news conference at the British Embassy before a meeting with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From now on, the test of everyone's commitment will not be how powerfully
they articulate their own tribal politics, but how constructively they seek to
accommodate others' fears and needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Northern Ireland fell back into crisis this month after the
Irish Republican Army refused to initiate a disarmament process. This prompted
Britain to withdraw powers from the province's power-sharing Cabinet that had
been formed only in December.
</P>
<P>
	   An example of the crisis of confidence that afflicts the process was evident
Wednesday when David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, Northern
Ireland's biggest Protestant party, told a gathering at Harvard University that
verbal commitments by the IRA to disarms are not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've certainly passed the point at which hints and vague promises would
be effective,'' Trimble said. ``I am skeptical, even if we had a clear
commitment, if that would be sufficient. Anything that falls short of actually
doing it will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is a sharp contrast in the mood between Mandelson's current visit to
Washington and his previous visit last fall, a time of heady expectations about
the peace process. He warned of the dangers of allowing the situation to
languish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the lessons of the past is that if we do not keep moving forward,
we run the risk of stalling completely,'' he said. ``In the coming weeks, I will
bend every sinew in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton had invested considerable effort in the peace process,
including the period leading up to the April 1998 Good Friday accords, perhaps
the most significant agreement in the 30 years since violence in the province
began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
	   For a time, Northern Ireland appeared ripe for inclusion as a rare,
unambiguous foreign policy victory for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin saw the setback earlier this month as
part of the normal ups and downs that are inevitable in a situation as complex
as the one in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are extraordinarily difficult things to do,'' Rubin said. ``They
don't succeed overnight, they succeed over time, and they only succeed through
persistence. And we will adopt the same persistence in the coming days as we
have in the past, based on the circumstances and our best judgment as to how we
can be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he did not expect former Sen. George Mitchell, who has played
a key role in past negotiating breakthroughs, to undertake a review process
similar to the one he carried out last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell, in a speech Tuesday night at Northwestern University, confirmed he
will steer clear of the dispute for the time being.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've now been involved for nearly five years, and I simply have to devote
some time to my family and to my business. I have to work to earn a living,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he understands the reservations of the IRA about disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA does not want to be seen to act under duress,'' he said, adding
that he believes that decommissioning is about ``good faith and good will. Not
about surrender.''
</P>
<P>
	   While disarming is difficult for the IRA, it is an issue of extreme
importance for Unionists, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unionists need to know the war is over, and will not believe that is truly
over until they hear it and see real signs that the IRA no longer wishes to use
its arms and intends to put them permanently beyond use,'' Mandelson added.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela May Allow US Drug Flights  </HEADLINE>
   By FABIOLA SANCHEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela is reconsidering its refusal to grant
the United States use its airspace for anti-narcotics flights, Vice President
Isaias Rodriguez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries: Venzuela
says the flights infringe on its sovereignty, while U.S. officials say they're
needed to stem the flow of drugs from neighboring Colombia, the world's top
producer of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hugo Chavez's critics say his stance jeopardizes good relations
with the United States, which is Venezuela's No. 1 trading partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, who took office a year ago, has forged a close ties with Cuba and
has spoken of the need to reduce U.S. influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering asked Venezuela again last week to
allow the anti-drug flights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have fully agreed on the need to establish a policy of joint
cooperation to confront the problem of Colombian drugs,'' Rodriguez said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Venezuela was prepared to discuss the flights as long as they
do not violate the country's sovereignty. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States wants to use Venezuela's airspace for flights from three
new staging centers it has set up in Ecuador and the islands of Curacao and
Aruba, just off the Venezuelan coast. The centers were set up following the U.S.
withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone, which had been used for the drug flights.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Lavish State Dinner  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton took a breather from the
hurly-burly of New York politics to serve grilled rack of lamb and California
pinot noir to the king and queen of Spain at a sparkling White House state
dinner Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The lavish affair for 170 guests, featuring a performance by tenor Placido
Domingo, topped off the first lady's first official day back at work in the
executive mansion since launching her political campaign in New York on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton has always taken an active role in the planning for state
dinners, and despite her busy schedule in New York she was able to be involved
in all aspects of the usual preparations for the Spain dinner,'' said
spokeswoman Toby Graff.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton and the first lady greeted King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday morning in an official
ceremony punctuated by reminders of the threat terrorism poses to freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The king condemned a car bombing that killed two people in the Basque
capital of Vitoria, accusing Basque separatists blamed for the attack of trying
to ``impose their totalitarian ideas by force'' at the expense of human life.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Juan Carlos for his ``stand against the forces of terror and
the enemies of freedom,'' particularly for his stand against an armed militia
that stormed the Spanish parliament in a coup attempt on Feb. 23, 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   The president touched on the theme again when the king and queen returned to
the White House for dinner. During the toast, he expressed condolences to the
families of the bombing victims and said that ``in a democracy we must settle
our differences with dialogue, not destruction.''
</P>
<P>
	   The evening began on a slightly awkward note when the queen stumbled in her
long black and gray gown as she scaled the North Portico steps to meet the
Clintons. She reached out with her hands to save herself from a bad fall, and
the president reached down and grabbed her shoulders to help her recover.
</P>
<P>
	   Guests were seated around 17 tables in the State Dining Room and the Red
Room that were bedecked with white orchids, Virginia roses and slender tapers in
golden candelabras.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those invited were actors Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and
Whoopie Goldberg, several lawmakers and administration officials and Vice
President Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who studied in Spain, and her
husband, Dr. Andrew Schiff.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rigors of campaigning, Mrs. Clinton was at the White House to
choose the place settings and set the menu, which included for dessert a topiary
of white chocolate styled like a crate filled with sherbet oranges, lemons and
limes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton chose the Eisenhower china, white with wide rims of gold, to
accompany champagne-colored brocade tablecloths. The menu featured the sort of
full-flavored dishes best appreciated on a chilly night: lobster and maine
shrimp served with risotto and chorizo; grilled rack of lamb with blood orange
and rosemary sauce.
</P>
<P>
	   The wine served with the main course was a robust pinot noir from the Artesa
vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif.; with dessert the royals were treated to a
Gloria Ferrer ``Royal Cuvee'' brut, which was developed in honor of their visit
to Napa Valley in 1983.

<HEADLINE> 9 Inmates Shot, One Killed in Riot  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot 13 inmates, killing one, to quell
a race riot Wednesday at a prison that houses some of California's most
dangerous criminals, a prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons began fighting in
a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State Prison, Lt. Ben Grundy
said. The violence ended a half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas
and pepper spray, opened fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy did not know what sparked the violence, although he noted, ``We've
had racial incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum-security prison was built for 2,280 inmates but has 3,400, many
of whom were sent there after being involved in violence or escape attempts at
other prisons. About 1,200 of the inmates are in permanent lockdown conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 prisoners wounded by guards were taken to hospitals, and one was in
critical condition, said Grundy, who would not give details on the others'
conditions. KIEM-TV reported that 19 inmates suffered injuries related to the
melee, such as stabbings and beatings. No guards were hurt. Prison authorities
originally said nine inmates were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of forest land 20
miles south of the Oregon state line.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were able to put down another riot at Pelican Bay last August by
firing tear gas and rubber bullets. A guard suffered a fractured cheekbone, but
no inmates were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparently unrelated case, two former guards are charged with
violating the civil rights of Pelican Bay inmates. A federal grand jury
indictment made public Wednesday accuses E. Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia
of conspiring to arrange assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is already serving a state prison sentence on similar charges.
Another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, was convicted of civil rights
charges Feb. 14 for shooting a prisoner after a fight in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Son Makes Texas Train Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALESTINE, Texas (AP) -- The son of famed stuntman Evel Knievel jumped a
moving locomotive Wednesday in a 200-foot, ramp-to-ramp motorcycle stunt on live
television.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10,000 people gathered along the eastern Texas tracks to watch
as Robbie Knievel took off on a motorcycle just before a Texas State Railroad
locomotive plowed into the wooden ramp.
</P>
<P>
	   Knievel landed safely on the other side, then ran to the top of the ramp to
wave to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was close,'' he said, smiling and out of breath.
</P>
<P>
	   In a state that leads the nation in vehicle-railroad collisions, the
stuntman offered several disclaimers before the jump.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody out there that tries this is out of their mind,'' the 37-year-old
told the Palestine Herald-Press in Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Michael Williams asked Fox TV to show
public-service announcements about train safety during the program because of
fears the jump might trivialize the dangers. The agency says U.S. drivers are 40
times more likely to die in a collision with a train than in a crash with
another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Robbie is a professional stuntman and this is not to suggest that anyone
should try anything like this at home,'' a Fox TV spokeswoman in Los Angeles,
who declined to be identified, said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 9 Inmates Shot, One Killed in Riot  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot 13 inmates, killing one, to quell
a race riot Wednesday at a prison that houses some of California's most
dangerous criminals, a prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons began fighting in
a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State Prison, Lt. Ben Grundy
said. The violence ended a half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas
and pepper spray, opened fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grundy did not know what sparked the violence, although he noted, ``We've
had racial incidents in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum-security prison was built for 2,280 inmates but has 3,400, many
of whom were sent there after being involved in violence or escape attempts at
other prisons. About 1,200 of the inmates are in permanent lockdown conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 prisoners wounded by guards were taken to hospitals, and one was in
critical condition, said Grundy, who would not give details on the others'
conditions. KIEM-TV reported that 19 inmates suffered injuries related to the
melee, such as stabbings and beatings. No guards were hurt. Prison authorities
originally said nine inmates were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of forest land 20
miles south of the Oregon state line.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards were able to put down another riot at Pelican Bay last August by
firing tear gas and rubber bullets. A guard suffered a fractured cheekbone, but
no inmates were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, six inmates were killed in clashes between cellmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparently unrelated case, two former guards are charged with
violating the civil rights of Pelican Bay inmates. A federal grand jury
indictment made public Wednesday accuses E. Michael Powers and Jose Ramon Garcia
of conspiring to arrange assaults on prisoners, one of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is already serving a state prison sentence on similar charges.
Another former Pelican Bay guard, David E. Lewis, was convicted of civil rights
charges Feb. 14 for shooting a prisoner after a fight in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Thursday morning on
optimism over strength in the American economy. Japanese stocks rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.27 yen, up 0.69 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but
slightly lower than its late New York level of 111.30 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 97.64 points, or 0.50
percent, to 19,617.19 at the end of the morning session. On Wednesday, the
average closed up 128.97 points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar largely followed through from its strength
in New York. There, the greenback gained after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony Wednesday before a Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, delivering the second half of his semiannual report to Congress,
said he expects the U.S. economy to remain strong and that there's little sign
of inflation on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan warned anew that the Fed is prepared to boost interest rates
again to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.68 yen, up from 111.10 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices moved higher following a rally by technology and
Internet stocks in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Morning gainers included major technology blue chips and information
technology-related issues as investors were encouraged by a steep rise in the
Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York on Wednesday, the technology-rich Nasdaq closed up 168.21 points
at 4,550.33, a new closing high that surpassed the previous record of 4,548.92
set last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 79.11 points at 10,225.73.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 31.92 points, or 1.91 percent, to 1,699.16. The TOPIX closed up
22.65 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8500
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8400 percent. Its price fell 0.09 point to
99.57.

<HEADLINE> Former Bolivia Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- A former interior minister who played a key role in
tracking down revolutionary leader Che Guevara died when a bomb he was carrying
exploded, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio Arguedas was killed Tuesday night in the wealthy La Paz neighborhood
of Obrajes, just two blocks from the home of former President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they did not know why Arguedas was carrying a bomb or what he
intended to do with it. Arguedas had been linked to an anti-communist
nationalist group that recently exploded several bombs in downtown La Paz.
</P>
<P>
	   Arguedas was interior minister during the military regime of Rene Barrientos
between 1964 and 1967 and played a key role in hunting down Guevara, who was
killed by Bolivian rangers after being captured in a remote tropical area in
southeastern Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
	   Guevara, who assisted in the triumph of the Cuban revolution, had gone to
Bolivia in an effort to foment a rebellion there.

<HEADLINE> RFK Jr. Praises Gore in Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Evoking his family's legacy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praises
Vice President Al Gore as an environmental leader in a new presidential campaign
ad to be aired soon in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no political leader in our nation's history who has a better
understanding or commitment to environmental protection than Al Gore,'' Kennedy
says in the 30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past six years he's gone toe to toe with the big shots on Capitol
Hill who've been trying to dismantle the laws that protect our air and our water
and endangered species and our public lands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is director of the
Environmental Law Project at Pace University and heads the Hudson Riverkeeper
program. His father represented New York in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you care about your children's future, if you care about the future of
America there is no more important decision that you can make this year than
your choice to support Al Gore for president,'' Kennedy says in the ad,
appearing with the Hudson River in the background.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore authored a book about ecology that helped boost his reputation as a
major player in environmental policy, but his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, also is courting
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy ad is expected to begin airing statewide in the next few days.
New York's presidential primaries are March 7.

<HEADLINE> College May Institute Letter Grades  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA MENDOZA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Despite months of protests from students,
professors at the traditionally liberal University of California, Santa Cruz,
campus gave one of the school's founding principles -- no required grades -- a
big fat F on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The professors voted to require new students to be graded in most of their
classes, ending a 30-year experiment with alternative, narrative essay-like
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, grades are the common currency in most modern universities
and in the federal bureaucracy,'' said Tony Tromba, a math professor who
resisted the change.
</P>
<P>
	   Biology professor Martha Zuniga said students who don't have grades to show
often have a hard time getting grants and fellowships.
</P>
<P>
	   The question rested with the 588-member Academic Senate, which represents
the faculty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are processing us like we are on an assembly line,'' said Student
Union Assembly chair Kirti Srivasta, tears welling in her eyes after the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But some students support the change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the current system allows the slackers to hide, and I think that
attracts a lot of students to this campus. Grades provide a lot more
precision,'' said Jordan Benjamin, who is studying biochemistry and molecular
biology.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new system, set to begin in fall 2001, each new student would have
to take 75 percent of his or her classes for a grade. The rest could be taken on
a pass/fail basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The requirements are similar to those in place at the University of
California, San Diego. Other University of California schools require students
to take two-thirds of their classes for grades.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents may have a chance to reverse the vote. Just 231 of the 588
professors voted Wednesday, and opponents are expected to petition for mail
balloting in an attempt to get more to participate.
</P>
<P>
	   UC-Santa Cruz, which opened in 1965 as an alternative to the more
traditional University of California campuses, remains one of the most liberal
schools in the nation, with no ROTC military training, no football team, and a
banana slug for a mascot. The '60s radical Angela Davis is a professor in the
History of Consciousness Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of letter grades, UC-Santa Cruz has given students narrative essays
evaluating their work. Students could get a grade if they want one, but last
year only one in three of the 11,000 students took that option.
</P>
<P>
	   The nontraditional grading system has long been a selling point for UC-Santa
Cruz, which reported receiving a record 20,000 applications from prospective
students for the fall quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, in a move that stunned many students, 187 faculty members asked
the Academic Senate to dump narrative evaluations altogether, saying they are
time-consuming and are disregarded by graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Narrative Evaluation System has an honorable history, but times have
changed and a new approach to grading is required,'' the professors wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   UC-Santa Cruz students have held demonstrations and spoken at public
meetings during the past few months in opposition to the grades.
</P>
<P>
	   While UC-Santa Cruz moves toward grades, there is a national movement under
way to put less emphasis on A's and F's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Grades can be limiting and not provide nearly enough information about
what the student is doing or thinking or how they are progressing,'' said Karen
Hartke at the Cambridge, Mass.-based Coalition for Authentic Reform in Education
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of schools, particularly elementary and high schools, are
introducing portfolios and even student self-assessments because of the weakness
of letter grades.''

<HEADLINE> Santana Leads Tonight's Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, won seven Grammys Wednesday for
his comeback album "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 52-year-old guitarist's victories came for a track from
"Supernatural," a multi-platinum album that included "Smooth," his first No. 1
single.
</P>
<P>
	   With the best album trophy still to be awarded, Santana had a chance to tie
Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single night, eight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smooth" was named record and song of the year. Santana didn't earn a trophy
for song of the year, which went to the writers, Rob Thomas -- who sings it --
and Itaal Shur.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank Santana for taking this song to the moon," Shur said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, won her first Grammy
for dance recording. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with
the hit single "Believe."
</P>
<P>
	   In a mild upset, Christina Aguilera beat out her fellow teen queen and
former Mousketeer, Britney Spears, for the Grammy as best new artist. Even she
was surprised.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh my God, you guys," she said. "I seriously do not have a speech prepared
whatsoever. I'm shaking right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Feuding soul divas TLC picked up two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues
performance by a group for their frank put-down of men, "No Scrubs," and best
R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No Scrubs" was also named best R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting sprang an upset in the male pop vocal category with a victory for
"Brand New Day," beating out younger, Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and
Ricky Martin. Sting also won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt the talent I was up against was extraordinary," said Sting, who also
won for pop album. "I have 14 Grammys now and a very large mantlepiece."
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Two '70s icons took home their first trophies ever: love god Barry White's
"Staying Power" won best male R&AMP;B performance and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was
honored as best metal performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Country's leading ladies, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain, won two Grammys
apiece. George Jones, who had a near-fatal traffic wreck last year, won male
country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   "We all feel really lucky," Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines said
backstage. "The second album on a major label and to have both of them
acknowledged by the Grammys is unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, a familiar winner in the traditional pop vocal performance
category, was honored with his ninth Grammy for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark Woodstock festival,
he collaborated with younger singers like Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill and
Dave Matthews to make "Supernatural," which won the rock album Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the guitarist's awards were presented before the television
broadcast of the night's major awards, a three-hour show hosted by Rosie
O'Donnell and designed to emphasize musical performances more than trophy
presentations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for all the people who don't have running water or electricity,"
said Santana, a native of Mexico. "If I could do it, you could do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana also won for rock performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop
performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop instrumental performance, pop
collaboration with vocals and rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for my daddy who taught me the value of music," Santana said when
collecting his instrumental award for an Eric Clapton collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when he wasn't on stage, Santana was on the minds of his fellow
performers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I was conceived to his music. He's an influence to me as a guitar
player," said Chris Perez, the widower of Tejano singer Selena and a winner for
Latin rock/alternative performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Crow, whose cover of the Guns 'n Roses tune "Sweet Child O'Mine" won
for female rock vocal, thanked Santana for not being nominated in her category.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, joined Clapton and
Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by voters and then
made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and Raitt got three in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Spears had three of the year's four best-selling
albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana beat out Backstreet Boys in the pop duo or group category and
defeated 'N Sync for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   In other categories, bluesman B.B. King won his ninth Grammy, for
traditional blues album; Tito Puente won his fifth, for traditional tropical
Latin performance; and Tom Waits won for contemporary folk album.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, the jazz singer-pianist who garners nearly as much attention
for her striking blond appearance, won for jazz vocal performance for "When I
Look in Your Eyes."
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Belafonte, Woody Guthrie, John Lee Hooker, Mitch Miller and Willie
Nelson received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston and Bruce
Springsteen as president and founder of Arista Records, and Phil Spector, whose
famed "wall of sound" defined rock music of the 1960s, were presented with
Trustees Awards.

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Protest Deadly Car Blast  </HEADLINE>
   By CIARAN GILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) -- Tens of thousands of mourners packed the sidewalks of
the Basque capital Wednesday, witnessing the funeral procession for a Socialist
politician killed with his bodyguard in a bombing blamed on a Basque separatist
group.
</P>
<P>
	   People showered the coffin with roses -- the party symbol -- as it passed
through the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, several thousand people huddled under umbrellas in the
city's Plaza de Espana square in a silent vigil as a steady rain fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The solemn protest was mirrored all over Spain as people gathered outside
town halls and other public buildings to observe several minutes of silence in
condemnation of the separatist group ETA, whose name is an acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom. Evening rallies were held in towns and cities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   In Madrid, some 200 miles to the south, protesters crowded the central
Puerta del Sol plaza carrying banners reading ``Basque Yes, ETA No'' and ``Peace
Yes, ETA No.''
</P>
<P>
	   ETA, which called off a 14-month cease-fire in December, is blamed for a
similar bombing last month in Madrid that killed an army colonel. That attack
brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets to clamor for an end to more than
three decades of killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's procession carrying the body of Fernando Buesa to a funeral Mass
in the Vitoria cathedral was led by relatives and prominent Socialists,
including party leader Joaquin Almunia and former Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Buesa, 53, and Jorge Diez, his 27-year-old bodyguard, were killed by Tuesday
on a university campus as they walked from Buesa's house to the city center. A
car bomb exploded some 200 yards from the Basque government headquarters. There
was no claim of responsibility, but the government immediately blamed ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   Buesa, married with three children, was the Socialist party's spokesman in
the Basque parliament and an outspoken critic of ETA and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying coincided with a state visit to the United States by King Juan
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This new and heinous crime clearly shows an absolute contempt for human
rights and the most precious of them all, the right to live, by those who try to
impose their totalitarian ideas by force,'' Juan Carlos said in a joint press
conference with President Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio
Guterres, joined EU leaders in expressing outrage over the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast came in the run-up to general elections on March 12, and all
parties suspended campaigning. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who is ahead in
opinion polls, promised Tuesday to continue his stance against Basque
independence. The Socialists also oppose concessions to ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Basque regional government, controlled by the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party, severed parliamentary ties with Euskal Herritarrok, the party
seen as ETA's political wing, because it failed to condemn the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Euskal Herritarrok said it regretted the deaths, but said the attack
resulted from a ``collective failure'' to bring about a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA ended its cease-fire because it said politicians were not making
progress toward its demands for an independent Basque state, which straddles
northern Spain and southwestern France. The organization has killed nearly 800
people since 1968.

	   Each of the 52-year-old guitarist's victories came for a track from
"Supernatural," a multi-platinum album that included "Smooth," his first No. 1
single.
</P>
<P>
	   With the best album trophy still to be awarded, Santana had a chance to tie
Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single night, eight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smooth" was named record and song of the year. Santana didn't earn a trophy
for song of the year, which went to the writers, Rob Thomas -- who sings it --
and Itaal Shur.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank Santana for taking this song to the moon," Shur said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, won her first Grammy
for dance recording. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with
the hit single "Believe."
</P>
<P>
	   In a mild upset, Christina Aguilera beat out her fellow teen queen and
former Mousketeer, Britney Spears, for the Grammy as best new artist. Even she
was surprised.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh my God, you guys," she said. "I seriously do not have a speech prepared
whatsoever. I'm shaking right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Feuding soul divas TLC picked up two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues
performance by a group for their frank put-down of men, "No Scrubs," and best
R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No Scrubs" was also named best R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting sprang an upset in the male pop vocal category with a victory for
"Brand New Day," beating out younger, Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and
Ricky Martin. Sting also won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt the talent I was up against was extraordinary," said Sting, who also
won for pop album. "I have 14 Grammys now and a very large mantlepiece."
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Two '70s icons took home their first trophies ever: love god Barry White's
"Staying Power" won best male R&AMP;B performance and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was
honored as best metal performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Country's leading ladies, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain, won two Grammys
apiece. George Jones, who had a near-fatal traffic wreck last year, won male
country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   "We all feel really lucky," Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines said
backstage. "The second album on a major label and to have both of them
acknowledged by the Grammys is unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, a familiar winner in the traditional pop vocal performance
category, was honored with his ninth Grammy for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark Woodstock festival,
he collaborated with younger singers like Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill and
Dave Matthews to make "Supernatural," which won the rock album Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the guitarist's awards were presented before the television
broadcast of the night's major awards, a three-hour show hosted by Rosie
O'Donnell and designed to emphasize musical performances more than trophy
presentations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for all the people who don't have running water or electricity,"
said Santana, a native of Mexico. "If I could do it, you could do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana also won for rock performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop
performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop instrumental performance, pop
collaboration with vocals and rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for my daddy who taught me the value of music," Santana said when
collecting his instrumental award for an Eric Clapton collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when he wasn't on stage, Santana was on the minds of his fellow
performers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I was conceived to his music. He's an influence to me as a guitar
player," said Chris Perez, the widower of Tejano singer Selena and a winner for
Latin rock/alternative performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Crow, whose cover of the Guns 'n Roses tune "Sweet Child O'Mine" won
for female rock vocal, thanked Santana for not being nominated in her category.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, joined Clapton and
Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by voters and then
made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and Raitt got three in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Spears had three of the year's four best-selling
albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana beat out Backstreet Boys in the pop duo or group category and
defeated 'N Sync for pop collaboration with vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   In other categories, bluesman B.B. King won his ninth Grammy, for
traditional blues album; Tito Puente won his fifth, for traditional tropical
Latin performance; and Tom Waits won for contemporary folk album.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, the jazz singer-pianist who garners nearly as much attention
for her striking blond appearance, won for jazz vocal performance for "When I
Look in Your Eyes."
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Belafonte, Woody Guthrie, John Lee Hooker, Mitch Miller and Willie
Nelson received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston and Bruce
Springsteen as president and founder of Arista Records, and Phil Spector, whose
famed "wall of sound" defined rock music of the 1960s, were presented with
Trustees Awards.

<HEADLINE> Puffy Combs, Body Guard Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap artist Sean ``Puffy'' Combs was indicted Wednesday along
with his bodyguard on charges of bribing a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and Anthony ``Wolf'' Jones are accused of offering Combs' driver,
Wardel Fenderson, $50,000 and a diamond ring to say he owned a gun police found
as Combs drove away from a New York nightclub where a shooting had occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, 30, already faces gun possession charges in connection with the Dec.
27 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am outraged by this new charge,'' Combs, who was attending the Grammy
Awards, said in a statement. ``I am not guilty. From the outset I have firmly
believed that the Manhattan district attorney's office has unfairly targeted me
for baseless charges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, Jones and Fenderson were arrested after one of Combs' rap proteges
allegedly shot and wounded three people inside the club. The suspect, Jamal
``Shyne'' Barrow, 19, was arrested separately.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the shooting stemmed from an argument in which an
unidentified man threw money in Combs' face. Both Combs and Barrow are accused
of pulling guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapon Combs allegedly wanted Fenderson to claim was a loaded 9 mm
automatic that police found on the floor of the vehicle. Fenderson was driving;
Combs, Jones and actress-singer Jennifer Lopez were passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was arraigned on weapons charges earlier this month. The bribery
charge carries a penalty of seven years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Seeks World Solo Record  </HEADLINE>
   By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- An engineer who quit his job in hopes of making the first
solo voyage around the world in a hot air balloon was floating over the Atlantic
Ocean on Wednesday, more than 1,100 miles and nearly two days into his journey.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Uliassi, 36, lifted off in his 160-foot balloon from a stone quarry
near Rockford, Ill., early Tuesday. He hopes to complete the journey in 14 to 20
days.
</P>
<P>
	   By Wednesday evening, he was about 140 miles east of Nassau in the Bahamas,
cruising about 15,300 feet at 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the second attempt for Uliassi, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., but
lifts off from the Chicago area to be close to his family and ballooning
friends. In December 1997, the bottom of his balloon ruptured over O'Hare
International Airport, forcing Uliassi down in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   He sat out the last two years out because of bad health and bad weather and
watched last March as the team of Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian
Jones of Britain managed to circle the globe in 19 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike his wealthier rivals, such as Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, who
went head-to-head with Uliassi in 1997, Uliassi has no flush bank accounts to
draw from. He relied on sponsors and donations to raise the $500,000 he needed,
and 15 volunteers are staffing his flight command center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted to show people that it could be done,'' Uliassi's wife, Renee,
said from the command center, in the Chicago suburb of Homewood.
</P>
<P>
	   She contends her husband isn't any different from the guy next door: ``Your
neighbor may be working toward a better golf score,'' she said. ``Mine just
wants to fly a little bit higher.''
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi -- an engineer and architect who is described as the consummate
inventor with a drawer full of ideas at home -- began his love affair with
ballooning as a kid.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother, Shirley, remembers him poring over encyclopedia entries about
ballooning and retreating to their yard to send off crepe paper balloons.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi earned his ballooning license by the time he was 18 and put off
college to run his own ballooning company. During his years at the Illinois
Institute of Technology, the idea of circling the globe began to germinate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are some things out there that people are very afraid of,'' his
mother said. ``If Kevin looks at something that seems frightening to the rest of
us, he'll just say `I'll do it.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and family say Uliassi is relaxed in the air -- he's called in to
say he's enjoying music from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on CD. He's also a
little bit scatterbrained; he asked for help finding his spoon for his morning
bowl of Corn Flakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi said that although there is plenty of pain and discomfort involved
in this type of ballooning, completing the journey is simply something he
doesn't want to miss. ``If I didn't do it,'' he asked, ``how could I live with
myself?''

<HEADLINE> NKorea Said Involved in Drug Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- North Korean ships are ``heavily involved'' in drug
trafficking, underscoring the isolated communist nation's role in the illegal
trade, a U.N. official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese maritime authorities seized ``a number of ships from North Korea''
late last year and found ``significant quantities'' of drugs, said Sandro
Calvani, the U.N. Drug Control Program's top official in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``North Korean ships are heavily involved in trafficking drugs,'' Calvani
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Calvani refused to characterize the extent of the Stalinist
government's collusion, he said North Korea's isolation and refusal to join
international drug-fighting treaties made it a natural haven for trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Calvani's comments, at a Beijing news conference about a global report on
drug control, add to mounting evidence that North Korea has turned to the drug
trade to earn desperately needed hard currency. Its centrally planned economy
has all but collapsed amid chronic food shortages, now in their fifth year.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's leading spy agency reported in October that North Korea is
producing 40 tons of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs a year for export.
The National Intelligence Service said North Korean diplomats and trade
officials distributed the contraband, a charge North Korean diplomatic missions
denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Calvani said North Korea's involvement fits a pattern in international drug
trafficking. Traffickers gravitate toward countries that are struggling or in
disarray and where law enforcement is easily corruptible, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaos in Afghanistan has accompanied its rise as a top heroin producer, he
said, and better enforcement in Iran sent traffickers to unstable Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
	   In East and Southeast Asia, marijuana cultivation is spreading, heroin use
and trafficking is prevalent and trade in methamphetamines is growing, said the
report issued by the Vienna-based International Narcotics Control Board, which
oversees the implementation of U.N. drug treaties.

<HEADLINE> McCain Sees 'Governing Coalition'  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, rearmed by a double victory over Gov. George W. Bush, said
today he is building a ``governing coalition'' with Democratic and independent
voters and more Republicans should join in and ``enjoy the ride.'' An
unflinching Bush said he would still win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain crowed about his ``overwhelming and phenomenal victory'' in the
Michigan and Arizona primaries during a speech today in Spokane, Wash., one of
three states with contests next week. He acknowledged he had ``a long way to
go'' and said he would focus on his conservatism and electability to attract
more Republican voters, who have favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm proving to them is that I'm forming a governing coalition,''
McCain said en route to Spokane from Arizona. ``This is a crusade, get with it
and you will enjoy the ride.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two campaigns continued to swap charges over telephone calls in Michigan
that sought to link the candidates to religious bigotry, with McCain saying the
same calls attacking him were made today in Virginia, which also votes next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said in California today that the McCain camp had made phone calls to
voters portraying him as anti-Catholic, then had denied any connection with the
calls until the polls had closed. ``I don't accept that kind of campaigning, and
I don't appreciate it one bit,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for McCain's Michigan support from Democrats, he said he understood some
found his rival the more attractive candidate but he added, ``In this state
there was a clear effort by people to hijack the primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush tried to ease the blow of his defeat in battleground Michigan by noting
he ``won overwhelmingly'' among Republican voters, who were narrowly outnumbered
in their own primary, which McCain captured with votes from independents and
Democrats. McCain also won at home in Arizona by a landslide Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A new poll today found McCain has caught up with Bush in New York, a key
state in the March 7 round of voting. McCain said he was on ``very, very good
footing, particularly among the northeastern states.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush declared, ``I'm going to be the Republican nominee,'' and said
independents who voted for McCain would support him in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real question is when I'm the nominee will I be able to pick those
independents up?'' Bush said on NBC's ``Today.'' ``And I believe I will be.
There's a lot of people that are sick and tired of what's going on in
Washington, D.C. They want something different.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said McCain's campaign ``deceived the public''
by initially denying making telephone calls in Michigan that portrayed Bush as
anti-Catholic because he spoke at Bob Jones University, where a past president
has called the church a ``satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was an accurate phone call. I didn't call anyone a bigot,'' McCain
said today. His campaign complained that evangelist Pat Robertson was now making
recorded calls in Virginia that call McCain campaign co-chairman Warren Rudman
``a vicious bigot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was campaigning in California today, the biggest prize of the March 7
primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   After Washington, McCain planned to swing this weekend through Ohio, Georgia
and Virginia, which votes next Tuesday, before heading to California, where he
expected to spend about half of the next two weeks. Bush, who also plans lots of
time in California, was planning stops in Virginia, Georgia, New York, Ohio and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll from Marist College's Institute of Public Opinion, taken before
Tuesday's votes were counted, found Bush supported by 46 percent of New York's
likely Republican voters and McCain backed by 43 percent, a statistical tie
given the poll's margin of error. The New York primary is for Republicans only.
</P>
<P>
	   At an airport rally in Burbank, Calif., late Tuesday, Bush said that while
he didn't win, the good news is that he dominated the Republican vote in
Michigan. He suggested his popularity among the party faithful would spell
trouble for McCain in the contests still to come.
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrating his victories, McCain set about rebutting Bush's argument that
he's building his victories outside the GOP, among voters who likely will
abandon him in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a proud Reagan conservative,'' McCain said. ``I love the Republican
Party. It is my home ... We are creating a new majority, my friends. A McCain
majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I look more electable, we'll start drawing more Republicans,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victories earned him all 30 delegates from Arizona and 52 of the 58
at stake in Michigan -- enough to assume the lead in the delegate race. Bush
gained six delegates Tuesday, giving him a total of 67. McCain has 96.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Michigan, with all the votes counted, McCain had 626,422 votes, or 50
percent, and Bush had 535,917 votes, or 43 percent. Alan Keyes had 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Arizona, with 99 percent of the precincts counted, McCain had 179,610
votes, or 60 percent, and Bush had 106,626 votes, or 36 percent. Keyes had 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   There are Republican caucuses in Virginia, Washington and North Dakota next
Tuesday. But the main event is March 7, with 613 Republican nominating delegates
at stake in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, slightly more than half of the votes were cast by independents
or Democrats, and they were overwhelmingly for McCain. Bush won two-thirds of
the Republican vote, McCain matched that among independents, and took 80 percent
of the ballots cast by Democrats.

<HEADLINE> UK's N. Ireland Envoy Urges Civility  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Britain's top official for Northern Ireland, in talks
with Clinton administration officials on rescuing the peace process for the
province, implored the parties to the conflict on Wednesday to act like
statesmen and stop engaging in ``tribal politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No more heads in the sand, no more walking away, no more laying down the
law, no more sulking,'' Peter Mandelson, the secretary of state for Northern
Ireland, told a news conference at the British Embassy before a meeting with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From now on, the test of everyone's commitment will not be how powerfully
they articulate their own tribal politics, but how constructively they seek to
accommodate others' fears and needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Northern Ireland fell back into crisis this month after the
Irish Republican Army refused to initiate a disarmament process. This prompted
Britain to withdraw powers from the province's power-sharing Cabinet that had
been formed only in December.
</P>
<P>
	   An example of the crisis of confidence that afflicts the process was evident
Wednesday when David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, Northern
Ireland's biggest Protestant party, told a gathering at Harvard University that
verbal commitments by the IRA to disarms are not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've certainly passed the point at which hints and vague promises would
be effective,'' Trimble said. ``I am skeptical, even if we had a clear
commitment, if that would be sufficient. Anything that falls short of actually
doing it will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is a sharp contrast in the mood between Mandelson's current visit to
Washington and his previous visit last fall, a time of heady expectations about
the peace process. He warned of the dangers of allowing the situation to
languish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the lessons of the past is that if we do not keep moving forward,
we run the risk of stalling completely,'' he said. ``In the coming weeks, I will
bend every sinew in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton had invested considerable effort in the peace process,
including the period leading up to the April 1998 Good Friday accords, perhaps
the most significant agreement in the 30 years since violence in the province
began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
	   For a time, Northern Ireland appeared ripe for inclusion as a rare,
unambiguous foreign policy victory for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin saw the setback earlier this month as
part of the normal ups and downs that are inevitable in a situation as complex
as the one in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are extraordinarily difficult things to do,'' Rubin said. ``They
don't succeed overnight, they succeed over time, and they only succeed through
persistence. And we will adopt the same persistence in the coming days as we
have in the past, based on the circumstances and our best judgment as to how we
can be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he did not expect former Sen. George Mitchell, who has played
a key role in past negotiating breakthroughs, to undertake a review process
similar to the one he carried out last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell, in a speech Tuesday night at Northwestern University, confirmed he
will steer clear of the dispute for the time being.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've now been involved for nearly five years, and I simply have to devote
some time to my family and to my business. I have to work to earn a living,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said he understands the reservations of the IRA about disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA does not want to be seen to act under duress,'' he said, adding
that he believes that decommissioning is about ``good faith and good will. Not
about surrender.''
</P>
<P>
	   While disarming is difficult for the IRA, it is an issue of extreme
importance for Unionists, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unionists need to know the war is over, and will not believe that is truly
over until they hear it and see real signs that the IRA no longer wishes to use
its arms and intends to put them permanently beyond use,'' Mandelson added.

<HEADLINE> Council Nears Congo Agreement  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council closed in on an agreement
Wednesday on a U.S.-sponsored resolution to send military observers to Congo to
monitor a shaky cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very close,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said. ``I'm hopeful
that we'll wrap this up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a five-hour meeting, the council scheduled a vote for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States had been pushing for the council to approve the mission
Wednesday to send a message to a summit of leaders from six African nations and
rebel groups involved in the 1 1/2-year war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   But the one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia ended before the council meeting
even started. A statement issued by two rebel groups and the six nations with
troops in the vast central African nation urged the United Nations to ``move
speedily'' to deploy a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit participants said that they were prepared to provide security
guarantees to U.N. and related personnel stationed in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, the 500 U.N. observers, supported by 5,037 security
and logistics personnel, would verify the separation and redeployment of
opposing troops in Congo and lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a
much larger U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   But the resolution being debated by the Security Council gives no timetable
for even considering a peacekeeping force, and it does not authorize the U.N.
observers to forcibly disarm the fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   It states that Secretary-General Kofi Annan should make recommendations to
the council for further deployments ``on the basis of concrete and observed
military and political progress on the implementation of the cease-fire
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three rebel groups that launched an insurrection in August 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, as well as their backers Rwanda and Uganda,
signed the cease-fire agreement in Lusaka last summer. So did Kabila and his
supporters, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though the six nations reaffirmed their support for the Lusaka
accord last month directly to the Security Council, intermittent fighting has
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Wednesday's summit statement from Lusaka was helpful in
clearing up some of the remaining issues in the text.
</P>
<P>
	   A key issue still being debated is a call for implementation of sanctions
authorized in previous resolutions on Rwanda that cover the Hutu militiamen who
helped carry out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and now back Kabila.

Eight Grammys for Santana
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana won eight Grammys tonight, including the
song "Smooth" as record and song of the year, and tied Michael Jackson's 1983
record of most Grammys on a single night. Each of the 52-year-old guitarist's
victories came for a track from the album "Supernatural." Feuding soul divas TLC
picked up two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues performance by a group for
their frank put-down of men, "No Scrubs," and best R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No
Scrubs" was also named best R&AMP;B song. Sting sprang an upset in the male pop
vocal category with a victory for "Brand New Day," beating out younger,
Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and Ricky Martin.

McCain Targets West Coast Voters
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- After winning handily in his home state primary of Arizona
and beating George W. Bush in the Michigan contest, John McCain is turning his
attention to upcoming GOP presidential battles on the West Coast. McCain is
casting the nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can
win the White House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the
establishment. "The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have
proven -- I hope to my Republican friends and I believe to most Americans --
that we can reassemble a coalition" of bipartisan support in the tradition of
President Reagan, McCain told an overflow crowd at Gonzaga University in
Spokane.

FBI Joining Police Corruption Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI is entering an investigation into Los Angeles
police corruption that has already resulted in twenty police officers being
suspended and 40 criminal convictions being overturned. The investigation began
when a former anti-gang officer accused of stealing cocaine from an evidence
locker began telling prosecutors about fellow officers framing innocent people,
lying in court and attacking suspects. The Los Angeles County district
attorney's office is looking into as many as 3,000 criminal convictions that may
have been tainted by police misconduct.

<HEADLINE> McCain to Bush GOP: Get With It  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- John McCain is inviting George W. Bush's supporters to ``get
with it'' and join him after his latest primary victories, even as he seeks to
convince critics of his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a proud conservative Republican. I am a Reagan Republican. Have no
doubt about that,'' McCain told the Rotary Club here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to convince and tell our Republican Party establishment: It's great
over here,'' he added. ``Come on in. Join us. Join us in this effort to be an
inclusive party. Join us in this effort to reach out.''
</P>
<P>
	   After winning handily in his home state and beating Bush in Michigan, McCain
turned his attention to upcoming battlegrounds on the West Coast. He cast the
nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can win the White
House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have proven -- I
hope to my Republican friends and I believe to most Americans -- that we can
reassemble a coalition'' of bipartisan support in the tradition of President
Reagan, McCain told an overflow crowd at Gonzaga University in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a crusade. Get with it, and you will enjoy the ride,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Washington, a McCain win on Tuesday would only guarantee him 12 of
the state's 37 delegate votes. The rest would be picked by a caucus March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's effort is more about momentum than math, and on Wednesday he
campaigned in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone can come onboard this train because we're leaving the station, my
friends,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a boardwalk park in Bremerton, police estimated that 5,000 people
turned out, in the rain, to see and hear McCain. ``I'm a conservative Republican
... but I want everyone to be part of this reawakening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is focusing for the next two days on Washington, which votes on
Tuesday, and California, whose residents go to the polls on ``Super Tuesday'' a
week later. The Arizona senator also planned some down time Thursday with a
24-hour rest at his vacation home in Sedona before heading to San Diego on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been going nonstop for weeks and the senator wanted to take a day to
spend a day with his family and take a little rest,'' said Howard Opinsky,
McCain's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, his schedule brings him east to Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, on
Saturday, then back to Washington, D.C., through Sunday. No longer planning to
cede Virginia to Bush, McCain planned a town hall meeting in the Washington
suburbs on Monday before swinging through Atlanta on his way back to California.
</P>
<P>
	   In California on Wednesday, Gov. Gray Davis rebuked McCain for describing
his Vietnam war captors as ``gooks.'' McCain apologized Monday for using the
term. But at the same time, Davis warned critics of McCain to ``just mentally
put themselves in his place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the odyssey, McCain plans to concentrate on his signature issue,
campaign finance reform, and on such other matters as his intent to use federal
budget surpluses to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate plans to resist being drawn into distracting squabbles with
Bush over whose campaign made which negative calls to voters, one senior aide
said. A day earlier, McCain's aides were caught denying that the campaign was
making such calls to Catholic voters, until confronted with a transcript
provided by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain early Wednesday said he ``had nothing to do'' with those calls, then
defended their accuracy. ``That was an accurate phone call. I didn't call anyone
a bigot,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The days of engaging in distracting yes-no haggling ``are over,'' senior
adviser Mike Murphy said later. ``The reform message is very powerful, combined
with the message of fiscal conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the second time in the same speech, McCain declared his conservatism.
And, without being asked, he explained his sponsorship in 1998 of an
anti-tobacco bill that made him an enemy of many on the right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a strong loyal conservative Republican,'' McCain said. ``There are
times when you have to stand up for what you believe in.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A storm packing tornado-like bursts of wind and driving
rain damaged buildings, snarled highways and was blamed for two fatal traffic
crashes in southern California Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind bursts, which authorities compared to the power of tornados, pealed
the roofs off two buildings and uprooted a 65-foot pine tree in Los Angeles,
said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Highway Patrol said there were more than 570 accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm dumped 1.43 inches of rain on Burbank and left up to 8 inches of
fresh snow in Big Bear, which was bracing for an early weekend influx of skiers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beach near Topanga Canyon north of Los Angeles, lifeguards rescued a
wind surfer from the choppy waters of the Pacific Ocean, while an afternoon
mudslide blocked one lane of Interstate 405 between the San Fernando Valley and
the city's west side.

<HEADLINE> Santana Wins Record-Tying 8 Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old guitarist's multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the
year. His first No. 1 single, "Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by
winning song and record of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting the
album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."
</P>
<P>
	   To a standing ovation, Santana performed "Smooth" just before winning his
final award. He kissed singer Rob Thomas at the end.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a lack of a writing credit for "Smooth" prevented a record-breaking
performance by Santana. The song of the year trophy went to Thomas and Itaal
Shur.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank Santana for taking this song to the moon," Shur said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nominee whose career began in the 1960s, Cher, won her first Grammy
for dance recording. She enjoyed her biggest commercial success last year with
the hit single "Believe."
</P>
<P>
	   In a mild upset, Christina Aguilera beat out her fellow teen queen and
former Mousketeer, Britney Spears, for the Grammy as best new artist. Even she
was surprised.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh my God, you guys," she said. "I seriously do not have a speech prepared
whatsoever. I'm shaking right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Feuding soul divas TLC picked up two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues
performance by a group for their frank put-down of men, "No Scrubs," and best
R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No Scrubs" was also named best R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting sprang an upset in the male pop vocal category with a victory for
"Brand New Day," beating out younger, Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and
Ricky Martin. Sting also won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt the talent I was up against was extraordinary," said Sting, who also
won for pop album. "I have 14 Grammys now and a very large mantlepiece."
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Two '70s icons took home their first trophies ever: love god Barry White's
"Staying Power" won best male R&AMP;B performance and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" was
honored as best metal performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Country's leading ladies, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain, won two Grammys
apiece. George Jones, who had a near-fatal traffic wreck last year, won male
country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   "We all feel really lucky," Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines said
backstage. "The second album on a major label and to have both of them
acknowledged by the Grammys is unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, a familiar winner in the traditional pop vocal performance
category, was honored with his ninth Grammy for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-one years after Santana headlined at the landmark Woodstock festival,
he collaborated with younger singers like Thomas of Matchbox 20, Lauryn Hill and
Dave Matthews to make "Supernatural," which won the rock album Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the guitarist's awards were presented before the television
broadcast of the night's major awards, a three-hour show hosted by Rosie
O'Donnell and designed to emphasize musical performances more than trophy
presentations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for all the people who don't have running water or electricity,"
said Santana, a native of Mexico. "If I could do it, you could do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana also won for rock performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop
performance by a duo or group with vocal, pop instrumental performance, pop
collaboration with vocals and rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I was conceived to his music. He's an influence to me as a guitar
player," said Chris Perez, the widower of Tejano singer Selena and a winner for
Latin rock/alternative performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Crow, whose cover of the Guns 'n Roses tune "Sweet Child O'Mine" won
for female rock vocal, thanked Santana for not being nominated in her category.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose only previous Grammy win came in 1988, joined Eric Clapton
and Bonnie Raitt as artists who were largely ignored for years by voters and
then made major Grammy hauls. Clapton won six awards in 1992 and Raitt got three
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success in 1999 came amid a teen-age explosion in pop music.
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Spears had three of the year's four best-selling
albums.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana beat out Backstreet Boys in several categories. The Backstreet Boys
performed a vocal medley and backed up Grammy Legend winner Elton John on
"Philadelphia Freedom."
</P>
<P>
	   In other categories, bluesman B.B. King won his ninth Grammy, for
traditional blues album; Tito Puente won his fifth, for traditional tropical
Latin performance; and Tom Waits won for contemporary folk album.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, the jazz singer-pianist who garners nearly as much attention
for her striking blond appearance, won for jazz vocal performance for "When I
Look in Your Eyes."
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Belafonte, Woody Guthrie, John Lee Hooker, Mitch Miller and Willie
Nelson received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston and Bruce
Springsteen and is president and founder of Arista Records, and Phil Spector,
whose famed "wall of sound" defined rock music of the 1960s, were presented with
Trustees Awards.

Memo: Authorities Didn't Alert Canadian Broker That Prison Blood Unsafe
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Health Department memo says use of U.S. prison blood
products continued in Canada after being halted in the United States because
U.S. authorities did not tell a Canadian broker the products were unsafe.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 memo, obtained under Access to Information legislation, was written
by Health Department officials Andre Juneau and Robert Pinker.
</P>
<P>
	   It blames U.S. authorities for use in Canada of blood products it says had a
``high probability'' of being infected with both HIV and hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The use of these blood products in Canada can be attributed to a failure
by U.S. blood and regulatory authorities to inform a Canadian blood broker that
blood collected at prisons was no longer safe and as a result was no longer
being used in the U.S.,'' says the memo addressed to John Dossetor, who was and
remains a senior adviser to Health Minister Allan Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 1,000 Canadian hemophiliacs, many of whom have died, were
exposed to blood products manufactured from plasma collected through U.S.
prisons, notably the Cummins Unit at Grady, Ark.

Bigras Says He Approved Jobs for His Riding, Finds They Will Go to Chretien's
Instead
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Bloc Quebecois member of Parliament says he signed off on a
job creation grant that he thought would mean work for people in his riding,
only to find the jobs are now going to Prime Minister Jean Chretien's
constituency.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Bigras, who represents the Montreal riding of Rosemont, said
Wednesday he approved the grant under the Transitional Jobs Fund in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigras said he learned of the change when he spoke to officials at a Human
Resources Department office in Montreal this week to inquire on the status of
the project.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was told the file had been transferred to the regional office in
Shawinigan, which looks after projects in Chretien's riding.
</P>
<P>
	   The grant is valued at $165,984 in department records. It is listed as
awarded to 3393062 Canada Inc., identified by Bigras as a clothing firm formed
as a partnership of two previous companies. ------

Canadian Trucker Protest Losing Momentum
</P>
<P>
	   PICKERING, Ontario (AP) -- A protest by independent Canadian truckers angry
over the rising business costs appeared to run out of fuel Wednesday as drivers
dismantled roadblocks in eastern Canada and truckers in Ontario couldn't agree
on how their strategy would proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 truck drivers hatched plots to block roads in illegal convoys and
disrupt business at the General Motors Corp. plant in Oshawa during an afternoon
rally in this community east of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   But organizers urged a less disruptive way to win wage increases to offset
increasing fuel prices and, in the end, even the most radical went home quietly
planning nothing more than a handful of small meetings at Ontario truck stops on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Truck hauling to and from Atlantic Canada had effectively been shut down
since Monday after barricades were erected on the Trans-Canada Highway through
New Brunswick, the main commercial link for the movement of goods in the region.

Preston Manning Defends His Absence From Commons
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Reform Leader Preston Manning is defending his prolonged
absence from the Commons, saying it is his constitutional obligation to campaign
for an alternative to the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning returned Wednesday to the House after spending the last two weeks
traveling the country to promote the nascent political coalition he hopes to
lead, the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberal MPs heckled Manning as he arrived for question period for the first
time in 11 parliamentary days.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning has been mainly meeting Reform members who will cast ballots in a
party referendum on whether to merge with other like-minded conservatives to
form the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformers have until March 17 to vote, and results will be made public March
25.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets pitcher Bill Pulsipher stopped breathing briefly after
collapsing on the floor of his bathroom Wednesday, but was resting comfortably
in a hospital later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, who had worked out earlier in the day at the Mets' spring

vital signs were normal, Mets general manager Steve Phillips said on a

<HEADLINE> Raptors 99, Knicks 88  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hype is one thing, legitimacy is another. Vince Carter
wants to move from that first plateau to the next.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter put on another performance Wednesday night worthy of his
ever-increasing accolades, taking over the game by scoring 15 of his 33 points
in the third quarter to lead the Toronto Raptors past the New York Knicks 99-88.
</P>
<P>
	   "The All-Star game is over. The Letterman show is behind me. Guys wondered
if I'd remain focused," said Carter, who also had nine rebounds and nine assists
to barely miss his first NBA triple-double. "I still have to show up on the
floor. That's the proving I have to do no matter how much media I get. I still
have to give 110 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   The hype surrounding Carter shows no signs of slowing. He appeared in
mailboxes all across America on Wednesday on the cover of Sports Illustrated,
and on Sunday he'll make his first appearance with the Raptors in a nationally
televised game when Toronto plays Phoenix on NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter also gave plenty of ammo to the folks producing the highlight reels,
throwing down two incredible dunks and making several closely contested jumpers
as part of his evening.
</P>
<P>
	   To close matters, he scored Toronto's final seven points and gave hugs to
rap stars Ja Rule and Irv Gotti, who sat courtside across from Toronto's bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once I started hitting, the rest of the team looked for me," Carter said.
"Four quarters of good basketball was refreshing. We haven't done that in a
while."
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Christie added 22 points and Tracy McGrady had 16 for the Raptors, who
snapped a three-game losing streak, ended New York's five-game home winning
streak and knocked the Knicks out of first place in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Ewing scored 24 points to move past Adrian Dantley into 15th place
on the career scoring list. Just two days earlier, Ewing passed Elgin Baylor to
move into 16th place. Ewing now has 23,181 career points, with Robert Parish the
next player ahead of him with 23,334.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raptors used runs of 20-3 in the first half and 19-5 in the second to
make the difference. The victory allowed Toronto to avoid what would have been
its first four-game losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-5 run came to close the third quarter as Carter started taking over
the game. Smirking and scowling at whoever the Knicks tried to guard him with,
usually Latrell Sprewell or Larry Johnson, Carter did his damage with a array of
pull-up jumpers and drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   He capped a personal 5-0 run late in the fourth by driving around Allan
Houston at the 3-point line and slamming in a dunk for a 97-86 lead with 2:11
left.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of the shots he made were very tough," Ewing said. "He was elevating
over guys and shooting and they were going in. He is probably similar (to
Michael Jordan). He is a great player, but I'm not sure he is at the level of
Michael."
</P>
<P>
	   New York jumped out to an early nine-point lead, 15-6, then allowed Toronto
to go on a 20-3 run fueled by 12 points from Christie for a 26-22 lead after the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Oakley had a 3-pointer and an alley-oop pass to McGrady to give
Toronto a 31-24 lead, and Carter followed with a crowd-pleasing, high-rising
slam to make it 33-26. Chris Childs hit a pair of 3-pointers to fuel a
quarter-ending 21-9 run that gave the Knicks a 47-42 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A turnaround jumper by Ewing gave the Knicks a 62-52 lead before Carter
began his third-quarter outburst that led Toronto to a 71-67 lead entering the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks got no closer than three points in the final 12 minutes.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A storm packing tornado-like bursts of wind and driving
rain damaged buildings, snarled highways and was blamed for two fatal traffic
crashes in southern California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind bursts, which authorities compared to the power of tornados, peeled
the roofs off two buildings and uprooted a 65-foot pine tree in Los Angeles,
said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Highway Patrol said there were more than 570 accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm dumped 1.43 inches of rain on Burbank and left up to 8 inches of
fresh snow in Big Bear, which was bracing for an early weekend influx of skiers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beach near Topanga Canyon north of Los Angeles, lifeguards rescued a
wind surfer from the choppy waters of the Pacific Ocean, while an afternoon
mudslide blocked one lane of Interstate 405 between the San Fernando Valley and
the city's west side.

<HEADLINE> Giant blaze in Pinelands auto junkyard challenges firefighters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW GRETNA, N.J. (AP) - A fire broke out in a rural auto junkyard
Wednesday, consuming abandoned cars, loose tires and trees and sending plumes of
thick, gray smoke hundreds of feet into the air.
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 firefighters from three counties and foam-spraying trucks from
the Lakehurst naval base and Atlantic City International Airport were called in
to battle the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-alarm fire broke out about 2:30 p.m. in Cranmer's Auto Recycling
located in this southeastern Burlington County village. It was concentrated in a
400-by-400-foot area, according to Ocean County Fire Coordinator Brian Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was still burning at 11:30 p.m., a county dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   No evacuations were necessary. The nearest homes are located about 1 1/2
miles from the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a major mess in there," said firefighter Carl Wescoat of the Nesco
Volunteer Fire Department, who helped fight the fire. "Everything's burning -
cars, tires, woods. There's so many cars stacked on top of each other and it's
hard to get in between them."
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous small explosions rang out as the fire reached cars that still had
gasoline or gas vapors in their tanks, he said. "It's like gunfire going off in
there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was hard to get at the fire because of the stacked cars and the
quarter-mile distance between it and the nearest road, Route 542, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't pick it apart. We're dropping foam on it to try to suffocate the
fire," Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pumpers, ladder trucks and tanker trucks from 40 fire departments in
Atlantic, Burlington and Ocean counties were being used. New Jersey state Forest
Fire Service crews worked the perimeter to make sure the fire did not spread
into adjoining woods in the million-acre Pinelands National Reserve.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nick Bradford scored 19 points as No. 23 Kansas
recovered from a sluggish start to beat Nebraska 83-58 Wednesday night, handing
the Cornhuskers their sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gooden and Kenny Gregory each scored 12 for the Jayhawks (20-7, 9-4 Big
12), who outscored Nebraska 49-24 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks, who held off No. 20 Oklahoma 53-50 on Saturday, have won
consecutive games for the first time since beating Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
	   Cary Cochran scored 14 points and Kimani Ffriend had 11 points and 15
rebounds for the Cornhuskers (10-16, 3-10). Larry Florence added 12 points for
Nebraska, which hasn't won since beating Kansas State on Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Danny Nee has been stuck on 253 wins, tying Joe Cipriano for the most
in school history.
</P>
<P>
	   After scrapping for a halftime tie at 34, Nebraska fell apart. Kansas opened
the half by scoring nine unanswered points, holding Nebraska scoreless for 3:35.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska stayed within single digits until the Jayhawks went on a 7-0 run
after Florence was called for a technical foul for blocking Nick Collison's
drive with 12:15 left to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Collison went 1-for-2 from the line and Jeff Boschee hit both free throws
for the technical to start the run, which put Kansas up 56-43.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Truscott snapped Nebraska's scoring drought of 5:45 by hitting a pair
of free throws with 9:11 left to cut the lead to 56-45, but Eric Chenowith
converted a three-point play to start an 11-2 Kansas run.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied at halftime despite Nebraska's 14 turnovers. The Huskers
stayed in it by shooting 54 percent and outrebounding the Jayhawks 24-20.
Cochran was 4-for-4 in the half, hitting all three of his 3-point attempts, and
pulled down six rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows 7.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMIE TARABAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE -- Singapore's economic growth fell short of predictions in late
1999, but the government in this Southeast Asian powerhouse said Thursday the
outlook for the current year is bright.
</P>
<P>
	   "The chances we will end the year on the higher end of the forecast are
good," Khaw Boon Wan, permanent secretary of the trade and industry ministry
said. "The recovery is firm. I think the prospects that this year will be better
than the last year are bright."
</P>
<P>
	   The country's economy grew 7.1 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of
1999, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Though still robust, that was slower than the rate of 8.2 percent previously
estimated by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Gross domestic product growth for all of 1999 came to 5.4 percent, slightly
less than the 5.6 percent the government had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   However, it was sharply higher than in 1998 when the economy, slowed by the
effects of the Asian economic crisis, managed only 0.4 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The official forecast is pretty much in line with thinking in the private
sector, Ng Bok Eng, senior regional economist at Daiwa Securities, said, adding
his firm's forecast for this year was at 6-6.5 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this year will see good recovery for several sectors, it's not
going to be spectacular, but probably going to be better," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore is expected to thrive as regional economies continue to recover
from the financial crisis, with the manufacturing and construction sectors in
particular set to improve.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the manufacturing sector staged a strong turnaround, growing by 14
percent, but the construction sector contracted by 12 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "The domestic construction sector should perform better this year, and we
see positive growth for the financial services sector as well," said Charlie
Lay, economist at SocGen-Crosby Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Lay said another major spur to growth this year will be the deregulation of
the telecommunications sector in April.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have forecast 6.2 percent growth for this year, with an upside bias to
our forecast," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry contracted by 6.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with 3.2 percent growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the lower-than-estimated figures, the ministry confirmed its growth
forecast of 4.5-6.5 percent for the current year, and even suggested growth will
fall toward the upper end of that range.

<P>
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Morris Peterson scored 17 points and No. 5
Michigan State broke open a close game by scoring the first 10 points of the
second half in a 79-63 win over Penn State on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-place Spartans (21-6, 11-2 Big Ten), who made 33 of 59 shots from
the field, won their fourth straight and opened a one-game lead over Ohio State
and Purdue in the standings. They visit No. 16 Indiana in Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Granger added 15 points, while Mateen Cleaves had 11 points and 10
assists. With 738 assists in his career, he moved into second place in the Big
Ten record book ahead of Michigan's Gary Grant.
</P>
<P>
	   David Thomas had 10 rebounds as Michigan State outrebounded the Lions 42-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarrett Stephens and Joe Crispin each scored 18 as the Lions (13-11, 5-8)
lost for the fifth time in six games. The schedule doesn't get easier, with No.
21 Purdue on Sunday and No. 6 Ohio State next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite shooting 57 percent in the first half, Michigan State led only six
points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came the onslaught. Charlie Bell opened the second half with a jumper
and a fast-break layup. Peterson got a dunk on a Cleaves-led break, Andre Hutson
scored inside, Peterson hit a 3-pointer and Michigan State led 52-35. The Lions
never threatened again.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State missed their first three shots, turned the ball over once and had
a shot blocked during the spurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spartans went up 39-30 as Cleaves split two defenders on a fast break
with 3:49 to go in the first half. But the Lions hung close. When Michigan State
missed its last three shots and committed three turnovers, they pulled within
41-35 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Crispin had 13 points in the first half, helping Penn State stop the usual
quick Spartan start by hitting his first three 3-pointers -- all of them
off-balance with a hand in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State coach Jerry Dunn was hit with a technical foul for running on the
court after a no-call after a driving Crispin collided with Cleaves.

<P>
	   Pulsipher had X-rays, blood work and an EKG conducted last week as part of
his annual physical and there appeared to be no abnormalities, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher has had anxiety problems after injuring his elbow in 1995 and has
taken Prozac the past three years to help combat that. He needed to be medicated
Wednesday to calm him down enough for the tube to be inserted.
</P>
<P>
	   The pitcher went through a normal workout during the day, throwing, running
and doing other conditioning exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything was fine other than a slight tweak to his hamstring at the end
of day,'' Phillips said. ``He threw pretty well. There was nothing remarkable
about his workout.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, 26, is in his second stint with the Mets, coming back in January
when Milwaukee dealt him for infielder Luis Lopez. He was one of the favorites
for the fifth spot in the team's starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was uncertain when he can resume workouts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly have to be comfortable there is some understanding about what
happened or at least every effort to understand what happened before he comes
back,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, one of the Mets' most promising prospects before injuries set
back his career and he was eventually traded to Milwaukee. He was 5-6 with a
5.98 ERA last year in 16 starts and three relief appearances with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 62 major league games, including 44 starts, he is 13-17 with a 4.87 ERA.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Dave Legwand and Drake Berehowski scored goals 52 seconds
apart early in the third period as the Nashville Predators beat the Chicago
Blackhawks 4-2 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sebastien Bordeleau and Tom Fitzgerald also had third-period goals for the
Predators, who won their second straight after losing six in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Zhamnov and Doug Gilmour scored for Chicago, which has lost two
straight and is 1-5 in its last six. Chicago star Tony Amonte's goal streak was
snapped at six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Legwand opened the scoring with a power-play goal 28 seconds into the third.
After Nashville's Patric Kjellberg lost the puck in the slot, Legwand slid it
under goalie Steve Passmore from 10 feet.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee Philippine Volcano  </HEADLINE>
   By BULLIT MARQUEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) -- A volcano in southeastern Philippines erupted
early Thursday, spewing fountains of lava and sending superheated ash down its
slopes. Officials urged villagers to flee, warning that a more violent explosion
could occur at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   A cloud of ash and steam rose about two miles above the crater of the
8,100-foot Mayon Volcano, about 215 miles southeast of Manila in Albay province.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 5,000 people had already fled the immediate area, but authorities
urged thousands more living in villages up to five miles away to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology, said that villages along the mountain's southeastern side faces
the greatest threats from boulders the sized of automobiles and deadly
pyroclastic flows -- fast moving, superheated clouds of volcanic ash that can
incinerate anything in their path.
</P>
<P>
	   The eruption began before dawn with lava gushing out of the crater,
accompanied by loud rumblings. Bright orange lava flowed like a river part way
down Mayon's slope and ash rained over several villages. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorists, some with binoculars, stopped on the side of roads to watch the
eruption. Authorities canceled all flights to Legazpi, the airport closest to
the volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   For about a week, the mountain, famous for its cone-like shape, has been
emitting ash plumes and occasional flows of lava.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers boarded army trucks to evacuate as the volcano rumbled. More than
4,920 people from 14 villages had been evacuated as of late Wednesday. But
officials could not immediately say how many more had been taken early Thursday
to emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were suspended in schools used as evacuation centers and in villages
on the mountain's southeastern slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano has been showing signs of unrest since last June, and an
explosion in September forced more than 5,700 people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon's most violent eruption on Feb. 1, 1814, killed more than 1,200 people
and buried an entire town in volcanic mud flows. Its last major eruption in
February 1993 killed more than 70 villagers.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lashes Out at GOP Rivals  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat that John
McCain says he'll ``beat like a drum,'' shot back at his GOP presidential rivals
on Wednesday, saying McCain and George W. Bush ``echo one another in their
efforts to attract the extreme right wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley, also offered dueling new
government programs aimed at attracting the votes of union members and senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore dubbed his plan ``Medi-coverage,'' a repackaging of earlier Clinton
administration proposals plus unlimited new coverage for catastrophic drug costs
resembling a plan Bradley put on the table last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president declared his own proposal the ``third great pillar'' in
American health care -- after Medicare and Medicaid. Bradley dismissed Gore with
a new version of an old Bill Clinton line: ``This is yet another example of the
'Co-opt Kid' at work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, increasingly frustrated by his inability to gain on Gore in polls,
told WCBS-TV in New York, ``I'll propose something and soon as people think it's
a good idea, he'll propose the same thing. It's 'me too.' This act today is not
leadership, it is followership.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an economic address at Columbia University in New York, Bradley advanced
what he called an Earnings Insurance Program to supplement -- through annual
payments of up to $10,000 for three years -- the income of workers who lose
their jobs because of future trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore favor free trade. The AFL-CIO endorsed Gore last fall
despite its vehement disagreement with him over trade. The Painters and Allied
Trades union separately endorsed Gore on Wednesday. Bradley is still hoping for
a breakthrough with rank-and-file workers.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the $35 billion to $40 billion 10-year cost of Gore's added drug
benefit, Bradley proposed using the federal budget surplus to pay the estimated
$200 million annual price tag on his income subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also released a radio ad in Washington state that, for the first
time, moves his harshest criticism of Gore into paid advertising. It says Gore
was a ``conservative congressman'' with an anti-abortion and pro-gun record, and
also points listeners to a new, anti-Gore Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democrats have found it difficult to break into headlines as long as
McCain and Bush have been locked in a nail-biter on the other side of this
year's primary battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Republicans frequently make Gore the target of their barbs.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, in the heart of auto country, Bush knocked Gore for being
critical of the internal combustion engine in a book several years ago. ``I look
forward to him campaigning up here and saying, 'My vision for America is one
where you won't be working,''' Bush said Monday, quoting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   One of McCain's recent TV ads featured him telling a crowd that, in the
general election, ``I'm gonna beat Al Gore like a drum.'' And, rallying
supporters after his victory in Michigan Tuesday night, McCain cried out: ``We
are Al Gore's worst nightmare!''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, while saying he was focused on the Democratic nomination, nonetheless
handicapped the general election in an interview appearing Thursday in USA
Today. Gore described the Republican Party as being ``at war with itself'' and
said Bush and McCain were out of step with the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've jokingly said that if I am the Democratic nominee, I would prefer to
run against whichever one loses,'' Gore said. ``But I think both of them are
going so far to the right that they're on the warning track heading full speed
for the wall.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Gore greeted Floridians at the Boca Raton airport Wednesday, he brushed
off a reporter's question about McCain's ``nightmare'' comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concentrating on the Democratic semifinals and we'll let the
Republicans settle their disputes among themselves,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rejiggered speech to seniors at the Century Village retirement
community, Gore said Bush and McCain both favor ``weakening Medicare'' through
private medical savings accounts, Gore said. And both agree that South Carolina
should be allowed to fly the Confederate flag over its Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They echo one another in their efforts to attract the extreme right wing
and to dismantle some of the protections that we have in our country for seniors
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore last campaigned in Florida on Feb. 8, at another Century Village
community near Hollywood, he praised McCain for proposing that part of the
budget surplus be dedicated to shoring up Medicare for the baby boom's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore share plans to provide Medicare coverage for prescriptions,
but they have bickered over the details.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has proposed that Medicare pay half of an individual's annual drug
costs up to a $5,000 limit in exchange for a $44 monthly premium. Seniors near
poverty would pay no premium or copayment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley proposed a $500 annual deductible, $25 monthly premium and 25
percent copayment.
</P>
<P>
	   From the start, Bradley argued that his plan was better because it gave
unlimited help to senior citizens with the most unwieldy drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the addition Gore advanced Wednesday, once a beneficiary has reached
an annual floor of $4,000 in out-of-pocket prescription expenses, Medicare would
pick up all additional costs.
</P>
<P>
	   From Florida, Gore went to an education forum in South Carolina, where he
was endorsed by Gov. Jim Hodges. He said he was not observing the NAACP-led
boycott of the state over its flying of the Confederate flag, saying national
unity was more important.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Flee Smoldering City  </HEADLINE>
   By GILBERT DA COSTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Charred bodies and burned-out cars littered the
streets of the north-central Nigerian city of Kaduna on Wednesday, as hundreds
of residents fled the scene of two days of religious clashes that left at least
200 dead.
</P>
<P>
	   An overwhelming stench filled the morgue at the main hospital, where dozens
of bodies were piled up on slabs, on the floor, and even the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Smoke wafted from burned buildings and from the remnants of bonfires built
in the streets during the rioting, which erupted Monday morning during a
demonstration by local Christians against a proposal to bring Islamic law to
Kaduna state.
</P>
<P>
	   Guns, cutlasses and other weapons were used in the clashes, said workers
sifting through the bodies at the morgue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People, especially the Christians in my area, were slaughtered like
chickens and goats,'' said Nkechi Nwosu, a Christian, who sought refuge with her
15-year-old son at the Army Referral Hospital. ``I haven't seen anything like
this in the 10 years I have lived in the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police maintained, however, that just 13 bodies had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of thousands of people live in Kaduna, one of the largest cities in
northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds grabbed what belongings they could Wednesday and picked their way
through debris-filled streets to flee the city, most on foot. Others gathered at
police and military facilities for protection.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of fighting Wednesday, but looting continued in some
neighborhoods despite a 20-hour curfew that kept residents inside except between
8 a.m. and noon.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents still in the city raced to the few stores open, stocking up on
supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Police reinforcements were brought in from five neighboring states, and
soldiers fanned out through the city to contain the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are looking for some ringleaders of the crisis who have gone into
hiding,'' said police official Taba Balogun, adding that more than 100 arrests
have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic law, or sharia, has become an increasingly divisive issue in
Nigeria, a nation of 120 million people sharply divided along ethnic, religious
and geographic lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, sharia officially went into affect in neighboring Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. A number of other states in Nigeria's largely
Muslim north -- including Kaduna -- have considered following suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaduna state is about 40 percent Christian.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Gov. Abdulkadir Kure of Niger state, south of Kaduna, signed
into law a sharia bill, and Sokoto state to the northwest followed suit
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kure assured non-Muslims that they would not be tried under the sharia law
and appealed to them to show understanding of the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But such assurances, repeated by sharia supporters in other states, have
meant little to Christians, who fear becoming marginalized or discriminated
against. Their fears are fed by the country's newspapers in the largely
Christian south, which have filled pages with dire warnings of the punishments
Christians will face.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim law prohibits such things as drinking alcohol, and also calls for
separate schools and public transportation for males and females. Islamic courts
were established to hold trials and mete out punishment to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, one man was lashed 80 times in Zamfara state for drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent Nigerian lawyer and human rights activist, Olisa Agbakoba, filed
a suit Wednesday asking the Zamfara state high court to declare sharia
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department issued a statement deploring the violence and loss
of life in Nigeria. ``As Nigeria builds democracy after over 15 years of
military rule, we believe that all citizens must find avenues to work together
to find their common goals,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, an emergency debate in Parliament's lower house degenerated into
a shouting match Wednesday, as Christians and Muslims argued over the
constitutionality of sharia and sought to blame each other for the Kaduna
clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The House of Representatives passed a motion Wednesday condemning the
fighting and supporting the deployment of soldiers to contain the violence. A
hastily added amendment asked the justice minister to refer the question of
sharia to the Supreme Court for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected a year ago after 15 years of
military rule, has remained largely silent on the issue, apparently afraid of
sparking an even larger crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   His only comment Wednesday was to condemn the violence as ``not only
criminal but highly unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need most now is love, caring for each other and joining of hands
to rebuild the nation together,'' Obasanjo said in an address on national
television. ``Let us bind our wounds and accept the challenge of the time.''

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Race 3 Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The 30th America's Cup is turning into a snooze.
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in six days, racing between Italy's Luna Rossa and Team New
Zealand's Black Magic was called off because the weather was too nice on the
unpredictable Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	There was more breeze Thursday than Saturday, when Race 1 was postponed, but
officials felt it was too unstable to start the race. The highest the wind got
was 8 knots at 3:30 p.m., more than two hours after the scheduled starting time.
</P>
<P>
	Friday is an off day, and Race 3 is now scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	Officials had until 4 p.m. to abandon the race, but didn't wait quite that
long. Black Magic, which leads the best-of-9 series 2-0, hitched up for the tow
back to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
	The Italians, badly outfoxed by Black Magic skipper Russell Coutts at the start
of Race 2, used some of the idle time Thursday to do a little practicing. The
sails stayed up on Luna Rossa for several minutes after the postponement, as if
the crew wanted to race, but finally came down.
</P>
<P>
	``The only place we had acceptable wind was in the starting area,'' race
committee chairman Harold Bennett said. ''(Luna Rossa) proved that to us by
sailing up and down in it. Up the course, there was nothing to convince me to do
it and be fair with it.''
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said he spoke with both teams and they would have been happy to race.
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it was my call,'' Bennett said. ``I wasn't happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
	Had the race gone off, there could have been dramatic wind shifts and big wind
holes, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators spent the long delay fishing or swimming.
</P>
<P>
	Massimiliano Sirena was back on Luna Rossa two days after having his head
gashed by the pole the Italians were using to try to clear debris from their
keel on the disastrous first leg of Race 2.
</P>
<P>
	Sirena was taken off the boat to receive stitches, but remained on the water to
watch the rest of the race. He stayed at home Wednesday when Luna Rossa went out
to train on an off day.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Pitcher Pulsipher Collapses  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets pitcher Bill Pulsipher was unconscious and had
difficulty breathing after collapsing on the floor of his bathroom Wednesday,
but was resting comfortably in a hospital later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, who had worked out earlier in the day at the Mets' spring
training complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla., was breathing without aid and all
vital signs were normal, Mets general manager Steve Phillips said on a
conference call shortly before 11 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was in serious condition when he was brought in,'' St. Lucie Medical
Center spokeswoman Ginger King said by telephone. ``He's OK now. He's up,
talking with the staff and walking around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will be treated this evening and will be staying the night for
observation. He will be released in the morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Pulsipher called an ambulance after finding her husband lying on
the floor of the bathroom unconscious around 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The pitcher was taken to the emergency room and had a tube inserted to help
his breathing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was concerning certainly when he had difficulty breathing,'' Phillips
said. ``But as time went on the symptoms relieved themselves and he was feeling
much better.''
</P>
<P>
	   King said the doctors believe they know what caused the problem, but
declined to say what it was.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher had X-rays, blood work and an EKG conducted last week as part of
his annual physical and there appeared to be no abnormalities, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher has had anxiety problems after injuring his elbow in 1995 and has
taken Prozac the past three years to help combat that. He needed to be medicated
Wednesday to calm him down enough for the tube to be inserted.
</P>
<P>
	   The pitcher went through a normal workout during the day, throwing, running
and doing other conditioning exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything was fine other than a slight tweak to his hamstring at the end
of day,'' Phillips said. ``He threw pretty well. There was nothing remarkable
about his workout.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, 26, is in his second stint with the Mets, coming back in January
when Milwaukee dealt him for infielder Luis Lopez. He was one of the favorites
for the fifth spot in the team's starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was uncertain when he can resume workouts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We certainly have to be comfortable there is some understanding about what
happened or at least every effort to understand what happened before he comes
back,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulsipher, one of the Mets' most promising prospects before injuries set
back his career and he was eventually traded to Milwaukee. He was 5-6 with a
5.98 ERA last year in 16 starts and three relief appearances with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 62 major league games, including 44 starts, he is 13-17 with a 4.87 ERA.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Texas Tech 91, Texas 85, 2OT  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM VERTUNO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Plenette Pierson scored 20 points, including four in
the second overtime, as No. 7 Texas Tech survived a scare from unranked Texas
for a 91-85 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierson, who missed free throws at the end of regulation to let Texas
(17-10, 8-6 Big 12) tie it at 70 and send the game into overtime, hit the first
two baskets of the second extra period to put Tech (22-3, 11-3) ahead 85-81.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas's Lindsey Ryan hit a jumper and dumped the ball inside to JoRuth Woods
for a layup to close the Longhorns to 87-85 with 1:06 left before Pierson missed
two foul shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas' Edwina Brown, who led all scorers with a career-high 34 points and
hit three foul shots to tie it at the end of regulation and the first overtime,
came up short on a 10-foot jumper, and the Red Raiders grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Melinda Schmucker-Pharies converted four free throws in the final 20 seconds
to put the game away for Texas Tech. The Red Raiders outscored Texas 10-4 in the
second overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmucker-Pharies, who averages 6.7 points, finished with 14 for the Lady
Raiders. Aleah Johnson added 21 points for Tech before fouling at the end of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown also had a career-high 18 rebounds and went 16-of-19 from the foul
line. Tracy Cook and Woods each added 14 points for Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierson could have iced the game in regulation, but missed two foul shots
with 5.1 seconds left. Texas got the rebound, but still had to go the length of
the court in four seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   After calling timeout, the Longhorns got the ball inbounds to Brown, who was
fouled deep in her own end by Johnson to get to the line. Brown, who was
13-of-13 at the line at that point, rattled both around the rim and in to send
the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown had a chance to win it in the final seconds of the first extra period,
but missed the first of two foul shots before hitting the second to tie it at
81. Brown, who played all 50 minutes, did not score in the second overtime.
