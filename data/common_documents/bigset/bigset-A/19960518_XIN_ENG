<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Expands Cabinet for Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today expanded his cabinet for the third time in a
move described by local observers as an attempt to make his
three-party ruling coalition more stable.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of Deuba, King Birendra today appointed
four cabinet members, making the already grand-sized council of
ministers into a 47-strong one, the ever biggest in Nepal's
history.
</P>
<P>
The four additional cabinet members are Moti Prasad Pahadi
(minister of state for law and justice), Khobhari Raya (assistant
minister for agriculture), Anish Ansari (assistant minister for
supplies) and Bishnu Bikram Thapa (assistant minister for
commerce).
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Deuba expanded his cabinet because he
wants to secure majority support for his ruling coalition in the
powerful lower house in case of any no-confidence vote against his
government.
</P>
<P>
After the Nepali Congress (NC)-led government was formed last
September, its cabinet had already been expanded twice.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Albania Sign Bilateral Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos and his visiting Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi,
signed here today two bilateral agreements aimed at further
developing relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement signed provides for the legalization of
hundreds of thousands of illegal Albanians in Greece as seasonal
workers.
</P>
<P>
The second one concerns the establishment of a Greek consulate
in the southern Albanian city of Korce.
</P>
<P>
In statements after the signing, Pangalos described the
agreement legalizing Albanians in Greece as "useful" for both the
Greek and Albanian economies, noting that it would fill "gaps" in
agricultural production especially during the summer months while
at the same time assisting the economic development of the
neighbouring country.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the consulate agreement, Pangalos said it would
considerably help the further development of economic and trade
relations between the two countries since the second main road
artery between greece and Albanian passed through Korce.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos described the agreement as "historic" because Greeks
and Albanians had lived together for many years in the area.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that with the two agreements "and the brotherly
cooperation which exists between the two countries", a new period
was opening up during which Greece and Albania will be able to
further develop their relations and go forward in a spirit of
peace, friendship and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Serreqi said that the friendship between
the two countries was "tried and tested" and had historical roots.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the friendship and cooperation pact
recently in Tirana by the two countries during the visit of Greek
President Kostis Stephanopoulos, Serreqi said, Greek-Albanian
relations had acquired fresh impetus and a new pace.
</P>
<P>
Serreqi arrived earlier today for a one-day visit to Greece.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Patrol Opens Fire on Greek Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish army patrol opened fire on
a Greek fisherman on the Evros river which forms the two
countries' north-east border, according to an dispatch by the
semi-official Athens News Agency from Alexandroupoli today.
</P>
<P>
the incident took place Thursday in the area of Tychero when
the Turkish patrol unsuccessfully tried to detain Charalambos
Tserkezis, 38, a farmer and amateur fisherman.
</P>
<P>
According to Tserkezis, as he was laying nets near the Greek
side of the river, two shots were fired at him by a five-man
Turkish patrol which ordered him to come over to the Turkish bank.
</P>
<P>
Feigning obedience, Tserkezis headed for the patrol which lost
sight of him momentarily as he approached a small island in the
middle of the river, allowing the fisherman to suddenly change
course and head back to the greek side.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish patrol then fired seven shots at Tserkezis without
hitting him.
</P>
<P>
A Greek army patrol arrived soon afterwards and the Turkish
troops stopped shooting.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
will leave for Paris Monday to attend the signing ceremony of a
Yemeni-Eritrean agreement on accepting international arbitration
to settle their dispute over the Greater Hanish island in the Red
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni and Eritrean foreign ministers will sign the
agreement Tuesday in the presence of their French, Egyptian and
Ethiopian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Through the mediation by France and diplomatic efforts by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Ethiopian President Meles
Zenawi, Yemen and Eritrea agreed on the France-proposed
declaration of principles on international arbitration early this
month.
</P>
<P>
Moussa termed the agreement between Sanaa and Asmara on
resorting to international arbitration as a positive step to
resolve their dispute peacefully and within the framework of
good-neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
France has succeeded in convincing the two sides to accept the
formation of a special three-judge tribunal to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani Thursday announced
his country's willingness to accept any international court ruling
to settle its dispute with Eritrea over the the Greater Hanish
island in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni-Eritrean dispute flared in a two-day battle in
December last year. Eritrean forces took over the Greater Hanish
island, the greatest of the three disputed islands, in the
fighting. The other two islands, Zuqar and Lesser Hanish, remain
under Yemen's control.
</P>
<P>
The islands sit astride major shipping lanes 100 kilometers
north of the Bab el-Mandeb, the southern gateway to the Red Sea.

<HEADLINE> Major Faces Dilemma on Ulster Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
once again appealed today to Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), not to let the chance of peace in
Northern Ireland slip away.
</P>
<P>
Major said reiterated that he wanted Sinn Fein to take part in
the planned all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
scheduled for June 10, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
For that to happen, Major urged Sinn Fein to persuade the IRA
to renew its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have a better chance at the moment of ending that
violence than we have had at any time in the last quarter of the
century."
</P>
<P>
Major promised Thursday that all-party talks in June would not
be blocked by the thorn and sensitive disputes about arms
decommissioning by rival paramilitary groups, mainly the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister in an article written for the Irish Times
newspaper said that arms decommissioning would need to be
addressed at the start of the talks without blocking the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But now the prime minister is facing a dilemma on the Ulster
talks process as his proposals have been seen as concessions to
Sinn Fein and the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet members warned Major Thursday not to make further
concessions to Sinn Fein ahead of all-party talks amid deep unease
within the cabinet and threats of revolt among Tory backbenchers,
according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
At least six Tory members of parliament warned privately that
they would consider resigning the party whip as a final resort.
</P>
<P>
The Tories argued that the promise made by Major would allow
Sinn Fein to attend the all-party talks without the need for any
agreement over the surrender of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet members voiced fears that concerns of the
Unionists in Ulster who strongly defend British rule over the
crisis-laden province were being ignored in a bid to draw Sinn
Fein into the talks.
</P>
<P>
With the Tories' majority in the House of Commons down to one,
any threat of rebellion would be dangerous to the government.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party has warned that the talks would founder
on the first day if the issue of arms decommissioning was not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
The more radical Democratic Unionist Party vilified Major as a
"pathetic man of putty", claiming that Major "eventually gets his
political throat cut" by surrendering to Sinn Fein and the IRA.

HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) allowed it president a possible two terms of
office, the IBF decided at its annual general meeting (AGM) here
Friday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
As a result of the election, two of the existing members were

and Art de Silva of Zambia. The decision widened the geographical
spread of the council, giving the Indian sub-continent its first
ever representation and increasing the African places to two.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Responsibilities of the continental bodies to be increased;
</P>

<HEADLINE> Navy Chief Suicides over Legitimacy of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Chief
of Naval Operations, apparently killed himself Thursday over the
legitimacy of his wearing of two Vietnam combat decorations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said Friday that the U.S. Navy's top
officer committed suicide after leaving two notes lamenting the
coming disclosure by journalists that he had improperly worn two
bronze "V" pins, normally awarded for valor in combat, on
Vietnam-era decorations he received.
</P>
<P>
One of the two notes Boorda left was to his wife and family,
and the other addressed to two friends with instruction to pass
the message to all Navy sailors, the Post quoted Pentagon and
law enforcement sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the message to sailors, Boorda acknowledged he made a
mistake in wearing the "V" pins. He had wrongly thought he was
entitled to them, he said, but worried that some would never see
his action as an honest mistake.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon and police officials said Boorda shot himself in the
chest with a 0.38-caliber revolver while in a yard outside his
quarters in the Washington Navy Yard at around 2: p.m. East
Daylight Time. He died minutes after he was rushed to the D.C.
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred less than two hours after Boorda learned
that the bureau chief of the Newsweek magazine would come that
afternoon to discuss with him why until last year Boorda had worn
the two pins on ribbon decorations, although the official
citations bestowing the ribbons did not explicitly say the pins
had been earned.
</P>
<P>
Retired Marine Lt. Col. Roger Charles, who investigated
Boorda's record for the independent National Security News
Service, said, "It's inconceivable to me that it was a mistake. It
may be a real puzzle to civilians. But it would be a major
embarrassment for someone to be caught doing this."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said the notes suggested Boorda had been
driven to take his life by fear that the reputation of the Navy,
already battered by a series of scandals, would be further harmed
by the disclosures about his medals.
</P>
<P>
The questions about the legitimacy of Boorda's combat ``V''
award came at a time when the Navy has come under fire from
critics for moral lapses, from sexual assault scandal, drug use at
the Naval Academy, to frequent Navy aircraft crashes.
</P>
<P>
Boorda said recently that was determined to move the Navy into
a new era and away from the controversies that dogged it in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who appointed Boorda as Chief of Naval
Operations in 1994, was shocked learning the news of Boorda's
death. Clinton praised him for his work in Bosnia and for showing
"unwavering concern for the men and women" of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry called him "a sailor's sailor."

<HEADLINE> Germany Keen to Invest in Zimbabwe: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Federal Minister of
Economic Affairs Gunter Rexrodt said here today Germany was keen
to invest in and trade with Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Zimbabwe's third largest trading partner after
South Africa and Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing last year of a bilateral investment pact
between the two countries would boost the confidence of German
investors.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe would
attend a major investment conference to be held in September in
Hamburg to promote Zimbabwe as an investment destination for
German investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said the conference would provide an
important opportunity for Zimbabwe to highlight important changes
which had taken place since the country embarked on wide-based
reforms more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
He hoped more German companies would consider investing in
Zimbabwse after the conference.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt added Germany intended to increase its economic links
with southern African countries through a new German-African
initiative aimed at boosting trade.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt arrived in Zimbabwe on Thursday for a two-day business
visit.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will not
withdraw the 1996 constitution amendment bill (the draft
constitution) from parliament, Vice President Godfrey Miyanda
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a television address to the nation, Miyanda said contrary
to local media reports, the bill will go through the house until
it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
The reports in some local news papers claiming that the
government may withdraw the bill are highly misleading and
malicious, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If there are any amendments to the bill, they will only be
passed by parliament, no other body can do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local daily "The Post" reported today that President Frederick
Chiluba, who has given in to pressure, has instructed Vice
President Miyanda to withdraw a clause of citizenship
qualification for presidency from the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
The controversial clause stipulates that only second
generation Zambians are qualified for standing as presidential
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue to strongly
support the application of a policy of principles to the Cyprus
problem, which stands for an independent, territorially integral
and sovereign republic without foreign troops on its soil.
</P>
<P>
This was stated today in Moscow by Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgenii Primakov during a 40-minute meeting with leader of the
Cypriot left-wing opposition Akel party Demetris Christofias,
according to an Akel party announcement here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Russian minister underlined the need
that the Cyprus problem remains within the framework of the U.N.,
especially that of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.N. chief to try harder to make possible a
meeting between the two community leaders for promoting a just and
viable solution to the Cyprus problem based on relevant
U.N. resolutions and the high level agreements reached between the
two sides in 1977 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed the view that a special committee
monitoring the Cyprus problem should be set up by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated Russia's proposal for convening an
international conference on the international aspects of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Primakov sent a letter recently to U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali stressing the need for U.N. action on the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides has described
 the Russian move as "a positive contribution" to efforts towards
a solution to the Cyprus problem, which has remained unsolved for
the past 22 years.

behind in the last inning to beat world championship runner-up
China 7-5 in the preliminaries of the women's softball
International Challenge here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our players became apparently slack after leading 5-2 in the
last inning," said Chinese coach Li Minkuan. "And we had a weaker
pitcher today as our world-class pitcher Wang Lihong was not here."
</P>

China, which beat Australia 2-0 on the opening day Thursday,
raced to a 3-0 lead after the third inning and extended it to 5-0
on a home run by Ou Jingbai in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
After Japan pulled two points back in the fifth inning, Chinese
pitcher He Liping began to hurl slower balls in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
With all three bases filled, Japan surged to lead 6-5 on a
critical home run and added a point taking advantage of another
mistake by He.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Discusses Cooperation with Russian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, who is on an official visit in Moscow, held several
meetings with Russian leaders to discuss "Russia's interaction
with the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
During their almost two-hour meeting in the Kremlin, Ghali and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin "exchanged views on a wide range
of issues connected with the strengthening of cooperation between
Russia and the United Nations," the Press Service of the Russian
President said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed problems of the settlement of crises and
conflicts in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the
press service added.
</P>
<P>
As for the UN's prospects at the turn of the century, Ghali
said the organization with 185 country-members should focus on
global problems which no country can handle single-handed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed Russia's intention to make an ever growing
contribution to the UN activities in different directions.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief also met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov after his
meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Ghali told reporters here after all these meetings that the
Russian peacekeeping presence, with the UN's mandate, in
Tajikistan, Georgia, former Yugoslavia, Angola and on Iraq-Kuwaiti
and Israeli-Egyptian borders reflects a significant role of
Russian diplomacy at the UN and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for a four-day
official visit and is expected to attend a summit meeting of the
CIS here on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Exports Up in 1st 10 Months of 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports during the
first 10 months of the current fiscal year amounted to 225.90
billion rupees (6.75 billion US dollars, an increase of 15.2
percent over the same period of the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures issued by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics, Pakistan's imports during the same period (July
1995-April 1996) totaled 319.38 billion rupees (9.57 billion US
dollars), up 26.1 percent compared with the corresponding period
of the 1994-95 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative trade deficit in the first 10 months of the
current fiscal year stands at 93.48 billion rupees (2.82 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's export target for the current fiscal year is 9.2
billion US dollars. With only two months remaining before the end
of the 1995-96 fiscal year, Pakistan faces a substantial shortfall
in its export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Apart from raw cotton exported by Pakistan for the first time
after a sharp drop in its output during the previous years, most
of the major export items have recorded a substantial decline in
quantitative terms.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that during July 1995 to April 1996, Pakistan's
monthly export value was no more than 675 million US dollars, it
seems to be a herculean task for the country to bridge the gap of
2.45 billion US dollars in the remaining two months.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. is expected
to choose Thailand over the Philippines as the site for its first
major assembly plant in Southeast Asia, which will need 1 billion
U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
The project is the initial step for the leading U.S. motor
company to gain 10 percent of the entire vehicle market in Asia by
2005, according to a report of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that GM's share currently is just 5 percent in a
region dominated by Japanese auto makers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company already has smaller plants in Indonesia and
Taiwan that assemble vehicles for imported kits, and it has an
initial agreement with the Chinese government to build a factory
to assemble midsize cars in Shanghai, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said GM was impressed by the greater maturity of the
Thai market in comparison with that of the Philippines. It also
has a higher per-capita income and a higher rate of growth than
the Philippines, it added.

LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Local Government and
Housing Minister Bennie Mwiinga said today that the government
will construct 2,500 housing units this year.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a statement on the 1996 housing policy at

the 2,500 housing units in five cities and towns has been
completed under a pilot project supported by donors.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga assured MPs that councils will continue building more
houses by using funds from various sources including money from
the financial market.
</P>
<P>
He also urged councils to follow the presidential directive to
sell the existing houses to sitting tenants, adding that the sale
of the council houses will not deprive the councils of any
revenue to construct more houses.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, President Frederick Chiluba gave a
directive that councils across the country should sell its houses
to the sitting tenants at affordable prices.

MONTEVIDEO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries will
make efforts to promote tourism to meet with more challenges and
opportunities in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In the five-day meeting of the 39th Confederation of Tourism
Organizations of Latin America (COTAL), which ended here this
afternoon, the Latin American countries discussed the development
of tourism, air transportation and travel agencies in the next
century.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Latin American tourism ministers also met here
during the meeting and issued a statement to accelerate the
development of tourism in the continent with joint actions between
official organizations and the private sector of tourism.
</P>
<P>
A campaign of corporate promotion with a strategic
commercialization of Latin America as a destination is needed, one
that could give it a solid presence in the main markets of the
world, according to a statement released at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It adds that if the Latin American countries are effectively
integrated, they can promote the production of tourists' souvenirs
and create better opportunities and more jobs.

COTAL should be the adequate environment for joining the public
and private sectors at a continental level, the statement stressed.

his five-day state visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Jiang sent a message to his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak to express his sincere thanks to
Mubarak and the Egyptian people for their hospitability and
considerate arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The message said that during this short but fruitful visit,
the Egyptian people's friendship with the Chinese people gave him
a deep and unforgettable impression.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Party Leader Prods State Trade Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party leader Do
Muoi urged the country's lack-luster state-run trading firms to
spruce up in five years, to secure an edge over their domestic
competitors and prepare Vietnam for participation in international
trade organisations.
</P>
<P>
The party general secretary criticized these firms for failing
to make profit or cater to the public interest and the national
economy, saying that they are no longer a dominant force
influencing market behavior.
</P>
<P>
Competition, which is taking place daily at an intensifying
speed, will decide who will be the final winner between the
state-run and private sectors, he warned at a conference here on
Wednesday, according to the English "Vietnam News" today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's state-owned trading network has been losing ground to
private dealers since it was weaned from yearly subsidies when the
country began moving towards a market-oriented economy in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies have gone bankrupt or been mergered,
leaving others to brave against the growing menace from their
private rivals.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it was time for the state-run trading
businesses to return to their traditional markets through closer
co-ordination with major domestic producers to stabilize the
supply of goods.
</P>
<P>
Besides, employees should also learn market expertise to
conform their activities to international practice.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the state-run trading network should become a major
player in the market so that it could guide other traders toward
socialist-oriented market activities and contribute much to the
modernization and industrialization of the country, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Seeks Closer Ties With Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- With promises from Warsaw to knit
closer business ties, a grand South Korean government delegation
today winds up its four-day mission in Poland, its top trading
partner in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Prime Minister Soo Sung Lee, accompanied by 70
entrepreneurs, started the trip on May 13 in a bid to pry open the
Polish market for Korean products and investment and to elevate
their bilateral relations to a new horizon.
</P>
<P>
After hours of talks with Polish counterpart Wrodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, both sides are
committed to expanding cooperation to cover as many areas as
possible -- political, economic, technological, cultural and
social.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has offered Warsaw soft loans of 50 million U.S. dollars
as well as loan guarantees of 450 million dollars since they
forged diplomatic ties in late 1989. It is ready to pour in more
money, said Soo Sung Lee.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed that bilateral cooperation in
the future will be centered on seeking a perfect match between
Poland's technical know-how and South Korea's capital and jointly
tapping market opportunities in third countries.
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of areas where Seoul and Warsaw can work
together, including the industries of electronics, post and
telecommunications, automobile, aircraft, shipbuilding and
chemicals, Lee and Cimoszewicz pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries topped 540 million dollars last
year. Poland imports textiles and auto from South Korea, and
exports steel and pig iron.
</P>
<P>
Big-time Korean investors, such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG,
have also set an eye on Poland, eager to build modern office
buildings and container factories in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, the No.1 player in the South Korean business circle,
will invest a total of 341 million dollars in two auto plants in
Poland by the year 2000 and 1.5 billion dollars more in early next
century.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Military Personnel to Oversee Ceasefire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that military personnel will oversee the
cease-fire understanding in south Lebanon, according to an Israel
Radio report.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire understanding was achieved between Israel, Syria
and Lebanon through the U.S. mediation at the end of Israel's
16-day military operation against Hezbollah (Party of God) targets
in south Lebanon three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, a monitoring committee consisting of
the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria is to be set
up to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Peres revealed that an agreement to this effect was reached
Thursday night in Washington among the representatives of the
members of the monitoring group following two rounds of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli premier stressed that Syrian officers
will not be allowed to enter the Israeli territories.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if there is a need to enter the Israeli
territories, the American or French military personnel will do
so with the escort of their Israeli counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Peres said, if there is a need for military

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's BNP Party Announces Poll Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- the former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) today released its manifesto for the
coming June 12 general elections, pledging to complete its
unfinished task in turning the country into a happy and healthy
one within the minimum possible time.
</P>
<P>
The BNP was forced to step down on March 30 to hand over the
power to the non-party caretaker government led by Chief adviser
Habibur Rahman to supervise the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the manifesto, BNP chairperson and former prime
minister Begum Khaleda Zia said that the party vowed to take
measures to free the people from the curse of poverty to enable
them to have a taste of better life in economic, social, cultural
and other areas of national life if the party was returned to
power with a majority in the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
Calling the document as "realistic", Khaleda laid particular
emphasis on such issues like poverty alleviation, speedy rural
development, a vibrant and effective private sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides maintaining its liberal and free market economy, the
BNP would provide fiscal, economic and revenue benefits to
business, trade, garments and other industries which underwent
immense losses during the last two years' "unwarranted and
unjustified disruptive political activities", the manifesto said.
</P>
<P>
The party also pledged to protect the constitution and
democratic system, saying that nationalism, democracy and
socialism mean economic and social justice.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, the manifesto made clear that the 25-year
treaty signed with neighboring India in 1972 will not be renewed
while no country would be allowed to use the land, water, sea and
sky of Bangladesh for military purposes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry Takes over Bangkok Bank of Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand
has taken over the Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) to save it from
collapse after heavy withdrawals by depositors during the last 10
days.
</P>
<P>
The run on the bank has seriously jeopardized BBC's operations,
despite full assistance provided by the authorities, including the
central bank, Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As of the start of this year, BBC's capital fund was more than
6 billion baht (240 million US dollars) in the red, the opposition
revealed during the censure debate on May 8-10.
</P>
<P>
The bank has bad and doubtful debts to the tune of more than 40
billion baht (1.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Part of the bad debts is loans to a group of politicians,
including Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen, who was
criticized and questioned by the opposition over his loans from
the BBC and got the least number of supporting votes during the
censure debate.
</P>
<P>
Some coalition government parties have urged Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa to drop Suchart from the government during a
forthcoming reshuffle in late may.
</P>
<P>
The takeover took effect Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The run on the bank was reported to be particularly heavy at
provincial branches.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Shell Guerrilla Targets in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli occupation forces this
afternoon resumed bombardments at suspected guerrillas bases in
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security Sources in the area said that the Israeli forces
shelled vicinities of the villages of Habboush, Wadi Akhdar, Arab
Salim and Ahraj Wazani.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Israeli artillery bombarded the same area
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments came after guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, lunched a bombing attack
at an Israeli patrol in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon this afternoon, in which it claimed several
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
that its fighters detonated an explosive device on the road
between the towns of Jurmuq and Aishiyeh, when the Israeli patrol
was passing by.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas mounted several attacks at the Israeli
occupation forces since this week, drawing rapid responses from
the Israeli forces by air raids and bombardments at Iglim
Al-Toffah, a ridge often used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a spring
board to launch attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed that six Israeli soldiers had been
wounded in these guerrilla attacks in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire understanding, which was reached between Lebanon
and Israel on April 26, deprived Hezbollah of the right to fire
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. But it did not ban the
Shiite militant group from attacking the Israeli occupation
forces in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Backs Sacking of Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament has
approved the sacking of moderate Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic and
elected his replacement.
</P>
<P>
Economist Gojko Klickovic was appointed the new prime minister
of Republika Srpska at an extraordinary session of parliament
which ended early this morning in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Pale, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic, who had maintained good relations with the
international community, was sacked on Wednesday by Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, on grounds that Kasagic's cooperation
with international mediators overseeing the Dayton peace accord on
Bosnia had "endangered the interests of the Serb people and the
nation."
</P>
<P>
Kasagic rejected the sacking on Thursday, saying he would stay
in office until the dismissal was confirmed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
International mediators have refused to deal with Karadzic, a
hardliner who has been an indicted for war crimes, since the
Dayton peace agreement was reached last November.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kasagic, who became premier last December, has been
the Serb leader with whom international mediators have had the
most contact.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said Speaker of the Serb parliament Momcilo Krajisnik
and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha will introduce the new premier,
who was previously responsible for refugee affairs, to the
international community's High Representative for Bosnia Carl
Bildt today.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been a change of prime minister, there would
be no cabinet reshuffle, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Kasagic has been widely condemned by the
international community which views the move as a blow to the
Bosnian peace process. Bildt and NATO officials have said that
they would continue to treat Kasagic as the Bosnian Serbs'
representative.

<HEADLINE> China Whitewashes Indonesia in Uber Cup Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China whitewashed Indonesia 5-0
in group A of the 16th Uber Cup world women's badminton team
championships here Saturday to close their grip on a semi-final
berth.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian team official conceded that he expected their
defeat, but the score should have had a less margin.
</P>
<P>
"We expected to be beaten, but not losing 0-5 today," said Iwan
Setiawan, Indonesia's assistant team manager.
</P>
<P>
China won over underdog Russia in the group's opening matches
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But it was not what was going on at the arena but a surprising
Indonesian line-up that drew the main media concern Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia fielded an under-par side for its first encounter
with China since the tournament opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Susi Susanti, Indonesia's popular sports figure and world
number three, was replaced in the first singles by 15-year-old Mia
Audina.
</P>
<P>
Audina was thought by many as a possible successor to Susanti
after the 24-year-old retires following this summer's Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Audina put up a fearless fight against China's world number one
Ye Zhaoying, but her effort was obviously crippled by her thigh
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Ye took just 22 minutes to wrap up the match 11-4, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
Also on the Indonesian team were Lidya Djaelawijaya, ranked
13th in the world, and 29th-ranked Meluswati, for the other
singles.
</P>
<P>
They all lost their respective matches, Djaelawijaya to
seventh-ranked Wang Chen 2-0 and Meluswati 2-1 to Han Jingna,
runner-up at last year's world championships.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese also won the doubles, with its top-ranked pair of
Ge Fei and Gu Jun defeating Indonesians Eliza and Zelin Rosiana
10-15, 15-9, 15-5 and third-ranked duo Qin Yiyuan and Tang Yongshu
beating Lili Tampi and Finarsih 15-3, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, China's head coach, said he was also surprised by
Indonesia's line-up. "If I were their coach, I would have fielded
a strongest side against China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, we have achieved what had expected for the first
stage of the tournament. From now on, I have to try to get our
team fully fit and well prepared for the semi-finals," he added.
</P>
<P>
China will meet Japan on Monday in their last group match.
</P>
<P>
Setiawan explained the deployment of his players, saying "Susi
was reserved for today since she had been beaten by Ye three times
in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"If fielded, she would feel much pressure on her," he said.
</P>
<P>
Setiawan said he had expected his players for a win in the
second doubles. "But they just lost it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm considering is to have our team well prepared for the
semi-finals, to meet and beat whoever appear there," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the other match Saturday afternoon, Denmark defeated England
4-1 in group B.
</P>
<P>
There would be two more matches Saturday night. Russia is
playing Japan in group A and South Korea is competing against host
Hong Kong in group B.

<HEADLINE> College Bans Student Smoking, Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing college has slapped a
booze ban on students, forcing freshmen to sign a "teetotaller'
clause before being enrolled.
</P>
<P>
Just days ago Beijing imposed a strict ban on smoking in public
buildings, including schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
But the Beijing Physical Education Institute had already
informed all freshmen of the alcohol ban before the new academic
year begun last autumn.
</P>
<P>
All new students had to sign an agreement to abide by the ban,
otherwise they would not be recruited, according to the "Beijing
Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
The school also prohibited students from drinking both in and
out of the campus. Shops inside the school were not allowed to
sell alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team carried out routine checks in classrooms,
students dormitories and stadiums every day. Offenders faced
punishments like disciplinary warnings and expulsions, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive drinking and smoking among students majoring in
sports and physical education have been a headache for managers at
the college.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place among students' general mood of
studying and in behaviour in dormitories," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM inaugurates Upgradation of Karakorum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Development of the Karakorum
Highway reflects strong commitment of the Pakistani government to
accelerate pace of progress and strengthen Pakistan's trade links
with China and the Central Asian Republics.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made today by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto when addressing a gathering on the occasion of ground
breaking ceremony of upgradation of the Karakorum Highway (First
Phase) in Jaglot in the northern part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
She said the Karakorum Highway was the realization of the dream
seen by the late Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, 26
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Karakorum Highway, which was an
impossible task, has been turned into reality, she said, adding it
is manifestation of the great courage and commitment to the cause.
</P>
<P>
The Karakorum Highway was an unprecedented project, and it was
declared eighth wonder of the world by the international media,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister paid rich tributes to the Chinese and
Pakistani engineers who developed the modern "silk route" and gave
their lives for it.
</P>
<P>
She highlighted the economic priorities of her government and
the development programs, with particularly reference to
Pakistan's northern area.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China, Pakistan and Central Asian republics decided at
a conference held in Gilgit, major city in the northern area, that
the Korakorum Highway will be extended for approach of the Central
Asian Republics.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has allocated an enormous amount of
three billion rupees (about 900 million US dollars) for the
project.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Karakorum Highway will usher in a new
era of relations between Pakistan, China and Central Asian
republics.
</P>
<P>
The ground breaking ceremony today was also addressed by
representatives from China, Kirghizstan and Kazakhstan as well as
other Pakistani officials.

<HEADLINE> UK May Double Cattle Cull For Partial EU Ban Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government may double
the number of the cattle to be slaughtered to more than 80,000 to
get its European Union (EU) partners to lift partially the
world-wide ban on exports of British beef products.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission earlier this month has recommended lifting
the ban on British exports of gelatine, tallow and other beef
by-products, but some EU countries have demanded more detailed
measures by Britian to eradicate mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU standing Veterinary Committee, which failed to reach
agreement on the EU proposal earlier this week, is to convene
again on Monday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
A British Agriculture Ministry official has reportedly
indicated that Britain would consider doubling the cattle cull if
the EU veterinary experts agree to implement the EU Commission's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this would add another 40,000 cattle to the
slaughter program," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under an earlier culling proposal, the British government
agreed to slaughter some 42,000 cows likely to be infected with
mad cow disease over 30 months.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry official also said that the latest
British proposal may be put forward at the EU Agriculture
Ministers meeting next week, but this depended on whether the
Veterinary Committee agreed to lift the ban on exports of some
British beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Austria reportedly remain firmly opposed to any
relaxation of the EU ban, which was imposed on March 27 after the
British government admitted that there was a possible link between
mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent, the brain-rotting
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Degraded Environment Endangers Animals, Plants in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Many rare plants and animals in
Vietnam face extinction as environmental degradation threatens the
country's flora and fauna, the Vietnam News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The environmental crisis has been blamed on three decades of
warfare between Vietnam and first France, then the United States,
and on the country's rapid industrialization since the early
1990s, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Recent research found that some varieties of trees, including
sindorasiamensis and afzelia, are in danger of extinction, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Medicinal plants such as coptischinesis and morinda officinalis
are also disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam uses 2,300 of its 7,000 varieties of plants for the
production of food, medicine, wood and oil.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Vietnam has the largest number of endangered
species of animals in Indochina, including big roe deer and a
recently discovered wild cow.
</P>
<P>
The increasing trade in exotic animals and plants has also
accelerated the environmental destruction, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Vows to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani vowed today to get rid of poverty as a basic and
fundamental movement in the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting on poverty, Rafsanjani said that the
movement would be persistently followed until the total removal
of deprivation from the society.
</P>
<P>
According to observers here, the statement by the 62-year-old
president indicates that poverty has become a big social problem
posing a grave threat to the social stability.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, 95 percent of the people earn less than 100 dollars a
month on the average.
</P>
<P>
The economic hardships, especially the runaway inflation, have
led to an increasing rate of crimes such as armed robberies and
theft. Many people have to do three or four jobs in order to
support their families.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said effective steps have been taken to eliminate
poverty, adding that the measures are gradually bearing fruits.
</P>
<P>
The president said that about 26 percent of the rural
population lived below the poverty line in 1995, down from over 48
percent 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the urban residents living under the poverty line
accounted for 12.2 percent of the urban population last year, down
from 47 percent before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Of the total Iranian population, he said, the percentage of
those living below the poverty line also declined from the
pre-revolution 48 percent to about 17 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, many Iranians have argued that their living standards
were much higher and prices were much lower before the Islamic
Revolution, observers said.

Sources say that as an increasing number of climbers tackle the
world's highest mountain, a large amount of non-biodegradable
waste is gathering on both the southern and northern slopes,
arousing international concern about environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
So, more than 70 mountaineers, scientists, and reporters will
stay on the mountain for four days, starting June 5, World
Environment Day, to help increase people's awareness of
environmental protection worldwide.
</P>
<P>
At the base camp, 5,000 commemorative envelopes, postmarked by
the world's highest post office, will be issued to record the
event, and a permanent monument will be erected on the mountain.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Denies Agreement with Denktash on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has rejected allegations by Turkish Cypriot Community leader Rauf
Denktash that he is ready to discuss the issues which the Turkish
side is putting forward.
</P>
<P>
The President also refuted claims about an agreement to begin
direct talks with the Turkish side after the parliamentary
elections on the island to be held on May 26.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Denktash claimed that he was informed that
President Clerides was ready to discuss the controversial issues
of sovereignty, bizonality and political equality.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press today, President Clerides revealed that
he has told U.S. ambassador Richard Boucher that before the start
of direct talks, there should be an approach on decisive
aspects. However, the primary concern should be to secure the
future of the two communities, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This implies that the issues like withdrawal of foreign
troops, the guarantees, the so-called intervention rights,
demilitarization and the creation of an international force with
a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, should be discussed
first," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President added that following these talks, all
constitutional issues will have to be discussed before the two
sides sit down for talks in order to find out if there are any
common views.
</P>
<P>
Clerides is expected to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on
June 18 at the White House to discuss the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Diamond Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- High quality has led to more
exports of Israel's diamond industry, according to a report of
Israel Business made public Today.
</P>
<P>
Israel Business, a bi-weekly business magazine published in Tel
Aviv, said that in the light of the first-quarter figures released
by the Israeli Diamond Institute (IDI) recently, the country's
diamond exports to the world's three major markets registered
steady progress.
</P>
<P>
Shipments to the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong totaled 447 million
dollars, 202 million dollars and 194 million dollars respectively,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The total net exports for the country amounted to 1.1 billion
dollars, compared with last year's first quarter return of 1.05
billion dollars. Net exports in carat terms for the same period
increased five percent to nearly 1.09 billion carats.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the quarterly results, an IDI spokesperson said
the figures indicate movements by the Israeli industry to
process and export higher quality goods. He added that the
production of fancies is also growing as Israeli products cut
more than 70 percent of the world's supply of special
shapes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli trade is spreading its marketing focus to jewelry
store chains, jewelry manufacturers, and buyers of smaller
quantities throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Israel Diamond Exchange is expected to play host to the
27th World Diamond Congress in Tel Aviv on May 26-29. The
presidents of 22 of the world's diamond federations will
attend the congress, which will show Israel's leading role in the
international diamond market.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Deficit Higher Than Expected in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) totalled 3.3 billion pounds (5 billion
U.S. dollars) last month, the Office for National Statistics said
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was more than 400 million pounds (600 million
dollars) down from the same month a year earlier, but still higher
than the 2.8 billion pounds (4.2 billion dollars) which economists
had forecast.
</P>
<P>
The worse-than-expected borrowing figure for April was largely
due to higher-than-predicted spending by government departments
rather than a hole in tax revenues, the chief concern of recent
months.
</P>
<P>
Central government spending was up 7.5 percent from a year ago
last month, compared with the Treasury's forecast of 1.2 percent
for the year as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Last month, revenues were relatively buoyant, increasing
almost 13 percent over the same month a year earlier, which was
more than offset by the unexpected big jump in government spending.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expect the Treasury to overshoot its borrowing
forecast of 22.4 billion pounds (33.6 billion dollars) for this
financial year.
</P>
<P>
But they think that given the political imperative in the
approach to a general election, this will not deter Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke from cutting taxes in the new
budget.

<HEADLINE> World Bank-Funded Project Eases Water Shortage in Changchun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 6.5 million residents of the
capital of northeast China's Jilin Province will no longer suffer
from water shortage, with a new water system, built with World
Bank loans, going into operation today.
</P>
<P>
The city's old water supply system, built half a century ago,
had long ago failed to meet the demands of industrial development,
putting it second among the country's 14 cities that are
"extremely short of water", with a daily shortage of 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The new system was one of Jilin's major projects during the
Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000) and the province's
largest construction project involving World Bank loans. It had a
price tag of 2 billion yuan (some 240 million US dollars), 120
million US dollars of which came from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 km of underground pipe will carry 110,000
tons of water daily from the Songhua River, 160 km to the east of
the city, and also help the city's with sewage treatment. It is
expected, by 2000, to bring the city's daily water supply up to
1.1 million cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the system, work on which started in 1993,
was the most difficult of the six major water projects in China to
build, but it started operation one year earlier than was
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank delegation recently visited Changchun to have a
close look at progress of the project and were quite satisfied
with the speed and quality of the construction work, remarking
that it is rare that such a large project could begin operation
within such a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhongda, chief engineer on the project, said that the
management and construction workers will continue to work hard
during the follow-up work, to make it equal to the world's
standards.

HANOI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Many rare plants and animals in
Vietnam face extinction as environmental degradation threatens the
country's flora and fauna, the Vietnam News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The environmental crisis has been blamed on three decades of
warfare between Vietnam and first France, then the United States,
and on the country's rapid industrialization since the early
1990s, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Recent research found that some varieties of trees, including
sindorasiamensis and afzelia, are in danger of extinction, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Medicinal plants such as coptischinesis and morinda officinalis
are also disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam uses 2,300 of its 7,000 varieties of plants for the
production of food, medicine, wood and oil.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Vietnam has the largest number of endangered
species of animals in Indochina, including big roe deer and a
recently discovered wild cow.
</P>
<P>
The increasing trade in exotic animals and plants has also
accelerated the environmental destruction, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Eating Right Prevents From Student Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Although students' physical
condition has greatly improved in China over the past decade,
thanks to better living conditions, there are still cases of
malnutrition and low body weight, according to a national survey
on students' health.
</P>
<P>
Dieticians and children's health experts developed a menu to
teach parents how to prepare balanced and nutritious means, and,
at an activity publicizing nutrition and health of students that
opened in Beijing today, they noted that if they eat improperly
for a long period of time, malnutrition will result.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 34.7 percent of the male students in
cities and 32.9 percent in rural areas have problems with
malnutrition, as well as 43.8 percent of girls in cities and 38.8
percent in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
A lack of calcium, vitamins and minerals affect the growth of
many children, the survey disclosed, and it is "caused not by lack
of food but people's knowledge about proper diet," explained Li
Tong, a dietician at Beijing Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
She said that children tire easily of regular meals after
eating too many between-meal snacks, and suggested that students
stay far away from high-calorie and fat-rich food, which has
caused too many children to become chubby.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that, among boys in the 7-18 age group, 8.65
percent were overweight, compared with 2.75 percent in 1985. The
percentage of overweight girls in the same age group rose to 7.18
percent from 1985's 3.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggest regular and nutritious meals and more
physical exercise to avoid malnutrition. But parents complain that
the burden of study outside class gives students less time to take
part in sports or to have regular meals.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Generating Unit Put into Operation in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A new 200,000 kw generating unit in
the Baima Power Plant in Neijiang city of southwest China's
Sichuan province, one the State's key power projects, has gone
into full operation.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old power plant started the installation of the
generating unit as a technological transformation project in March
1994 and used a total investment of 760 million yuan. It was
designed and constructed by the provincial power construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
The old power plant had been outdated, with high coal
consumption and severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
The new generating unit is expected to produce an additional
annual electricity output of 600 million kwh and save nearly
107,000 tons of coal yearly. Moreover, its smoke discharge volume
will be only one tenth that of the original power plant before the
technological transformation.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Ready to Form Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
with just a month to go before presidential elections, said today
that he is prepared to form a coalition government to include
"representatives of all parties," Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning in the central Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk,
Yeltsin told a rally of supporters: "I am ready to unite with
anyone" and to set up a coalition government embracing
representatives of all parties and movements.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after a setback in
consultations with the so-called "Third Force" candidates on
forming an alliance to fight the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Third Force, comprising liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov and retired general
Alexander Lebed, has fallen apart over whether to support the
president's bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said last Saturday that he was joining forces with
Yavlinsky and the Third Force.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky later the same day said that he had neither the
intention nor the desire to ally with the president. The next day,
he said he would contest the election alone.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said today that he had offered Yavlinsky the post of
the first deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs in
his future government.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky said he would give up his candidacy and call on
his supporters to back Yeltsin only if he is made prime minister,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven candidates are running for the Russian presidency, but
none looks likely to win the election alone.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov has suggested that 30 to 40 percent of the government
portfolios should go to the Communist Party and the democratic
camp respectively.
</P>
<P>
His proposal has been backed by the Russian Communist Party led
by Yeltsin's strongest rival, Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,
has also suggested that all 11 candidates should share power in a
coalition government.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Localization of Civil Servants in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Certain progress in the localization
of civil servants of the Macao government has been made during the
past decade, but the localization procedure still needs to be
quickened as only three and a half years remain before the
transition of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration
on the Question of Macao in 1987, the number of civil servants
speaking Chinese rather than Portuguese has increased. Local
Chinese civil servants also have more training opportunities and
certain law and regulations on the localization have been made as
well.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil servants has been deemed one of the
three leading issues to be settled during Macao's transitional
period before 1999 when China resumes exercise of sovereignty over
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the Joint Declaration, the majority of
the civil servants were from Portugal, and almost all the middle
and senior positions were held by Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the Macao Government has taken a series
of measures to localize the civil servants.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Macao Government at the
end of 1994, among the 629 officials above the rank of head of
sub-group, there were 160 civil servants whose mother tongue is
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira recently ordered that civil
servants of the rank of section chief and head of group should be
localized by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
The ranks of civil servants of Macao Government are roughly
divided into five categories, namely, head of department, head of
office, section chief, head of group and head of sub-group.
</P>
<P>
The government has also strengthened the training of civil
servants during the past decade. Courses like administration, law
and translation have been opened in the University of Macao, the
Science and Engineering Institute of Macao and some other training
institutions. A special school for the training of senior
security officers has been established as well.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has chosen and sent hundreds of
civil servants to Beijing or Lisbon for further training in
language or administration. More than 200 people have been trained
in Portugal and some 300 trained in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Localization of Civil Servants in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of law and regulations have been issued to
guarantee the localization procedure.
</P>
<P>
The law to recognize non-Portugal-issued diploma, for instance,
made it possible for Macao citizens who own Chinese or other
diploma to take up government positions. Currently, about half of
the 2,000 bachelor's degree-holders among Macao civil servants are
local citizens.
</P>
<P>
The government also revised several laws and regulations to
allow more local citizens to have the chance of entering the
middle or senior positions. Those rules include the setting-up of
assistant positions, promulgation of law on promoting people
speaking both Portuguese and Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, the localization process still needs to
be quickened in view of the fact that only three and a half years
remain before the transition of power. Local communities and the
Chinese side have made repeated statements, urging the government
to step up the localization pace.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch said
that although progress has been made, it is imbalanced in
different departments of the government and still lags far behind
the requirements for a smooth transition of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of Chinese-speaking local citizens among the
senior positions of the government remains quite small, and that
is inconsistent with the proportion of the Chinese population
among Macao's residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil servants has been deemed a top
concern and a prerequisite to Macao's smooth transition. It is
also crucial to the other two major issues -- the localization of
law and the use of Chinese as an official language.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Macao Government would make further effective
measures for the localization process," the Xinhua official
said. "In this way the handover of power in 1999 would be
conducted in a stable and orderly way."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Briefed on Thai Investment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Board of Investment
(BOI) today arranged a report session on Thailand's investment
policy for visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party.
</P>
<P>
BOI Secretary General Staporn Kavitanon told his Chinese guests
that Thailand divided itself into three investment promotion
zones, each enjoying different degrees of investment privileges.
</P>
<P>
Investors in Zone 1, which includes Bangkok, already a crowded
and much-polluted metropolis, and five adjacent provinces, get the
least privileges, while those in Zone 3, which incorporates 60
remote and least developed provinces, are offered the most
favorable treatment among the 76 provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
By zoning the country, BOI hopes to encourage investment to
inland provinces and give promotional favors for export-oriented
factories.
</P>
<P>
BOI also encourages Thai businesses to invest in foreign
countries and solicits foreign investment into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
When approving projects, BOI also considers their environment-
friendliness and their technological level.
</P>
<P>
BOI is a government agency chaired by the prime minister, which
has been involved in promoting investment in the country for over
30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier listened to the briefing with great
interest.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier today to Thai reporters that the Chinese
government also encourages Chinese business people to make
investment in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier and his party are on a week-long
official visit to Thailand, which will conclude on May 22.

<HEADLINE> Zhenjiang Customs Sends Back Garbage from Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhenjiang Customs has returned 50
tons of garbage which was transported by a Taiwan businessman from
Hong Kong in violation of Chinese regulations
</P>
<P>
The 50-ton consignment of waste was shipped in three containers
from Hong Kong to Zhenjiang in November and December last year
claiming it as imports of "abandoned plastic products" for
processing.
</P>
<P>
Nobody applied for import procedures after the garbage arrived
at the Zhenjiang harbor for more than three months.
</P>
<P>
The Zhenjiang Customs officers opened and investigated the
three containers which were regarded as having no owners.
</P>
<P>
Abandoned badly smelling plastics, rotten bronze and iron,
parts of sewing machines and mud were found inside the containers.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Provincial Bureau for Environment Protection made a
thorough investigation of the case, saying that the case has
violated the 25th Article of the Law on Environment Protection and
Control of Solid Waste Pollution of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
The bureau urged the shipping agent responsible for the waste
to send back the garbage according to the 66th Article of the law
and concerned regulations of Jiangsu provincial document on
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Zhenjiang Customs finally made the decision to send back the
garbage in accordance with the suggestion and regulations of
customs law.
</P>
<P>
The garbage was returned to Hong Kong on May 10.
</P>
<P>
It was found that a Taiwan businessman entrusted a
Zhenjiang-based joint venture to apply for importing abandoned
plastics for processing.
</P>
<P>
Zhenjiang Customs, finding that the joint venture was not
qualified for processing plastic products, and had no license
given by environmental department, refused the venture's
application.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan businessman, now missing, still forced the
transportation of the waste and but did not dare declare it to the
customs.
</P>
<P>
The waste did not cause any harm to the local environment, said
local officials.

<HEADLINE> US: Main Offender in Dumping Waste to China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The US has become the main country
to dump its waste and garbage to China in recent years, according
to the Shandong provincial administration for inspection of import
and export commodities today.
</P>
<P>
An administration official noted that, in recent years, the
rate of substandard waste paper imported to Shandong from the US
has been high, with some of it containing impurities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent incident, which has arouse wide concern
in China, involved garbage brought to Beijing via Qingdao port and
is not the only case, but has happened several times.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1990, he said, a local foreign trade company agreed to
import eight containers of waste paper from the US's Full Shine
Enterprise Co., which contained 348 items, weighing 200 tons, and
was valued at 30,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the first four containers arrived, on July 25, 1990, they
were found to contain a lot of worn clothes, underwear, polluted
clothing, plastic, wood, mud, and other urban waste.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious thing was that there was a very rotten dog in
the waste," the official said.
</P>
<P>
A hygiene check had revealed that there were 110,000 to 450,000
germs in every square cm of the waste.
</P>
<P>
The US exporter admitted their mistake and said they would not
do it again.
</P>
<P>
But last July, the same company exported another load of waste
to China, which arrived in Qingdao a few days before the load
later shipped to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A hygiene check found that the so-called No. 3 waste paper,
weighing 470 tons, contained a lot of urban waste, which experts
said was even worse than those shipped to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These included many plastic bags, oil drums, cans, worn leather
shoes, and clothes that exceeded standards several hundred-fold.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese importer has held several rounds of negotiation
with the US company, but it has yet to find a solution.

<HEADLINE> US: Main Offender in Dumping Waste in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official said China has had rapid development in its paper
industry and to keep costs low has mainly imported waste paper
from the US, giving rise to the impure waste problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Shandong administration checked on 32 loads, of
10,566 tons of American waste paper, of which 15 loads, or 40,000
tons, were below standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the administration checked on 36 others, of 17,000
tons, in which two, of 1,249 tons were below standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, there were 42 loads in Shandong, of 20,850 tons, with
four, of 12,490 tons, below standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, there were 93 loads, or 28,775 tons, of which seven,
or 3,200 tons, were below standards.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the imported US waste paper amounted to 125 loads,
or 32,615 tons, of which nine, or 2,940 tons, failed to meet the
standards.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, Shandong had 17,167 tons of
US waste paper in 62 loads, of which two, or 9,700 tons, were
below standards.
</P>
<P>
There was also some waste paper imported from the US, but not
reported to customs, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Such a large sum of impure waste imported from the US, the
official said, is not a simple question of some unscrupulous
businessmen reluctant to keep promises.
</P>
<P>
There may be some other factors involved in the cases, he
added, noting that exports fall under the jurisdiction of US
customs and the government should be held responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
The official urged the US to control the waste exports to other
countries better.

<P>
Zhu said that in recent years trade and investment between
China and Thailand have developed rapidly and that the two
countries are economically very complementary.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said there has been more cooperation
rather than competition between the two countries.

had a long history of friendship and there have been no disputes
between the two nations.

Talking about future Sino-Thai economic cooperation, Zhu cited
hydroelectric power generation, thermopower stations, development
of the upper reaches of the Mekong River basin, as well as the
trans-national railway from Singapore up to China's Kunming.

In the security fields, Zhu said that China supports Thailand
in all its efforts to safeguard peace, stability and prosperity in
the region in particular and the world at large.

the People's Republic of China as the only representative of China
and being opposed to "Taiwan independence."

issues.

</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Sino-ASEAN Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that there is more economic cooperation
than competition between China and Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with representatives of the local media, Zhu
said that China and ASEAN nations enjoy good friendly and
cooperative ties, which have been developing well.
</P>
<P>
A considerable portion of China's foreign trade is done with
member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
China supported ASEAN's activities for peace, stability and
prosperity in the region in the past and will do so in the future,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there is competition in the area of trade between
China and ASEAN nations, Zhu replied that the competition, if any,
is quite limited because of the difference in the industrial
structure and the highly complementary economies between China and
ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
Their complementarity is greater than competition, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji said that such limited competition will help China
and ASEAN countries to improve their own products and enhance the
competitiveness of their products in the world market.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that exports of products in the same
categories to Western countries from China and ASEAN nations are
not too much.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said that there is also no competition
between China and ASEAN countries in drawing foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN nations all have good investment environments
and Western investors are competing among themselves in seizing a
bigger share in the Asian market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that economic cooperation between
China and ASEAN will continue to develop in the future.

<HEADLINE> HK Experts Study Genes of Crops for Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables and rice crops may
gain higher nutritional value when their genes are changed,
according to a report in today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Professor Sun Saiming from the Chinese
University of Hong Kong plans to set up a plant gene center of
about 10 scientists to serve the region with crops that are
healthier for humans, while having tougher resistance to disease
and being more suited to local weather.
</P>
<P>
Sun said cross-breeding of current supercrops had reduced the
gene pool and nutritional value in search of resistance to
temperature and disease, so other genes needed to be introduced
for improvement.
</P>
<P>
His research has already proved that nutritional genes could be
added safely to tobacco plants as test models. Now it is time to
experiment on real crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he could steal a march on work being done worldwide by
targeting crops that matter in this region, such as soya beans,
rice and Chinese-style vegetables.

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The first and biggest integrated
broadcast service company in Asia, the Asia Broadcast Center,
opened here today to provide "an effective link" between
programmers and millions of television viewers throughout the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The 30-million-US-dollar Asia Broadcast Center (ABC) said that
it is the region's largest independent full-service hub for
television program production, post-production, playback and
satellite transmission.
</P>
<P>
The company is a joint venture between Singapore's Yellow River
Network and the US-based Group W Network Service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Singapore Communications
Minister Mah Bow Tan said that the world class support services
that ABC provides will enhance Singapore's creative and
technological capabilities.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the center, Mah said that programmers
interested in setting up here would no longer need to invest
heavily in infrastructure and equipment. Instead, they could now
concentrate on packaging programs and leave the technical
broadcast operations to service providers like ABC, he said.
</P>
<P>
With state-of-the-art facilities, ABC is now one of the few
all-digital broadcast facilities in the world, offering fully
digital production and post-production services, including editing
of culturally sensitive material, dubbing and graphics, the
company said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Arranges Press Tour of Disputed Islets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BODRUM, TURKEY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today arranged 75
local and foreign journalists to tour the waters around the
disputed twin islets of Kardak, or Imia, amid tensions caused by
low-altitude flying of Greek jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to a Greek plan to take European
Union (EU) journalists based in Athens to the same area on the
same day, which seriously angered Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and foreign pressmen boarded two tourist yachts at the
Aegean holiday resort of Bodrum, very close to the Kardak, and
traveled to the waters near the twin islets at 11:00 local summer
time (08:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
A Turkish coast guard vessel and two Turkish assault boats
escorted the journalists, who were invited by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The journalists were briefed by Turkish Foreign Ministry
officials on the dispute of Kardak, which led to a military
standby between Turkey and Greece last January.
</P>
<P>
The two yachts stayed in the area for about half an
hour along with several boats rented by Turkish private
televisions.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek jet fighters, including F-16 and Mirage,
made low-altitude flying overhead, which was described as
"military show" by Turkish officials abroad the yachts.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the Greek jets violated Turkish airspace
and They would lodge a protest against the violation.
</P>
<P>
Both Greece and Turkey had planned to carry journalists by
military vessels to the disputed area but later gave it up
in an apparent bid to prevent any military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Turkish vessels left the area at 11:30 (08:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Turkey's Anatolia news agency, a
Greek vessel carrying EU journalists reached the area at 10:15
(07:15 GMT) for a similar information tour.

<HEADLINE> US Sanctions Against China Will Not Work: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that US sanctions against China will not
work and that the only solution to the intellectual property
rights issues (IPR) is through consultations between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to a question raised by a Thai reporter, Zhu said
the Chinese government has made a lot of efforts to protect
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
He said China's legislature on intellectual property rights
(IPR) has reached world standard and the Chinese government is
determined in crackdown on IPR infringements.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, the US side is ill-advised to have resorted to
sanctions against China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said economic sanction has been an out-of-date way of
approaching problems.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that since the US announced its sanction decisions
against China, much of the world opinion has not favored the US
decision.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the American people, including middle-income
Americans and retailers, will be hurt by the decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said trade sanction is a double-edged sword, which can hurt
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that he was not implying that IPR infringements do not
exist in China. He said this problem occurs in many countries in
the world, including the US. What is important is the attitude of
the government.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Chinese government is resolute in its
protection of IPR and in the enforcement of related laws.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the issue could be resolved through
negotiations between the two sides and a trade war be averted.
</P>
<P>
Talking of China's founder status in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Zhu said that the reason why the issue has not
been resolved to this day is that the US has politicized the issue
and demanded that China assume its obligations as a "developed
nation."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the US demand on the issue is unreasonable and is
therefore unacceptable to China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier is on a week-long official visit to
Thailand at the invitation of the Thai government from May 16 to
22.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the second leg of his three-nation tour in
Southeast Asia. He has visited Indonesia and will fly to Malaysia
from Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Professor Asks President for Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has been asked by a controversial thinker to
ensure his life safety against repeated onslaughts by extremists
on university campus, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abolkarim Soroush, a British-educated and liberal-minded Moslem
with a doctorate in pharmacology, published his letter to the
Iranian president in today's Persian daily Akhbar, shouting out
"help" in the political center of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Soroush has attracted much attention from the educated class
in Iran, particularly in academic circles where the war focusing
separation of politics from religion has being fought between him
and his opponents.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Rafsanjani, Soroush also asked for help
vis-a-vis government organizations and agencies that openly
condone Ansar Hezbullah's violence against him.
</P>
<P>
He complained that because of intimidation by "pressure groups
and their supporting press" no institution is ready to offer a
teaching job to him.
</P>
<P>
Soroush, who has been at the center-stage of academic
debates on the separation of religion from politics, said that
his life has been in danger and normal living has been
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
"The Information Ministry with its threats and repeated summons
have made life very hard for me," he wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Soroush returned to Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution and
held some official positions such as membership in
the Supreme Council on Cultural Revolution before he became a
persona non grata for his views on Islam, pluralism and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the Iranian scholar claimed
that his life was in danger. In January, He attacked Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati for making statements that would
further endanger his life in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Velayati told a group of students that liberal thinker
Abolkarim Soroush pursued the same goals as another
controversial thinker Ahmad Kasravi who was stabbed to death by
a religious zealot in the fifties.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Soroush accused Velayati of "jumping on the bandwagon"
in a massive campaign by the Iranian regime to discredit
him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ansar Hezbullah, a hardline fundamentalist group, also
published in today's daily their letter to the Iranian
president, defending their official positions against the scholar.
The extremists accused Soroush of trying to propagate secular
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, some extremists from the Ansar Hezbullah
intruded into the university campus and stopped a scheduled
speech by Soroush by beating some students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group held frequent demonstrations in Tehran
University, mosques and other public places in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, some 500 university students voiced
their anger and lodged protest over extremists' violence on
campus in Tehran this week.
</P>
<P>
Students of Sheriff Technical University sent their open letter
to Iranian authorities, demanding stringent measures to prevent
any violent behavior by Ansar Hezbullah, a riotous and
frightening group in Iran.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State on Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher alleged today that Washington did not want a trade war
with China, though it published a list of large-scale trade
sanctions earlier this week because of a dispute over the
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
He once again threatened that the United States would go ahead
with the sanctions unless its requirements are met before the June
17 deadline. "No one should doubt that we will fully protect our
interests," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has given China 30 days to avoid
punitive tariffs on 3 billion U.S. dollars' worth of apparel,
electronic equipment and other exports by proving its readiness to
stop the alleged illegal copying of American movies, musical
recordings and computer software.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral move taken by the United States prompted China
to counter-retaliate in defense of its national interests.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the New York-based Asia Society, the Council on
Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China
Relations, Christopher said, "While we seek dialogue and
engagement to manage our differences with China, we will not
hesitate to take the necessary action to protect our interests."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he voiced Washington's continuous commitment to the
one-China policy, which he said has been the foundation for
deepening engagement between the two countries since 1972.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed support for continuing most-favored-nation
(MFN) trading status with China, saying that "renewing the MFN
unconditionally is the best way to advance American interests."
</P>
<P>
A similar commitment was made by President Bill Clinton
Thursday evening when he mentioned his desire for better relations
with China.

<HEADLINE> Prospect of Punishing Bombing Criminals Arouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The expected execution of four
Saudis charged with a 1995 bombing attack aroused concerns among
Americans living in Saudi Arabia who fear that terrorist
sympathizers of the criminals would stage retaliation attacks
against them, local press reported said today.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers quoted a U.S. State Department announcement
as saying that the American Embassy in Riyadh received an annonymous
telephone call threatening retaliation against U.S. interests if
the four were punished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the embassy and consulates also received "drawings
that imply bomb threats against American personnel or
institutions, including the Saudi-American International School."
</P>
<P>
A car bomb killed five Americans and two Indians at a
U.S.-run Saudi National Guard training center in Riyadh last
November.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia said last month it arrested four Saudis for the
bombing. The four confessed on state television to their
involvement in the attack and said they were influenced by Islamic
groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and residents in the kingdom say the four would
likely be beheaded, the punishment for murder and drug
trafficking under Saudi Arabia's Islamic sharia.
</P>
<P>
An American was quoted as saying that "there is concern
among many Americans here" although there was no feeling of
panic following the arrest and conviction of the four
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Threats received by the U.S. Embassy and consulates also
warned the Americans to "watch out for your kids," which caught
everybody's attention, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department urged Americans in Saudi Arabia to
be cautious, appear less in public, reduce travel in the country
and treat mail received from unfamiliar sources with suspicion,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Since the November bombing, many of the residential compounds
of villas where Americans live have been put under strict security
 vigilance under the protection of the Saudi National
Guard.

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A huge, mountain-outlined sleeping
buddha has been discovered in north China's Buddhist mecca, Mount
Wutai of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
With its contour over 3,000 meters, the buddha lies along a
ridge between the Puhua Buddist monastery and Nanshan Monastry.

Mount Wutai, formerly named as Mt. Wutai Pancasirsha in
Buddhist sutras, is one of the four Buddhist holy sites in China.
Every year hundreds of thousands of Chinese buddhist worshippers

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Attacks Again On Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of a Kenyan opposition
FORD-Asili, Kenneth Matiba, has renewed his attack on Asian
community in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The attack contained in a 14-page policy document on the Asian
question, issued here on Friday. In the document, Kenneth Matiba
described the Asian (Indian and Pakistani Origin) community as
having no interests of Kenya at heart.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his warning that he would stop what he called
their "exploitativeness" if he came to power.
</P>
<P>
Kenya held the first multi-party General Election in 1992, and
the next General Election is expected to be held in early 1997.
During the campaign for the first multi-party General Election,
the FORD-Asili chairman warned that he would expel Asians if he
won the election.
</P>
<P>
In the document entitled "The Asian Question", Matiba said,
"The issue I am disussing is very grave indeed. You drive round
Nairobi, and what you see is that all the shops are owned by
Asians."
</P>
<P>
He declared that Asian community members must be vetted and
action should be "taken in order to save future Kenya generations
from slavery".
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the document, A.N. Shah, an Asian Prominent
businessman told today's local paper "East African Standard" that
Matiba's utterances were "terrifying".
</P>
<P>
He said it was terrifying to hear those remarks coming from
Matiba and "our community members are very worried."

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution Caused by Sunken Boat Brought under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Water pollution on east China's
Bohai Sea, caused by leaking oil from a sunken fishing boat, has
been brought under control, according to sources with the China
Maritime Search and Rescue Center (CMSRC).
</P>
<P>
The "Zhepuyuyou 31" boat was carrying 480-tons of engine oil
when it collided in thick fog with a ship of an unidentified
nationality in the early morning of May 1.
</P>
<P>
The boat was seriously damaged in the middle part of its body,
allowing the oil to leak.
</P>
<P>
The boat's 11 crewmen escaped from the sinking boat after the
collision, and were rescued by a nearby vessel.
</P>
<P>
The rescue center asked its branches in Liaoning and Shandong
provinces, which are closest to the spot, to recover the boat as
soon as possible, after it was informed of the collision.
</P>
<P>
But rescue work was delayed because of heavy fog. A Chinese
Navy "631" submarine arrived at the spot on the afternoon of May
1, and found that the fishing boat had sunk below the surface.
</P>
<P>
The submarine also detected a two kilometer long and 200 meter
wide oil slick near the spot, which continued to grow as oil
poured out from the boat.
</P>
<P>
About 15 ships and an airplane were mobilized by CMSRC to the
spot, helping clean the oil floating on the surface of the
sea. But there were many other ships and vessels sailing through
the polluted waters nearby, hampering the clean-up operation.
</P>
<P>
All of the located oil slicks have been cleaned, but the
rescue vessels are trying to find whether there are other new oil
slicks, in order to ensure all the polluted waters are cleaned.

<P>
Speaking during the ground-breaking ceremony of phase two of

<HEADLINE> Two Top Hamas Activists Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
arrested two top activists of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or
Hamas, in the West Bank town of Hebron, according to an Israel
Radio report today.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday night, Israeli border police stopped and searched
the car Hassan Salameh and Razak Rajoub were driving. Salameh
tried to run away, but was shot and captured.
</P>
<P>
Salameh, deputy of Hamas military wing leader Mohammed Dief,
is suspected of planning three suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem and at the Ashkelon junction in February and March,
which killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
He had been a fugitive for a long time, and his capture
has been a top priority for the Israeli security forces, but
he managed to escape on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to the Aliya Hospital in Hebron where his
conditions were described as serious.
</P>
<P>
According to a visitor to the hospital, Salameh said upon his
arrival to the hospital that he wanted to be a martyr and not to
be arrested by the Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Salameh fled to Egypt from the Gaza
Strip in 1990, and received military training in Syria and Sudan
before returning home six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rajoub, who was driving the car at the time,
is a brother of Jibril Rajoub, the head of the Palestinian
Preventive Forces in the West Bank, and also a well-known
Hamas activist in the Hebron area.
</P>
<P>
Jibril reportedly visited the Aliya Hospital early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The report added that in the search of the car, Border police
found a Uzi sub-machine gun, a pistol and ammunitions, as well as
sets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, it was disclosed that Israeli security
forces arrested Akram Salameh, brother of Hassan Salameh, in
April when he returned to Gaza following a trip to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly supplied a great deal of information to his
investigators on his brother's activities, which probably could
have led to the capture of Hassan Salameh Friday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Tin, Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and
rubber markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with tin and CPO
prices getting lower with rubber price higher.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed the week lower this
week in thin trading due to profit taking activities and lack of
foreign buying interest.
</P>
<P>
Tin price dropped 10 sen to 15.93 Malaysian ringgit (about 6.37
US dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week dropped to 419 tons against 458 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
Crude palm oil physicals closed the week lower in sluggish
trading following bearish stock figures released here by the
country's palm oil registration and licensing authority this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, Malaysia's April palm oil stock rose
1.12 percent to 695,427 tons from 687,710 tons last March.
</P>
<P>
The price for May South stood at 1,290 ringgit (about 516
dollars) per ton compared with last week's 1,310 ringgit (about
524 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market closed higher this week
over fears of disruption to rubber supplies due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in northern Malaysia and southern Thailand prompted
a price hike and players were active in the market.
</P>
<P>
The price for June RSS1 rose to 377 sen (about 1.5 dollars) per
kg from 369.5 sen (about 1.47 dollars) per kg, while SMR20 was one
sen higher at 328.5 sen (about 1.31 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here also said the strong performance of the other
regional markets gave additional support to the market.

JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat has sworn in 21-members of his recently
formed cabinet in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of them took an oath on the Koran while Elias Freij,
Mayor of Bethlehem, laid his hand on the Bible.
</P>
<P>
Each of them said: "I swear by my mighty God to be faithful to
the homeland and to the people to preserve the constitution and
carry on my duty honestly and faithfully and the God is my
witness."
</P>
<P>
One member, Intisar Wazir, was unable to attend because Israel
had suspended her VIP pass which enables her to travel between
the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israel claimed that the punishment
came after she took two students without passes from Gaza in
violation of the closure.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he will name additional members in the coming
days and present the full cabinet to the legislative Palestinian
Council (PC) within 10 days for a vote of confidence.

<HEADLINE> IMF Cancels Disbursement to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has cancelled a 100 million US Dollars disbursement for
Zimbabwe's economic reform program due to missed targets and has
ruled out any new funding negotiations until after the next
budget in July, according to the Financial Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Jurgen Reitmaier, who heads the Southern Africa Department of
the IMF from Washington said yesterday in Harare that Zimbabwe no
longer qualified for further financial support because it
remained ''off target'' in reducing its budget deficit and
continued to finance loss-making parastatals.
</P>
<P>
''There is nothing to release. The 100 million US Dollars has
lapsed because the IMF program expired in September 1995 before
Zimbabwe could meet certain major targets,'' he told the
Financial Gazette in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe now needs to make a fresh application which needs
new negotiations. There are no negotiations now. we are here to
help the Zimbabwean government analyze the situation and advise
on budget procedures,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Vows to Make Weishanhu Lake Cleaner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
speeding up its work to eliminate pollution in Weishanhu Lake, the
largest freshwater lake in northern China, by cleaning up the
local environment.
</P>
<P>
The lake, consisting of the four small lakes of Nanyang,
Zhaoyang, Dushan and Weishan, covers 1,266 sq km.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which is rich in water plants, fish and other aquatic
resources, has suffered serious pollution since the
1980s. Especially, no grass, fish or shrimps can been seen in the
10,800-ha polluted water area.
</P>
<P>
Pollution in the lake also threatens irrigation, and the
drinking water of livestock and people as well as industrial
production in nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
Jining City, located in the area irrigated by the lake,
launched an anti-pollution program last year, urging 34
enterprises which are major polluters to reduce their pollutants
within a fixed period of time. Ten of them have so far done so.
</P>
<P>
The city also has closed 63 paper mills and some 100
electroplating workshops, which produce serious pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Universities and colleges in
northeast China have learned a valuable lesson - in running highly
successful off-shoot businesses.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 scientific and technical achievements developed
by colleges and universities in Liaoning province have have been
used by local enterprises in the past five years, bringing
noticeable profits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government department has set up a 20 million
yuan risk investment fund for scientific and technological
developments at local higher-learning schools, in a bid to support
high-tech industries run by colleges.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technical-intensive enterprises run by colleges
and universities in northeast China's Liaoning province realized
480 million yuan in sales income and more than 60 million yuan in
pre-tax profits in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province's 61 colleges and universities have established
222 scientific and technical industrial entities, accounting for
the total number of enterprises run by local schools of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
At present, three colleges in the province have signed
contracts to develop more than 30 high-tech programs, including
new materials, information technology, and automation techniques.
</P>
<P>
The colleges have developed a group of high-tech products and
expect to put them into production. A code bar system, developed
by the Shenyang Engineering Institute, produces 200 million yuan
in output value annually.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, computer software and dryers of the Northeast China
University, air-wave refrigerators of the Dalian Engineering
University, and non-corrosion iron plating technology of the
Dalian Maritime University have become four major pillars of
college high-tech industries in the province.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Maker Wins U.S. Supercomputer Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Science Foundation
(NSF) of the United States has planned to buy a supercomputer from
Japan's NEC Corp., which will be the first such purchase by the
government from a Japanese company, said NSF on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the foundation said that it had evidence that NEC had
offered the computer at a price below cost, supporting accusations
by several congressmen and Cray Research Inc., NEC's U.S. rival
for the supercomputer contract, according to a report by the New
York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The awarding of the supercomputer contract, which is worth 13
million to 35 million U.S. dollars, had been closely watched as an
indicator of U.S. trade policies.
</P>
<P>
The award was critical to Cray, with thousands of U.S. jobs at
stake. The dominant U.S. supercomputer company has struggled hard
in recent years, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that there had been clear and compelling
evidence that the computer is being dumped on the U.S. market by
Japanese producer. Offering a product below cost is an illegal
trade practice known as dumping, they said.
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers are the fastest computers available, performing
tens of billions of calculations a second. They are typically used
by the military and for scientific and engineering simulations.
</P>
<P>
The new NSF supercomputer, which will be installed at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is
intended to aid climate research by helping scientists develop
advanced simulations that model the environment.
</P>
<P>
Cray Research has sold more than 100 machines in Japan to
government agencies, it said, while no Japanese machines have been
sold to government agencies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
NEC was one of the finalists in the bidding contest along with
Cray and Fujitsu Corp., another Japanese supercomputer maker, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Healthy Development in Namibia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- the Namibian government has
been credited with its great achievements of political stability
and a sustainable economic growth rate of 3.5 percent annually in
the past six years from the ashes of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has been widely admired by African countries for its
maintenance of political stability, avoidance of serious clashes
between the white and the black and between different tribes, and
the constructive role played by the oppositions under the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements were contributed to the reconciliatory
policy initiated and carried out by the ruling South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) since its coming into office six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Namibia gained independence from South Africa on March 21,
1990. It was then inherited with all the legitimacy of social
unjustice and unequality: abnormal racial relationship, political
rivalry, a widening gap of income between the white and the
black, economic dominance by the white and a black unemployment
rate as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO drew a lesson from some other African states in
practising radical action toward the whites after gaining
independence. It adopted a reliable and reconciliatory attitude
toward white political groups and civic organizations with a
principle of nation-building.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's first democratic constitution had been written after
extensive consultations with the whites and the oppositions.

<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- On political issues, SWAPO
advocated multi-party democracy in dealing with affairs of state
and made stay civil servants of the former colonialist government
as a bid of continuation of efficient governance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special attention had also been paid to opposition
leaders, tribal chiefs, unions and local communities in all
levels of governments. As a result, political parties committed
themselves to constitution and stability, exchanging their
differences through legal channel.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's national reconciliatory policy included racial and
tribal reconciliation. Different cultural and religious tradition
of each tribe was protected by the constitution. State leaders,
including the president and the prime minister, usually spoke
with main tribal languages in turn in delivering a formal speech.
</P>
<P>
Taking education as an example, the Namibian government has
allocated 20 percent of its budget to invest in improving and
upgrading separate but equal education system since independence.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, special efforts have been made to provide
all people, regardless of race and tribe, with access to
education, including literacy programs, secondary education and
vocational training.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 95 percent of children throughout Namibia between 7
to 13 years old were at school, and almost 50 percent of the
grade 10 learners achieved well enough to go onto Senior
Secondary education. Both of these figures were among the highest
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the fields of health-care, welfare, housing and
resettlement, consideration of interest of different race and
tribe was put at the top of priorities by the government, while
issues concerning means of livelihood were dealt with above the
narrow interest of parties and tribes.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, the government continued with the
policy of improving the health status of all Namibians through
the provision of relevant preventive, promotive, curative and
rehabilitative health services.

<P>
WINDHOEK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- In the past six years, the
government continued with the policy of improving the health
status of all Namibians through the provision of relevant
preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative health
services.
</P>
<P>
On economic performance, Namibia's annual growth rate of 3.5
percent realized in the past six years was contributed to the
sustainable development of mining, fishing and animal husbandry,
the three pillars of the country.
</P>
<P>
A variety of measures, including the retaining of
professionals and training of black management personnels, have
been adopted by SWAPO to promote the development of economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a growing expansion of international cooperation and
strengthening of bilateral economic ties with the neighbors also
played a pivotal role in maintaining the sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
With a trend of globalizing and liberalizing world economy,
the Namibian government has adopted, through legislation, a
package of incentives to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the incentives included the establishment of the
Export Processing Zone, the Offshore Development Company and
Industrial Development Institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to President Sam Nujoma, the Namibian Government had
now embarked on a "new era of economic reconstruction and
development" based on the strategy of economic diversification.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's first five-year National Development Plan, which
proposed in 1993 and published last year, was put into full
operation early this year, which aimed at stimulation of economic
growth, poverty alleviation and job creation in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
In a word, Namibia's maintenance of political stability and

<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of South
Korea and Thailand agreed Friday to hold working-level defense
policy meetings every year to promote mutual military cooperation.

annually with major allies such as the United States, Japan and
Germany, with Thailand to be the first Southeast Asian country to
have such meetings with South Korea.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistani Export Sector Faces Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The situation of Pakistan's
foreign trade in the current fiscal year does not seem to be as
upbeat as expected by many. The country now faces a substantial
shortfall in export earnings and is most likely to meet with an
alarmingly high trade deficit of about three billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures issued by the Federal Bureau of Statistics
show that the slower than projected growth in exports and the
continually surging imports will make more acute the problem of
trade imbalance which has been plaguing the economy for the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports during the first 10 months of the current
fiscal year (July 1995-June 1996) totalled 225.90 billion rupees
(6.75 billion US dollars), an increase of 15.2 percent over the
same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's imports during the period amounted to
319.38 billion rupees (9.57 billion dollars), recording a 26.1
percent rise as compared with the corresponding period of the
1994-95 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Thus the cumulative trade deficit in the first 10 months of the
1995-96 fiscal year stands at 93.48 billion rupees (2.82 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's monthly export average was no more than 675 million
dollars during the period from July 1995 to April 1996. With only
two months remaining before the end of the current fiscal year, it
would be a Herculean task for Pakistan to realize the 9.2 billion
dollar export target.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, May and June are supposed to be the two months in
which exporters are in a state of uncertainty because of the
expectations of another tough budget with new taxation measures.
Therefore, the chances of a sudden and rapid growth in exports are
abysmally low.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that while exports in the fiscal year
of 1995-96 will hardly touch the target figure of 9.2 billion
dollars, imports are most likely to cross 12 billion dollars,
leaving an annual deficit of about three billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
People may take some solace from the country's major export
item of cotton, for the year 1995-96 has been a quite satisfying
year, with the cotton crop doing far better than expected after
three years of crop failures due to wide-spread pest attacks.
</P>
<P>
And Pakistan has for the first time in recent years restarted
export of cotton, which constitutes about 60 percent of the
country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
However, apart from cotton, exports of other major foreign
exchange earners, such as rice, leather carpets, textile and
fruits, have recorded a substantial decline in quantitative terms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the traditional problems with export industries have
also slowed down export growth -- inadequate packaging,
non-adherence to time schedules for export orders, poor marketing
and non-compliance with specifications, according to an article in
the latest issue of the weekly magazine Pakistan Economist.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the traditional export industry
should be further promoted and be given more incentives to
generate surpluses for export.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the encouraging news this week is that figures show
Pakistan has attracted a direct foreign investment of more than
2.1 billion dollars in the past two years that equals the amount
of investment made in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment in Pakistan, especially in its power and
petroleum sectors, is expected to boost exports in the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
In addition, because of Pakistan's need for industrialization,
machinery, petroleum crude and its related products have been the
major import items in recent years, accounting for nearly 30
percent of the total import bill. These sectors, which are of
vital importance to economic development, are expected to play a
major role in generating future exports.
</P>
<P>
With the Pakistani government's continued efforts to promote
export, attract foreign investment and conduct structural and
macro-economic reform, there is every reason to believe Pakistan's
export industry will be further promoted along with healthy
economic progress.

<HEADLINE> Jet Lands After Captain Regains Consciousness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A jet captain revived in time
from unconsciousness caused by loss of cabin pressure Sunday and
landed a Boeing 727 with 106 passengers on board safely in
Indianapolis, Indiana, airline officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A flight attendant in the cockpit with the pilot, co-pilot and
engineer also fell unconscious in the oxygen-starved atmosphere,
the Associated Press quoted American Trans Air (ATA) spokeswoman
Mary Moses Cochran as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the co-pilot put the jet into a
two-minute, 23,000-foot descent to stabilize its cabin air
pressure. When they reached about 10,000 feet, the captain took
over the controls and completed the unscheduled landing.
</P>
<P>
Flight 406 of ATA was scheduled to fly between Chicago and
St. Petersburg, Florida.
</P>
<P>
It made the unscheduled landing at Indianapolis International
Airport about an hour after the takeoff.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of passengers were treated and released for ear pain,
lightheadedness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports on the cause to the cabin pressure loss
and investigation was under way.

<HEADLINE> BJP Takes Move for Consensus House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- With support from the regional
parties still not coming, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
has floated the idea of having a consensus candidate as the Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament) speaker in consultation with all
the major parties.
</P>
<P>
The BJP has adopted this strategy to save it from any possible
embarrassment over the issue. The Congress and the Third Front
have announced that they would put up their own candidate for the
speaker's post and would not allow the BJP's candidate to get
elected.
</P>
<P>
The BJP has only 160 seats in the parliament, far away from a
clear majority in the house.
</P>
<P>
It has been the tradition in the Lok Sabha to have the speaker
from the ruling party, while the post of deputy speaker goes to
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
BJP general secretary V. Naidu has said that it would have been
proper if the BJP got 30 days' time to prove its majority in
parliament. The president gave the BJP 15 days to prove its
majority.
</P>
<P>
"I can only hope that we will be able to prove our majority,"
he said. Naidu's hope that the government would survive was being
taken skeptically even within the BJP, which has yet to garner
support from any of the major groups in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The BJP is likely to propose the name of Shivraj Patil, speaker
of the 10th Lok Sabha, for the 11th Lok Sabha's speaker. Patil was
elected speaker of the 10th Lok Sabha as the consensus candidate
whose name was proposed by the Congress and supported by the BJP.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Suspends Research Activities in Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to suspend research projects in the country's easternmost
province of Irian Jaya following the hostage incident, the local
press today quoted a military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian armed forces Chief for General Affairs Gen. Soeyono
said Friday that research activities in the province should be
temporarily stopped to avoid unexpected incidents.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) launched a
rescue operation and freed nine of the 11 remaining hostages held
by the Free Papua Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya since January 8
this year.
</P>
<P>
The other two hostages were found dead with deep cuts and
wounds in their bodies during the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The nine hostages -- four Britons, two Dutch nationals and
three Indonesians, were part of a 26-member scientific expedition
team. The other 15 hostages had been released earlier.
</P>
<P>
Soeyono said research activities in the province would resume
once the ABRI makes clear that the security situation there
becomes relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here, the Indonesian government Friday
formally handed over the four Britons and two Dutch nationals to
ambassadors of their countries to Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Parties Lead in Dominican Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Candidates from two opposition
parties are leading in the latest returns from the presidential
election in the Dominican Republic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the Caribbean island's capital of
Santo Domingo, count of the vote so far today showed the candidate
from the ruling party has been trailing at third place.
</P>
<P>
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, of the Dominican Revolutionary Party
(PRD), has garnered 528,223 votes, or 46.06 percent of the ballots
counted, announced the Central Electoral Board.
</P>
<P>
Leonel Fernandez, of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD),
followed with 383,134 votes, or 33.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jacinto Peynado, of the ruling Social Christian
Reformist Party (PRSC), obtained 219,619 votes, or 19.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Pena Gomez, even if he is ahead in the final vote
counting, must obtain more than 50 percent of the ballots in this
first round to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the reformists of Peynado could form an
informal alliance with followers of Leonel Fernandez to confront
Pena Gomez in the second round of voting scheduled for June 30.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's election in the Dominican Republic proceeded in calm
and with a noticeable voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country with a population of 2.2 million is led
by President Joaquin Balaguer, who came to office in August 1986
and has since won two successive elections.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held two years earlier than scheduled
after opposition forces demanded Balaguer's mandate be cut from
four to two years following accusations of his involvement in
electoral fraud during the 1994 presidential race.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay to Share Anti-terrorism Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay
will soon establish a joint database to fight against terrorism in
the border area that joins the three neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Initially proposed by Argentine President Carlos Menem earlier
this year, the project was announced today by Hugo Franco, head of
the National Migrations Direction of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The three Latin American countries have a common border area
that encompasses Puerto Iguazu in Argentina, Foz Do Iguazu in
Brazil and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to prevent terrorism in the area, the planned
database will record the flow of people and vehicles that cross
the border from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
The database will be "a determining instrument" in providing
precise information about the identification of the people who
cross the border every day, Franco said.
</P>
<P>
Its creation, the Argentine official noted, shows the
determination of the Argentine, Brazilian and Paraguayan
governments to fight terrorism in the area.
</P>
<P>
President Menem proposed on March 18 the creation of the
database as one of a series of measures designed to prevent crime
and terrorism in the border area.
</P>
<P>
The initiative has since received support from the Brazilian
and Paraguayan governments.
</P>
<P>
To further discuss the database plan, Argentine Interior
Minister Carlos Corach is scheduled to meet his Paraguayan
counterpart, Mario Vidal Garcete, and Brazilian Justice Minister
Nelson Acevedo Jobim in Puerto Iguazu.

<HEADLINE> Material Help Cleans up 'Brocade' Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- American environmentalist Betsy
Damon has dreamed that the Fujiang and Nanjiang rivers in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan province, will one day be cleaned up, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Her dream is about to come true.
</P>
<P>
A project to clean the rivers, which started in January 1993,
and involves a total investment of 2.7 billion yuan (320 million
US dollars), is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Fujiang and Nanjiang rivers are branches of the Minjiang
River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River. The Fujiang River
enters downtown and flows northward and eastward. The Nanjiang
River, also named Jinjiang River, flows eastward and southward.
</P>
<P>
"The project is the biggest one in Chengdu since 1949, when New
China was founded," said Zhang Jihai, assistant mayor of Chengdu.
"It will bail the city out of the muck and mess it is in."
</P>
<P>
The Fujiang and Nanjiang rivers once nurtured Chengdu. They
were called the brocade rivers because silk washed in the water
became brighter.
</P>
<P>
Gone are these days, however. A group of American artists led
by Betsy Damon rinsed long stretches of white silk in the river
water last July. The silk turned brown and grey.
</P>
<P>
Rapid industrialization and population growth have damaged the
quality of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Frequent floods have made the rivers a burden on local
residents, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"We had to leave our homes and the dirty water washed away our
furniture," said Zhang Wende, 84, who was brought up and lived in
a damp and dim house near the Fujiang River.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Zhang and his neighbors moved into a new
residential block. Zhang's family was allocated three apartments.
The Chengdu City Government has set up 24 residential blocks to
accommodate 100,000 locals who lived in houses along the rivers.
</P>
<P>
"The harness project will greatly raise the rivers'
flood-control ability," said the assistant mayor.
</P>
<P>
The project will build 18 km of new river dikes, consolidate 23
km of dikes, dredge 16 km of the river, build and transform 17
bridges, build and upgrade five dams and 12 docks, and widen the
river course to 40-80 m.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the rivers will witness only one flood per 200
years," said the official. To improve the environment is another
goal of the harness project.
</P>
<P>
More than 650 drainage ports along both banks of the rivers
discharge over 60,000 cu-m of sewage every day, posing a threat to
the health of the residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the assistant mayor, the harness project will
equip the inner and outer sides of the rivers with 26-km-long
sewage pipelines, bringing the sewage to sewage treatment plants
before going into the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that severely pollute the river have been moved to
the industrial parks out of town.
</P>
<P>
"The project will make the city greener," said Damon. There is
also a plan to cultivate a 23.5-ha greenbelt. Small parks and
amusement grounds will be built along both sides of the rivers,
supplemented with cultural and artistic works and city statues.
</P>
<P>
"The project will also upgrade the infrastructure in the city,"
said Zhang Jihai.
</P>
<P>
The harness project will build a 15-km-long and 25-m-wide ring
road on the inner side of the rivers as well as a protective
passage. It will construct an underground pipeline network to
enhance the functions of the city's infrastructural facilities.

<HEADLINE> China to Strive for More Vigorous Ties with Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAMAKO, Mali, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that the strengthening of friendly
relations with African nations will remain an important part of
China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
China is to work hard in an effort to make Sino-African
friendly relations more substantial, more concrete and more
vigorous, Jiang said in a speech at a banquet hosted by Malian
President Alpha Oumar Konare.
</P>
<P>
Under the new international situation after the Cold War, Jiang
said, "equality, sincerity, unity and common development" are
among China's principles of developing state-to-state relations
with African nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head of state pointed out that China and African
countries should increase the exchanges between the young peoples
so as to add new elements to the traditional China-Africa
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Konare said Mali and China have conducted multiform cooperation
since they established diplomatic ties in 1960. Through such
cooperation, he added, China has helped Mali to lay the foundation
of industries.
</P>
<P>
He said Mali-China cooperative management system is an example
of South-South cooperation and should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The Malian president said China, as a faithful friend of
Africa, can play its due role in joining the international
community to restore peace in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage, including Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen, were present at the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Mali's Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, president of
national assembly Ali Nouhoum Diallo were also present.

<HEADLINE> Austria Condemns Dismissal of Bosnian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Austria today joined the
international chorus of condemnation of the dismissal of Bosnian
Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal shows again that "peace and normalization won't
resume in Bosnia should people like (Radovan) Karadzic or (Serb
general) Ratko Mladic be in power," said Austrian Vice Chancellor
and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel in a news release.
</P>
<P>
He called on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to help
remove Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic and send him to The Hague for
war crime trials.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic removed Kasagic from his office Wednesday, accusing
him of carrying out policies that endangered the "vital interests"
of the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic, who agrees to cooperate with the arch-rival
Muslim-Croat confederation and commits himself to full
implementation of the Dayton peace accord that ended the 43-month
war in Bosnia, is regarded as a moderate alternative to
hard-liners in the Bosnian Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said his country will continue to reinforce the
"moderate camp" in Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He asked Milosevic to exert influence on the incident, remove
Karadzic from his political power and send him to the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague for trial.
Karadzic was twice indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic was the de facto paramount political leader and
military and financial aid provider of the Bosnian Serbs in the
Bosnia war. He later signed the Dayton accord under the heavy
pressure of international economic sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
also criticized Karadzic's move, describing it as "illegal and
unacceptable," the Austria Presse Argentur quoted an OSCE news
release as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE document said Kasagic has done his best to support the
Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Thursday rejected the dismissal of the
leading moderate.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will continue to deal with Kasagic as legal
representative of Republic Srpska." Spokesman Alexander Ivanko
said.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic himself refused to step down. He is now in the
northwestern Bosnian Serb city of Banja Luka to resist Karadzic's
authority from Pale.
</P>
<P>
He has reportedly won the endorsement of four Serb opposition
parties, which called for an emergency meeting of both the
government and the assembly in Banja Luka, rather than in Pale, to
find a solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Government Begins Banking Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government today put
two major banks considered facing insolvency under its special
surveillance, at the start of an all-out restructuring effort to
save the ailing banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank board of governors said the decision to
intensify supervision over the First Private Bank and the
state-run Mineral Bank was made in line with the banking and
credit law enacted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation empowers the Central Bank to monitor banks
that are failing, assess their financial situations and ask a
court to declare them bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the two banks' executives should leave
their office and officials designated by the Central Bank will
take over.
</P>
<P>
But the governor of the First Private Bank, in a statement
carried by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, said his bank has
enough assets to protect the interests of its depositors.
</P>
<P>
He said the current situation surrounding his bank, which had
piled up losses of 7.3 billion leva (6.6 million U.S. dollars) by
the end of March, was caused by some unspecified political blocs.
</P>
<P>
The Mineral Bank, which has been hard hit by bad debts owed by
many loss-making enterprises for years, had run up losses of 7.4
billion leva (6.7 million dollars) by the end of March, or nearly
one-fifth of the total losses accumulated by the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has urged the parliament to pass a law to
safeguard the deposits of citizens and companies in loss-making
banks and planned to set up some special offices to collect
overdue debts.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Survey On Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey of diabetes
epidemic will kick off soon to collect data to map out a feasible
policy for diabetes control, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The two-year survey, organized by the Ministry of Health, is
the first of its kind in the country, and similar inspections will
he conducted every five to 10 years, according to ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
This is only one of many actions that the ministry is planning
to take over the coming five years, for the purpose of controlling
the rampant spread of diabetes, which is the third most lethal
non-infectious chronic disease among the Chinese people, next to
cancer and cardio-vascular illnesses.
</P>
<P>
China currently has approximately 20 million patients with
diabetes and each year about 750,000 new cases are registered
nationwide, said Dai Zhicheng, department director in charge of
disease control in the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey in Beijing showed that incidence rate of
diabetes in the capital city in 1980 was 1.1 percent, the rate
climbed up to 5.3 percent last year, four times higher than it was
15 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The various complications caused by diabetes are the major
reasons for disability and early death among diabetics, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the Ministry of Health yesterday set up
a National Expert Consultant Committee on Diabetes Prevention and
Treatment, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also promulgated a national five-year
(1996-2000) program on diabetes control, asking local governments
to pay close attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
In line with the program, a reporting system will be introduced
to help health departments establish a clear understanding of the
epidemic situation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks German Support for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, at meetings with German President Roman Herzog and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl here today, urged Germany to support his
country's efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told a press conference later that there should be a
"definite timetable" for Turkey to join the EU and that a tariff
agreement with the 15-member organization is not enough for the
two sides to develop closer ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed with the EU a tariff agreement in January as part
of the move for better cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish-Greek relations, Yilmaz said his country is
willing to negotiate with Greece and accept arbitration by the
International Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides also discussed the legal
status of the about 2 million Turks living in Germany and the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PKK, also banned in Germany, has waged a decade-long
guerrilla war for independence or autonomy in southeastern Turkey
in which more than 19,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz arrived here Thursday on his first state visit to
Germany since taking office two months ago.

<HEADLINE> European Official Calls Arms Treaty Dispute Hard to Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over how much weaponry
Russia should keep along its borders seems unlikely to be solvable
at the current arms limitation treaty review conference here,
Frank Majoor, chairman of the conference, said today.
</P>
<P>
As delegates from 30 signatory nations to the 1990 Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty gathered for the two-week conference
to review the treaty, the issue of "flank limitations" -- the
amount of weaponry nations may amass along their borders -- popped
up.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said he sees little hope in sorting out the
difficulty presented by Moscow, which had called for the pact to
loosen its stringent arms control conditions imposed on its "flank
zone," stretching from St. Petersburg in the north to the volatile
Caucasus region in the south.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that he is "not too upbeat," Majoor, also a
department director of the Dutch Foreign Ministry, told the
Austrian agency APA that he still has to keep up his spirits as
always.
</P>
<P>
"No procedural problem has occurred during the whole process of
the conference," he said, adding that confidence should be
maintained despite enormous difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi
Mamedov, who held talks here with Lynn Davis, U.S. undersecretary
for arms control, before the treaty review, had shown flexibility
in conforming with the CFE ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The CFE treaty, which took effect in late 1995, was signed by
countries from the NATO and the former Warsaw Pact to cap the
levels of weapons and troops around Europe.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held to discuss the implications of the
political changes in Europe since 1990 and recommend amendments to
the pact.

<HEADLINE> China's Railway To Attract More Overseas Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a more
market-oriented policy for the railway industry, currently one of
the country's most centrally controlled sector, aiming at drawing
more overseas investment, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment and advanced technologies are particularly
welcome in the manufacture of rolling-stock products and auxiliary
safety and telecom equipment, while trade in the sector is also
being encouraged, said Tan Datong, director of the Ministry of
Railways' Rolling Stock Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The growing demand for overseas cooperation can be attributed
to the government's goals to raise travelling speed of trains and
toi open heavy-duty freight trains on major lines.
</P>
<P>
The country's railway sector now runs 32,000 passenger trains
and 430,000 freight trains. And the Ministry of Railways has set
a target of increasing these numbers to 40,000 and 480,000
respectively in the next five years. Priority will be given to
adding more high-standard passenger trains and special-use freight
trains.
</P>
<P>
The ministry wants 35 percent of passenger trains to be
airconditioned in five years, up from the present 20 percent. On
several major railway lines, the travelling speed of passenger
trains will be increased to 140 to 160 km per hour, from the
present 120 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the growing market demand for better rolling-stock
products with higher technological specifications, China has
improved international technological exchanges from mere academic
discussions to joint development of rolling-stock products with
higher technological specifications, China has improved
internaitonal technological exchanges from mere academic
discussions to joint development of rolling-stock products, Tan
noted.
</P>
<P>
A number of joint venture enterprises have already been
established with the United States, Sweden and Germany, as well as
with Taiwan to produce cast-steel wheels, bearings, and
air-conditioners for passenger trains.
</P>
<P>
China is also negotiating with Canada and Germany to develop
jointly high-standard passenger trains and subway carriages.
Negotiations are underway with Japan, Germany and France on
cooperation in building China's first expression railway linking
Beijing and Shanghai.

Minors seen on the streets without their parents or tutors
during curfew will be taken to a special place and delivered to
their parents or tutors after drafting an affidavit, the mayor

The curfew will permit the establishment of the right of the
minors to live in conditions that will promote their integral
development, he added.

The number of minors in irregular situations has been
increasing in Caracas and this has forced authorities to adopt
measures of control, orientation, vigilance and protection to
prevent criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> 34 Finance Ministers Meeting Opens in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Orleans, Louisiana, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers
from 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere started their two-day
meeting here today to explore ways of promoting greater private
investment in Latin America and the Caribbean through the
development of banking and securities markets.
</P>
<P>
The first-day meeting was characterized by a high-level forum
which was jointly sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) and three private organizations based in Peru, Argentina and
New York.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which was divided into four seminars, is served as a
platform for the exchange of ideas among high-level government
officials and economic leaders in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a round-table discussion was held by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Counselor to the U.S. president Thomas
F. Mclarty, IDB President Enrique V. Eglesias as well as a group
of finance ministers and high-level representatives from the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be followed by a one-day ministerial meeting
Saturday over liberalization, development and integration of
financial markets in the Americas, chaired by the U.S. treasury
secretary. This is the first finance ministers' meeting since U.S.
President Bill Clinton convened the Summit of the Americas in
Miami in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival earlier today, Rubin told a press conference
at the New Orleans International Airport that the meeting is a
major step toward a unified effort to raise and sustain economic
growth that will benefit three-quarters of a billion people in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. treasury secretary said the major aim of the meeting
is to forge a consensus on and commitment to sound economic
policies to sustain growth, raise savings rates and strengthen the
now-central role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Rubin noted, the issue of fighting financial crime is
also on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Former England Manager to Coach Barcelona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Robson has signed a two-year
contract to coach Spanish club Barcelona, a local radio reported
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Robson, former England manager who led Portuguese Porto to its
second league title recently, flew to Madrid on Friday and inked
the deal to replace Johan Cruyff.
</P>
<P>
Robson was reportedly offered 20 million pesetas (160,000 US
dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Robson led England to the semifinals of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Robson, 63, won two league championships with Dutch club PSV
Eindhoven before moving to Lisbon's Sporting in 1992 and going
further to Porto some 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Cruyff had taken the helm of Barcelona for
eight years, winning the club's first European Cup in 1992 and
taking the Spanish league titles for four successive seasons from
1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, his relations with club chairman Jose Luis Nunez
became tense after two barren seasons.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Blast Injures Four in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Four people were seriously injured
Thursday in a car bomb blast that destroyed parts of the local
Shell oil company building, authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, the first of its kind this year, occurred
Thursday night in the La Victoria district of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Attacks with car bombs in the country, more frequent in 1992
and 1993, were waning in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Besides ripping off parts of the facade of the Shell building,
the explosive device also cast flyers referring to the war waged
against the Peruvian government by the Shining Path rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The injured, one of them in a coma, were riding three
automobiles passing by the building when the blast occurred.
</P>
<P>
National Police experts estimated that the car bomb was loaded
with at least 100 kilograms of explosives.

<HEADLINE> Property Assessor Exam for China Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's first national certified
public assessor examination, a two-day event that ends tomorrow,
attracted nearly 40,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
It covers four areas: assets evaluation, accounting, basic
engineering, and economics, and comes in response to a government
decision to establish a system where only certified persons are
allowed to do appraisal work.
</P>
<P>
The increasing changes in property rights and transactions
since the late 1970s have made property assessment an increasingly
important part of the Chinese economy, observers say.
</P>
<P>
An official here said that the system is designed to
fundmentally improve the quality of the work and provide the
conditions for mutual recognizability of Chinese and foreign
assessments.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the certified assessors are significant in the
Chinese government's efforts to curb the loss of state property,
which was valued at nearly 5 trillion yuan (about 600 billion US
dollars) by the end of March, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official data shows that China had nearly 2,400 assessing
agencies by the end of 1994, with about 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
From this year, the test will be an annual event open to both
Chinese and non-Chinese working in China.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Iliescu Meet on Bilateral Issues, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and Romanian President Ion Iliescu said here today
Yugoslavia and Romania significantly contributed to peace and
stability in the region of the Balkans with their activities.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting today, the two leaders agreed that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and Romania "are linked with firm ties of
friendship, good neighborliness and the closeness of their peoples
on the basis of equality and mutual respect," the Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They also said the two countries are in favor of multilateral
Balkan cooperation and the equal involvement of regional countries
in European integration processes.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu arrived here Thursday for a three-day official and
friendly visit to Yugoslavia. He signed an agreement with Yugoslav
President Zoran Lilic the same day on an overall cooperation for
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
It is the joint belief of both sides that the future of the
Balkans lies in harmonious economic development which should
proceed in peaceful and stable political conditions, and Balkan
peoples should independently decide about their destiny, Tanjug
said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Iliescu also devoted special attention to the
strengthening of economic cooperation between Yugoslavia and
Romania, underscoring the traditional links between economic
partners and the continuity in their contacts, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have traditional relations and
Romania reestablished political and economic relations with
Yugoslavia soon after the international community lifted the
sanctions against Belgrade last November.

<HEADLINE> New York Stock Market Regains Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
resumed momentum today with the Dow Jones industrial average
rising 52.45 points to 5,687.50, just an inch away of a closing
record.
</P>
<P>
During the day the barometer once surpassed an all-time high
and hit 5,698.58 points.
</P>
<P>
After setting a record of 5,689.74 on April 3, the market eased
down more than 6 percent before resuming its climb in early May.
</P>
<P>
The rally is driven by a belief that the economy is on the
right track, not to make inflation surge.
</P>
<P>
For the week, the Dow was up 169.36 points. That brought its
gains to nearly 350 points, or 6.5 percent, from a steep sell-off
less than two weeks ago. The market had been rattled by fears that
business activity has been accelerating too quickly and would
result in higher inflation, which would prompt the Federal Reserve
to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But over the past week, a series of modest readings on
inflation has eased those worries.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners today by about 5 to 3 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 429.12 million
shares, up from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
All the other major stock indexes also moved higher, with some
setting new records.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq set its fifth new high in six sessions, but rose
just 2.57 to 1,241.88. Similarly, the American Stock Exchange's
market value index rose to its fourth new high this week, adding
2.48 to 605.21.
</P>
<P>
In other economic news, the Commerce Department reported that
the U.S. trade deficit soared to 8.92 billion U.S. dollars in
March as imports of both goods and services hit all-time highs.
The March deficit, 26.8 percent higher than February's, was much
worse than the gap many economists had been anticipating.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Japan are ready
to expand cooperation, especially in the economic sphere, visiting
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed
that tremendous potential exists for economic cooperation between
the two countries because they are both moving forward with
economic opening-up and reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after a meeting with Hashimoto,
Ramos said they also discussed regional security issues, including
the Japan-U.S. security arrangement.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of the "comfort women" - women, many of them
Filipino, forced into sexual servitude for Japanese soldiers
before and during World War II - was not covered in their talks,
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Philippines and Japan have already resolved
"this very sensitive subject through an institutionalized
solution."
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
which will be held in the Philippines in November, Ramos said the
meeting will concentrate on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade, investment and economic development will top the agenda,
he added.

<HEADLINE> OAU Secretary general on Deteriorating Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), said today
the security situation in Burundi has sharply degenerated over
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release quoted Salim as saying that the climate
of insecurity has continued to deteriorate and is spreading
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the present situation has been provoked by the
unprecedented magnitude of attacks launched by armed rebels and
the ensuing reprisals taken by security forces.
</P>
<P>
"This explosion of violence, which has reached a level
hitherto unknown, has been the subject of very serious and
deepening concern for the OAU and the international community,"
said Salim. " The violence has, with every passing day,
precipitated an exodus of people into neighbouring countries and
led to the displacement of a lot of persons, in addition to the
massacres of innocent people and the destruction of property and
infrastructure that it has left in its trail," he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim calls on the people of Burundi to demonstrate courage
and political so as to unequivocally fall the true problems that
are wrecking their society.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU condemns unreservedly, irrespective of the
perpetrators, the massacres of innocent populations,
assassinations, attacks on hospital centres, as well as
destructions of property and infrastru- ctures," the OAU
secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a peaceful solution to the Burundi crisis does
exist and is within the capacity of the Burundians, Salim
appealed to all the parties in Burundi to seize this opportunity
and engage resolutely in an open and sincere dialogue and thus
give peace a chance.

<P>
ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- European champions Panathinaikos
darked it chance at the Greek basketball championship when its
former NBA star forward Dominique Wilkins flew to the United
States on Friday to treat his injured leg.
</P>
<P>
"He left with my permission so that he could treat his injured

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan Enjoy All-Weather Friendship: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KARACHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Pakistan friendship is a
model for the development of relations among countries with
different social systems, a visiting senior Chinese official said
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
During his talks here with Speaker of the Sindh Assembly Ghous
Buksh Khan Maher, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Sun Fuling, said that China and
Pakistan enjoy all-weather friendship.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "Pakistan is one of the countries which established
diplomatic relations with China just after the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949."
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan declared the establishment of diplomatic
relations in Beijing and Karachi, the then capital of Pakistan,
respectively on May 21, 1951.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "strengthening friendly ties with our neighboring
countries is one of China's major foreign policies."
</P>
<P>
Maher said on the occasion that Sun's visit will further
promote the traditional friendship between Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been putting the development of friendly ties
between Pakistan and China on the top of its foreign policy
agenda, Maher said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the development of relations among nations should
base on the five principles of peaceful co-existence, just like
the ties between China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Leading an eight-member CPPCC delegation, Sun is on an
eight-day goodwill visit to Pakistan, which will highlight the
celebrations of the 45th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek, Costa Enter Italy Open Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Richard Krajicek and Spain's
Alberto Costa sailed into the semi-finals of Italy Open men's
tennis tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Big-serving Krajicek rolled over Swede Stefan Edberg 6-3, 6-3
while Costa disposed of Andrea Gaudenzi, the only Italian left in
the quarter-finals, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek opened the game by blasting three aces in the first
game and soon built up a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Despite a vocal crowd supporting Edberg, Krajicek hammered one
and another aces and let Edberg no chance to break.
</P>
<P>
The second set turned out to be similiar, where Edberg
struggled with a fastest serve of the year, 220 km per hour,
before conceding loss.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek now meets South Africa's Wayne Ferreira for a place in
the final.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier Costa-Gaudenzi match, an exhausted Gaudenzi lost
his serve in the opening game of the first set, broke back and
then lost serve twice more in the fifth and seventh games.
</P>
<P>
The second set started in the same fashion, but Costa won
every game after Gaudenzi's break.
</P>
<P>
Gaudenzi had said on Thursday that he desperately needed some
rest after beating 13th seed Michael Stich and then fourth seed
Thomas Enqvist.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Tightens Screw on Arms Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams pressed
British Prime Minister John Major again to make details about how
the issue of arms decommissioning to be addressed in parallel with
the planned all-party talks scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
Adams told a news conference in Belfast today that he detected
a certain shift in Major's remarks about arms decommissioning, but
the prime minister had to say how his promise could be translated
into reality.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that there would be no any negotiations if the
Unionist demand over resolving this issue before any discussions
was allowed to hold sway.
</P>
<P>
Major promised Thursday in an article for the Irish Times
newspaper that all-party negotiations scheduled for June 10 would
not be blocked by any disputes about arms decommissioning by rival
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks process on the future of Northern Ireland
would be genuine and serious and disarmament would be tackled at
the start of the talks without blocking the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Major once again urged Sinn Fein and the Irish
government not to let the chance of peace in Northern Ireland to
slip away.
</P>
<P>
But he also reiterated that Sinn Fein must persuade the IRA to
renew its shattered ceasefire, so the party could be admitted to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government has praised Major's new offer and pressed
Sinn Fein and the IRA to restore ceasefire immediately.

<HEADLINE> Canada Pledges Support for Business with Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has pledged
its continued "strong support" to Canadians doing business in
Cuba, despite of the new U.S. anti-Cuban law which threatens to
punish Canadian and other foreign companies doing business with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Christine Stewart, Secretary of State for Latin America and
Africa, said here Thursday that the Canadian government is
"continuing to provide strong support to Canadian businesses
seeking opportunities in the Cuban market."
</P>
<P>
To facilitate Canadian business in Cuba, the government have
increased trade staff at its Cuban embassy so that "Canadian
companies will the best possible advice", the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S law, known as the Helms-Burton bill, aims at
discouraging foreigners from doing business in Cuba. It also
threatens to sue those who "traffic" in confiscated property in
Cuba and to deny them entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day symposium on Helms-Burton and
International Business, the minister called the new U.S.
anti-Cuban law "the wrong instrument" of the U.S. isolation
attempts against Cuba, which "not only targets Cuba but threatens
trading partners and friends."
</P>
<P>
Canada has opposed the bill vehemently before and after it was
adopted by the U.S. congress and signed by President Bill Clinton
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
In its fight against the bill, Canada has been joined by Mexico
and the European Union, who have respectively accused the U.S. of
violating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the very
principles of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
It has also enlisted the support from the Central American
countries, whose leaders are here on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Stewart told the meeting that the Canadian government "will not
let up" in its fight against the bill and will try its best "to
blunt its impact on Canadians."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Increases in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit increased
to 8.92 billion dollars in March as imports of both goods and
services hit all-time highs, U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports of goods and services in March fell to 68.8
billion dollars, down by 0.8 percent, and the imports climbed to a
record level of 77.72 billion dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that the March deficit was 26.8
percent higher than the imbalance in February that was revised to
7.04 billion dollars from originally estimated 8.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
While two of the biggest imports, oil and cars, both decreased
in March, U.S. purchases of foreign semiconductors, heavy machine
tools and chemicals were up.
</P>
<P>
In first three months of this year, the U.S. deficit in goods
and services is running at an annual rate of 103 billion dollars,
a slight improvement from last year's 111.5 billion, which had
been the worst showing in seven years.
</P>
<P>
In March, the U.S. deficit with Japan rose by 5.5 percent to
4.11 billion dollars even though U.S. exports climbed to a record
6.1 billion. For the first three months of the year, America's
deficit with Japan was 11.8 billion, the lowest quarterly total
since the spring of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Mexico narrowed to 1.13 billion in March.
That is an improvement of 13 percent from February as American
exports to Mexico climbed to 4.5 billion dollars, the highest
level since November 1994, the month before Mexico was forced to
devalue its peso and set off an economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that America's second largest deficit in
March was with China but it was improved quickly comparing with
February as import from China fell sharply.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Law Against Sex Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed legislation known as "Megan's Law," that requires
states to inform communities when sex offenders move in.
</P>
<P>
The bill is named for a slain New Jersey youngster.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the law will "tell a community when a dangerous
sexual predator enters its midst." "There is no greater right than
a parent's right to raise a child in safety and love," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure strengthens requirements in the 1994 anti-crime
bill by requiring states not only to notify local law enforcement
officials when a convicted sex offender moves into a neighborhood
but also to make that information available to the community.
</P>
<P>
The bill was sponsored by Representative Dick Zimmer,
Republican of New Jersey, following the 1994 rape and murder of
Megan Kanka, a seven-year-old New Jersey girl.
</P>
<P>
A convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her,
whose record was unknown to the Kanka family, was charged with the
crime.
</P>
<P>
"Megan's Law" measures were passed in most states following the
crime. But their notification provisions vary widely.
</P>
<P>
States could lose federal aid if they fail to comply with the
terms of the bill but they would still be allowed to decide how
dangerous an offender is and what type of notification is
required.
</P>
<P>
Numerous studies have shown that "sex offenders commit crime
after crime," he said. "Today, America warns, if you dare to prey
on our children, the law will follow you wherever you go, state to
state, town to town."

<HEADLINE> UK Annual Inflation Rate Falls to 2.4 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation in
Britain last month fell to 2.4 percent, its lowest level for 18
months, from 2.7 percent in March as consumers benefited from
reduced mortgage payments, according to the Office for National
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
There was disappointment in the City, however, at the failure
of underlying inflation to make any progress towards the
government's target figure of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, was unchanged at 2.9 percent for the third
month in a row.
</P>
<P>
The headline 2.4 percent figure was due mainly to lower housing
costs and seasonal food prices.
</P>
<P>
There were also price falls in household goods and household
services such as home contents insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
Exerting an upward pressure on prices, however, were slightly
higher motor insurance premiums after the fierce competition of
last year and prices for non-seasonal food.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow" crisis has led to falls in the cost of beef but
the benefit for consumers has been overtaken by a sharp rise in
the cost of alternative meats such as lamb, pork and poultry.
</P>
<P>
Although the underlying rate has stubbornly stuck at nearly 3
percent, economists and the Bank of England believe that it will
now start dropping.
</P>
<P>
Sharp falls in producer output prices in recent months as well
as surveys of manufacturers' price expectations suggest that even
underlying inflation should start dropping.

</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, China is to provide 10 million

</P>
<P>
The money will be used either in the joint ventures of the two
countries or to buy Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, representatives of the two countries

Yuan (about 9.6 million U.S. Dollars) from China to Mali to fund
some Sino-Malian cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a memorandum on the establishment of
a Chinese investment and development center in Bamako, capital of

<HEADLINE> Democrats Work on Agenda for Congressional Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic leaders today
set forth "principles" expected to guide development of an agenda
for House and Senate elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said it would be a "grave
misunderstanding" to compare the Democratic Agenda for Progress to
the Republicans' Contract With America that helped Republicans
gain control in both chambers in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
"Every part of our agenda will speak to the daily challenges of
working families and the middle class," Gephardt said. "It won't
be about balance sheets and accounting games in Washington."
</P>
<P>
He said the agenda, yet to be finalized in late June, will
serve as a voters' blueprint to Democratic goals if they are
returned to power in Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, we're asking for a second chance. We may have made
our share of mistakes the last time we had a majority," Gephardt
said. "But we're ready to work 24 hours a day to avoid those
mistakes next year."
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' five principles amount to a vague set of
guidelines: "honoring work, fighting for children, protecting
families, responsibility and basic fairness."
</P>
<P>
While the Republicans' Contract With America promised action on
more than a dozen specific pieces of legislation, ranging from
anti-crime measures to a constitutional amendment requiring a
balanced budget, the House has passed most of the contract
measures, but most items died in the more moderate Senate and some
were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Senator Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, said the
details would be put together after all House and Senate members
have a chance to hear what their constituents think are important
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats must net 20 seats in the 435-member House and
three Senate seats in the 100-member Senate, in addition to
holding their own seats, in order to retake control of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Allows in Burundi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner of the Ngara
District, North-Western Tanzania, Brigadier-General Sylvester Hemed,
said today that Tanzania had not opened its border to Burundi
refugees, but was allowing in people under stress on humanitarian
grounds.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to reports that "operation on prevention of
refugees from crossing into Tanzania" has cost a lot of money
while refugees from Burundi have continued to pour into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched by the government in March last
year by stationing army units along the Tanzania-Burundi border.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner told reporters those, who were
arguing that the operation was a waste of funds, did not know
what the operation entailed.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been incidents of Burundi refugees and soldiers
crossing into Tanzania and harassing the people. The presence of the
army units in the area had brought the situation under control, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The number of Burundi refugees in the district had risen to
37,000 by yesterday from 34,000 reported at the end of last
April, according to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Had the army not deployed its units in Ngara, the fighting in
Burundi could have spilled into Tanzania, and the situation would
have been very different, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Ngara also said fighting
between rebels and the Burundi army had intensified and that areas
bordering Tanzania were being monitored by the army.

<HEADLINE> Malian, Chinese Presidents Hail Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAMAKO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare
said here today that Mali attaches importance to the friendly
relations and cooperation with China and hopes the two countries
will expand the existing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the current international situation, he told visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in their talks, Mali hopes that the
two countries establish cooperative ties which will extend to the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-Malian relations have been growing healthily
and steadily since the two countries established diplomatic ties
35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He commented that Sino-Malian relations have stood the test of
time and can be an example of South-South cooperation. He added
that China hopes to become an "all-weather friend" of Mali.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Konare that China, which has begun reforming its
foreign assistance system since last year, has not changed its
position of sincerely helping the recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
Konare said Mali, as a member of some regional organizations
in the west African region, is actively participating in
political and economic affairs in the region and is making
efforts to promote African integration.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa is undergoing a key period and Mali hopes
that China will play a more positive role in African affairs. He
added that Jiang's visit to Africa is very important.
</P>
<P>
The Malian leader said that African countries have made
unremitted efforts in order to establish a fair and reasonable
new international order and that the African nations appreciate
the Chinese government's efforts in maintaining world peace.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Mali for pursuing an independent,
good-neighborly and non-aligned foreign policy. He said China
supports Mali's just stand of safeguarding the country's
sovereignty and opposing external interferences.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that from the long-range and strategic
point of view, Africa is a continent full of hopes.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Assures Customers of Good Services (By Pei Shanqin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA) has assured its customers that the
Chinese-built railway is more reliable, despite stiff competition
from other modes of transport.
</P>
<P>
The TAZARA Managing Director, Antisne Mweemba told reporters
here today that TAZARA had been striving to provide its customers
with good services so as to meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
"We have introduced a reliable customer information service to
provide spot information to our customers regarding the
whereabouts of their cargoes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The TAZARA chief said that the new information service to
TAZARA clients had been achieved due to an assistance from the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD has assited TAZARA in the installation of the
advanced cargo information system (ACIS) railway module called
railtracker.
</P>
<P>
ACIS, developed by UNCTAD, provides transport operators and
auxillary professions with reliable, useful and immediate data on
operations taking place on transport modes.,
</P>
<P>
Mweemba said that with the new information service, TAZARA
cliens might be connected to the ACIS and be able to supervise
their cargoes through connected computers.
</P>
<P>
"They will only view their own wagons or cargoes position for
confidential purposes," said Charles Tamba, a UNCTAD computor
expert seconded to TAZARA to supervise the implementation of the
railtracker.
</P>
<P>
So far, according to Tamba, TAZARA has introduced official
telephone lines which will enable TAZARA customers to know about
the whereabouts of their wagons and cargoes. enditem

<HEADLINE> Intense Summer Drought Forecast in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- An extremely intense drought in some
parts of Britain is being forecast by scientists after rainfall
for the first half of this month was well below the seasonal
average, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
In some places of the country, rainfall levels for May
reportedly fell as low as 1 percent of the seasonal average,
bringing closer the prospect of serious water shortages this
summer.
</P>
<P>
According to the Institute of Hydrology, rainfall for the
13-month period from April 1995 to April 1996 was the fifth lowest
in 228 years of records. Water levels are still below normal in
many reservoirs across England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report, the institute said, "Over this 13-month
period, most regions have recorded only three or four months with
above average rainfall. A few districts in the north have reported
none, and the more than 50 percent rainfall deficiency is
indicative of an extremely intense drought."
</P>
<P>
Across the country, rainfall for the first half of May reached
only 24 percent of its average level, according to the
Meteorological Office.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected areas were the south Pennines and reservoirs
in West Yorkshire, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Water Service Association, which monitors water resources,
said the water companies had invested 350 million pounds (525
million U.S. dollars) in safeguarding the water supply.

<HEADLINE> Senators Call for Reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of senators today urged
the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House a
year after it was closed to motor vehicle traffic for security
concern.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in front of the White House, Senator Rod
Grams called the closing a "knee-jerk reaction to fear."
</P>
<P>
Grams, along with two co-sponsors, introduced a resolution in
the Senate this week urging the reopening.
</P>
<P>
Members of the District of Columbia Council, along with
preservationists, business groups and the American Automobile
Association's local chapter also reportedly want the street
reopened.
</P>
<P>
The two-block section of the avenue was closed on May 20, 1995,
after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.
</P>
<P>
The section is closed at either end by concrete barricades. The
National Park Service is planning to convert it into a pedestrian
mall.
</P>
<P>
"The hard fact is that in order for us to protect the president
from vehicles with explosive devices in them driving past the
perimeter, Pennsylvania Avenue must remain closed," said Carl
Meyer, a spokesman for the Secret Service.
