Japanese students exposed to radioactivity near their school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nine junior high school students were exposed to
low levels of radiation while playing with radioactive cubes they
found near a monitoring facility in northern Japan, an official
said Wednesday.
	   The students were exposed again when workers from the station,
located near their school, asked them to help search for the small
devices, said Nobutoshi Sato of the Miyagi prefectural, or state,
nuclear power safety office.
	   Five teachers helping to search for the cubes, used to measure
radioactivity, were also exposed, he said. The incident took place
on Dec. 2.
	   Officials first publicly announced the exposures on Tuesday,
saying the amount of harmful material in the cubes was so low that
medical checks on the students and teachers were not necessary,
Sato said.
	   He also said officials did not publicize the case earlier
because they did not want to cause high levels of anxiety at the
school.
	   Workers left the cubes in a metal container outside the facility
on Dec. 2, Sato said. The facility and the school are located in
the town of Onagawa, 365 kilometers (226 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   The students found the container at the station the same day,
and while they were playing with it the cubes fell out onto the
ground, Sato said.
	   When the workers found the empty container about 10 minutes
later, they asked the students and teachers to help look for the
lost cubes, he said.
	   The prefecture set up the facility, which stands next to Onagawa
No. 1 Junior High School, to monitor radiation levels from a nearby
nuclear power plant.

Two Hong Kong citizens, Malaysian released by kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIMBANGAN, Philippines (AP) _ Two Hong Kong citizens and a
Malaysian kidnapped by former Muslim rebels in the southern
Philippines were released Wednesday after 106 days in captivity.
	   Officials said no ransom was paid for the release of Law Cheung
Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong Kong and Tong Ket Ming of Malaysia.
	   But a military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the men's employer paid at least 2 million pesos (about dlrs
51,000) in ``board and lodging'' fees to the kidnappers.
	   The three were seized Sept. 8 while buying live fish for sale to
Hong Kong restaurants near an island in Tawi-Tawi province close to
the border of the east Malaysian state of Sabah.
	   They were then brought to Sulu province and moved from town to
town in the hinterlands as police and soldiers searched for them.
	   The kidnappers included members of the Muslim extremist Abu
Sayyaf group, whose leader was killed in a raid by police last
Saturday, and former members of the Moro National Liberation Front,
the main Muslim rebel group that had signed a peace agreement with
the government.
	   Negotiators led by MNLF chief of staff Yusuf Jikiri and Sulu
Gov. Munib Estino fetched the victims from the kidnappers' mountain
hideout outside Timbangan town, about 920 kilometers (575 miles)
south of Manila.
	   ``We are very happy that we have been released by the
kidnappers,'' said Malaysian Tong Ket Ming.
	   He said they were fed mainly dried fish and root crops and were
not harmed by the kidnappers.
	   ``The first thing I will do is talk to my family in Hong Kong,
my mother, my father,'' said Law Cheung Yau.
	   Estino said the kidnappers held the three men hostage to show
the government that they have been ``left behind'' in receiving
social benefits for former rebels.
	   ``We had to explain to them the program of the government for
development, that's why it took us many days for them to accept the
program of the government,'' he said.
	   Police Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, the head of the
presidential anti-organized crime task force, said the Muslim feast
of Ramadan as well as the involvement in the negotiations of MNLF
chairman Nur Misuari helped in winning the early release of the
victims.
	   ``Fortunately this matter was settled without bloodshed,'' said
Interior Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno. ``This is an indication that
much can be done here in this region ... if we communicate well
with one another. I'm very happy.''
	   The three men were brought to a military hospital in Zamboanga
City, north of Sulu, for a checkup. They were to be flown to Manila
after that.

Australian Open champion Korda failed drugs test: ITF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS details on Korda's negative test at Australian
Open, nandrolone &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Open tennis champion Petr
Korda declared he was ``not a drugs cheat'' after being sanctioned
for testing positive to a banned steroid at this year's Wimbledon
Championships.
	   The 30-year-old Czech was stripped of the 199 rankings points
and U.S. dlrs 94,529 prizemoney he earned by reaching the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year.
	   Korda's argument that he did not know how the steroid nandrolone
got into his system was accepted by the International Tennis
Federation, which made the matter public Wednesday following the
end of an appeal process.
	   The ITF's appeals committee, sitting on Dec. 22 in London, ruled
that as Korda was unaware he had taken or been administered the
banned substance, no further penalty would be imposed. Korda said
in a statement that he was pleased with the appeals committee's
finding.
	   ``I wish to state categorically that I am not a drugs cheat and
would never seek to obtain a competitive advantage over my fellow
professionals by such means,'' Korda said. ``I am delighted that
the committee has vindicated me.''
	   The appeals committee heard evidence from Korda, his
representatives and the federation before making its ruling.
	   In his statement, Korda said he had been informed by the
federation on Aug. 1 that he had tested positive to nandrolone and
was issued with a notice of violation in October. He then lodged an
appeal.
	   Korda said he and his advisers had made exhaustive, but
unsuccessful, attempts to find the source of the illegal substance.
	   ``This allegation came as a tremendous shock and caused
considerable distress to me and my family,'' said Korda.
	   ``From a professional standpoint my performances since August
suffered, as my recent results have shown.
	   ``Whilst I am in the final stages of my career I still love the
game. I am delighted that the committee has cleared my name and
that I am free to carry on playing and competing.''
	   Under ITF rules, Korda was found to have committed a doping
offense, even though the federation was satisfied he had not taken
the banned substance intentionally.
	   Therefore, it was compelled to deduct the rankings points earned
by Korda at Wimbledon and require him to return his prizemoney.
	   Korda broke through for his first Grand Slam title in February
when he beat Marcelo Rios in the final of the Australian Open in
Melbourne.
	   A spokeswoman for the event said Wednesday that Korda had passed
a drugs test at that tournament.
	   ``Petr Korda, the defending champion, was tested after he won
the 1998 Australian Open men's final and the result was negative,''
she said in a statement.
	   The statement said players are randomly tested throughout the
tournament, then all players involved in the singles from the
quarter-finals onwards are tested.
	   Nandrolone boosts muscle development and reduces fatigue. A
Kuwaiti weightlifter tested positive to the steroid at this month's
Asian Games while Sri Lankan star sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe is
under investigation by the IAAF after testing positive to the drug
this year. Jayasinghe said she used the drug to control her
menstrual cycle.
	   French studies showed 28 of that country's athletes across
several sports tested positive to nandrolone in 1996. (tjh)

21 bus passengers die in SAfrica accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAINGSBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A bus carrying holiday travelers
collided with a truck on a highway north of Cape Town early
Wednesday, and 21 people were killed, media reports said.
	   Four of the dead were children, and 17 people were critically
injured in the accident just after midnight, SABC state television
said.
	   The bus was carrying about 60 people when it hit an 18-meter
(yard) long-hawl truck on the N-1 highway near this town about 260
kilometers (160 miles) northeast of Cape Town, SABC radio said.
	   The cause was not immediately known.
	   Reporters on the scene said luggage was strewn along the side of
the road, and that a side of the bus was sheered away. A number of
passengers did not want to be returned to Cape Town for fear of
losing the bus fare.
	   Many South Africans are returning from the cities to their
villages ahead of Christmas, a period when road accidents plague
South Africa.
	   The government has launched a major public information campaign
this year to stem the carnage, but more than 430 people have died
on the roads this month. Many of the accidents are blamed on drunk
driving.

Report: Funeral pyre explodes in Cambodia injuring five mourners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Five mourners were injured when the
funeral pyre they built to cremate a deceased relative mysteriously
exploded, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The pyre, built from banana trees and holding the coffin of a
77-year-old man, had been soaked in kerosene and gasoline, Koh
Santepheap (Island of Peace) newspaper said.
	   As soon as it was lit to begin the cremation, it exploded,
sending out sprays of flame on to the mourners, the paper said.
	   Three children aged 8 and 12, a 19-year-old woman and the
deceased man's brother aged 55 were burned on their bodies and
faces.
	   The paper did not say what happened to the coffin. The incident
occurred in Kompong Cham province, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
northeast of Phnom Penh.
	   The newspaper quoted Kompong Cham provincial police as saying
the blast may have been caused by technical mistakes and
recklessness in constructing the pyre.

Poll: Most Thai women oppose impeaching Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In Thailand, where it's common for
powerful men to keep mistresses and more than one wife, most women
oppose the impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton. Men,
however, are split on the issue.
	   Those are the results of a poll of 2,586 people in Bangkok and
four other Thai cities conducted from December 19-22 by the Suan
Dusit Rajabhat Institute and released Wednesday.
	   Of the 1,638 women surveyed, 64.3 percent said the House of
Representatives was wrong to impeach Clinton, because his affair
with an intern was a personal matter.
	   The women said they admire Clinton's capabilities and suspected
that the Republicans were playing a political game.
	   The 948 men who responded were evenly split on whether Clinton
should have been impeached.
	   In Thailand many politicians and wealthy businessmen have what
are known as minor wives: one or more women the man also lives with
and who may bear him children.
	   Although courts do not recognize them as the equal of a man's
first wife, they are entitled to some legal rights as a wife if a
dispute arises.
	   One former deputy interior minister boasted of having nine minor
wives.
	   Until early this century, Thailand was a polygamous society.
	   The Suan Dusit poll was conducted in Bangkok, Chiang Mai,
Songkhla, Nakhon Ratchasima and Nakhon Sawan. No margin of error
was given.
	   The Suan Dusit Rajabhat Institute is the research arm of a local
university.

Courier gets wildcard to Auckland Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Former No.1-ranked Jim Courier has
accepted a controversial wildcard into the Auckland Open tennis
tournament, starting Jan. 11.
	   Courier is ranked No.76 and missed automatic entry by 10 places.
	   Tournament director Graham Pearce said Wednesday that Courier
had been offered and accepted one of three wildcards for the
tournament. Pearce had earlier said Courier was unlikely to get a
wildcard because they are usually reserved for local players.
	   Despite Tennis New Zealand preferring the wildcard to go to New
Zealanders, Pearce decided to ensure Courier could play in a draw
headed by world No.2 and defending champion Marcelo Rios.
	   ``Courier is a household name and one of the best players this
decade,'' Pearce said. ``To have him play in Auckland at the
Heineken Open is an opportunity not to be missed and he'll be a
huge draw card.''
	   Courier has won both the Australian and French Open on two
occasions and has been runner-up at the U.S. and French Opens.

Thai army will give up ownership of radio, television stations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a move that should enhance freedom
of expression, the Thai army will give up ownership of most of its
radio frequencies and television stations, the office of the
commander in chief said Wednesday.
	   The Thai army controls 128 radio frequencies and will probably
retain only about 50 for military use and security, a spokesman for
Army Commander in Chief Gen. Surayud Chulanont said.
	   In addition, the army will probably give up control of
television Channel 7, but retain Channel 5.
	   The frequencies will be turned over to the government for
privatization.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has set up a national committee to
reassess the need for each government agency to have transmission
frequencies.
	   The idea of reassessing the need is in line with the new
constitution, the army spokesman said. The constitution, passed in
1997, guarantees greater degrees of civil liberties.
	   In the past, academics had argued that military ownership of
radio and television stations had a chilling effect on open
discourse, as angering military leaders could lead to a station
having its license or ability to operate revoked.
	   Current Army Commander in Chief Gen. Surayud is regarded as a
reformer who is determined to professionalize the army and reduce
its role in political and civilian affairs.

	   In Denver, Dominic Roussel stopped 45 shots for his first
victory in more than two years and Jeff Nielsen scored his first
goal of the season as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim beat the Colorado
Avalanche.
	   Roussel, who last won on March 22, 1996 in a 4-1 victory over
Winnipeg, outdueled Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, who made 20 saves
but had a hand in Nielsen's goal.
	   Roy sent a blind cross-ice clearing pass right onto Nielsen's
stick at the upper right circle. Nielsen sent a wrist shot into the
net at 5:10 of the second period before Roy got back into position.
	   Nielsen's first goal since April 19, 1998 was the first Roy and
the Avalanche have allowed in 189:40 at home.

	   In Calgary, Alberta, Harry York's goal and two assists led
Vancouver over the Calgary Flames in a game marred by a head injury
to Canucks captain Mark Messier.
	   Messier was injured on his second shift when he crashed into the
Flames' net after scoring a goal at 3:36 of the first. He was
helped off after about two minutes. It was the 11th goal of the
season for Messier, who turns 38 on Jan. 18.
	   His status for Wednesday night's return matchup in Vancouver was
not known.
	   Dave Scatchard, Adrian Aucoin and Donald Brashear also scored
for the Canucks. Jarome Iginla had two goals and Michael Nylander
also scored for the Flames.

<TEXT>
	   LAINGSBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A bus carrying holiday travelers
collided with a truck on a highway north of Cape Town early
Wednesday, and 21 people were killed, media reports said.
	   Four of the dead were children, and 17 people were injured in
the accident, which occurred just after midnight, SABC state
television said.
	   The bus was carrying about 60 people when it hit an 18-meter
(yard) long-hawl truck on the N-1 highway near this town about 260
kilometers (160 miles) northeast of Cape Town, SABC radio said.
	   The cause was not immediately known.
	   Reporters on the scene said luggage was strewn along the edge of
the road, and that a side of the bus was sheered away. A number of
passengers did not want to be returned to Cape Town for fear of
losing the bus fare.
	   Seven of the injured were in critical condition, the state TV
said.
	   The bus was heading toward the Transkei region along the
country's southeastern coast, a rural zone home to mainly Xhosa
people.
	   Many South Africans are returning from the cities to their
villages ahead of Christmas, a period when road accidents plague
South Africa.
	   The government has launched a major public information campaign
this year to stem the carnage, but more than 430 people have died
on the roads this month. Many of the accidents are blamed on drunk
driving.

New Zealand recession ends as export-led recovery kicks in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Six months after New Zealand
succumbed to the Asian financial crisis and slid into recession,
official statistics released Wednesday showed that the recession is
over.
	   Latest gross domestic product figures show the economy grew by a
better-than-expected 0.7 percent in the quarter ending through
September.
	   The short-lived recession in the first two quarters of the year
was sparked by the Asian crisis hitting exports, the worldwide
slump in farm commodity prices and a drought which hit farm output.
	   But the latest data shows New Zealand experiencing an export-led
recovery after producers diversified to markets in Europe, Britain
and the United States and away from depressed Asian economies.
	   ``The growth that has occurred appears to have been export-led,
as industries such as forestry and manufacturing have made some
recovery from the falls in production over the previous two
quarters,'' said Ian Ewing, deputy statistician with Statistics New
Zealand.
	   But the recovery appears fragile. Activity in domestic-based
industries was flat or down in the quarter and local spending
showed a hesitant upturn buoyed by tax cuts.
	   Purchases of durables, especially cars, was the major
contributor to growth, up 4.4 percent.
	   ``After being depressed for some time the household market for
cars appears to have been given new life by the removal of motor
vehicle tariffs in May and tax cuts in July,'' Ewing said.
	   He said the annual growth figure was the lowest in six years.
	   The economy had contracted by 0.8 percent in the three months to
June 30 and 1 percent in the March quarter to meet the definition
of a recession _ two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
	   The National Bank is predicting 0.6 percent growth in the
December quarter when it sees the recovery spreading into the
domestic sector.
	   Financial markets reacted immediately to the figures, pushing up
both the New Zealand dollar and domestic interest rates.
	   The dollar jumped 40 basic points to U.S. cents 52.32, and
90-day bank bills rose 10 points to 4.66 percent.
	   Finance Minister Bill Birch said the economy had come through
the Asian crisis with flying colors.

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ More than a dozen Katyusha rockets
rained down on northern Israel early Wednesday, injuring at least
eight people, Israeli media and witnesses said.
	   Paramedics reported at least four injuries from the rockets that
fell in and around the town of Kiryat Shemona, located on Israel's
northeastern border with Lebanon.
	   Another four people were injured in the western Galilee region
from about ten rockets that fell there, the paramedics said.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for the attack in the wake of an
Israeli air strike Tuesday against Lebanon that killed a woman and
her six children. That was the highest civilian casualty toll this
year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said the rockets landed in
a garage just minutes after workers from Thailand left the
building. None of the workers was injured.
	   Residents of northern Israel had been told to spend the night in
bomb shelters in anticipation of retaliatory rocket attacks by the
guerrilla group Hezbollah. Israeli warplanes flew over southern

Military to arrest, convict electricity thieves in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The military has been given sweeping
powers by the Pakistani president to arrest, investigate and try
people involved in electricity theft, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   President Rafique Tarar announced the law Tuesday to slash the
massive losses of state-run utilities. The trials will be conducted
by military courts which have already been set up in
violence-plagued Karachi to try those responsible for killings and
alleged terrorists activities.
	   The opposition said the government intends to extend the army's
role in other parts of the country as well.
	   ``The menace of stealing of electricity is rampant'' which has
made it necessary to call upon the Armed Forces to help civil
government, the announcement said.
	   In a separate law, Tarar raised the penalty for electricity
theft to 5 million rupees (dlrs 110,000) from 5,000 rupees.
	   The state-run Water and Power Development Authority and the
Karachi Electric Supply Corporation suffers billions of rupees in
losses every year due to theft. Between 35 to 40 percent of the
total power distributed by those two utilities is stolen.
	   The main opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party has bitterly opposed
using the military saying that modern democratic governments seldom
use military courts in civilian matters.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Surrounded by his family and thousands of
flag-waving citizens, Emperor Akihito celebrated his 65th birthday
Wednesday with a public address recalling difficulties Japan faced
the past year.
	   ``This was a year of many pains,'' Akihito told a crowd of
nearly 10,000 people gathered on the grounds of the sprawling
Imperial Palace in central Tokyo. ``I hope the next year is a good
year for each and every one of us,'' he said.
	   The palace is open to the public only on the emperor's birthday,
which is a national holiday, and on Jan. 2, one of a string of
three consecutive national holidays that mark the beginning of the
new year.
	   In a news conference held in advance of his birthday, Akihito
also expressed sympathy for people at home and abroad who have
endured economic hardship and natural disaster.
	   He said he is particularly worried about the effects of the
current economic recession on the Japanese people.
	   ``With the economic situation becoming increasingly severe this
year and with the rising unemployment rate, I am deeply concerned
for the welfare of the people of Japan,'' he said.
	   The emperor also recalled his trip to England earlier this year,
saying that it called to mind the unforgettable suffering people
endured in World War II.
	   Akihito's May visit was marked by protests from angry British
veterans who were interned in Japanese prisoner camps during the
war.
	   When asked at the news conference what he would do if he had
more free time, Akihito, who is an expert on marine biology and
ichthyology, said he would like to continue his research.
	   No foreign media and only a few Japanese reporters were allowed
to attend the press conference, as is customary with imperial
briefings.
	   A translated transcript of the emperor's comments was provided
by the palace for release on Wednesday.

At least 10 hurt in rocket attack on northern Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more injuries, details throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Dozens of Katyusha rockets rained
down on northern Israel early Wednesday, injuring at least ten
people, Israeli media and officials said.
	   Hezbollah guerillas operating from south Lebanon claimed
responsibility for the attack. Israel's army confirmed the injury
figure and said its forces were returning fire.
	   At least five people were slightly injured and one was in stable
condition from the rockets that fell in and around the border town
of Kiryat Shemona, in northeastern Israel. Paramedics said most of
the injuries were from shock.
	   Another four people were slightly injured in the western Galilee
region from about ten rockets that fell there, the paramedics said.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for the attack in the wake of an
Israeli air strike Tuesday against Lebanon that killed a woman and
her six children. That was the highest civilian casualty toll this
year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   The rockets fell with a tremendous boom that could be heard for
miles. Some of the rockets fired into in the western Galilee landed
in the Mediterranean sea, but others collapsed roofs of houses in
villages and collective farms.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one of the rockets
heavily damaged a house where workers from Thailand live, just
minutes after the workers left the building. None of the workers
was injured.
	   Residents of northern Israel had been told to spend the night in
bomb shelters in anticipation of retaliatory rocket attacks by the
guerrilla group Hezbollah. Israeli warplanes flew over southern
Lebanon Tuesday night and dropped flares, apparently to thwart
guerrilla movements.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Tibetan lama who criticized Dalai Lama dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Sengchen Lobsang Gyaltsen, a senior Tibetan
Buddhist cleric and controversial supporter of Chinese rule who
openly criticized the Dalai Lama, has died. He was 62.
	   Sengchen, a vice chairman of Tibet's regional legislature and
China's national legislature, died in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
on Dec. 6 after a lengthy and unspecified illness, the official
Tibet Daily reported on Dec. 12.
	   The newspaper praised Sengchen as a ``dear friend'' of the
Communist Party and a patriot. Vice President Hu Jintao, a former
party chief in Tibet, was among the senior officials who sent their
condolences, it added.
	   Sengchen played a key role in one of the most arcane and
divisive episodes in Tibet's recent political life: the search for
the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, Tibet's most revered
religious figure after the Dalai Lama.
	   China hoped to control the search to help confer legitimacy on
its often harsh rule over Tibet.
	   When the Dalai Lama announced from exile that the reincarnation
was found in May 1995, Sengchen denounced Tibet's spiritual leader
and supported Chinese efforts to install a rival candidate.
	   Sengchen, who held one of Tibetan Buddhism's highest scholarly
degrees, was then named head of a Communist Party-backed committee
to ensure the political loyalty of Tashilhunpo, an influential
monastery that is the Panchen Lama's traditional seat of power.
	   A bomb exploded outside Sengchen's home in Lhasa in January
1996. Although no one claimed responsibility, many saw the
explosion as retaliation.

Indonesian customs agents uncover marijuana in Christmas cakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A batch of Christmas cakes yielded an
unusual ingredient during a search by customs agents: marijuana.
	   The drugs were hidden in a freight delivery that was stopped at
Jakarta's main airport, The Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
	   Officials on Tuesday uncovered 34 kilograms (75 pounds) of
marijuana in the cakes as well as in packets of coffee and boxes of
old documents.
	   The shipment from the northwestern province of Aceh was likely
to be sold in Jakarta. Authorities searched it after a tip-off from
undercover agents in Aceh, said customs chief Heru Santoso.
	   There were no arrests.
	   Indonesia is predominately Muslim, but the government promotes
religious tolerance and Christmas Day is a national holiday.

Indonesian elite soldiers accused of kidnapping go on trial

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military court on Wednesday charged
11 elite soldiers with kidnapping pro-democracy activists in the
last months of former President Suharto's rule.
	   The abductions were carried out earlier this year amid a growing
wave of protests against the authoritarian Suharto that triggered
deadly riots and forced him from power in May.
	   Yet a key figure linked to the kidnappings, the former head of
Indonesia's special forces, was in Jordan and apparently beyond the
reach of military investigators.
	   Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, had
successfully sought citizenship in Jordan, where he has close ties
with military officers with whom he once conducted joint training
exercises.
	   Prabowo has not been charged but he was suspected of engineering
the abductions. The military, which is trying to clean up its human
rights record, had said it might court-martial him.
	   In Jakarta, the soldiers accused of kidnapping stood impassively
in green uniforms and red berets as a military prosecutor read a
27-page document outlining the charges.
	   Col. Haron Wijaya, a military prosecutor, said the suspects
abducted nine activists in a series of operations between February
and April and interrogated them at the Jakarta headquarters of
Kopassus, the military's elite force.
	   He said the suspects kidnapped their victims at a Jakarta legal
aid office, a hospital, an amusement park and the clandestine
headquarters of the People's Democratic Party, a pro-democracy
group that was banned at the time.
	   The suspects include one major, seven captains and three
sergeants. They allegedly used a private van and jeep, blindfolding
and handcuffing the victims.
	   Student leader Pius Lustrilanang and other activists have
alleged they were tortured. Thirteen activists remain missing.
	   ``We were punched and burned with cigarettes. Our heads were
pushed underwater in the bathroom,'' said Pius, who attended the
trial of the soldiers.
	   Family members of some activists watched the proceedings and
jeered the suspects after the hearing. The courtroom was packed
with uniformed members of the military's elite forces.
	   The next hearing in the trial, which is expected to last several
months, will be held Dec. 31. If convicted, the soldiers face up to
seven years in jail.

Suharto relative denies he accepted Jordanian citizenship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Indonesia-Kidnapping Trial

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relative of former President Suharto
being investigated for alleged kidnapping said he turned down an
offer of Jordanian citizenship, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   In a statement sent from Jordan, former Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto said he was visiting the country in order to pursue
business opportunities and denied any wrongdoing.
	   Jordan said Tuesday it had granted honorary citizenship to
Prabowo, a son-in-law of Suharto who is suspected in the abduction
and torture of pro-democracy protesters earlier this year. The
military has said it might court-martial him.
	   The authoritarian Suharto quit in May after riots and protests
against his 32-year rule.
	   In Jakarta on Wednesday, 11 soldiers belonging to Indonesia's
special forces were charged in a military court with kidnapping the
opponents of Suharto. Prabowo was in command of the elite troops at
the time.
	   In a letter to the daily Kompas newspaper, Prabowo said he was
offered Jordanian citizenship, ``but I was forced to reject it
because Indonesia does not recognize dual citizenship.''
	   Justice Minister Muladi said that if Prabowo accepts Jordanian
citizenship, his Indonesian citizenship will automatically be
revoked.
	   Prabowo, who for many Indonesians represents the worst excesses
of the Suharto era, denied allegations that he engineered riots
that preceded Suharto's downfall.
	   A government-backed panel of investigators implicated Prabowo in
the riots that killed 1,200 people in Jakarta. Critics have
suggested military hardliners provoked the violence in order to
justify a crackdown on government opponents.
	   ``I sternly and strongly deny these accusations,'' Prabowo said.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Dallas Drake, Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick
each had a goal and an assist as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the
struggling Detroit Red Wings.
	   Juha Ylonen, Teppo Numminen and Bob Corkum also scored for the
Coyotes, who have won both their meetings with Detroit this season.
	   The Coyotes have won two straight following their first two-game
losing streak of the season and have 42 points, just two behind
first-place Dallas in the Pacific Division.
	   Brendan Shanahan had a goal and an assist and Igor Larionov
scored the other goal for the Red Wings. The two-time defending
Stanley Cup champions have lost three straight, four out of five
and are 4-10 against teams with .500 or better records.
 &UR; Kings 3, Penguins 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Jamie Storr stopped 25 shots and Glen Murray
scored one goal and set up another in 27 seconds as the Los Angeles
Kings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-0 Tuesday night.
	   The win was Larry Robinson's 100th in four seasons as the Kings'
coach. He has a 100-136-43 record in that time.
	   The shutout was the second of the season for Storr and third of
his career. He made his toughest save six minutes into the second
period when he kicked out his right pad to stop Jaromir Jagr.
	   He got the Kings' first shutout in Pittsburgh since March 7,
1979, when Mario Lessard had a 4-0 win at the Civic Arena.
 &UR; Islanders 3, Blues 3
	   In Uniondale, New York, Todd Gill spoiled Zigmund Palffy's
return to the New York Islanders with his first goal of the season
in the final six minutes, giving the St. Louis Blues a tie.
	   Palffy, playing his first game since ending a long holdout last
week, assisted on two goals. Palffy, the Islanders' top goal scorer
the last three seasons, signed a five-year deal for about dlrs 25
million to end a long and sometimes acrimonious contract battle
with the team.
	   Gill beat Wade Flaherty with a slap shot at 5:46. The play
needed video review before it was allowed to stand and extend the
Blues' unbeaten streak to three games (2-0-1).
	   Scott Pellerin and Marty Reasoner also scored for the Blues.
Mariusz Czerkawski scored twice for the Islanders, while Claude
Lapointe had one goal.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 1, Avalanche 0
	   In Denver, Dominic Roussel stopped 45 shots for his first
victory in more than two years and Jeff Nielsen scored his first
goal of the season as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim beat the Colorado
Avalanche.
	   Roussel, who last won on March 22, 1996 in a 4-1 victory over
Winnipeg, outdueled Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, who made 20 saves
but had a hand in Nielsen's goal.
	   Roy sent a blind cross-ice clearing pass right onto Nielsen's
stick at the upper right circle. Nielsen sent a wrist shot into the
net at 5:10 of the second period before Roy got back into position.
	   Nielsen's first goal since April 19, 1998 was the first Roy and
the Avalanche have allowed in 189:40 at home.
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Harry York's goal and two assists led
Vancouver over the Calgary Flames in a game marred by a head injury
to Canucks captain Mark Messier.
	   Messier was injured on his second shift when he crashed into the
Flames' net after scoring a goal at 3:36 of the first. He was
helped off after about two minutes. It was the 11th goal of the
season for Messier, who turns 38 on Jan. 18.
	   His status for Wednesday night's return matchup in Vancouver was
not known.
	   Dave Scatchard, Adrian Aucoin and Donald Brashear also scored
for the Canucks. Jarome Iginla had two goals and Michael Nylander
also scored for the Flames.

Court rejects Anwar suit claiming illegal ouster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court on Wednesday dismissed a
lawsuit filed by jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim accusing the prime
minister of violating the constitution by firing him.
	   High Court Judge Mohamed Saari Yusoff rejected the claim,
saying, ``I do not see why there should be further hearing or
arguments on the matter.''
	   The civil suit alleged that Mahathir took it on himself to
dismiss Anwar as his finance minister and deputy prime minister on
Sept. 2, rather than seeking the consent of Malaysian King Tuanku
Ja'afar, as the constitution requires.
	   Anwar is accused in a separate trial in criminal court for abuse
of power and sexual misconduct. He denies the charges and calls
politically motivated.
	   Anwar's letter of dismissal, signed by Mahathir, reads: ``With
regret, I am compelled to relieve you of your appointment of deputy
prime minister and finance minister.''
	   Anwar's attorney, Karpal Singh, argued that the wording of the
letter showed that Mahathir had made the decisions himself and had
bypassed the king, who is the only authority empowered to appoint
and dismiss Cabinet ministers.
	   Technically, Karpal argued, Anwar should still be considered
finance and deputy prime minister. He added that Mahathir's
appointment of himself as first finance minister and the country's
1999 budget, which he presented after Anwar's ouster, should be
declared invalid.
	   ``The executive must act within the confines of the
constitution, and the prime minister must not be allowed to just
get away with this,'' Karpal told the court. ``The judiciary must
be brave.''
	   Judge Mohamed Saari said he believed Anwar's dismissal letter
``satisfied the requirement of the constitution.''
	   Despite the fact that there was no evidence showing the letter
was written at the behest of the king, Mohamed Saari said he
believed the king was advised of the dismissal by Mahathir.
	   ``I don't see why the prime minister himself could not sign the
letter,'' the judge told the court.
	   Karpal said he planned to file an appeal Thursday morning.

At least 10 hurt in rocket attack on northern Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Dozens of Katyusha rockets rained
down on northern Israel early Wednesday, damaging buildings,
knocking out power and injuring at least ten people.
	   Although there was heavy property damage _ the worst in nearly
three years from a cross-border attack from Lebanon _ most people
had spent the night in shelters, accounting for the relatively
light casualty toll.
	   Hezbollah guerillas operating from south Lebanon claimed
responsibility for the attack. Israel's army confirmed the injury
figure of 11 and said its forces were returning fire.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for a retaliatory attack in the
wake of an Israeli air strike Tuesday that killed a woman and her
six children in south Lebanon. That was the highest civilian
casualty toll this year in the war between Israel and Lebanese
guerrillas.
	   In the 7:30 a.m. attack, the rockets fell with a tremendous boom
that could be heard for miles. At least six injuries _ five slight,
one more serious _ were reported in and around the border town of
Kiryat Shemona, in northern Israel.
	   Over the years, the town has been hit so often by rockets that
some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha.''
	   One rocket hit a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets. A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the
electricity was out in some areas.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   About ten rockets fell in the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some of those rockets fell harmlessly into
the sea, but others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and
collective farms. Paramedics reported at least four injuries.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one of the rockets hit
a house where agricultural workers from Thailand lived, just
minutes after the workers left the building. The house was heavily
damaged, but none of the workers was injured.
	   On Tuesday night, Israeli warplanes had flown over southern
Lebanon Tuesday night and dropped flares, apparently to thwart
guerrilla movements.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Taiwan to employ more home-developed missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's military plans to cut back
purchases of foreign-made anti-aircraft missiles after domestically
produced versions were successfully tested, the defense minister
said Wednesday.
	   ``Our policy is to give priority to weapons systems that we can
produce domestically,'' Chiang Chungj-ling told reporters.
	   The air force has already ordered home-made Sky Bow
surface-to-air missiles from the military-run Chungshan Institute
of Technology and Science, which developed them, he said.
	   Chiang did not comment on a newspaper report that Taiwan will
suspend its purchases of U.S. made Avenger air defense systems
which use Stinger surface-to-air missiles.
	   The China Times said the Taiwanese army decided to take delivery
70 such systems, instead of the originally planned 200, to save
funds in preparation for Taiwan's participation in the
U.S.-proposed theater missile defense program.
	   The report said the navy and air forces will also cut back their
purchases of portable Stingers.
	   Taiwan is considered particularly vulnerable to missile attack
from China, which considers the island a breakaway province to be
reunited by force if necessary.
	   Taiwan is spending over U.S. dlrs 385 million to deploy 200 of
the U.S.-made Patriot missiles, and is seeking U.S. help in
building a missile defense system.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, other socialists face sentencing for
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected as of 1230GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's highest court was to rule
Wednesday if ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and two other former
ministers are guilty of corruption in awarding two defense
contracts in the 1980s.
	   The trial against Claes, 60, ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, opened Sept. 2 with all
three denying they are guilty of bribe-taking.
	   Also pleading innocent were nine fellow defendants: eight former
aides and associates, plus Serge Dassault, head of France's
Dassault aviation concern.
	   Prosecutors alleged Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.37 million) to oil a December, 1988, contract for 46 army
helicopters.
	   Similarly, they alleged, Dassault Aviation SA paid a bribe of 60
million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June, 1989, deal to
equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   The corporate money _ ``gifts'' in Belgian political parlance _
were allegedly paid to this nation's Dutch and French-speaking
socialist parties through an exotic web of Swiss and Luxembourg
bank accounts.
	   The trial was held in the 15-judge high court after the
parliamentary immunity of Claes and other ex-cabinet members had
been been lifted.
	   The trial was a final curtain for a generation of party bosses
who, until the 1990s, ran their political families out of their
wallets and secret bank accounts, unhindered by any law banning
corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations. Thus,
prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid but that
the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to the
awarding of contracts that Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes. If so, they are guilty of corruption.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain by hired killers
in 1991, presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing and was
about to talk.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as
Belgian economics minister
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at government expense.
	   At the time, the government said Agusta and Dassault offered
better economic compensation than their rivals _ respectively
France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton Industries Inc. of the United
States. Such compensation usually means promises to create jobs in
return for winning defense contracts.

Impoverished Russian city wants Formula One racetrack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A run-down Russian industrial city is vying to
become a stop on the prestigious and costly Formula One car racing
tour, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The bid seems unlikely to succeed _ Tula, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) south of Moscow _ is suffering from a severe
post-Soviet slump made worse by Russia's latest financial crisis.
	   The city of 580,000 also has no existing racetrack and none of
the necessary infrastructure.
	   But city administrators in Tula said they have a rich investor
to pay for the dlrs 300 million track and plan to renovate the
airport, according to the Moscow Times newspaper.
	   They also have the support of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who signed a decree last week giving his nod of approval.
	   Even with the investor and Primakov's support, the odds are
against Tula. Formula One racing is is one of the world's most
expensive sports, and most race venues have been in the same places
for years.
	   Tula would also have to build a track first and go through a
long application process before Formula One officials consider
holding races there.
	   ``It's not absolutely impossible, but to say it's possible is
premature,'' Francesco Longanesi, spokesman for the Federation
Internationale de Automobiles, told the Moscow Times.
	   Tula's one advantage is that many European cities that host
Formula One races lost a major revenue source when the European
Union banned tobacco advertising from some tracks last year. There
is no such ban in Russia.
	   But Tula could also face competition from Moscow, which has much
larger coffers and better infrastructure. The Russian capital is
also thinking of building a Formula One racetrack and vying for a
place on the tour.

Lebanese guerrillas rocket northern Israel; 13 hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu to convene security Cabinet, northern
residents being ordered to stay in shelters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, accounting for the relatively light
casualty toll.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ a rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets. A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the
electricity was out in some areas.
	   As of mid-morning, several hours after the attack, tens of
thousands of people in northern Israel were being told to stay in
shelters.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, for which Hezbollah
guerillas claimed responsibility. Israel's army said its forces
were returning artillery fire and was prepared to launch air
strikes.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for a retaliatory attack after
Israeli air strike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in
south Lebanon. That was the highest civilian casualty toll this
year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   More than a dozen rockets were fired in Wednesday's attack,
falling with tremendous booms that could be heard for miles. At
least six injuries _ five slight, one more serious _ were reported
in and around Kiryat Shemona.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   More rockets were fired at the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some fell harmlessly into the sea, but
others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and collective farms.
Paramedics reported at least four injuries in the area.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one rocket hit a house
where agricultural workers from Thailand lived _ just minutes after
the workers left the building. The house was heavily damaged, but
none of the workers was hurt.
	   On Tuesday night, Israeli warplanes had flown over southern

	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in

As famine ebbs in southern Sudan, Christmas celebrations underway

	   PANTHAU, Sudan (AP) _ Cries of ``Hallelujah!'' rise through the
mud walls past the simple wooden cross on the thatched roof.
	   Inside the makeshift Protestant church in Panthau, a boy beats
on a cowhide drum and other Dinka children sing Christmas carols.
	   But the Christmas season isn't the only reason residents of Bahr
el-Gazal province in southwestern Sudan are singing. Having enough
to eat is the other.
	   After a spate of war-induced famine six months ago that killed
thousands, international aid is _ for the time being _ keeping
starvation at bay.
	   ``People are doing well. There is food to satisfy the
community,'' said Victor Garang, a member of the political wing of
the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
	   ``That's why you get a child attending the church. Before, he
did not attend because he had no food,'' he said.
	   Panthau is controlled by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,
the main rebel group fighting the Islamic government for control of
the south, where most people follow Christian or indigenous African
religions.
	   Panthau, about 600 miles (965 kilometers) southwest of the
capital, Khartoum, suffered most this year from a government ban on
supplying relief food to rebel-held areas.
	   Many people fled their homes and fields following attacks by
government-allied forces. Subsequent looting, compounded by severe
flooding, resulted in one of the worst harvests in years.
	   By the time international pressure forced the government to lift
the ban, allowing the world's largest current relief operation to
begin, hundreds of thousands were facing death in Panthau and
neighboring Ajiep.
	   Since then, aircraft have dropped relief food supplies at a
record rate, and death has given way to survival.
	   In the feeding center in Ajiep, where thousands clamored at the
gates just six months ago _ some so hungry they were eating sand _
a dozen youths recovering from hunger played soccer in the yard
recently.
	   Nearby, children sat under the shade of a tree that serves as
their school.
	   ``A is for apple, B is for bat,'' they recited in English before
gathering to pray and sing Christmas songs around a wooden cross
stuck into the dry, brown earth.
	   ``We need uniforms for school and shoes to be ready for
Christmas,'' said 14-year-old Anyistheo Ahok Ajiek.
	   Food aid continues to pour in as humanitarian groups try to
restore stability to the devastated population. But aid agencies
warn that continued fighting could quickly push millions back
toward starvation.
	   In places like Adet, south of Ajiep, where the U.N. World Food
Program has only recently begun shipping food, people are
especially susceptible to the effects of the 15-year civil war.
	   ``Insecurity is definitely the main problem,'' said John Burns,
an aid worker with the agency. ``That is the reason people cannot
cultivate and cannot guarantee a good harvest.''
	   One farmer, caring for four wives and 12 children, lost his
cattle to rustlers allied with the north and could not plant crops
because of insecurity at home, Burns said.
	   ``In seven days' time they are going to have no food
whatsoever,'' he said. ``So when you think about Christmas here,
well ... it's very difficult for them to understand the concept.''
	   But in Panthau, the lull in the fighting is enough for
celebration.
	   Men in blue robes pounded the earth with their feet recently,
dancing to the accelerating beat of drums and sticks, their arms
raised like the horns of their beloved cattle. And in the church,
children returning to life sing to celebrate Christ's birth and
mark another year of survival in southern Sudan.

As ad revenue shrinks in crisis-hit Asia, Singapore agencies to
</HEADLINE>
fold

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nearly 10 percent of Singapore's numerous
advertising agencies will close next year as the Asian financial
crisis takes its toll on ad revenue, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Ad billings for most agencies plummeted between 10 percent and
40 percent in 1997, John Borzi, managing director of Leo Burnett
Singapore, was quoted as saying in The Business Times.
	   The trend, blamed on fee undercutting and falling client
budgets, is expected to continue, Borzi said.
	   Layoffs are also on the rise in the highly competitive industry,
which features a large number of local advertisers fighting it out
with high-profile international agencies, the report said.
	   There are about 80 members of the Association of Accredited
Advertising Agents in this city-state of 3.1 million people _ among
the highest concentrations of advertising firms in the world.
	   Telecommunications companies in high-tech Singapore remain the
top advertising spenders, contributing about 7 percent of the total
587 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 355 million) for ads during the
first half of 1997, added the paper.
	   When the current fixed telephone line monopoly ends in 2000 and
other mobile phone operators also enter the market, ad spending is
expected to pick up.
	   ``The whole IT area, and telecommunications particularly, these
are the two areas as far as new business we're looking at and
targeting,'' Borzi was quoted as saying. ``Its massive money.''

Nicholson wins call for injured Gillespie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian paceman Jason Gillespie
failed a fitness test and was ruled out Wednesday for the fourth
test against England at the MCG from Saturday.
	   Uncapped paceman Matthew Nicholson received a call up after a
strong performance against England early on tour.
	   Gillespie was troubled by soreness behind a knee.
	   Nicholson, from Western Australia, has played just six first
class games. The 24-year-old made his debut two seasons ago,
playing two matches, before suffering Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
	   He took seven wickets in an innings against England last month
and has claimed 17 Sheffield Shield wickets in four games this
season.
	   Australia leads the five test series 2-0 and has already
retained the Ashes.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, other socialists face sentencing for
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected as of 1230 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's highest court was to rule
Wednesday if ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and two other former
ministers are guilty of corruption in awarding two defense
contracts in the 1980s.
	   The trial against Claes, 60, ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67, opened Sept. 2 with all
three denying they are guilty of bribe-taking.
	   Also pleading innocent were nine fellow defendants: eight former
aides and associates, plus Serge Dassault, head of France's
Dassault aviation concern.
	   Prosecutors alleged Italy's Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs
(dlrs 1.37 million) to expedite a December 1988, contract for 46
army helicopters.
	   Similarly, they alleged, Dassault Aviation SA paid a bribe of 60
million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June 1989, deal to
equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   The corporate money _ ``gifts'' in Belgian political parlance _
were allegedly paid to this nation's Dutch and French-speaking
socialist parties through an exotic web of Swiss and Luxembourg
bank accounts.
	   The trial was held in the 15-judge high court after the
parliamentary immunity of Claes and other ex-cabinet members had
been lifted.
	   The trial was a final curtain for a generation of party bosses
who, until the 1990s, ran their political families out of their
wallets and secret bank accounts, unhindered by any law banning
corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989 that Belgium outlawed such donations.
Thus, prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts that Claes and the others had to know
they were bribes. If so, they are guilty of corruption.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a one-time socialist minister who was slain by hired killers
in 1991, presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing and was
about to talk.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as
Belgian economics minister

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, accounting for the relatively light
casualty toll.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ a rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets. A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the
electricity was out in some areas.
	   As of mid-morning, several hours after the attack, tens of
thousands of people in northern Israel were being told to stay in
shelters.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, for which Hezbollah
guerillas claimed responsibility. Israel's army said its forces
were returning artillery fire and were prepared to launch air
strikes.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for a retaliatory attack after
Israeli air strike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in
eastern Lebanon. That was the highest civilian casualty toll this
year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   An Israeli military spokesman expressed regret over the civilian
deaths, saying the target of the air strike had been a Hezbollah
radio transmitter.
	   In its claim of responsibilty, Hezbollah threatened more
attacks.
	   ``Since force cannot be confronted except with force and
murderers must pay the price of their crimes ... the Islamic
resistance rocketed Zionist settlements,'' said the statement. ``We
renew our pledge to protect our people and their villages, no
matter how great the struggle.''
	   Dozens of rockets were fired in Wednesday's attack, falling with
enormous booms that could be heard for miles. At least six injuries
_ five slight, one more serious _ were reported in and around
Kiryat Shemona.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   More rockets were fired at the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some fell harmlessly into the sea, but
others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and collective farms.
Paramedics reported at least four injuries in the area.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one rocket hit a house
where agricultural workers from Thailand lived _ just minutes after
the workers left the building. The house was heavily damaged, but
none of the workers was hurt.
	   On Tuesday night, Israeli warplanes had flown over southern
Lebanon Tuesday night and dropped flares, apparently to thwart
guerrilla movements.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

<TEXT>
	   OBERHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) _ A women's super giant slalom race
wiped out by fog at Megeve, France, will be held Jan. 22 in the
Italian resort of Cortina, the International Ski Federation
announced Wednesday.
	   After delaying the start by nearly three hours last Friday in
the hope that the fog would clear, race officials were forced to
let skiers out early for their Christmas break.
	   It was the first time this season that a women's World Cup race
had been called off.
	   The super-G will add to a heavy schedule of women's competition
at Cortina, where three races had already been planned.
	   The downhill originally set for Jan. 22 has been moved to
Thursday, Jan. 21.
	   The scheduled Cortina super-G will take place on Saturday, Jan.
23, with a giant slalom the following day.

Witness says brother denies wife's affair with Anwar
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prosecution's star witness in
the sexual misconduct case against dissident Anwar Ibrahim conceded
Wednesday there was evidence against her allegation Anwar had sex
with the wife of a former aide.
	   Ummi Hafilda Ali, a 31-year-old advertising executive, alleged
in a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year that Anwar
had sex with the wife of her brother, his former personal
secretary.
	   The letter sparked a scandal that led to Mahathir's sacking of
Anwar as finance minister and deputy prime minister in September.
Anwar was subsequently arrested and charged with corruption and
illegal sex acts.
	   But on Wednesday Ummi conceded in court that her brother denied
his wife had slept with Anwar. Ummi said her brother, Azmin Ali,
demanded that she change the facts in her original statement to
Mahathir.
	   Ummi faced Anwar's defense attorneys for a third day Wednesday
in the sensational trial, which has provoked unprecedented civil
unrest in the Southeast Asian capital. The government's treatment
of Anwar has also sparked international criticism of Mahathir's
rule.
	   Ummi has been at the center of the Anwar scandal since her
allegations last year. She also encouraged Azizan Abu Bakar, a
driver in the Anwar household, to publicly accuse the politician of
sodomizing him.
	   Two weeks after writing her letter, Ummi was arrested and
retracted the statement. Ummi claims she was coerced by police, but
Anwar insists Ummi is part of a high-level conspiracy to ruin him
and denies the charges against him.
	   Defense attorneys have accused Ummi of taking bribes and
fabricating tales about Anwar's sexual misdeeds because she was
furious that he had spurned her romantic advances.
	   Ummi said she wrote the letter to protect her family honor, but
agreed that it had instead torn the family apart.
	   ``My brother was angry with me for raising those suspicions
against his wife,'' she said.
	   ``He told you there's no truth in your suspicions, right?''
defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked her.
	   ``Yes,'' she replied.
	   Ummi testified Monday that her allegations in the letter to
Mahathir were true, but that she retracted them because police had
threatened to send her to jail for two years.
	   Anwar, whose beating while in police custody led to an
international outcry and close monitoring of his trial, is being
tried for four counts of corruption. A separate trial for another
corruption charge and five illegal sex acts charges will follow.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS `1997' to `1998' in 2nd and 6th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nearly 10 percent of Singapore's numerous
advertising agencies will close next year as the Asian financial
crisis takes its toll on ad revenue, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Ad billings for most agencies plummeted between 10 percent and
40 percent in 1998, John Borzi, managing director of Leo Burnett
Singapore, was quoted as saying in The Business Times.
	   The trend, blamed on fee undercutting and falling client
budgets, is expected to continue, Borzi said.
	   Layoffs are also on the rise in the highly competitive industry,
which features a large number of local advertisers fighting it out
with high-profile international agencies, the report said.
	   There are about 80 members of the Association of Accredited
Advertising Agents in this city-state of 3.1 million people _ among
the highest concentrations of advertising firms in the world.
	   Telecommunications companies in high-tech Singapore remain the
top advertising spenders, contributing about 7 percent of the total
587 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 355 million) for ads during the
first half of 1998, added the paper.
	   When the current fixed telephone line monopoly ends in 2000 and
other mobile phone operators also enter the market, ad spending is
expected to pick up.
	   ``The whole IT area, and telecommunications particularly, these
are the two areas as far as new business we're looking at and
targeting,'' Borzi was quoted as saying. ``Its massive money.''

German police arrest suspected railway blackmailer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Federal police news conference set for 1200 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Police have arrested a man suspected of
trying to extort 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million) from the German
railways with acts of sabotage, the rail company's head said
Wednesday.
	   Police, aided by air force reconnaissance planes, had been
chasing the blackmailer for several weeks amid a growing
holiday-season scare for railway employees and passengers.
Helicopters and 400 extra federal police were also ordered out to
patrol rail lines.
	   The railways' head, Johannes Ludewig, said the suspected
blackmailer was arrested overnight. He did not immediately provide
details.
	   The manhunt centered on the northeast of the country, where rail
lines were sabotaged several times in recent weeks.
	   Federal criminal investigators linked three attacks to the
blackmail attempt, which involved several ransom letters to the
national railways.
	   In the most serious incident, a cargo train carrying paper rolls
derailed Friday near Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
Berlin, after someone loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No
one was hurt.
	   Officials believe the tools used were stolen from the railway.
	   Also linked to the extortion was a similar attack that forced a
high-speed ICE train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into an
emergency stop on Dec. 8.
	   Adding to the jitters were copycats.
	   Police in Nuremberg said they arrested a 44-year-old man late
Tuesday who had tried to extort dlrs 1,380 from the railways by
threatening to attack a train. The man told investigators he was
inspired by news coverage of the larger blackmail attempt, police
said.
	   Police temporarily shut down the main train stations in
Frankfurt, Hamburg and Nuremberg late Tuesday after bomb threats
were received, stranding a number of travelers. No bombs were
found.

Three policemen die when bomb explodes in store

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Three policemen who answered a theft alarm
at a telecom store were killed early Wednesday when a bomb planted
in the store exploded.
	   The store owner and a fourth policeman were injured in the
blast.
	   Investigators said the explosive device was likely placed by a
local extortion racket and was meant only to damage the building to
intimidate the store owner. The bomb exploded just as the officers
arrived at the store in this northern Italian city.
	   In Sicily and southern Italy, mobsters trying to extort money
from businesses frequently destroy property with bombs or other
devices. But such acts are not commonplace in Italy's more affluent
northern cities.

Russian prime minister says country will pay all debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a
visit to Kazakstan, said Wednesday that his country would repay all
of its debts despite the country's economic crisis.
	   ``Russia will not declare default, we have no intention of
declaring default,'' Primakov said in Kazakstan's capital Astana.
``Russia will all debts, both internal and external.''
	   Russia is facing huge debt repayments it cannot afford, and is
seeking to restructure its obligations with creditors.
	   After the latest economic crisis hit in August, the government
stopped making payments on dlrs 40 billion worth of treasury bills.
Creditors regarded this as a default, and restructuring
negotiations are still underway.
	   Russia also faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall
due next year. Primakov has previously acknowledged that Russia
won't be able to make all the payments on time, and plans to
restructure the debts are underway.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov called for closer relations with Kazakstan,
a former Soviet republic.
	   Relations are generally good, despite some tension in the past
over the alleged discrimination against ethnic Russians in
Kazakstan and a dispute over mutual debts.
	   The Kazak government has accused Russia of failing to pay the
agreed rent for leasing the former Soviet cosmodrome in Baikonur,
while the cash-strapped Russian government cited Kazakstan's own
debts to Moscow. Earlier this year, the two nations have agreed to
clear mutual debts.
	   ``There are no problems in relations between Russia and
Kazakstan,'' Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev said after
meeting with Primakov on Wednesday.
	   The two leaders agreed to increase the amount of Kazak oil going
through Russian territory and reduce Russian railway tariffs for
Kazak goods.
	   ``We must unite to resolve our common problems,'' Primakov said.
	   Speaking at a news conference after the talks, Primakov warned
NATO against embracing any former Soviet republics.
	   If any of them join the alliance, Moscow will be ``forced to
take certain steps,'' he said without elaboration.
	   NATO's move to incorporate former Soviet allies in Central and
Eastern Europe have drawn strong protests in Russia, which said it
threatens national security. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the
three former Soviet republics, have also long been pushing for
NATO's membership.

<TEXT>
	   PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Evidence collected
by U.S. intelligence indicates Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was more
concerned about internal threats to his regime than about the
damage he faced last week from impending air strikes, the commander
of U.S. forces in the Gulf said Wednesday.
	   The repositioning of Iraqi ground forces and last-minute shifts
in their commanding officers indicated Saddam wanted to make sure
the U.S. and British air attack did not spark a revolt in the
ranks, said Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, head of the U.S. Central
Command.
	   Zinni, visiting this desert base with Defense Secretary William
Cohen, described the separation of Iraq's ground forces into four
sectors under the command of ruthless officers loyal to Saddam.
	   ``That decentralization was done so they insured they had
control,'' Zinni said. ``I think it was done more for internal
reasons and internal military problems they thought they might have
than for any military preparations they had for us.''
	   Zinni and Cohen arrived at this sprawling air base, focal point
for the Deny Flight mission over southern Iraq, on a
morale-boosting pre-Christmas visit with the troops.
	   Pop and country music stars Carole King, Mary Chapin Carpenter
and David Ball joined Cohen on the trip. They were scheduled to
entertain sailors and Marines aboard the carrier USS Enterprise
later Wednesday.
	   Cohen paid a call on government officials in Kuwait early
Wednesday before he and his party headed for the Enterprise.
	   ``We need to, 7th graf pvs.

Shares close down in thinnest trade in three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower
Wednesday, with the key index plunging 1.6 percent, in the quietest
trading day in three years.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 163.81 points at
10,158.75. It fell 0.7 percent on Tuesday.
	   Turnover was a mere 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 282
million), down from 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 321
million) Tuesday. It was the lowest level since Dec. 18, 1995.
	   Investors were holding off buying plans following comments from
one of the city's biggest tycoons, Li Ka-shing, that Hong Kong's
political environment has become too unstable and hostile for
business, traders said.
	   Many investors also have left the market for the holidays, while
some European investors are busy preparing for the introduction of
the euro currency on Jan. 1, they said.
	   The Hang Seng's fall Wednesday was led by three stocks: China
Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd., Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., and
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
	   China Telecom fell 6 percent, or 90 Hong Kong cents, to 13.25
Hong Kong dollars, a day after the company said it would cut mobile
phone rates in Guangdong province, its largest operating area.
	   Conglomerates Hutchison and Cheung Kong, however, suffered from
``the Mr. Li effect,'' said Antony Mak, head of trading at Vickers
Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   Li, who controls both companies, said Tuesday he had scrapped a
10 billion Hong Kong dollar investment plan with a foreign company
because of the political situation, but didn't elaborate on what he
meant.
	   Stocks in Hutchison closed down 2.0 Hong Kong dollars to 54.0.
Cheung Kong fell 1.0 to 57.25.
	   HSBC Holdings, the biggest company on the Hang Seng Index, fell
1.5 Hong Kong dollars to 197.50. Its affiliate Hang Seng Bank fell
1.25 to 71.50.

Sea skirmish prompts Thailand to seek joint patrol with Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand wants joint naval patrols with
Myanmar in waters both nations claim to prevent another battle from
breaking out between them, a Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Wednesday.
	   On Saturday, two Thai Navy officers were killed in a skirmish
with an unidentified boat that sped away into Myanmar's territorial
waters, the ministry said.
	   The Thai Navy vessel had come to the aid of a Thai fishing
trawler that had been attacked in disputed waters.
	   To prevent similar incidents in the future, Thailand will
propose the joint patrols to officials from Myanmar, also known as
Burma, at meetings scheduled for January, said Kobsak Chutikul, the
ministry spokesman.
	   The ministry is also preparing guidelines that would serve as
the basis for demarcating the Thai-Myanmar border. The guidelines
will be discussed with Myanmar early next year, he said.
	   The 2,401-kilometer (1,488-mile) border will be divided up into
ten sections, according to the Thai plan, with a disputed area in
each section. Seven disputed areas are in the Andaman Sea, and
three are on land.

Ukraine's president travels to Turkmenistan for gas talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma left for
Turkmenistan on Wednesday for two days of talks with President
Saparmurat Niyazov expected to focus on resumption of gas supplies
to Ukraine.
	   The two leaders plan to sign several bilateral agreements, which
would possibly include a deal on supplies of 15 billion cubic
meters (525 billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas to Ukraine in 1999.
	   Ukrainian and Turkmen gas officials have been negotiating over
the past weeks on resuming gas supplies to Ukraine.
	   Supplies were suspended in March 1997 over Ukraine's mounting
gas debt, which Turkmen officials have estimated at between dlrs
600 million and dlrs 1 billion.
	   Ukraine is one of the world's largest gas consumers and has
pressed for the resumption of gas supplies from Turkmenistan to
lessen its dependence on neighboring Russia, which covers about 70
percent of Ukraine's gas needs.

	   LAINGSBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A fertilizer truck collided with
a bus early Wednesday on a highway north of Cape Town, shearing off
the side of the bus and killing 21 of the sleeping passengers,
police said.
	   At least four of the dead were children, and 19 people were
hospitalized, police said. Seven were reported in critical
condition.
	   The accident occurred just after midnight on one of the most
dangerous roads in the country, the N-1 highway leading from Cape
Town to the rural Transkei region along the country's southeastern
coast, home to mainly Xhosa people.
	   Many South Africans are returning from the cities to their
villages ahead of Christmas, a period when road accidents plague
South Africa.
	   The government has launched a major public information campaign
this year to stem the carnage, but more than 430 people have died
on the roads this month.
	   The bus was carrying about 60 people when it hit a truck on the
highway near this town about 260 kilometers (160 miles) northeast
of Cape Town.
	   ``The driver's side of the bus was completely ripped open right
to the back,'' police Capt. Mark Collins said. ``Most of the people
died with the impact.''
	   He said police had not yet determined the cause. Both drivers
were killed.
	   ``It was terrible -- people and their belongings were strewn
across the road,'' said Piet Meyer, the transport commissioner for
Western Cape Province.
	   The road is generally straight and in good condition.
	   Traffic control officials say, however, that it has one of the
highest rates of fatalities in the country.
	   The main causes are driver fatigue and the overloading of
minibuses, buses or pickup trucks with passengers, Collins said.
The extra weight, combined with poor tires, causes the tires to
blow and reduces the driver's control.

Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia returning to Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government will transport five
Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia for the past 15 months back
home this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
	   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the government
would find a way to bring the elephants back, even though a
campaign to raise money for the transport fell short of its target.
	   The government raised 1 million baht (dlrs 28,000) but needs
500,000 baht (dlrs 14,000) more, he said.
	   Nevertheless, Kobsak insisted the elephants will be back on Thai
soil by Dec. 26 or 27.
	   There have been several public protests over the stranding of
the elephants.
	   The elephants were sent to Indonesia last year on a ten-year
contract to help train Indonesian elephants.
	   When the Asian economic crisis hit, however, the Indonesians
could no longer afford to pay the salaries of the elephants'
handlers, who returned to Thailand and abandoned their animals.
	   Elephants are a national symbol in Thailand, but their numbers
are dwindling because of their shrinking forest habitat, and they
are frequently abused.
	   Many are fed amphetamines and put to work in the illegal logging
trade. Others roam the streets of cities with their handlers
begging for food.

Iraq orders U.N. to cancel flight

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations to cancel a
scheduled flight of military observers headed to Baghdad for duty
on the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait, a U.N. official
said.
	   Iraq offered no explanation for its decision, which was likely
to increase tensions with the United Nations. The U.N. official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he hoped the measure was
temporary.
	   Wednesday's flight had been scheduled to carry members of the
United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, from Bahrain to
Habaniyya air base outside Baghdad, the official said. The force
was set up after the 1991 Gulf War to monitor the cease-fire and
the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait.
	   The report of the canceled flight came just four days after the
United States and Britain carried out military airstrikes on Iraq
to force it to comply with U.N. resolutions to eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq air defenses are still geared up to meet further possible
attacks, and the cancellation of the U.N. flight may be related to
Iraq's fears of more U.S-British airstrikes.

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ A French court has sentenced Antonio
Garcia-Sanchez, a convicted drug smuggler, to three years in
prison, the court announced Wednesday.
	   Garcia-Sanchez was arrested Nov. 17 in Biarritz, a French
seaside resort just north of the border with Spain, with 31 kilos
(68 pounds) of marijuana in his car.
	   He already had served nine years in prison in Spain on a similar
conviction.
	   The French court also ordered Garcia-Sanchez to pay a fine of
750,000 dlrs (135,000) to the French Customs Service, the court
said.
	   The sentencing hearing was held Tuesday in Bayonne, a city in
the Pyrenees-Atlantiques region of southwestern France.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, accounting for the relatively light
casualty toll.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ a rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets. A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the
electricity was knocked out in some areas but later restored.
	   As of midday, several hours after the attack, tens of thousands
of people in northern Israel were being told to stay in shelters.
	   Israel's army said its forces were returning artillery fire and
were prepared to launch air strikes.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, for which Hezbollah
guerillas claimed responsibility, and planned to fly to the north
for a visit later Wednesday.
	   Northern Israel had been braced for a retaliatory attack after
Israeli air strike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in
eastern Lebanon. That was the highest civilian casualty toll this
year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying the
target of the air strike had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   A session of Israel's parliament on Wednesday opened with
speaker Dan Tichon expressing condolences over the slain civilians
in Lebanon and offering sympathy to ``those who sit in the shelters
under the threat of Katyusha rockets'' in northern Israel.
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks.
	   ``Murderers must pay the price of their crimes,'' the statement
said. ``We renew our pledge to protect our people and their
villages, no matter how great the struggle.''
	   Dozens of rockets were fired in Wednesday's attack, falling with
enormous booms that could be heard for miles.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerilla.
	   More rockets were fired at the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some fell harmlessly into the sea, but
others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and collective farms.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one rocket hit a house
where agricultural workers from Thailand lived _ just minutes after
the workers left the building. The house was heavily damaged, but
none of the workers was hurt.
	   On Tuesday night, Israeli warplanes had flown over southern
Lebanon Tuesday night and dropped flares, apparently to thwart
guerrilla movements.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Iraq orders U.N. to cancel flight

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with humanitarian workers resuming work; CORRECTS
flight would have originated from Amman sted Bahrain, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations on
Wednesday to a cancel a scheduled flight of military observers who
monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized zone on the Iraq-Kuwait
border, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraq offered no explanation for its decision, which was likely
to increase tensions with the United Nations.
	   The U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
hoped the measure was temporary and that the U.N. is pursuing the
matter with Iraq.
	   The flight had been scheduled to carry members of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, from Amman, Jordan, to
Habaniyya air base outside Baghdad, the official said.
	   The force was set up after the 1991 Gulf War which evicted Iraqi
forces from Kuwait following their seven-month occupation of the
tiny oil-rich emirate.
	   The official said the Iraq move appeared to be related to the
U.S.-British military airstrikes on Iraq to force it to comply with
U.N. resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. The
four nights of strikes ended Saturday.
	   Iraqi air defenses are still on alert for further possible
attacks, and the cancellation of the U.N. flight may be the result
of Iraq's fears of more U.S-British airstrikes.
	   Iraq had warned Tuesday that it won't forgive Kuwait for
allowing the United States and Britain to use its military bases to
mount last week's airstrikes against the country.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian workers resumed their normal duties
Wednesday after returning from Jordan.
	   Their first task will be to judge the impact of the bombing
campaign on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program and other
international efforts to help the 22 million Iraqis, said U.N.
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered a survey taking no more than a
week to determine what repairs are needed, the officials said.
	   They said U.N. food observers also went out Wednesday to check
grain silos and aid distribution centers in Baghdad and elsewhere
in Iraq.
	   Some 120 U.N. humanitarian workers returned to Baghdad on
Tuesday night after a bus trip across the desert from Amman, where
they were evacuated last week during the bombing campaign.
	   The United States launched the missile attacks to punish Iraq
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors who are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
along with long-range missiles.
	   Until the inspectors certify that their job is done, economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be
lifted.
	   The Iraqi government also has ordered an assessment of civilian
and military losses from the U.S. and British bombardment. Iraqi
officials, also insisting on anonymity, said the government intends
to formally ask the U.N. Security Council for compensation.
	   The ruling Baath party daily Al-Thawra said in a front-page
editorial that the Security Council was required now ``to condemn
America and Britain and lift sanctions.''
	   Iraq has long insisted it has destroyed its weapons programs and
demanded the lifting of the sanctions.
	   Iraq on Tuesday accused U.S. and British warplanes of firing two
missiles toward the southern city of Basra, saying the renewed
aggression was part of a policy ``to harm Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted 100 sites, mostly defense related,
to reduce Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass destruction.

Russia sends medicine to Tajikistan, Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Wednesday delivered a plane load of
medicine to Tajikistan, and the supplies were also to be
distributed in war-torn Afghanistan, a news report said.
	   Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations delivered the 16 tons
of medicine to Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Seven tons will be distributed in remote regions of Tajikistan,
a country still recovering from a 5-year civil war that formally
ended last year.
	   The remaining nine tons will be sent on to neighboring
Afghanistan, a land devastated by two decades of war.
	   The report did not say whether the aid would go to the ruling
Taliban movement in Afghanistan, which Russia opposes, or to areas
controlled by the opposition in northern Afghanistan.

Round-the-world balloonists drift over China's ancient sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British entrepreneur Richard Branson and his
teammates floated over northern China's ancient sites Wednesday
after the government bowed to British appeals to let their hot-air
balloon pass through prohibited airspace.
	   One Chinese air traffic controller grumbled that planes flying
between Xi'an, site of China's famed terra-cotta warriors, and the
capital Beijing were having to adjust their flight paths because of
the balloon.
	   ``People don't like uninvited guests,'' said the controller at
Xianyang Airport, near Xi'an. He refused to give his name.
	   British diplomats worked late into the evening Tuesday seeking
Chinese permission for the round-the-world balloon to continue its
course.
	   China's Foreign Ministry finally telephoned Britain's ambassador
at about 9.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) to say that the balloon could carry
on ``but it has to leave Chinese airspace as soon as possible,''
said embassy spokeswoman Harriet Hall.
	   ``I'm gripping wood with both hands,'' she added when asked if
she expected further problems for the flight.
	   The Chinese air traffic controller said the balloon could be
seen with the naked eye and on radar as it passed over the walled
city of Xi'an, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southwest of
Beijing, on Wednesday morning. No commercial flights were delayed
or canceled because of its passage, he added.
	   ``It's flying OK,'' added another air traffic controller in
Beijing.
	   Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden, aloft in the ICO Global balloon heading eastward around
the globe, were hoping to catch a jetstream to get them quickly out
of Chinese airspace.
	   ``We are going to look ... for the fastest, most direct route
out of China, which is what the balloon wants to do anyway,'' said
project director Mike Kendrick.
	   China originally had given the balloonists permission to cross
the country below 26 degrees north latitude. But they drifted
further north Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms
and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The Chinese then asked the balloonists to land in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital, but the balloon overshot the airfield.
	   As it became apparent that the balloon would inevitably cross
into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent
a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji asking for China's help.
	   ``Thank you to the Chinese government,'' Branson said upon
hearing that China had finally granted permission for them to
continue their flight.
	   ``We are embarrassed to have entered the airspace without
permission and relieved that they understand our position.''

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A British military
helicopter crashed just outside of a NATO base in Gornji Vakuf,
some 70 kilometers (40 miles) west of Sarajevo, NATO officials said
Wednesday.
	   The Lynx helicopter carried three people on board -- all of whom
were reported hurt, said Maj. Keith Jarvis, a NATO spokesman in
Sarajevo. The extent of the injuries was not announced.
	   Local police in Gornji Vakuf, citing witnesses, said one person
died but NATO refused to comment on the report.
	   ``The crash is now subject to formal military investigation and
there will be no further comment to the cause of the accident until
the investigation is completed,'' Jarvis said.
	   Since NATO deployed the peace force three years ago, 91 members
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic
accidents or landmine blasts.

Iraq orders U.N. to cancel flight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with humanitarian workers resuming work; CORRECTS
flight would have originated from Amman sted Bahrain, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations on
Wednesday to cancel a scheduled flight of military observers headed
to Baghdad to monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized zone on the
Iraq-Kuwait border, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraq offered no explanation for its decision, which was likely
to increase tensions with the United Nations.
	   The U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
hoped the measure was temporary and that the U.N. is pursuing the
matter with Iraq.
	   The flight had been scheduled to carry members of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, from Amman, Jordan to
Habaniyya air base outside Baghdad, the official said.
	   The force was set up after the 1991 Gulf War which evicted Iraqi
forces from Kuwait following their seven-month occupation of the
tiny oil-rich emirate.
	   The official said the Iraq move appeared to be related to the
U.S.-British military airstrikes on Iraq to force it to comply with
U.N. resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. The
four nights of strikes ended Saturday.
	   Iraqi air defenses are still on alert for further possible
attacks, and the cancellation of the U.N. flight may be the result
of Iraq's fears.
	   Iraq had warned Tuesday that it won't forgive Kuwait for
allowing the United States and Britain to use its military bases to
mount last week's airstrikes against the country.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian workers resumed their normal duties
Wednesday after returning from Jordan.
	   Their first task will be to judge the impact of the bombing
campaign on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program and other
international efforts to help the 22 million Iraqis, said U.N.
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered a survey taking no more than a
week to determine what repairs are needed, the officials said.
	   They said U.N. food observers also went out Wednesday to check
grain silos and aid distribution centers in Baghdad and elsewhere
in Iraq.
	   Some 120 U.N. humanitarian workers returned to Baghdad on
Tuesday night after a bus trip across the desert from Amman, where
they were evacuated last week during the bombing campaign.
	   The United States launched the missile attacks to punish Iraq
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors who are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
along with long-range missiles.
	   Until the inspectors certify that their job is done, economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be
lifted.
	   The Iraqi government also has ordered an assessment of civilian
and military losses from the U.S. and British bombardment. Iraqi
officials, also insisting on anonymity, said the government intends
to formally ask the U.N. Security Council for compensation.
	   The ruling Baath party daily Al-Thawra said in a front-page
editorial that the Security Council was required now ``to condemn
America and Britain and lift sanctions.''
	   Iraq has long insisted it has destroyed its weapons programs and
demanded the lifting of the sanctions.
	   Iraq on Tuesday accused U.S. and British warplanes of firing two
missiles toward the southern city of Basra, saying the renewed
aggression was part of a policy ``to harm Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.

Witness says brother denies wife's affair with Anwar

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prosecution's star witness in
the sexual misconduct case against dissident Anwar Ibrahim conceded
Wednesday there was evidence against her allegation Anwar had sex
with the wife of a former aide.
	   Ummi Hafilda Ali, a 31-year-old advertising executive, alleged
in a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year that Anwar
had sex with the wife of her brother, his former personal
secretary.
	   The letter sparked a scandal that led to Mahathir's sacking of
Anwar as finance minister and deputy prime minister in September.
Anwar was subsequently arrested and charged with corruption and
illegal sex acts.
	   But on Wednesday Ummi conceded in court that her brother denied
his wife had slept with Anwar. Ummi said her brother, Azmin Ali,
demanded that she change the facts in her original statement to
Mahathir.
	   Ummi faced Anwar's defense attorneys for a third day Wednesday
in the sensational trial, which has provoked unprecedented civil
unrest in the Southeast Asian capital. The government's treatment
of Anwar has also sparked international criticism of Mahathir's
rule.
	   Ummi has been at the center of the Anwar scandal since her
allegations last year. She also encouraged Azizan Abu Bakar, a
driver in the Anwar household, to publicly accuse the politician of
sodomizing him.
	   Two weeks after writing her letter, Ummi was arrested and
retracted the statement. Ummi claims she was coerced by police, but
Anwar insists Ummi is part of a high-level conspiracy to ruin him
and denies the charges against him.
	   Defense attorneys have accused Ummi of taking bribes and
fabricating tales about Anwar's sexual misdeeds because she was
furious that he had spurned her romantic advances.
	   Ummi said she wrote the letter to protect her family honor, but
agreed that it had instead torn the family apart.
	   ``My brother was angry with me for raising those suspicions
against his wife,'' she said.
	   ``He told you there's no truth in your suspicions, right?''
defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked her.
	   ``Yes,'' she replied.
	   Ummi testified Monday that her allegations in the letter to
Mahathir were true, but that she retracted them because police had
threatened to send her to jail for two years.
	   Anwar, whose beating while in police custody led to an
international outcry and close monitoring of his trial, is being
tried for four counts of corruption. A separate trial for another
corruption charge and five illegal sex acts charges will follow.

NATO troops remove Croatian police from disputed border area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force in
Bosnia removed Croatian police from a disputed area along Bosnia's
western border to Croatia, NATO announced on Wednesday.
	   Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define the
border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220
kilometers (150 miles) west of Sarajevo.
	   Martin Brod was considered in Bosnia before the 1991-1995 war
but since the fighting ended in this area, Croatian authorities
moved the border deeper into Bosnian territory.
	   When they returned into the area after fighting stopped, many of
the residents of Martin Brod found their homes or land on the other
side of the border, in Croatia. Croatian border police prevented
them to go there.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, sent a
letter to both countries saying until the two border commissions
agree on the frontier, he wqill consider the pre-war demarcation
line to be valid.
	   This means that the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation should be in
charge of the area instead of Croatia.
	   In response to a request from Westendorp's office, the NATO-led
peace force removed the Croatian police without any incident, a
NATO press release said.
	   ``The territory is now under the jurisdiction of the Federation
police,'' the statement said.

Some runway lights switched off during Thai plane crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES attribution to airport official in lead, quotes graf

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Half the runway lights were not working
when a Thai Airways jet crashed, killing 101 people in a nighttime
rainstorm two weeks ago, an airport official said on Wednesday.
	   ``Even now they're not working. Something in the electrical
system broke down and our electricians have said we're still
waiting for imported parts before it can be fixed,'' said Pratiyudh
Boonrod, Executive Director of Administration at Surat Thani
airport where the crash took place.
	   ``But we notified every airline, so the pilot should have
known,''he said.
	   Waravuth Siri-oat, an electrician at Surat Thani airport, was
quoted in Wednesday's The Nation newspaper as saying that half the
lights being shut off should not have affected the visibility of
the runway.
	   The runway lights are 60 meters (198 feet) apart. With half of
them switched off, each working light was 120 meters (396 feet)
apart.
	   The plane crashed on its third attempt to land. Airport
officials have already been a target of questioning for removing
their instrument landing system during runway renovations. The
system helps pilots land in bad weather.
	   A government committee is investigating the cause of the crash
of the Airbus A310-200 on Dec. 11 at Surat Thani, 530 kilometers
(330 miles) southwest of Bangkok and a gateway to popular resort
islands.
	   Some of the 45 survivors blamed the pilot for trying to land
repeatedly in bad weather instead of diverting to another airport
or returning to Bangkok.
	   The pilot had complained to the tower of poor visibility, air
traffic controllers at Surat Thani airport told The Nation.
	   The paper quoted one anonymous Thai Airways pilot who disputed
the electrician's contention that having only half the runway
lights on would not affect visibility.
	   ``We need those lights, especially when the weather is very
bad,'' he told the paper.
	   He added that airport officials should have maximized other
equipment, such as runway lights, considering the instrument
landing system had been removed.

El-Farnawani says he delivered access, not votes to bid committee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Mahmoud El-Farnawani, paid dlrs 58,000 as
a consultant for the Salt Lake bid committee in 1994-95, says he
delivered access _ not votes _ to Utah Olympic boosters.
	   The former Egyptian national volleyball coach, who now lives in
Toronto, told The Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret News that he
did not attempt to buy votes of International Olympic Committee
members in behalf of Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   El-Farnawani said that through his coaching experience, he
became acquainted with nearly three dozen IOC members.
	   ``I made introductions, gave Salt Lake City all the knowledge
about this person or that family, what he likes, however many
children he has, what his history is and so on, so they know
something about him, like what he eats,'' he told The Tribune.
	   ``Some people from my group don't eat pork or ham, or don't want
to have alcohol on the table. It all helps to make the IOC member
feel he is taken care of and to feel they (bidders) respect his
background and religion,'' he said.
	   El-Farnawani was quoted by the Toronto Sun in 1995 as saying
that he ``assured'' the IOC's Arab vote for Salt Lake.
	   ``I offered my service to Quebec,'' another of the four cities
that sought the 2002 Games, El-Farnawani was quoted then as saying.
``But they didn't want anybody from outside Quebec. So I signed a
contract with Salt Lake City and assured them of all the Arab
votes.''
	   The Deseret News, in a copyright story Tuesday, said
El-Farnawani declined to say which IOC members he contacted. ``If
you trust me to work with people, I won't expose who I contacted,''
he said.
	   The implication that he made bribes, made in a Toronto
newspaper, ``is very, very stupid,'' El-Farnawani told The Tribune.
``Salt Lake did not need that. They knew they were going to win.
... Linking me to (bribery allegations) has to come from someone
who is jealous or envied my success.''
	   George Gross, the Toronto Sun reporter who interviewed
El-Farnawani in Budapest in 1995, shortly after the IOC voted to
award the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, said he stands by
his story.
	   El-Farnawani said that he had been unaware of the Salt Lake
boosters' scholarships for IOC relatives.
	   In another development Tuesday, the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee hired the international law firm Latham -and- Watkins,
which has 850 attorneys in 14 cities, to represent it in whatever
issues may arise with the U.S. Justice Department.
	   Attorney General Janet Reno said last week she is reviewing the
case to see if it merits a full investigation. ``Nothing has
changed,'' a spokesman said Tuesday.

Russia's Zhirinovsky supports separatists in Moldova

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ Russian ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky vowed to support politicians struggling for
independence of Moldova's Slav-dominated region of Trans-Dniester,
a separatist official said Wednesday.
	   Zhirinovsky's one-day visit Tuesday came as Russia's State Duma
prepared to debate a resolution that could call for recognition of
Trans-Dniester's sovereignty.
	   Zhirinovsky predicted most lawmakers would approve the
resolution and ask President Boris Yeltsin to officially back the
separatists in the breakaway region, Grigori Marakuta, a spokesman
of the Trans-Dniester parliament said.
	   Zhirinovsky, president of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party,
refused to meet with Moldovan national officials. He also warned
neighboring Romania not to interfere in politics of Moldova, a
former Soviet Republic.
	   ``Romania should watch out for its own interests and take its
gaze off the east, because it is known that any attempt of
expansion eastwards has ended badly.''
	   About three million of Moldova's 4.5 million inhabitants are
ethnic Romanians while the rest are mostly Slavs who moved here
during Soviet times.
	   Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova, with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Slavs, declared independence in
1990 fearing that Moldova would seek to reunite with neighboring
Romania.
	   A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992
killed about 700. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in troops.
Relations have remained tense.
	   Recently Ukraine, Romania and Moldova urged Russia to withdraw
its few remaining troops from Trans-Dniester and recommended an
international monitoring force.
	   The presidents of the three countries signed a document saying
that Trans-Dniester is a region inside the territory of an
independent Moldova.
	   But Zhirinovsky said the communist-dominated Duma would
recommend the independence of Trans-Dniester.
	   He said that Moscow expects later a union between Russia and
Trans-Dniester.
	   A Chisinau government spokesman said Wednesday that Moldova
considers Zhirinovsky's visit ``private'' and the government hasn't
yet commented.
	   Trans-Dniester separatists gave Zhirinovsky 30 bottles of cognac
who posed for photos with the waitresses who served him.
Zhirinovsky presented his hosts with a signed bottle of Zhirinovsky
vodka, which vodka producers named after him.

Indonesian attorney general ponders next legal step in Suharto case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto might be
named a suspect in a probe of corruption during his 32 years of
authoritarian rule, Indonesia's top prosecutor said Wednesday.
	   A decision to label Suharto a suspect would be a big step
forward in the government inquiry into the wealth of his family,
which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
	   Under Indonesian law, people are named as suspects after
preliminary questioning but before formal charges are filed in a
criminal case.
	   Critics have alleged that Suharto, who quit in May after riots
and protests, amassed a fortune by siphoning off state wealth for
the benefit of his children and associates.
	   Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib said there was a
possibility of taking the legal step of naming Suharto a suspect,
the official Antara news agency reported.
	   ``Based on the statements of witnesses, it leads in that
direction,'' Ghalib said. ``However, we cannot hastily draw such a
conclusion. We need some rechecking.''
	   President B.J. Habibie, under pressure from student protesters
who want Suharto to be put on trial, had ordered Ghalib to
intensify the investigation of his predecessor.
	   Critics have alleged that Habibie is too compromised by his
links to Suharto to conduct a serious investigation of the
77-year-old ex-army general.
	   On Dec. 9, government prosecutors questioned Suharto for four
hours about corruption allegations.
	   The questions related to multimillion-dollar charitable
foundations formerly under his control, a national car project run
by one of his sons with huge tax breaks, the contents of his bank
accounts and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited his
family and friends.

NATO troops remove Croatian police from disputed border area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force in
Bosnia removed Croatian police from a disputed area along Bosnia's
western border to Croatia, NATO announced on Wednesday.
	   Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define the
border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220
kilometers (150 miles) west of Sarajevo.
	   Martin Brod was considered part of Bosnia before the 1991-1995
war but since the fighting ended, Croatian authorities have moved
the border deeper into Bosnia.
	   When they returned to the area after fighting stopped, many of
the residents of Martin Brod found their homes or land on the other
side of the border, in Croatia and they were blocked from returning
by Croatian border police.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, sent a
letter to both countries saying until the two border commissions
agree on the frontier, he will consider the pre-war demarcation
line to be valid.
	   In response to a request from Westendorp's office, the NATO-led
peace force removed the Croatian police without any incident, a
NATO press release said.
	   ``The territory is now under the jurisdiction of the Federation
police,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   TIMBANGAN, Philippines (AP) _ Two Hong Kong citizens and a
Malaysian kidnapped by former Muslim rebels in the southern
Philippines were released Wednesday after 106 days in captivity.
	   Officials said no ransom was paid for the release of Law Cheung
Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong Kong and Tong Ket Ming of Malaysia.
	   But a military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the men's employer paid at least 2 million pesos (about dlrs
51,000) in ``board and lodging'' fees to the kidnappers.
	   Hours after their release, the three men were flown to Manila
where they met President Joseph Estrada, who had given strict
instructions to the authorities to ensure their safety.
	   ``We are happy that no untoward incident happened to these
people,'' Estrada said. ``We are continuing our drive against
kidnapping.''
	   The three were seized Sept. 8 while buying live fish for sale to
Hong Kong restaurants near an island in Tawi-Tawi province close to
the border of the east Malaysian state of Sabah.
	   They were then brought to Sulu province and moved from town to
town in the hinterlands as police and soldiers searched for them.
	   The kidnappers included members of the Muslim extremist Abu
Sayyaf group, whose leader was killed in a raid by police last
Saturday, and former members of the Moro National Liberation Front,
the main Muslim rebel group that had signed a peace agreement with
the government.
	   Negotiators led by MNLF chief of staff Yusuf Jikiri and Sulu
Gov. Munib Estino fetched the victims from the kidnappers' mountain
hideout outside Timbangan town, about 920 kilometers (575 miles)
south of Manila.
	   ``We are very happy that we have been released by the
kidnappers,'' said Malaysian Tong Ket Ming.
	   He said they were fed mainly dried fish and root crops and were
not harmed by the kidnappers.
	   ``The first thing I will do is talk to my family in Hong Kong,
my mother, my father,'' said Law Cheung Yau.
	   Estino said the kidnappers held the three men hostage to show
the government that they have been ``left behind'' in receiving
social benefits for former rebels.
	   ``We had to explain to them the program of the government for
development, that's why it took us many days for them to accept the
program of the government,'' he said.
	   The three men were brought to a military hospital in Zamboanga
City, north of Sulu, for a checkup, before they were flown to
Manila for the meeting with Estrada.

Doctors eye promising magnetic surgery technique
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JIM SALTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Surgeons may some day treat brain tumors and
heart ailments with the click of a computer mouse.
	   Washington University neurosurgeon Ralph Dacey used a pioneering
magnetic surgery technique to direct a biopsy needle to the brain
tumor of a 31-year-old man. The Dec. 17 biopsy at Barnes-Jewish
Hospital indicated the man needed chemotherapy.
	   The Magnetic Surgery System will be tested on four other brain
tumor patients over the next several months, Dacey said Tuesday.
Several years of trials will likely be necessary before the
procedure is commonly used.
	   Dacey and officials with Stereotaxis Inc., which helped develop
the system, believe it will help in getting surgical tools _ and
perhaps medicine _ to hard-to-reach areas of the brain and the
heart. They say it may eventually help treat aneurysms, coronary
artery disease and other ailments.
	   For a traditional biopsy, a surgeon would manually push a rigid
needle via a long, narrow catheter through the brain to the tumor.
	   Magnetic surgery allows the catheter to follow curved routes,
bypassing sensitive areas of the brain, or travel along blood
vessels to or near the heart, Dacey said.
	   Surgeons around the country said the procedure appears
promising.
	   ``I just think this is a better way,'' said Warren Selman,
professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland.
	   ``I think part of our problem is getting around structures that
are in the way,'' Selman said. ``The ability to steer around an
object instead of merely go through it is an exciting
development.''
	   In magnetic surgery involving a brain tumor, a small hole is
drilled in the patient's skull. The surgeon places a plastic bolt
in the hole to provide entry for a guidewire with a magnet that
travels through a catheter about the width of a strand of
spaghetti.
	   The surgeon views magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the
patient's brain on a computer screen. The three-dimensional view
allows him to plan the best route to the tumor.
	   The patient's head is placed in a machine between
superconducting magnets and a catheter is inserted through the
bolt. The surgeon, sitting at the computer console, uses a mouse or
joystick to guide the magnet to the tumor in about five minutes.
The guidewire positioning system pushes the small magnet through
the brain, with the fields from the superconducting magnets
controlling its direction.
	   When the head of the instrument reaches the desired area, the
surgeon pulls out the guidewire, leaving the catheter in place to
act as a tunnel. He then inserts a tiny surgical tool through the
catheter that snips out a tissue sample for the biopsy.
	   Universities and laboratories around the United States have been
developing magnetic surgery for more than a decade. Trials have
been previously performed on animals.
	   Doug Kondziolka, professor of neurosurgery at the University of
Pittsburgh, called the procedure very promising but said there are
concerns.
	   ``How reliable is this way to control something deep in the
brain?'' he asked. ``For example, control of the magnetic field,
the control and accuracy of the manipulation.''
	   Dacey said the procedure is safe, even in the event of a
computer failure. If that happens, he said, surgery would be
performed manually.

France wants new system of ``continuous control'' in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the
U.N. Security Council should set up a new system of continuous
surveillance to prevent Iraq from producing weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``The time has come for the Security Council ... to assume its
responsibilities and adopt a new system. Which one? Not a system
investigating the past, but a system of precautions for the
future,'' Vedrine said in an interview in Wednesday's edition of
the daily Liberation.
	   ``Continuous control would consist, first of all, of surveying
any resumption by Iraq of the manufacture of banned weapons. It
would also aim to prevent the continuous deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in Iraq,'' he said.
	   Vedrine added that such a method would provide the basis for an
eventual lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   France was critical of the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq
and has long called for a lifting of sanctions.
	   The United States has rejected France's proposal for a new arms
control system in Iraq and wants to keep UNSCOM, the U.N. special
commission on arms inspection, in place.

Tung says government will keep Hong Kong business-friendly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday
acknowledged a prominent businessman's concerns about political
instability, but said the government would ensure a
business-friendly environment.
	   Tung was responding to comments by billionaire Li Ka-shing
Tuesday that the political environment has become too unstable and
hostile for business. Li announced that he had scrapped a 10
billion-Hong Kong dollar (U.S.-dlr 1.28 billion) investment plan
with a foreign company.
	   His two companies, property developer Cheung Kong Holdings and
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, led the blue-chip Hang Seng Index's
slide Wednesday.
	   The index fell 1.6 percent to close at 10,158.75.
	   Speaking to reporters, Tung didn't directly agree or disagree
with Li's comment on Hong Kong's political environment, but said he
respected the tycoon.
	   Tung, who was picked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after it was
returned to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, called for harmony among
disparate elements in the society.
	   ``A good environment which is conducive to business and
investment is very important to Hong Kong. That's the way to ensure
the recovery of our economy and to create more jobs for our
people,'' Tung said.
	   ``A harmonious community is fundamental for the creation of a
good, attractive business environment,'' he said.
	   Li's comments Tuesday apparently were a swipe at pro-democracy
politicians, who have recently stepped up calls for freer elections
and more help for the city's disadvantaged as the economy slides
deeper into recession. Only a portion of the 60-seat legislature is
directly elected.
	   In recent protests, pro-democracy lawmakers called large
property developers greedy and unfeeling for demanding that
would-be home-buyers who defaulted on pre-payments for homes honor
their purchase agreements.
	   Hong Kong's economy is expected to shrink by 5 percent this
year, and the once-mighty property market has been in the doldrums.

Chief officers of Elektrim resign over securities scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president and vice president of one of
Poland's leading companies _ Elektrim SA _ have resigned due to a
scandal surrounding a secret deal to sell a lucrative cellular
telephone stake for a nominal price.
	   The resignations of longtime president Andrzej Skowronski and
first vice president Emilian Bryk were accepted late Tuesday by the
supervisory board of Elektrim, a founding member of the Warsaw
Stock Exchange.
	   Supervisory board chairman Ryszard Jacyno will take over
temporary management of Elektrim, and Jan Kolodziejczak, vice
chairman of the board, will take over Jacyno's duties, according to
a statement issued Tuesday night.
	   Elektrim announced last month that it agreed in 1996 to sell a
6.5 percent stake in Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, the nation's first
cellular telephone company, for little more than the nominal price
at the time, when the company was first being organized.
	   Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa later was given one of two licenses to
operate a digital cellular telephone network, and its business has
boomed. Analysts estimate the 6.5 percent stake is now worth as
much as dlrs 150 million, perhaps five times more than Elektrim
would receive under the 1996 deal with a financial backer.
	   Elektrim's share price fell by nearly 30 percent after the
announcement, which sparked an investigation by Poland's Securities
and Exchange Commission and demands by angry shareholders for the
resignation of top managers.
	   Jacek Socha, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said the deal should have been disclosed sooner because it was
important for Elektrim's share price.
	   In its statement Tuesday, the Elektrim supervisory board said no
member of management broke any law in connection with the deal.
	   Elektrim is a diversified company with holdings in
telecommunications, power generation equipment and other aspects of
electrical engineering.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Police have arrested a man suspected of
trying to extort 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million) from the German
railways with acts of sabotage, officials said Wednesday.
	   Police, aided by air force reconnaissance planes, had been
chasing the blackmailer for several weeks amid a growing
holiday-season scare for railway employees and passengers.
Helicopters and 400 extra federal border police were also ordered
out to patrol rail lines.
	   The suspect was arrested late Tuesday at an autobahn rest area
in Bavaria, the Austria Press Agency reported. He had been enroute
to a ransom money handover in neighboring Austria, where police
were poised to nab him, the report said, quoting the Austrian
interior ministry.
	   German Transport Minister Franz Muentefering voiced relief,
calling the arrest ``reassuring news for the safety of all train
travelers at Christmas time.''
	   Earlier, the manhunt had centered on the northeast of the
country, where rail lines were sabotaged several times in recent
weeks.

Stability of China's countryside threatened by low incomes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Weakening growth in farm incomes over the past
two years is raising the potential for unrest in rural areas and
undermining efforts to boost economic growth, China's agriculture
minister said Wednesday.
	   Growth in farm incomes has slowed severely, particularly in
1998, despite government efforts to improve grain trade and invest
more in rural construction, Chen Yaobang said at a news conference.
	   Net farm income increased 4.6 percent in 1997, compared with 5.6
in 1996. The rate of increase this year is estimated at only 3
percent, he said.
	   China wants its farmers to earn and spend more. Rural domestic
demand is considered a key to keeping the economy growing at a
target of 8 percent.
	   Rural incomes are depressed in part because village and township
industries that absorb many underemployed farmers have been stung
by a decline in exports due to the Asian financial crisis.
	   Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises in the cities have been
laying off millions of workers as part of reforms to turn around
the heavily debt-ridden state sector. Laid-off urban workers often
take jobs that once went to migrants from the countryside.
	   China also has not been able to solve the problem of local
governments collecting too many random fees from farmers, Chen
acknowledged. A government rule limiting such fees to 5 percent of
a farmer's income is violated in many places, he said.
	   Over the past few years violent disputes have broken out in many
areas between farmers and local officials.
	   China expects a bumper harvest this year of more than 490
million tons of grain, about the same as last year, despite
devastating summer floods. Chen said good fall weather in much of
the country helped boost production.
	   Yet the abundant supply of agricultural goods is keeping prices
down and further depressing farm incomes.
	   In a cautious step toward more market-driven farm production,
China in 1999 will liberalize prices for cotton. Chen predicted
cotton output would shrink to 3.5 million metric tons in 1999, from
the 4.2 million tons expected this year.
	   But China will maintain its tight grip on the grain market,
continuing a decades-old tradition intended to ensure an adequate
grain supply.
	   Part of China's domestic grain sales are at a government
purchase price, and the rest is at a price that guarantees farmers
a decent minimum return. If not for price supports, farmers would
turn to other crops that earn more, Chen said.
	   Although farmers have not benefited as much as their urban
counterparts from market-oriented reforms, many have benefited from
two decades of rapid economic growth, Chen said.

Kyrgyzstan's government resigns amid economic shortcomings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan's entire government resigned Wednesday
after President Askar Akayev accused the cabinet of incompetence
and failing to develop the country's anemic economy, news reports
said.
	   ``It is impossible to work with such a cabinet,'' Akayev was
quoted as saying by the presidential press service.
	   He said the small, mountainous Central Asian nation should enter
the new year with ``a new, more capable government.''
	   Prime Minister Kubanychbek Zhumaliyev and all the government
ministers resigned and the president was expected to issue a decree
formally dismissing the government, Russian news agencies report.
	   Akayev and the Security Council criticized the cabinet for poor
economic performance, the reports said. According to government
figures, the economy has grown 1.7 percent this year, which would
make Kyrgyzstan one of the few ex-Soviet republics that hasn't seen
an economic contraction this year.
	   However, the country suffers from high inflation, a trade
deficit and a weakening currency.
	   Akayev has been president of Kyrgyzstan since it gained
independence in the 1991 Soviet breakup. The mountainous,
agricultural nation that has seen minimal economic development
since then.

North Korea rejects border talks over infiltration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Wednesday rejected the
American-led U.N. Command's proposal for border talks to discuss
the sinking of a suspected communist spy boat in South Korean
waters.
	   The low-slung, 12-ton North Korean boat went down off South
Korea's south coast Friday in a gun battle with South Korean navy
ships.
	   The command, acting on a South Korean request, proposed to North
Korea on Monday that military generals from both sides meet in the
truce village of Panmunjom to protest what the Seoul government
considered a ``grave military provocation.''
	   ``Although obliged to respond favorably to such a proposal by
the agreement establishing the general officer talks, the Korean
People's Army today rejected the meeting,'' the command said in a
news release Wednesday.
	   The command said it will continue to press North Korea to live
up to its obligations.
	   South Korea said the craft was on a mission to land spies. But
North Korea accused the South of fabricating the incident.
	   With the help of the United States, South Korea keeps close
watch on the North with camera-equipped satellites and spy planes
and communications intercepts. Lacking such sophisticated tools,
North Korea counters by trying to place spies in the South via land
and sea routes.
	   The U.N. Command and the North's Korean People's Army signed the
1953 armistice that ended the three-year Korean War, which
American-led U.N. forces fought on South Korea's behalf.
	   Both sides hold the general officer talks to discuss enforcement
and violations of the armistice.
	   The North Korean boat, believed to be carrying up to eight
crewmen, was first spotted as it approached a port on the South's
south coast. It was pursued for hours by South Korean warships
before it was sunk in a gun battle.
	   The lack of a peace treaty between the two Koreas leaves them
technically still in a state of war.

Round-the-world balloonists drift over China's ancient sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf previous to CORRECT that balloon uses hot air
and helium &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British entrepreneur Richard Branson and his
teammates floated over northern China's ancient sites Wednesday
after the government bowed to British appeals to let their balloon
pass through prohibited airspace.
	   One Chinese air traffic controller grumbled that planes flying
between Xi'an, site of China's famed terra-cotta warriors, and the
capital Beijing were having to adjust their flight paths because of
the balloon.
	   ``People don't like uninvited guests,'' said the controller at
Xianyang Airport, near Xi'an. He refused to give his name.
	   British diplomats worked late into the evening Tuesday seeking
Chinese permission for the round-the-world balloon, which flies
with a combination of hot air and helium, to continue its course.
	   China's Foreign Ministry finally telephoned Britain's ambassador
at about 9.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) to say that the balloon could carry
on ``but it has to leave Chinese airspace as soon as possible,''
said embassy spokeswoman Harriet Hall.
	   ``I'm gripping wood with both hands,'' she added when asked if
she expected further problems for the flight.
	   The Chinese air traffic controller said the balloon could be
seen with the naked eye and on radar as it passed over the walled
city of Xi'an, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southwest of
Beijing, on Wednesday morning. No commercial flights were delayed
or canceled because of its passage, he added.
	   ``It's flying OK,'' added another air traffic controller in
Beijing.
	   Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden, aloft in the ICO Global balloon heading eastward around
the globe, were hoping to catch a jetstream to get them quickly out
of Chinese airspace.
	   ``We are going to look ... for the fastest, most direct route
out of China, which is what the balloon wants to do anyway,'' said
project director Mike Kendrick.
	   China originally had given the balloonists permission to cross
the country below 26 degrees north latitude. But they drifted
further north Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms
and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The Chinese then asked the balloonists to land in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital, but the balloon overshot the airfield.
	   As it became apparent that the balloon would inevitably cross
into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent
a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji asking for China's help.
	   ``Thank you to the Chinese government,'' Branson said upon
hearing that China had finally granted permission for them to
continue their flight.
	   ``We are embarrassed to have entered the airspace without
permission and relieved that they understand our position.''

China steps closer to having a securities law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The national legislature is expected to vote on
China's long-awaited securities law by the end of the month, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Although China opened its two stock exchanges more than eight
years ago and has 837 listed companies and 40 million investors,
the industry has not had a unified body of regulations. The result
has been large loopholes and frequent bouts of volatility.
	   The new draft of the securities law prohibits state-owned
enterprises and banks from speculating in the market, Xinhua
reported.
	   This and other changes are intended to lower risks and increase
the transparency of government market controls, the news agency
quoted Qiao Xiaoyang, vice chairman of the legislature's Law
Committee, as saying.
	   If China's large state sector and its government-controlled
banks were allowed to speculate they could easily manipulate the
market and put state assets in serious jeopardy, Xinhua said.
	   A seven-day session of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress opened Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations on
Wednesday to a cancel a scheduled flight of military observers who
monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized zone on the Iraq-Kuwait
border, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraq offered no explanation for its decision, which was likely
to increase tensions with the United Nations.
	   The U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
hoped the measure was temporary and that the U.N. is pursuing the
matter with Iraq.
	   The flight had been scheduled to carry members of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM, from Amman,
Jordan, to Habaniyya air base outside Baghdad, the official said.
	   The force was set up after the 1991 Gulf War which evicted Iraqi
forces from Kuwait following their seven-month occupation of the
tiny oil-rich emirate.
	   Another U.N. official said Syria also denied clearance for the
flight, whose planned route would have carried it over Syrian air
space.
	   UNIKOM flights are routinely scheduled for Sundays and
Wednesdays, but were halted last week due to the U.S.-British
military airstrikes on Iraq. The four nights of bombardment, aimed
at forcing Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions to eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction, ended Saturday.
	   Iraqi air defenses are still on alert for further possible
attacks, and the cancellation of the U.N. flight may be the result
of Iraq's fears that it could have come in harm's way.

Turkish industry minister to be designated next premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel was
expected to appoint Industry and Trade Minister Yalim Erez, an
independent, to form the next government, Turkish news reports said
Wednesday.
	   Erez confirmed that he had an appointment to meet with the
president for Wednesday afternoon, but declined to comment on the
reports.
	   Veteran politician Bulent Ecevit, who was designated three weeks
ago, on Monday formally abandoned his efforts to form a pro-secular
government after failing to get enough backing from feuding
center-right parties.
	   After a series of meetings with Demirel, most parties agreed
they would back the premiership of an independent lawmaker until
elections scheduled for April.
	   Erez, who was the only independent in the cabinet, has the
backing of both Ecevit and acting Premier Mesut Yilmaz, daily
Hurriyet reported.
	   The two leaders reportedly told President Demirel that they
would support Erez if he is named premier-designate.
	   Erez, a businessman-turned-politician had resigned from the
center-right True Path Party, led by Tansu Ciller, because of a
dispute over the party's alliance with an Islamic party.
	   Hurriyet reported that Erez had also the backing of leading
labor unions.
	   Yilmaz' government collapsed last month in a vote of
no-confidence over a mafia and corruption scandal.

Asian markets end mixed in quiet trading day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended mixed Wednesday in
light trading ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays.
	   Japan's markets were closed for a national holiday, adding to
the already subdued mood in regional markets.
	   Hong Kong recorded the lowest turnover in three years. Investors
were holding off buying plans following comments from one of the
city's biggest tycoons, Li Ka-shing, that the territory's political
enviroment has become too unstable and hostile for business,
traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 163.81 points, or 1.6
percent, at 10,158.75.
	   Turnover was a mere 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 282
million), the lowest level since Dec. 18, 1995.
	   Li, who controls two blue-chip companies, said Tuesday he had
scrapped a 10 billion Hong Kong dollar investment plan with a
foreign company because of the political situation, but didn't
elaborate on what he meant.
	   His comments apparently were targeted at Hong Kong's vocal
pro-democracy legislators, who are fighting for freer elections and
more social welfare for the poor.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index closed down 27.87
points, or 2 percent, to 1,384.53 in lacklustre trading.
	   Traders said there was little news to spur activity except for
Development Bank of Singapore Ltd.'s denial of market rumors that
it planned to sell its 28 percent stake in property developer DBS
Land Ltd. to focus more on its core business.
	   The denial dampened sentiment on shares in the two companies and
in the overall market.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed nearly flat in thin trading,
with the key SET index gaining 0.93 point to 344.27.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian stocks closed lower as the currency, the
rupiah, fell against the U.S. dollar. The JSX composite index
closed down 5.946 points, or 1.5 percent, at 400.519 points.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished sharply higher as
investors bought stocks whose prices had fallen in recent days. The
benchmark Composite Index closed up 13.89 points, or 2.6 percent,
at 551.11.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended higher, fueled by Wall Street's
overnight gain and buying by fund managers before the year ends.
The key PSE index closed 16.80 points, or 0.9 percent, higher at
1,910.46.
	   SEOUL: South Korean shares closed mixed, but the key Kospi index
gained 5.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to 553.53 on continued
expectations that the country's ratings will be upgraded soon,
analysts said.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares ended a quiet, pre-holiday trading
session narrowly lower, with resource stocks pulled down by weaker
gold and other metals prices overnight. The All Ordinaries index
closed at 2,755.0, down 4.8 points, or 0.17 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended lower following Tuesday's 3.4
percent jump. The Weighted Price Index fell 94.03 points, or 1.4
percnet, to 6,688.65.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices end marginally higher. The
NZSE-40 capital index closed 4.51 points higher at 2,089.9 points,
off its intraday high.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Four children left alone at home died after
one of the kids ignited a fire while playing with matches,
officials said Wednesday.
	   A 5-year-old boy started the fire, and he was asphyxiated by the
smoke along with three younger children, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   Three more children from the same family were rescued by their
elder brother when he returned home from school and put out the
fire, the ministry said.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday in the village of Bilka in the
Zhytomyr region after the children's parents went to see their
friends in a neighboring village.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The national legislature is expected to vote on
China's long-awaited securities law by the end of the month, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Although China opened its two stock exchanges more than eight
years ago and has 837 listed companies and 40 million investors,
the industry has not had a unified body of regulations. The result
has been large loopholes and frequent bouts of volatility.

market and put state assets in serious jeopardy, Xinhua said.
	   A seven-day session of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress opened Wednesday.
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday
acknowledged a prominent businessman's concerns about political
instability, but said the government would ensure a
business-friendly environment.
	   Tung was responding to comments by billionaire Li Ka-shing
Tuesday that the political environment has become too unstable and
hostile for business. Li announced that he had scrapped a 10
billion-Hong Kong dollar (U.S.-dlr 1.28 billion) investment plan
with a foreign company.
	   His two companies, property developer Cheung Kong Holdings and
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, led the blue-chip Hang Seng Index's
slide Wednesday.
	   The index fell 1.6 percent to close at 10,158.75.
	   Speaking to reporters, Tung didn't directly agree or disagree
with Li's comment on Hong Kong's political environment, but said he
respected the tycoon.
	   Tung, who was picked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after it was
returned to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, called for harmony among
disparate elements in the society.
	   ``A good environment which is conducive to business and
investment is very important to Hong Kong. That's the way to ensure
the recovery of our economy and to create more jobs for our
people,'' Tung said.
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than half of the food and beverage outlets
launched in the first nine months of this year have failed, the
government said Wednesday.
	   Along with the city-state's beleaguered retail industry, the
food and beverage sector has been hard hit by the economic slowdown
plaguing Singapore.
	   Of 164 outlets opened during the first three quarters of 1998,
85 have already folded, said the Singapore Tourism Board.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Standard and Poor's has lowered certain ratings
of seven Japanese banks, while affirming the ratings of two others.
	   The ratings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Daiwa Bank Ltd.,
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sakura Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd.,
Sumitomo Bank Ltd., and Tokai Bank Ltd. were removed from
CreditWatch, where they were placed Nov. 24, and were assigned
negative outlooks.

S and P said Tuesday.
	   The senior debt, certificate of deposit, and counterparty credit
ratings of IBJ, Sanwa Bank, and Sumitomo Bank were lowered to
triple-B-plus/A-2 from single-A-minus/A-2, S and P said. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank's senior debt ratings were lowered to triple-B/A-3 from
triple-B-plus/A-2, S and P said.

triple-B-minus/A-3 from triple-B-plus/A-2, S and P said. Daiwa
Bank's senior debt ratings were lowered to double-B-plus/single-B
from triple-B-minus/A-3, S and P said.
	   Sakura Bank's long-term senior debt ratings were affirmed, but
its counterparty credit ratings were lowered to triple-B/A-3 from

ratings were affirmed at triple-B-plus/A-2, S and P said.
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Six months after New Zealand
succumbed to the Asian financial crisis and slid into recession,
official statistics released Wednesday showed that the recession is
over.
	   Latest gross domestic product figures show the economy grew by a
better-than-expected 0.7 percent in the September quarter.
	   The short-lived recession in the first two quarters of 1998-99
financial year was sparked by the Asian crisis hitting exports, the
worldwide slump in farm commodity prices and a drought which hit
farm output.
	   But the latest data shows New Zealand experiencing an export-led
recovery after producers diversified to markets in Europe, Britain
and the United States and away from depressed Asian economies.
	   ``The growth that has occurred appears to have been export-led,
as industries such as forestry and manufacturing have made some
recovery from the falls in production over the previous two
quarters,'' said Ian Ewing, deputy statistician with Statistics New
Zealand.
	   But the recovery appears fragile. Activity in domestic-based
industries were flat or down in the quarter and local spending
showed a hesitant upturn buoyed by tax cuts.
	   Purchases of durables, especially cars, was the major
contributor to growth, up 4.4 percent.

Government approves acquisition to form giant Internet service
</HEADLINE>
provider &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials on Wednesday approved Hong Kong
Telecommunications's acquisition of a local Internet company to
form a giant Internet provider, despite fears that the deal would
drown out market competition.
	   Hong Kong Telecom would control 51 percent of the growing
Internet market after buying Star Internet, a significantly larger
share than the next-largest Internet service provider, said Anthony
Wong, director-general of the Office of the Telecommunications
Authority.
	   To ensure that the market is not run by a monopoly, the
government telecommunications watchdog would modify the license of
Hong Kong Telecom's interactive multimedia services, Wong said.
	   It would add two new conditions to prohibit abuse of dominant
position and unfair cross-subsidies, he said, without giving
further details.
	   ``I do not consider that this would necessarily prevent or
restrict fair competition in the market if certain conditions to
further safeguard fair competition are to be added,'' Wong told a
news conference.
	   Hong Kong Telecom is buying loss-making Star Internet for 245.5
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 31.5 million) from
locally-listed Star Telecom International Holding Ltd. The two
companies claimed they control 70 percent of the market, compared
with the government estimate of 51 percent.
	   Rival Internet service providers have protested the deal, saying
it would stifle competition and wipe out smaller providers.
	   The Hong Kong Internet market is extremely competitive, with
more than 130 licensed operators and no limit on the number of
licensees, as well as a low entry barrier.
	   As of Dec. 1, there were 590,223 Internet subscribers in Hong
Kong. The market has grown by 40 percent since mid-1998.
	   Hong Kong Telecom has been aggressively expanding its
non-international direct dialing businesses, seeking new revenue
streams ahead of the loss of the monopoly on its international
gateway on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   It already has the sole video-on-demand license in Hong Kong and
markets its broadband Internet service through the video-on-demand
box.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A fund set up three months ago to handle
donations for victims of the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy has
received 269.5 million shillings (dlrs 4.49 million), chairman
Charles Njonjo said Wednesday.
	   ``This amount includes interest accrued during the period the
money was held in the bank,'' Njonjo said.
	   The chairman of the National Emergency Disaster Fund said
donations came from individual Kenyans, local and international
companies, the government and other well wishers.
	   He said the fund secretariat has processed 2,992 claims,
including 203 for deaths, 954 for serious injuries and 1,835 for
minor injuries.
	   The bombing killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, in
Nairobi. Another 11 people were killed in an almost simultaneous
blast at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania.
	   More than 5,500 people were injured in both blasts, most of them
by flying glass.
	   Njonjo said the fund had made out 267.5 million shillings (dlrs
4.45 million) in checks, and in most cases, these have been
collected.
	   He said payments ranged from 650,000 shillings (dlrs 10,833) to
bona fide family members of each Kenyan killed to 30,000 shillings
(dlrs 500) to those who received minor injuries.
	   ``Inevitably, there are those who feel that they should have
received more money, and we are inclined to agree with some of
them,'' said Njonjo, ``But we can only pay out what we have
received, and we have tried to do this as professionally and
equitably as possible,'' he said.
	   Foreign donor nations have tended to bypass the fund in favor of
directly assisting projects in hospitals and other health care
centers to provide rehabilitation and training for the injured and
blinded as well as to improve emergency medical response.
	   Most people agree that the bomb blast fund, as it is popularly
known, is the first disaster fund in Kenyan history to be
professionally administered and audited.
	   Njonjo told reporters that the fund committee had virtually
completed its work of disbursing the money received.
	   ``We haven't run away. A secretary with an accountant will still
be there,'' Njonjo said, ``If he tells us there is money to
distribute, we will meet and distribute the money to whatever case
there might be.''
	   The fund was formally established Sept. 8 by President Daniel
arap Moi after widespread concern was expressed by local business
people and citizens over the proper and effective handling of
donations that poured in following the bombing.

Russian ambassador heads back to the United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to the United States headed
back to Washington on Wednesday a week after he was recalled for
consultations on the American air strikes against Iraq.
	   The Russians harshly denounced the U.S. and British bombing
raids against Iraq, and recalled ambassadors from both countries.
But Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov was returning to his post in
Washington, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the air strikes only complicated any settlement in the long-running
confrontation between the Arab nation and United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   The bombings have increased anti-American sentiment in Russia.
But next month's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``will be important for overcoming the negative
consequences of the U.S. use of force against Iraq,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday.
	   The Russians were still holding discussions with Great Britain
about the return of Moscow's ambassador to London, officials said.
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and are to remain in place until U.N. inspectors verify that
all weapons of mass destruction have been dismantled.

 &UR; Kyrgyzstan's government resigns amid economic shortcomings &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment by presidential spokesman, new graf 4. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan's entire government
resigned Wednesday after President Askar Akayev accused the cabinet
of incompetence and failing to develop the country's anemic
economy, news reports said.
	   ``It is impossible to work with such a cabinet,'' Akayev was
quoted as saying by the presidential press service.
	   He said the small, mountainous Central Asian nation should enter
the new year with ``a new, more capable government.''
	   Presidential spokesman Kanybek Imanaliyev said that ``the
government of Kyrgyzstan has failed to reach a clear understanding
of its tasks in the struggle against the economic crisis,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Kubanychbek Zhumaliyev and all the government
ministers resigned and the president was expected to issue a decree
formally dismissing the government, Russian news agencies report.
	   Akayev and the Security Council criticized the cabinet for poor
economic performance, the reports said. According to government
figures, the economy has grown 1.7 percent this year, which would
make Kyrgyzstan one of the few ex-Soviet republics that hasn't seen
an economic contraction this year.
	   However, the country suffers from high inflation, a trade
deficit and a weakening currency.
	   Akayev has been president of Kyrgyzstan since it gained
independence in the 1991 Soviet breakup. The mountainous,
agricultural nation that has seen minimal economic development
since then.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday
implicated ex-NATO chief Willy Claes in corruption in awarding
defense contracts in the 1980s when he was Belgian economics
minister. It did not immediately sentence him.
	   Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge, spent hours reading
the verdict against Claes, two other ex-ministers, eight aides and
associates, plus Serge Dassault, head of France's Dassault aviation
concern.
	   Lahousse said he believed Claes knew Italy's Agusta SpA was
paying 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil a December,
1988, contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Lahousse stated.
	   From the outset of the trial on Sept. 2, Claes, 60, and the
other 11 defendants _ including ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67 _ denied the corruption
charges. They were expected to be sentenced later Wednesday.
	   In addition to Agusta, prosecutors alleged Dassault Aviation SA
paid a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a
June, 1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The international Red Cross appealed Wednesday for
contributions of 32 million Swiss francs (dlrs 24 million) for
further aid to the Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   The funds will provide food, seeds and agricultural tools to
more than 250,000 people over the next six months in Honduras,
Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, said a statement by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
	   The aid is expected to last until the next harvest in June, it
said, adding that money will also help supply clean water and
support health measures to avoid epidemics.
	   The new campaign comes on top of 12.5 million francs (dlrs 9
million) collected in the weeks after the October hurricane that
killed more than 9,000 people, left more than 1 million homeless
and destroyed large areas of agricultural land.

Ukraine's parliament approves humanitarian aid to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday voted to
send humanitarian aid to Iraq to help the country cope with the
aftermath of recent air strikes.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature approved by a narrow
majority a resolution that ordered the Cabinet to allocate an
``affordable amount'' of food and medicines for Iraq.
	   The United States and Britain conducted a series of air strikes
against Iraq last week in response to President Saddam Hussein's
refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The resolution said that the aid to Iraq is necessitated by
``numerous casualties and considerable damage that was inflicted on
Iraq by massive air and missile strikes, and by hardships the Iraqi
population is enduring as a result of the lasting blockade,'' the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Last week, Ukraine's left-leaning legislature condemned the use
of force by the United States and Britain against Iraq and called
for a peaceful solution to the conflict.

Iraq orders U.N. to cancel flight

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations on
Wednesday to a cancel a scheduled flight of military observers who
monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized zone on the Iraq-Kuwait
border, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraq offered no explanation for its decision, which was likely
to increase tensions with the United Nations.
	   The U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
hoped the measure was temporary and that the U.N. is pursuing the
matter with Iraq.
	   The flight had been scheduled to carry members of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM, from Amman,
Jordan, to Habaniyya air base outside Baghdad, the official said.
	   The force was set up after the 1991 Gulf War which evicted Iraqi
forces from Kuwait following their seven-month occupation of the
tiny oil-rich emirate.
	   Another U.N. official said Syria also denied clearance for the
flight, whose planned route would have carried it over Syrian air
space.
	   UNIKOM has offices in Baghdad and Kuwait and its officials
regularly visit both places for consultations.
	   UNIKOM flights, routinely scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays,
were halted last week due to the U.S.-British military airstrikes
on Iraq. The four nights of bombardment, aimed at forcing Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass
destruction, ended Saturday.
	   Iraqi air defenses are still on alert for further possible
attacks, and the cancellation of the U.N. flight may be the result
of Iraq's fears that it could have come in harm's way.
	   Iraq had warned Tuesday that it won't forgive Kuwait for
allowing the United States and Britain to use its military bases to
mount last week's airstrikes against the country.
	   The latest development came while U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and the commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf, Marine Gen.
Anthony Zinni, were in the Gulf region for a morale-boosting
pre-Christmas visit with U.S. troops. They visited an air base in
Saudi Arabia and Cohen headed for the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian workers resumed their normal duties
Wednesday after returning from Jordan.
	   Their first task will be to judge the impact of the bombing
campaign on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program and other
international efforts to help the 22 million Iraqis, said U.N.
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered a survey taking no more than a
week to determine what repairs are needed, the officials said.
	   They said U.N. food observers also went out Wednesday to check
grain silos and aid distribution centers in Baghdad and elsewhere
in Iraq.
	   Some 120 U.N. humanitarian workers returned to Baghdad on
Tuesday night after a bus trip across the desert from Amman, where
they were evacuated last week during the bombing campaign.
	   The United States launched the missile attacks to punish Iraq
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors who are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
along with long-range missiles.
	   Until the inspectors certify that their job is done, economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be
lifted. Iraq insists it has destroyed its weapons programs.
	   The Iraqi government also has ordered an assessment of civilian
and military losses from the U.S. and British bombardment. Iraqi
officials, also insisting on anonymity, said the government intends
to formally ask the U.N. Security Council for compensation.
	   The United Nations Children's Fund has already started repairing
two hospitals, whose windows and doors were shattered by the force
of explosions in nearby sites.
	   Iraq on Tuesday accused U.S. and British warplanes of firing two
missiles toward the southern city of Basra, saying the renewed
aggression was part of a policy ``to harm Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted 100 sites, mostly defense related,
to reduce Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass destruction.

Nicholson wins call for injured Gillespie

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian paceman Jason Gillespie
failed a fitness test Wednesday and was ruled out of the fourth
test against England at the MCG from Saturday.
	   Gillespie was troubled by soreness behind a knee and uncapped
paceman Matthew Nicholson received a call up after a strong
performance against England early on tour.
	   Nicholson, from Western Australia, has played just six Sheffield
Shield matches. The 24-year-old made his debut two seasons ago,
playing two matches, before suffering Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
	   He took seven wickets in an innings against England last month
and has claimed 17 wickets in four games this season.
	   ``I was just blown away when I was told,'' Nicholson said of his
selection.
	   ``You never think something like this is going to happen _ maybe
two years down the track, but not this year.''
	   Nicholson believes he will never recover fully from CFS, but
keeps it under control with a strict diet, which includes avoiding
alcohol.
	   ``A lot of the work I've done over the last two years hasn't
been so much physical work as discipline and mental work to get
myself back up to where I am health wise,'' Nicholson said.
	   ``It makes all that worthwhile _ the nights I was tired and
couldn't sleep and all the days I had to get through _ this makes
it all worthwhile.''
	   Australia leads the five-test series 2-0 and was unlucky not to
win the rain-affected first match.
	   England is backing up from a humiliating nine-wicket loss to
Australia's second string team in Hobart.
	   Despite the continuing poor performances on tour, England
captain Alec Stewart is still trying to deliver words of confidence
with a straight face.
	   ``We are looking to make it 2-all and square the series,''
Stewart said Wednesday.
	   He admitted the loss to Australia A was a major setback,
however.
	   ``What went on wasn't the right standard,'' Stewart said. ``It
was totally unacceptable and a few people have to put their hand up
and say why.''

Pinochet lawyers to seek bail adjustment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: To be led after 2 p.m. (1400 gmt) hearing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet said Wednesday
they were seeking minor changes to bail conditions for the former
Chilean dictator.
	   A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said it
understood the main objective of the application for a bail
variation would be to allow for any necessary dental or medical
treatment for the general over the Christmas holiday.
	   The general's lawyer, Michael Caplan, declined to give details
before the 2 p.m. (1400 GMT) hearing at Bow Street Magistrates
Court in central London.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
	   Pinochet is fighting a bid to extradite him to Spain to face
charges of a long list of human rights crimes relating to his
1973-90 dictatorship.
	   An official Chilean report says about 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   A British Cabinet minister ruled Dec. 9 that extradition
proceedings could start.
	   The next step in the proceedings is expected to be Jan. 18, when
the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, will rehear Pinochet's
claim that, under British law, his status as a former foreign head
of state gives him immunity.
	   On Dec. 17, the Lords set aside the original ruling against
immunity because a judge failed to disclose his ties to Amnesty
International.

Rojas beats Iida for WBA super flyweight championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Jesus Rojas of Venezuela beat defending
champion Satoshi Iida of Japan in a unanimous decision Wednesday,
winning the World Boxing Association super flyweight division
title.
	   There were no knockdowns in the 12-round fight.
	   Rojas, a former world flyweight champion, was in control after
the 29-year-old Iida suffered a shoulder injury in the fifth round.
	   Iida was making his third defense of the title he won from
Yoktai Sith Oar of Thailand a year ago.
	   ``Today is my son's 11th birthday,'' said a jubilant Rojas.
``This victory is a great present for him.'' The 34-year-old added
that he would like to give Iida a rematch.
	   Iida said he felt pain in the right shoulder from the second
round and it bothered him to such an extent that he had to fight
only with his left hand after the fifth.
	   Mexican judge Hector Hernandez saw the fight 116-112, Arkom
Wannasit of Thailand 116-113 and American Duane Ford 115-111, all
in favor of Rojas.
	   Iida now has a career record of 25 wins, 11 by knockout, two
losses and a draw. Rojas has won 32 bouts, 16 by knockout, against
seven losses and two draws.

One dead, three wounded in latest Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ One man was killed and three others
wounded in two separate shootouts in Kosovo, Serbian sources
reported Wednesday.
	   In one of the incidents, an unidentified gunman burst into an
Albanian-owned bar in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica late
Tuesday and opened fire, wounding two ethnic Albanians, the
Serb-run Media Center said.
	   One of the men, Naser Haziri, 22, was shot in the head and died
Wednesday at a hospital in the provincial capital Pristina. The
other, Lulzim Ademi, 20, a Kosovo Albanian known for his loyalty to
the Serbian authorities was shot in the back, the center reported.
	   The center also said the police sealed off the district where
the bar is located and were pursuing the perpetrator.
	   Also Tuesday the center said two Serbian police officers were
wounded in an attack late Tuesday when ``terrorists'' opened fire
with machine-guns in a suburb of the provincial capital Pristina.
The officers were shot while in a car, the center said. Police are
investigating.
	   The continuing spiral of violence, with killings and heavy
injuries almost daily, threatens to revive the all-out war that
raged in the Serbian province between secessionist ethnic Albanians
and Serb security forces from February to October. During that time
some 1,000 people lost their lives and another 300,000 lost their
homes.
	   On Oct. 12 President Slobodan Milosevic, under threat of NATO
airstrikes, pledged to U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to reduce
government troops here and allow deployment of 2,000 foreign peace
verifiers.
	   But the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army has been
stridently opposed to any plan for the majority Albanian province
that stops short of independence, while the Serbs have been
reluctant to pull out of Kosovo.
	   In Pristina Wednesday, 26 ethnic Albanians were to go on trial,
charged with ``terrorism and hostile activity against the state,''
for allegedly carrying out three armed attacks. Nine of the men
have been in custody since June, while the others will be tried in
absentia.
	   The Albanians' defense lawyer, Rexhep Haxhimusa, was quoted by
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore as saying that the trial was
political and staged, lacking firm evidence against his clients.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the international verifiers, William
Walker, suggested his people were being impeded and blamed the
Belgrade authorities for failing to cooperate with the mission.
Walker also blamed ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the
cease-fire agreement and carrying out provocative missions.
	   The same day, the KLA warned they would go for all-out war
unless Serb police pull out of central parts of the province.
	   The threat came as U.S. officials met with the guerilla
organization's top commanders in an apparent effort to resuscitate
the October truce and pave the way for negotiations on the Serbian
province's future.

FISA moves regatta to Belgium over German protests against beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Rowing Federation
on Wednesday announced it will move its first World Cup regatta of
1999 from Munich, Germany, to Belgium because of a threatened
boycott by a group of German rowers over beer sponsorship.
	   The move follows the decision by the German brewery Krombacher
to pull out of its three-year sponsorship deal with the federation,
FISA.
	   ``It is very sad that the actions of this small group of rowers
have led to the loss of a significant sponsor and the German
federation's only annual major televised regatta,'' said Matt
Smith, FISA executive director.
	   A FISA statement said the rowers had carried out ``a sustained
campaign of attack via the media, coupled with threats of
boycotts,'' against FISA and Krombacher.
	   ``Beer advertising is clearly permitted in FISA rules and German
Rowing Federation rules ... and nearly all European countries,''
the statement said.
	   ``The German Rowing Federation has now officially withdrawn its
support of these rowers, has agreed to follow all rules of FISA and
will ensure that its clubs and rowers participating in
international competitions do as well,'' the statement continues.
	   The first stage of the 1999 Rowing World Cup will now take place
at Hazewinkel, near Brussels, on May 28-30.
	   The second regatta will be in Vienna, Austria, on June 18-20,
and the finals will be in Lucerne, Switzerland, July 9-11.
	   Germany has won the overall World Cup event for the past three
years.

EU approves joint venture between Ford, ZF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday cleared a joint venture between America's
Ford Motor Company and the German auto part maker ZF
Friedrichshafen AG.
	   The joint venture is expected to be set up at the beginning of
1999. It will produce and sell automatic transmissions for
passenger cars and light trucks at Ford's Batavia Transmission
Plant in Ohio, in the United States.
	   A Commission statement said the new company ``will not create a
dominant position in the market of automatic transmissions.''
	   ZF will own 51 percent of the new company and Ford the remaining
49 percent.
	   The Commission is empowered to veto company alliances or joint
ventures it judges hinder fair competition rules.

Mother jailed (briefly) for naming son ``Gesher'' -- Hebrew for
</HEADLINE>
bridge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A mother of 14 was jailed this week because
she refused to change the name she picked for her young son, even
though that violated Norway's name law.
	   Kirsti Larsen, 46, told the Verdens Gang newspaper that she
named her son Gesher after she dreamed the child should be named
``bridge.'' Gesher means bridge in Hebrew.
	   Norway has strict laws regulating names, including lists of
acceptable first and last names. In mid-1995, Larsen tried to
register her son's name as Gesher at her local county office, which
rejected the choice as illegal.
	   Larsen, a devout Christian, lost repeated appeals. She was
ordered to change the name, pay a 1,600 kroner (dlrs 210 fine) or
spend two days in jail.
	   ``Many probably would have bowed to `Big Brother' and paid the
fine. On principle, I couldn't go along with such absurdity,''
Larsen was quoted Wednesday as telling the newspaper.
	   Instead, she reported as ordered to prison in Fredikstad, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Oslo, on Monday, leaving her husband
and 10 of her children at home to fend for themselves while she
served two days in jail.
	   ``Maybe the authorities thought I would come running with the
money when they ordered me to serve my sentence just before
Christmas, but I didn't let them scare me,'' she was quoted as
saying.
	   It was not clear whether anyone else in Norway had been ever
imprisoned for violating the name laws, or what the final outcome
of the dispute will be, according to the Norwegian Justice
Ministry.
	   For the time being, the child, now four, still is named Gesher.

Yeltsin works at country residence Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin discussed political and economic
developments with his chief of staff Wednesday in a meeting at his
country residence, the president's spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin held talks Wednesday afternoon with Nikolai Bordyuzha,
head of the presidential administration, spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said without providing details.
	   The president spent the day at his Gorky-9 residence just west
of the Russian capital, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has made only occasional trips to the Kremlin recently,
spending most of his time at Gorky-9 while recuperating from
illnesses, including a recent bout of pneumonia.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended mixed Wednesday in
light trading ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. Japan's
markets were closed for a national holiday, adding to the already
subdued mood in regional markets. Hong Kong recorded the lowest
turnover in three years. Investors held off buying plans after one
of the city's biggest tycoons, Li Ka-shing, said the territory was
too unstable and hostile for business. The blue-chip Hang Seng
Index ended down 163.81 points, or 1.6 percent, at 10,158.75.
Turnover was a mere 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 282
million), the lowest level since Dec. 18, 1995. In Singapore, the
key Straits Times Index closed down 27.87 points, or 2 percent, to
1,384.53 in lacklustre trading. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Just a few months ago, many economists were
anticipating a lengthy series of interest-rate cuts as the Federal
Reserve battled spillover from the world economic slump. Now, faced
with evidence of the U.S. economy's resilience, some analysts
believe the three quarter-point rate cuts from Sept. 29 through
Nov. 17 may be it for quite some time. ``I don't think there's
going to be any further easings,'' said economist Joel Prakken of
Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. As expected, Federal Reserve
policy-makers decided Tuesday to leave the benchmark rate on
overnight loans between banks unchanged at a four-year low of 4.75
percent. Prakken said this fall's cuts may be enough to sustain the
U.S. economy through any remaining ripple effects from the global
slowdown that began in Asia last year and toppled the Russian
economy and threatened Latin America this year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Six months after New Zealand
succumbed to the Asian financial crisis and slid into recession,
official statistics released Wednesday showed that the recession is
over. Latest gross domestic product figures show the economy grew
by a better-than-expected 0.7 percent in the quarter ending through
September. The short-lived recession in the first two quarters of
the year was sparked by the Asian crisis hitting exports, the
worldwide slump in farm commodity prices and a drought which hit
farm output. But the latest data shows New Zealand experiencing an
export-led recovery after producers diversified to markets in
Europe, Britain and the United States and away from depressed Asian
economies. (NEW ZEALAND-RECESSION ENDS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Standard and Poor's has lowered certain ratings
of seven Japanese banks, while affirming the ratings of two others.
The ratings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Daiwa Bank Ltd.,
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sakura Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd.,
Sumitomo Bank Ltd., and Tokai Bank Ltd. were removed from
CreditWatch, where they were placed Nov. 24, and were assigned
negative outlooks. All ratings of Asahi Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank
Ltd. were affirmed, S and P said Tuesday. (US-JAPAN BANKS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials on Wednesday approved Hong Kong
Telecommunications's acquisition of a local Internet company to
form a giant Internet provider, despite fears that the deal would
drown out market competition. Hong Kong Telecom would control 51
percent of the growing Internet market after buying Star Internet,
a significantly larger share than the next-largest Internet service
provider, said Anthony Wong, director-general of the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority. To ensure that the market is not run
by a monopoly, the government telecommunications watchdog would
modify the license of Hong Kong Telecom's interactive multimedia
services, Wong said. It would add two new conditions to prohibit
abuse of dominant position and unfair cross-subsidies, he said,
without giving further details. (HONG KONG-INTERNET BUYOUT)

codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq ordered the United Nations on
Wednesday to cancel a scheduled flight of military observers headed
to Baghdad to monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized zone on the
Iraq-Kuwait border, a U.N. official said. Iraq offered no
explanation for its decision, which was likely to increase tensions
with the United Nations. The U.N. official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he hoped the measure was temporary and that the
U.N. is pursuing the matter with Iraq. The flight had been
scheduled to carry members of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait
Observer Mission, from Amman, Jordan to Habaniyya air base outside
Baghdad, the official said. The force was set up after the 1991
Gulf War which evicted Iraqi forces from Kuwait following their
seven-month occupation of the tiny oil-rich emirate. (IRAQ-FLIGHT)
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people. Although the
cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the heaviest in
nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had spent the
night in shelters, accounting for the relatively light casualty
toll. The border town of Kiryat Shemona is so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha.'' As of
midday, several hours after the attack, tens of thousands of people
in northern Israel were being told to stay in shelters. Israel's
army said its forces were returning artillery fire and were
prepared to launch air strikes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
called a special meeting of his security Cabinet to discuss the
attack, for which Hezbollah guerillas claimed responsibility, and
planned to fly to the north for a visit later Wednesday.
(ISRAEL-LEBANON)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After miscalculating in the U.S. House of
Representatives, President Bill Clinton's defenders have moved
legalistic maneuvers to the background for now in favor of an
aggressive lobbying effort to stop a U.S. Senate impeachment trial
and promote censure instead. And like Monica Lewinsky, who shelved
her first lawyer last summer for two Washington insiders who won
her an immunity deal with prosecutors, the White House is likely to
turn to senior statesmen in both parties to make a case that
senators will heed, advisers say. Former Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell is already taking an increased role in the White
House effort, and his advice on dealing with the Senate and his
ability to contact key players is viewed by most advisers as
critical to success. While two-thirds of the Senate would be
required to convict Clinton and remove him from office, only 51
votes would be needed to set aside the trial and opt for another
form of punishment. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday
implicated ex-NATO chief Willy Claes in corruption in awarding
defense contracts in the 1980s when he was Belgian economics
minister. It did not immediately sentence him. Marc Lahousse, the
court's presiding judge, spent hours reading the verdicts against
Claes, two other ex-ministers, eight aides and associates, plus
Serge Dassault, head of France's Dassault aviation concern.
Lahousse said he believed Claes knew Italy's Agusta SpA was paying
51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil a December 1988
contract for 46 army helicopters. BELGIUM-CORRUPTION TRIAL.
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military court on Wednesday charged
11 elite soldiers with kidnapping pro-democracy activists in the
last months of former President Suharto's rule. The abductions were
carried out earlier this year amid a growing wave of protests
against the authoritarian Suharto that triggered deadly riots and
forced him from power in May. Yet a key figure linked to the
kidnappings, the former head of Indonesia's special forces, was in
Jordan and apparently beyond the reach of military investigators.
Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, had
successfully sought citizenship in Jordan, where he has close ties
with military officers with whom he once conducted joint training
exercises. Prabowo has not been charged but he was suspected of
engineering the abductions. The military, which is trying to clean
up its human rights record, had said it might court-martial him.

Police target prostitution ring using illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they had uncovered a
crime ring that snared illegal-immigrant couples from the Ukraine,
forcing the women to work as prostitutes and the men to engage in
criminal activities.
	   Gang members working in the Ukraine were obtaining passports
from Jewish couples who did not intend to go to Israel and forging
them for use by other couples, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin.
	   When those couples arrived in Israel, ringleaders here would
force them to go to work for the gang. The crime ring also
fraudulently collected government subsidies meant for new
immigrants to Israel, the police spokeswoman said.
	   On Wednesday, police arrested a man and woman in the northern
city of Haifa for involvement with the gang. The woman had been
trying to flee the prostitution ring, Menuhin said.
	   She said more arrests were expected.
	   Stories about sex slavery in Israel began surfacing shortly
after the mass immigration of Soviet Jews began in 1989, eventually
bringing nearly 800,000 newcomers to Israel.
	   Russian-based crime gangs used the influx of immigrants as a
cover for sneaking in an estimated 10,000 prostitutes over the past
decade. The sex trade has grown into a dlrs 450-million-a year
business, with women often finding themselves virtually enslaved by
crime bosses.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, other socialists found guilty of corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday found
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes guilty of taking bribes for awarding a
defense contract in the 1980s when he was economics minister.
	   It did not immediately sentence him or any of five other
defendants _ former aides and associates _ standing trial with him
on corruption charges.
	   The court said Claes, 60, must have known Italy's Agusta SpA
paying 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil the awarding of
a December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the high court's presiding
judge, said in a summation of the facts of the case that took hours
to read.
	   Claes was one of 12 defendants on trial in two separate
corruption cases involving government defense contracts.
	   The others were ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52 and ex-deputy
premier Guy Spitaels, 67, eight onetime aides and associates, plus
Serge Dassault, head of France's Dassault aviation concern.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, other socialists found guilty of corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday found
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes guilty of taking bribes for awarding a
defense contract in the 1980s when he was economics minister.
	   It did not immediately sentence him or any of five other
defendants _ former aides and associates _ standing trial with him
on corruption charges.
	   The court said Claes, 60, must have known Italy's Agusta SpA
paying 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil the awarding of
a December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the high court's presiding
judge, said in a summation of the facts of the case that took hours
to read.
	   Claes was one of 12 defendants on trial in two separate
corruption cases involving government defense contracts.
	   The others were ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52 and ex-deputy
premier Guy Spitaels, 67, eight onetime aides and associates, plus
Serge Dassault, head of France's Dassault aviation concern.

Ukraine's parliament fails to raise minimum wage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's left-leaning parliament on
Wednesday failed to override a presidential veto on the bill that
would have sharply raised the country's minimum wage.
	   Last month, parliament nearly tripled the monthly minimum wage
from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43), and also set the
official poverty level at 119 hryvna (dlrs 35) a month.
	   However, President Leonid Kuchma declined to sign the
parliamentary bill, arguing that the hike would force the
government to layoff workers and print more money to afford the
wage hikes.
	   Only 201 lawmakers in the 450-seat legislature voted Wednesday
to override the veto, falling nearly 100 votes short of the
two-thirds majority required.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998.
	   The minimum wage and poverty level figures, though, are used to
calculate salaries and various payments throughout the country.

French maritime authorities hunt for missing boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French maritime authorities searched Wednesday for
a Spanish fishing boat with eight men aboard that has been missing
since a storm hit the southwestern French coast five days ago.
	   The ``Marero'' is registered in the port of Pasajes in Spain's
Basque province of Guizpoca, maritime authorities said Wednesday.
	   The 23-meter (yard) vessel disappeared Saturday about 90
kilometers (55 miles) north of the French port of Bayonne during a
fierce storm.
	   France's Center for Monitoring and Sea Rescue is coordinating
the search effort. All fishing boats in the area have been asked to
watch out for signs of the crew.

Ghanian man arrested in money scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong police have arrested a Ghanian man
who allegedly swindled U.S. dlrs 250,000 out of two businessmen by
selling them blackened paper he claimed was U.S. banknotes,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The 26-year-old man was arrested at the Hong Kong airport on his
way back from Ghana on Tuesday, a police statement said. Police did
not give his name or other details.
	   The man allegedly lured two businessmen, from the Philippines
and Taiwan, to buy the blackened paper, which he said were defaced
and blackened for security in transit, the statement said.
	   He allegedly told them that the black ink could be washed out
with a special chemical.
	   The victims later reported the scam to police after the man
disappeared.
	   The blackened money was only ordinary paper and the the chemical
was iodine-based dye remover, police said.

Jordan unions call for partial boycott of U.S.-British drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian pharmacists and doctors have
called for a partial boycott of U.S.-British drugs in protest
against recent airstrikes on Iraq, the head of the pharmacists'
union said Wednesday.
	   The chairman of the Jordanian Pharmacists Association, Abdul
Rahim Issa, told The Associated Press that his union and the Jordan
Medical Association were urging pharmacists and doctors to boycott
all U.S.-British goods _ including cosmetics and medical equipment
_ except those ``for which no substitute products are available.''
	   ``We shall start our boycott on Wednesday and will continue as
long as the crisis between Iraq, the United States and Britain
continues, until the crisis is solved,'' he said.
	   All practicing doctors and pharmacies in the country are members
of the two associations. However, the boycott call is not legally
binding.
	   Issa said U.S. and British drugs amounted to 20 percent of
Jordan's annual imports of dlrs 110 million worth of medicines.
	   He said the boycott would have no effect on Jordanian patients
as ``local and foreign substitutes'' were usually available. Where
there was no substitute, the boycott would not apply.
	   There was strong public resentment against the four-day attacks
on Iraq by U.S.-British warplanes and missiles last week. Several
protests occurred, culminating in a march by 3,000 people through
the capital, Amman, on Sunday _ the day after the strikes ended.
The Jordanian parliament passed a motion condemning the
bombardment.
	   The United States and Britain undertook the attacks to punish
Baghdad for alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The
inspectors are charged by the Security Council with eliminating
Iraq's banned weapons of mass destruction.

BRUSSELS: aviation concern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The trial opened Sept. 2 with all defendants denying the
charges. Some raised procedural objections to a supreme court trial
but to no avail.
	   In addition to Agusta, prosecutors alleged Dassault Aviation SA
paid a bribe of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a
June, 1989, deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
each.
	   The corporate bribes _ ``gifts'' in Belgian political parlance _
were paid to this nation's Dutch and French-speaking socialist
parties through an exotic web of Swiss and Luxembourg bank
accounts.
	   The trial was held in the 15-judge high court after the
parliamentary immunity of Claes and other ex-cabinet members had
been been lifted.
	   It was a final curtain for a generation of party bosses who,
until the 1990s, ran their political families out of their wallets
or secret bank accounts, unhindered by laws banning corporate
political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations. Thus,
prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid but that
the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to the
awarding of contracts that Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991,
presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as
Belgian economics minister
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at government expense.
	   At the time, the government said Agusta and Dassault offered
better economic compensation than their rivals _ respectively
France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton Industries Inc. of the United
States. Such compensation usually means promises to create jobs in
return for winning defense contracts.

Mother jailed (briefly) for naming son ``Gesher'' -- Hebrew for
</HEADLINE>
bridge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A mother of 14 was jailed this week because
she refused to change the name she picked for her young son, even
though that violated Norway's name law.
	   Kirsti Larsen, 46, told the Verdens Gang newspaper that she
named her son Gesher after she dreamed the child should be named
``bridge.'' Gesher means bridge in Hebrew.
	   Norway has strict laws regulating names, including lists of
acceptable first and last names. In mid-1995, Larsen tried to
register her son's name as Gesher at her local county office, which
rejected the choice as illegal.
	   Larsen, a devout Christian, lost repeated appeals. She was
ordered to change the name, pay a 1,600 kroner (dlrs 210 fine) or
spend two days in jail.
	   ``Many probably would have bowed to `Big Brother' and paid the
fine. On principle, I couldn't go along with such absurdity,''
Larsen was quoted Wednesday as telling the newspaper.
	   Instead, she reported as ordered to prison in Fredikstad, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Oslo, on Monday, leaving her husband
and 10 of her children at home to fend for themselves while she
served two days in jail.
	   ``Maybe the authorities thought I would come running with the
money when they ordered me to serve my sentence just before
Christmas, but I didn't let them scare me,'' she was quoted as
saying.
	   It was not clear whether anyone else in Norway had been ever
imprisoned for violating the name laws, or what the final outcome
of the dispute will be, according to the Norwegian Justice
Ministry.
	   For the time being, the child, now four, still is named Gesher.

 &UR; India honors a socialist leader posthumously &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A socialist leader whose campaign
against corruption toppled the Congress Party government more than
two decades ago was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian
honor, the president's office said Wednesday.
	   President K.R. Narayanan will hold a special ceremony soon to
honor Jayaprakash Narayan with ``Bharat Ratna'' (India's Jewel)
award. A member of Narayan's family is expected to receive the
award.
	   Narayan was a close associate of Mohandas Gandhi, who led
India's freedom struggle against the British colonialists.
	   In 1975, Narayan brought together more than a dozen disparate
opposition groups to fight Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's
government after she imposed emergency in the country, curbing
civil liberties and jailing her political opponents for 19 months.
	   The opposition fought the 1977 general elections under the
banner of People's Party that ended the Congress Party's rule for
the first time since India won independence in 1947.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's right-wing Bharatiya
Janata Party also was part of the People's Party.
	   But Narayan died in 1979 a disappointed man as infighting
brought the downfall of India's first non-Congress government
within 18 months. Indira Gandhi swept back to power in 1980 midterm
elections held soon after Narayan's death.

 &UR; Ruckus in Parliament over proposed new state in India &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Ignoring protests from a small group of
socialist lawmakers Wednesday, the government placed before
parliament the last among a series of bills to create three new
states in India.
	   Members of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal,
whose lawmakers could see their fiefdoms shrink, kept up a steady
chorus of chants in the Lok Sabha, the lawmaking lower house of
parliament, prompting the speaker to shut down business for several
hours in the morning.
	   On Tuesday, shouting from opponents of a similar bill delayed
proceedings, but the Bharatiya Janata Party was eventually able to
introduce it.
	   The BJP says carving Uttaranchal out of northern Uttar Pradesh
and Chattisgarh out of central Madhya Pradesh would ensure better
governance by creating smaller, more manageable administrative
areas. India at present has 26 states and seven federally
administered union territories.
	   Wednesday, the government placed another bill to carve out
Vananchal out of what is now Bihar state.

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected separatist guerrillas gunned
down nine relatives of rebels who had surrendered in the northern
Himalayan territory of Kashmir on Wednesday, police said.
	   The attacks all took place in Kulgam, a village 70 kilometers
(45 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir,
a region over which India and Pakistan have fought two of their
three wars in 51 years.
	   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the pre-dawn
attacks, but police blamed separatist militants operating in the
Kashmir Valley, the seat of a decade-old Muslim insurrection that
has left about 20,000 people dead so far.
	   Details of the attack were sketchy.
	   The victims were all relatives of guerrillas who had surrendered
over the years after the government began a program to rehabilitate
them in counter-insurgency operations.
	   Rebels say the surrendered militants _ whom they call renegades
because they betrayed the cause of independence for Kashmir _ often
are used by the security forces to carry out fake attacks on
civilian targets that are then blamed on separatists with a view to
discrediting them. The government denies the charges.

VW makes first payments to former slave laborers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A fund set up this year by Volkswagen to
compensate its former slave laborers from the Nazi era has made its
first payments, the German automaker said Wednesday.
	   The 20 million mark (dlrs 12 million) fund transferred 10,000
marks (dlrs 6,000) each to 17 former slave laborers in Poland and
31 in the Netherlands, it said.
	   The fund, directed by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, recently took out advertisements in 22 countries publicizing
the fund and how to apply.
	   VW estimates 17,000 forced laborers worked in its factories from
1941 to the end of World War II, although others charge the number
was much higher.
	   Most German firms had refused to honor back wage claims, arguing
the workers were forced on them by the Nazis and so the current
government, as legal successor to the Nazi regime, should be
responsible.
	   But Volkswagen, facing lawsuits in the United States, broke
ranks this year and announced the establishment of a fund to
provide ``humanitarian aid'' directly to survivors.
	   It also is one of several big firms involved in talks with newly
elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to set up an industry-wide
fund, administered by the government, to settle all slave labor
claims and resolve all legal action.

surprised Austria with an unannounced private ceremony at Vienna
City Hall Wednesday.
	   In the past few weeks, speculation as to where Klestil and
Loeffler would marry was the talk of Vienna's tabloids. Wednesday's
ceremony was not disclosed in advance and no guests attended, the
Austria Press Agency reported.
	   The couple's relations have been widely published, since
Klestil's former wife, Edith, walked out of the presidential palace
on New Year's Eve 1993 after 40 years of marriage. It was rumored
that Klestil's relationship with Loeffler had caused the breakup.
	   Nevertheless, the president won a second six-year term in the
largely ceremonial post last April, defeating four challengers with
63 percent of the vote. In September, he finalized his divorce.
	   The 44-year-old Loeffler first met Klestil in the 1980s and
later worked as his office manager during his first two years in
office. In 1994, she transferred to the foreign ministry.
	   Klestil, 66, is a career diplomat widely credited with helping
restore Austria's credibility, which was damaged by the controversy
over the Nazi German wartime service of his predecessor, Kurt
Waldheim.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, other socialists face sentencing for
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Claes' conviction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's supreme court Wednesday
convicted ex-NATO chief Willy Claes of corruption in the awarding
of defense contracts in the 1980s when he was Belgian economics
minister. It did not immediately sentence him.
	   Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge, spent hours reading
the verdict against Claes, two other ex-ministers, eight aides and
associates, plus Serge Dassault, head of France's Dassault aviation
concern.
	   Lahousse said he believed Claes knew Italy's Agusta SpA was
paying dlrs 1.37 million to help win a December 1988 contract for
46 army helicopters.
	   ``Prior to awarding the contract, (Claes) gave his assent to his
chief cabinet aide to accept the offer made by Agusta,'' Lahousse
said.
	   From the outset of the trial on Sept. 2, Claes, 60, and the
other 11 defendants _ including ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
and ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67 _ denied the corruption
charges. The remaining verdicts were expected later Wednesday.
	   In addition to Agusta, prosecutors alleged Dassault Aviation SA
paid a bribe of dlrs 1.62 million to win a June 1989 deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics.
	   The two contracts were each worth hundreds of millions of
dollars each.
	   The bribes were allegedly paid to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through a web of Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The 15-judge high court held the trial after the parliamentary
immunity of Claes and other ex-cabinet members had been lifted.
	   The trial was a final curtain for a generation of party leaders
who, until the 1990s, ruled unhindered by any law banning corporate
political donations.
	   It was not until 1989 that Belgium outlawed such donations. To
prove corruption, prosecutors were required to show that the Agusta
and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to the awarding of
contracts that Claes and the others had to know they were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a one-time socialist minister who was slain by hired killers
in 1991, presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing and was
about to talk.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as
Belgian economics minister

Russian parliament rejects bill to expand land ownership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday rejected the latest
version of a land bill designed to expand the ownership of private
property, including farmland.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has been battling with the
Communist-dominated parliament for years in a bid to increase
private land ownership.
	   But seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia
still has no comprehensive law on land ownership. Land could not be
privately owned during Soviet times.
	   The proposed Land Code has been going back and forth between
Yeltsin's administration and parliament for the past year.
	   Seeking to win the bill's approval, Yeltsin has offered several
concessions to Communists and other hard-line lawmakers who want to
keep most land, and particularly farmland, under state ownership.
	   The version that was turned down Wednesday would have allowed
limited ownership of farmland, but would have banned its sale from
one private individual to another.
	   Lawmakers rejected the bill in two separate votes Wednesday.
	   Ownership of land in Russia, especially farmland, remains highly
controversial.
	   Since the 1991 Soviet breakup, Russian citizens have been
permitted to own land in urban areas, but agricultural plots mostly
remain state property and are often farmed collectively as in
Soviet times.
	   Communists and their allies argue that if privatization of
farmland is allowed, it would be snapped up by rich Russians and
foreigners who would take it out of agricultural use.
	   In the absence of a Land Code, Yeltsin has been regulating minor
land ownership issues by decree, and several regions have adopted
their own land laws.
	   Last spring, the Volga River region of Saratov held Russia's
first auction of farm land since the Russian revolution in 1917.
Yeltsin praised the auction while parliament condemned it.

British helicopter crash kills three in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two soldiers were killed and
another was injured when a British military helicopter crashed just
outside of a NATO base in Gornji Vakuf, NATO officials said
Wednesday.
	   Capt. Phil Jarvis, 27, and Sgt. David Kinsley, 34, died in the
crash Tuesday afternoon. The third, a British soldier who was not
identified, was seriously injured, NATO said in a press release. No
hometowns of the three were released.
	   The Lynx helicopter, carrying three people, crashed some 70
kilometers (40 miles) west of Sarajevo.
	   ``The crash is now subject to formal military investigation and
there will be no further comment to the cause of the accident until
the investigation is completed,'' said Maj. Keith Jarvis, a NATO
spokesman in Sarajevo.
	   Since NATO deployed the peace force three years ago, 92 members
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic
accidents or landmine blasts.

Jordan unions call for partial boycott of U.S.-British drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian pharmacists and doctors have
called for a partial boycott of U.S.-British drugs in protest
against recent airstrikes on Iraq, the head of the pharmacists'
union said Wednesday.
	   The chairman of the Jordanian Pharmacists Association, Abdul
Rahim Issa, told The Associated Press that his union and the Jordan
Medical Association were urging pharmacists and doctors to boycott
all U.S.-British goods _ including cosmetics and medical equipment
_ except those ``for which no substitute products are available.''
	   ``We shall start our boycott on Wednesday and will continue as
long as the crisis between Iraq, the United States and Britain
continues, until the crisis is solved,'' he said.
	   All practicing doctors and pharmacies in the country are members
of the two associations. However, the boycott call is not legally
binding.
	   Issa said U.S. and British drugs amounted to 20 percent of
Jordan's annual imports of dlrs 110 million worth of medicines.
	   He said the boycott would have no effect on Jordanian patients
as ``local and foreign substitutes'' were usually available. Where
there was no substitute, the boycott would not apply.
	   There was strong public resentment against the four-day attacks
on Iraq by U.S.-British warplanes and missiles last week. Several
protests occurred, culminating in a march by 3,000 people through
the capital, Amman, on Sunday _ the day after the strikes ended.
The Jordanian parliament passed a motion condemning the
bombardment.
	   The United States and Britain undertook the attacks to punish
Baghdad for alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The
inspectors are charged by the Security Council with eliminating
Iraq's banned weapons of mass destruction.

 &UR; Ruckus in Parliament over proposed new state in India &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with parliament ending without passing
patents bill, details. No Pick Up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's lower house of Parliament ended
its winter session Wednesday amid chaotic scenes and vociferous
protests by socialist lawmakers unable to block a bill for creating
a new state.
	   Lawmakers from the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal
could see their fiefdom shrink in Bihar, considered to be India's
most lawless state.
	   The federal government plans to carve out Vananchal from the
mineral-rich tribal area in Bihar.
	   The lawmakers kept up a steady chorus of anti-government chants
in the Lok Sabha, the lawmaking lower house of Parliament,
prompting the speaker to shut down business for several hours
Wednesday morning.
	   The BJP says creating a small state would ensure better
governance of India's poorest state with more manageable
administrative areas. India at present has 26 states and six
federally administered union territories.
	   The bill to carve out Vananchal was introduced in the Lok Sabha
Wednesday despite protests by the socialist parties. A day earlier,
the government had introduced bills to create two more states out
of large states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
	   The disruption in the proceedings scuttled government efforts to
pass a bill to amend India's 1970 patent laws which seeks to
provide exclusive marketing rights in India to foreign agrochemical
and pharmaceutical companies.
	   It will be taken up when parliament meets in February.

Newspapers call for control of mini-van transport industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Newspapers on Wednesday called on
authorities to rein in the private mini-van transport industry
after two people were beaten to death in turf fights.
	   The deaths led to mayhem in downtown Nairobi as drivers and
conductors of the mini-vans, known as ``matatus,'' smashed windows
and attacked pedestrians.
	   A matatu driver was beaten to death Monday by a security guard
after he jumped the line to pick up passengers in a transport
terminus. The guard was arrested.
	   The following day, drivers and conductors attacked and killed a
security guard at another mini-van park.
	   Police spokesman King'ori Mwangi said Wednesday that 18 suspects
had been arrested.
	   Commuters in the Kenyan capital of more than 4 million depend on
matatus for public transport.
	   There are few regular buses, and the British firm, Stagecoach,
that had been operating buses in Kenya, recently pulled out of the
market because of high costs associated with bad roads and poor
maintenance.
	   ``This may very well be the beginning of a total breakdown of
law and order in the Central Business District and elsewhere in the
capital,'' the East African Standard wrote Wednesday, referring to
the mayhem created by matatu crews.
	   The newspaper called on the police to ``reclaim their
authority.''
	   The beating deaths followed on the shooting deaths 10 days ago
of a matatu driver and his conductor by a member of President
Daniel arap Moi's presidential guard, who apparently was annoyed
because the matutu got in his way.
	   The officer was later arrested and charged with murder.
	   Matatu crews went on the rampage then.
	   ``Matatus contribute significantly to easing public transport
problems, but this is not a license to break the law, endanger
passengers' lives and hound other motorists,'' the Daily Nation
wrote. ``Unless stern action is taken now, the matatu problems may
soon become impossible to solve.''
	   Owning and operating a matatu is a lucrative business in Kenya,
and crews earn far more than the average wage of less than a dollar
a day.
	   Authorities periodically try to rein in the industry by imposing
regulations, standard colors, bans on loud music and speed
governors.
	   Owners, drivers and conductors, known as ``touts'' flout them
all.
	   Police spokesman Mwangi said as of Wednesday police have been
posted at matatu stops in Nairobi to protect passengers.

Close associate of Blair resigns after home loan questioned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A close adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair
resigned from the Cabinet Wednesday, following revelations that he
received a home loan from another prominent Labor Party figure.
	   Peter Mandelson, 45, one of the leading strategists of Labor's
1997 landslide election victory, resigned as secretary of trade and
industry, Blair's office said.
	   The resignation came just a day after The Guardian newspaper
disclosed that Mandelson received a loan of 373,000 pounds (dlrs
627,000) in 1996 from fellow legislator Geoffrey Robinson, who is
now the paymaster general.
	   Mandelson did not disclose the loan when he was appointed trade
secretary earlier this year, and informed Blair of the loan last
week, The Guardian said.
	   Some of Robinson's business interests are the subject of two
Department of Trade and Industry investigations.
	   Robinson, 50, has been a generous backer of the Labor Party, and
1996 he bought New Statesman, a weekly political journal which
supports Labor. He had to apologize to the House of Commons for
failing to declare some of his business interests, and has been
criticized by opposition lawmakers for sheltering some of his
assets in offshore trusts which are not subject to British
taxation.
	   ``I should not, with all candor, have entered into the
arrangement,'' Mandelson said in a resignation letter to Blair. ``I
should, having done so, have told you and other colleagues whose
advice I value and I should have told my permanent secretary (the
senior civil servant in the department) on learning of the inquiry
into Geoffrey Robinson, although I entirely stood aside from
this.''
	   It was the second resignation from Blair's Cabinet. Welsh
Secretary Ron Davies resigned as Welsh secretary in November, after
he was robbed in a London area known for homosexual cruising.

Northern Ireland prisoners get Christmas parole
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A protester handcuffed herself
to the exit of the Maze Prison on Wednesday, prepared for a
confrontation with the man who killed her parents and eight other
people.
	   But the Irish Republican Army bomber Sean Kelly, one of 170
prisoners receiving a 10-day Christmas release, left through a
staff door.
	   ``Kelly is an even bigger murdering coward than I thought he
was,'' Michelle Williamson said when she heard he had eluded her.
	   Kelly is serving a life sentence for killing her parents George
and Gillian Williamson and eight other people with a bomb in a
Belfast shop in 1993.
	   Most of the prisoners walked out through a nearby door, avoiding
Ms. Williamson, and Kelly was released at the opposite end of the
prison.
	   Christmas home leave for prisoners has become a tradition in
Northern Ireland, established long before the peace agreement in
April and cease-fires by the main paramilitary groups. The
prisoners on both sides of the conflict have returned voluntarily
to jail since the experiment began in the late 1980s.
	   Michael Stone, a pro-British Loyalist who killed three Catholics
and wounded 60 in a 1988 attack on an IRA funeral, was one of those
released Wednesday.
	   Also on temporary release is Johnny Adair, commander of the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, who began serving a 16-year
sentence in 1995 for directing the random slayings of Catholics.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others found guilty of corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more guilty verdicts; accordingly WIDENS lead

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday found
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and two other former government ministers
guilty of corruption in awarding two defense contracts in the
1980s.
	   It did not immediately sentence Claes, 60, former defense
minister Guy Coeme, 52 or ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, 67. The
court also convicted _ and delayed sentencing for _ Serge Dassault,
75, head of France's Dassault aviation concern, of bribery.
	   Eight others _ former aides and associates _ were to hear later
Wednesday if they are guilty or not.
	   The court said Claes, 60, must have known Italy's Agusta SpA
paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil the awarding of a
December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a summation of the case that took hours to read.
	   He said Claes' and his co-defendants bent the contract tendering
rules to favor Agusta at the expense of France's Aerospatiale SA
which had a valid rival bid for ther helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's payment of 60
million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June, 1989, deal to
equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics involved corruption
and other irregularities at the expense of a rival bid by Litton
Industries Inc. of the United States.
	   The contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.
Claes and the other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2, pleading
innocent.
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to this nation's Dutch
and French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The trial in the 15-judge high court came after the
parliamentary immunity of Claes and the others had been been
lifted. It was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the
1990s, ran their political families out of their wallets,
unhindered by laws banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations.
	   Thus, prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts that Claes and the others simply had to
know they were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991,
presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994.
	   He quit in disgrace 13 months when the investigation into his
role in the Agusta case became increasingly intense making it
untenable for him to remain as head of the western alliance.
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at government expense.

EU approves dlrs 11.1 million for victims of Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union approved Wednesday a
further 9.5 million European currency units (dlrs 11.1 million) in
aid for the four Central American countries devastated by Hurricane
Mitch.
	   The new funds for Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador
will help rebuild homes and provide the population with clean
drinking water to prevent epidemics.
	   ``According to latest estimates, at least 11,000 people died,
and 13,000 are missing'' after Mitch's deadly passage across
Central America in late October, a statement by the EU executive
Commission said.
	   The statement said about 80 percent of basic food crops have
been affected in the four countries hit.
	   The new aid package comes on top of earlier funding by ECHO, the
EU Commission's humanitarian aid office, of nearly 10 million ecu
(dlrs 11.7 million) for victims of Hurricane Mitch.

Russian prime minister says country will pay all debts

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a
visit to Kazakstan, said Wednesday that his country will repay all
its debts, but would need to restructure them because of the
country's economic crisis.
	   ``Russia will not declare default, we have no intention of
declaring default,'' Primakov said in Kazakstan's capital Astana.
``Russia will pay all debts, both internal and external.''
	   But he stressed that the government would seek to reschedule its
obligations. ``Russia is interested in debt restructuring,''
Primakov told reporters.
	   Russia faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall due
next year, but the government has only earmarked dlrs 9.5 billion
for foreign debt servicing and wants to reschedule the remainder
with creditors.
	   After the latest economic crisis hit in August, the government
stopped making payments on dlrs 40 billion worth of treasury bills.
Creditors regarded this as a default, and restructuring
negotiations are still underway.
	   The government badly needs new loans from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders to pay off its debts. It has
included dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans in next year's proposed
budget, although there's no guarantee they will materialize.
	   The World Bank on Tuesday promised to release a dlrs 400 million
loan for repairs and construction on Russia's vast road system, but
said that it wouldn't release dlrs 950 million in promised loans
for economic restructuring, social security and the coal industry
until at least March.
	   The IMF and other lenders say a sound federal budget is a key
condition for granting new loans.
	   Parliament is generally supportive of Primakov's government and
have indicated that the budget could win approval this year without
the lengthy, bitter debates of recent years.
	   However, there are still plenty of opponents.
	   ``The budget stands no chance to win approval in its current
shape,'' Eduard Rossel, the governor of the industrial
Yekaterinburg region in the Ural Mountains, told a news conference
Wednesday.
	   He ruled out a quick passage of the budget, saying the
government will have to listen to regional leaders who don't want
to see their share of the budget cut. s' demands.
	   Also Wednesday, Russia's parliament again turned down a proposed
land code that would have allowed increased land sales, including
the sale of some farmland.
	   President Boris Yeltsin supported the measure, but the
Communists and other hard-liners in parliament want to keep most
land, and farm land in particular, in state hands.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov held talks with Kazak President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and agreed to increase the amount of Kazak oil going
through Russian territory and reduce Russian railway tariffs for
Kazak goods.
	   ``There are no problems in relations between Russia and
Kazakstan,'' Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev said after
meeting with Primakov.
	   Relations are generally good, despite some tension in the past
over the alleged discrimination against ethnic Russians in
Kazakstan and a dispute over mutual debts.

One dead, three wounded in Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two shootouts in Kosovo have left
one man dead and wounded three others, Serbian sources reported
Wednesday, in continuing violence that threatens to revive the
all-out war in the secessionist province.
	   The continuing spiral of violence, with killings and heavy
injuries almost daily, threatens to revive war between secessionist
ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces that killed more than
1,000 people from February to October and forced another 300,000
from their homes.
	   On Tuesday night, an unidentified gunman opened fire in an
Albanian-owned bar in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica,
wounding two ethnic Albanians, the Serb-run Media Center said.
	   One of the men, Naser Haziri, 22, was shot in the head and died
Wednesday at a hospital in the provincial capital, Pristina. The
other, Lulzim Ademi, 20, a Kosovo Albanian known for his loyalty to
the Serbian authorities was shot in the back, the center reported.
	   Also Tuesday, assailants opened fire with machine guns on two
Serbian police officers in their car in a Pristina suburb, the
center said.
	   On Oct. 12 President Slobodan Milosevic, under threat of NATO
airstrikes, pledged to reduce government troops here and allow
deployment of 2,000 foreign peace verifiers.
	   But the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army has been
stridently opposed to any plan short of independence for the
majority Albanian province, while the Serbs have been reluctant to
pull out of Kosovo.
	   In Pristina, 26 ethnic Albanians were to go on trial Wednesday,
charged with ``terrorism and hostile activity against the state''
in three armed attacks. Nine of the men have been in custody since
June, while the others will be tried in absentia.
	   The Albanians' defense lawyer, Rexhep Haxhimusa, was quoted by
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore as saying that the trial was
political and staged.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the international verifiers, William
Walker, suggested his team was being impeded and blamed the
Belgrade authorities for failing to cooperate. Walker also blamed
ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the cease-fire agreement and
carrying out provocative missions.
	   The same day, the KLA warned they would go for all-out war
unless Serb police pull out of central parts of the province.
	   The threat came as U.S. officials met with the guerilla
organization's top commanders in an apparent effort to resuscitate
the October truce and pave the way for negotiations on the Serbian
province's future.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday found
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and two other former government ministers
guilty of corruption in awarding two defense contracts in the
1980s.
	   It gave Claes, 60, and former defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
each a three-year suspended jail term.
	   It also convicted former premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge
Dassault, 75, head of France's Dassault aviation concern, of

State denies Banana death threats

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Prosecutors said Wednesday former
President Canaan Banana should be imprisoned after being convicted
of sodomy and homosexual assault, and dismissed his claims that his
life was in danger.
	   Banana, 63, fled Zimbabwe in November upon being convicted on 11
gay sex charges. He claimed when he returned from South Africa on
Dec. 15 that he had fled because his life was in danger from
political opponents in the government.
	   ``We don't accept this whatsoever, we challenge it totally,''
said chief prosecutor Augustine Chikumira.
	   Chikumira asked to cross-examine Banana in the High Court on his
allegations, but Banana refused to testify, defense lawyer Chris
Andersen said.
	   Andersen said Banana had the right to do so. The attorney said
Banana did not want to divulge sensitive information involving high
level contacts between South Africa and Zimbabwe. Banana returned
to Zimbabwe after President Robert Mugabe and South African
President Nelson Mandela had discussed his case.
	   Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku ordered Banana to remain under house
arrest at his luxury Harare mansion until sentencing on Jan. 18.
	   Banana faces a fine or imprisonment on convictions of sodomy and
homosexual assault and ``unnatural acts'' with men mostly on his
staff when he served as ceremonial president after independence in
1980 until 1987.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe.
	   Chikimura asked that Banana be sentenced to prison.
	   ``This is not an appropriate case for a fine,'' Chikumira told
the court.
	   ``The state does not want his head, but he must receive his just
desserts.''
	   Chikumira said there was no maximum prison term for Banana's
offenses but cited similar cases where sexual assault _ both
homosexual and heterosexual _
	   that fell short of rape received jail terms of up to three years
with hard labor.
	   Andersen said Banana, a Methodist minister, professor of
theology and former diplomat, returned home voluntarily to face his
sentence and urged the court to impose a fine in recognition of his
``meritorious conduct in public office.'' Banana also served as a
mediator in an armed rebellion in Zimbabwe in the early 1980s and
in the Liberian civil war.
	   There has been speculation Banana could be pardoned. Chikumira
acknowledged that ``political considerations'' were in play.
	   ``They must be considered by politicians and I would rather
leave it to them,'' he told the judge.

After bout with flu, pope holds briefer than usual audience

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Looking wan after a bout with the flu, Pope
John Paul II on Wednesday held a general audience much briefer than
usual.
	   And apparently to allow himself more time to rest on the eve of
one of his longest work days -- his Christmas Eve midnight Mass
will keep him up till the wee hours of Friday -- the 78-year-old
pontiff broke with his tradition of meeting separately with fellow
Poles.
	   With the aid of a cane, John Paul walked very slowly in to Paul
VI auditorium at the start of his customary weekly audience with
the public. His speech and greetings in several languages were
among the shortest in recent years for the Wednesday appearance. In
all the audience lasted about 50 minutes, about half the length of
his usual meetings with the public.
	   Last Friday, the pope canceled private appointments because of
what the Vatican said was a light flu accompanied by fever, but he
was back in the public eye on Sunday with a brief appearance from
his studio window to bless pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's
Square.
	   During his 20-year-old pontificate, John Paul has met a few days
before Christmas with fellow Poles, to sing Polish carols and to
break the ``oplatek,'' a traditional Polish wafer bread.
	   But this time, the Poles were blended into the pilgrims at
Wednesday's general audience instead of having the
eagerly-anticipated personal session with the pope.
	   ``I thank all those who took part in this meeting and I embrace
with my prayer all our homeland,'' John Paul said in Polish.
	   John Paul expressed hope that people would learn, from Baby
Jesus, ``goodness and sensibility. Let us learn responsibility for
the fate of every man and of every human life.''
	   ``Dear brothers and sisters, I make for each of you and for your
loved ones fervent wishes for a happy and holy Christmas,'' John
Paul said.
	   John Paul no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest after midnight
Mass Christmas Eve.
	   However, he is scheduled to keep up his tradition of reading to
the public in St. Peter's Square a Christmas message and giving
holiday greetings in dozens of languages at noon on Christmas.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a hilltown outside Rome.

U.N. peacekeeping troops to stay in Central African Republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ The United Nations has
extended a peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic
until next December to strengthen a fragile peace in the country,
U.N. officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.N. troops will help restructure the country's military,
which has staged three major rebellions against President
Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   In the wake of parliamentary elections that weakened the ruling
party earlier this month, the military appears more divided before
between loyalists and opponents of Patasse.
	   U.N. officials said Wednesday that the rival groups clashed on
Monday in barracks in the capital of Bangui. No casualties were
reported.
	   The Security Council authorized the peacekeeping mission in
March to replace French troops who had been in the country to help
enforce a peace agreement.
	   Election figures from the second round of staggered voting were
released by the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, indicating the
ruling Movement for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique
won 47 seats in a parliament of 109. A coalition of several
opposition parties control 29 seats after the two rounds of voting,
the court said.
	   The remaining seats belong to a variety of independent
candidates or smaller opposition groups, which may now play a key
role in helping either the MLPC or the opposition coalition control
the legislative branch of government.
	   The election is seen as an important effort to stabilize the
Central African Republic, which has been wracked by ethnic and
factional violence since independence more than three decades ago.
	   Patasse's position is not affected by the vote and presidential
elections are not immediately planned.

Chemical weapons experts confirm destruction of cult's gas factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Chemical weapons monitors
confirmed Wednesday that Japan has destroyed a factory used by a
doomsday cult to make nerve gas used in the 1995 attack on Tokyo's
subway system.
	   The sarin gas attack, carried out by the shadowy Aum Shinri Kyo
cult, killed 12 people and sickened thousands.
	   Investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons oversaw the destruction earlier this month of the
high-tech plant at a commune near Mount Fuji.
	   ``This was a spectacular operation because it is the destruction
of a facility which has caused harm and victims,'' said OPCW
spokesman Donato Kiniger-Passigli.
	   OPCW officials declined to give details of the nature of the
machinery and chemicals removed or destroyed by Japanese officials
and would not say how much sarin was stored at the plant.
	   But the organization's inspectorate director, former Japanese
Army officer Ichiro Akiyama, confirmed that the cult's gas factory
was a highly professional operation.
	   ``The technology they are using is quite advanced,'' he said,
adding that only about six Japanese Army officers know how to make
sarin.
	   Akiyama said that the Japanese cleanup of the site was so
thorough that vegetables could safely be planted there now.
	   Much of the laboratory and production equipment from the plant
in Kamikuishiki, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, was removed for use as evidence in criminal trials against
cult members.
	   Cultists, including top guru Shoko Asahara, are on trial on
charges including the subway gassing as well as other gassings,
murders and other crimes.
	   The OPCW oversees the U.N.-brokered Chemical Weapons Convention
which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of
chemical weapons.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Two men suspected of sabotaging train
tracks in an attempt to extort 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million)
from the German railway have been arrested, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Authorities had been chasing the blackmailers for weeks amid a
growing holiday-season scare for railway passengers and employees.
Air force reconnaissance planes, helicopters and 400 extra border
police were called out last weekend to patrol rail lines.
	   The suspects, one of them reportedly a former railway worker,
were blamed for three attacks since late November on rail lines
around Berlin.
	   The most serious caused a cargo train to derail last Friday. No
one was hurt but damage estimates were in the millions.
	   After that accident, rail officials revealed they had received
four letters since Nov. 23 demanding money.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Ulrich Kersten, head of the
Federal Criminal Police Office in Wiesbaden, said the decision was
made to go public with the threats in an attempt to re-establish
contact with the extortionists, which had broken off.
	   The main suspect, identified only as a 46-year-old German from
the eastern state of Saxony, called German rail headquarters in
Frankfurt that same day and again on Saturday, Kersten said.
	   A ransom drop was arranged for Tuesday night at an autobahn rest
area in Bavaria, where the suspect was arrested by federal agents,
including members of an anti-terrorist squad.
	   After the arrest, Kersten said the suspect confessed to the
three sabotage acts and threatened to allow bombs planted in train
stations in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and Hamburg to explode.
	   Those stations were temporarily closed and searched, causing
headaches for travelers, but no bombs were found.
	   A 44-year-old man suspected of also being involved in the plot
was arrested Wednesday morning in his apartment in Chemnitz, a city
in Saxony, Kersten said.
	   The two men had been in trouble before for extortion, he added.
	   German Transport Minister Franz Muentefering voiced relief at
the arrests, calling them ``reassuring news for the safety of all
train travelers at Christmas time.''
	   The cargo train, carrying paper rolls, derailed Friday near
Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Berlin, after someone
loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No one was hurt.
	   Officials believe the tools used were stolen from the railway.
	   Also linked to the extortion was a similar attack that forced a
high-speed ICE passenger train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into
an emergency stop on Dec. 8.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Looking wan after a bout with the flu, Pope
John Paul II on Wednesday held a general audience much briefer than
usual.
	   And apparently to allow himself more time to rest on the eve of
one of his longest work days -- his Christmas Eve midnight Mass
will keep him up till the wee hours of Friday -- the 78-year-old
pontiff broke with his tradition of meeting separately with fellow
Poles.
	   With the aid of a cane, John Paul walked very slowly in to Paul
VI auditorium at the start of his customary weekly audience with
the public. His speech and greetings in several languages were
among the shortest in recent years for the Wednesday appearance. In
all the audience lasted about 50 minutes, about half the length of
his usual meetings with the public.
	   Last Friday, the pope canceled private appointments because of
what the Vatican said was a light flu accompanied by fever, but he
was back in the public eye on Sunday with a brief appearance from
his studio window to bless pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's
Square.
	   During his 20-year-old pontificate, John Paul has met a few days
before Christmas with fellow Poles, to sing Polish carols and to
break the ``oplatek,'' a traditional Polish wafer bread.
	   But this time, the Poles were blended into the pilgrims at
Wednesday's general audience instead of having the
eagerly-anticipated personal session with the pope.
	   ``I thank all those who took part in this meeting and I embrace
with my prayer all our homeland,'' John Paul said in Polish.
	   John Paul expressed hope that people would learn, from Baby
Jesus, ``goodness and sensibility. Let us learn responsibility for
the fate of every man and of every human life.''
	   ``Dear brothers and sisters, I make for each of you and for your
loved ones fervent wishes for a happy and holy Christmas,'' John
Paul said.
	   John Paul no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest after midnight
Mass Christmas Eve.
	   However, he is scheduled to keep up his tradition of reading to
the public in St. Peter's Square a Christmas message and giving
holiday greetings in dozens of languages at noon on Christmas.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a hilltown outside Rome.

Ukrainian court revokes ruling against opposition paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out an
earlier ruling that ordered a newspaper to pay a large sum in moral
damages to the country's interior minister.
	   The Supreme Court ordered the Starokievsky district court in
Kiev to reconsider the minister's lawsuit against the daily
Kievskie Vedomosti, the independent UNIAN news agency said.
	   The Supreme Court said the judge in the earlier case made
several unspecified violations during the hearing. It was not clear
when the new hearing would start.
	   Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko sued the newspaper following
the publication of articles last year that alleged he had bought an
expensive car out of public funds set up to help families of
policemen killed in the line of duty.
	   The Starokievsky court ruled that the publication stained
Kravchenko's dignity and honor, and ordered Vedomosti to pay him 5
million hryvna (dlrs 2.5 million at the time) for the damage.
	   It also ordered two journalists who wrote the articles to pay
the minister 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 10,000) and 7,000 hryvna (dlrs
3,500), respectively.
	   Wednesday's ruling was the latest in a series of cases involving
Ukraine's opposition media, which has lost in most instances.
	   Two opposition papers, Vseukrainskie Vedomosti and Politika,
have closed down this year.
	   The former lost a libel suit to a businessman and politician,
and the latter had its registration revoked after a court ruled it
had revealed unspecified state secrets.
	   Opposition newspapers in Ukraine have often alleged harassment
by authorities. But government officials say the fault lies with
the newspapers and accuses them of publishing libelous materials.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed
Yassin was freed Wednesday by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
from nearly two months of house arrest.
	   The move is likely to heighten tensions between the Palestinians
and Israel, coming as the two sides accuse each other of violations
of the now-stalled Wye River land-for-security accord.
	   A spokesman for Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said the group welcomed
the decision to free Yassin.

	   Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight
Islamic militants like Hamas. Word of Yassin's release drew new
criticism from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority has to decide whether it wants to
meet its commitments to fight Hamas terror and move the peace
process forward or turn a blind eye to the terrorist activities of
the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said.
	   The frail, ailing Yassin, who uses a wheelchair, was not
expected to make any public appearances until later in the week,
Hamas sources said.
	   With the lifting of the house arrest, he was expected to receive
a few close associates. During his house arrest, he was prevented
from receiving visitors.
	   Yassin was put under house arrest on Oct. 29, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli children. The attack came only six days
after the signing of the Wye River accord.
	   Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his following, was
one of Arafat's strongest steps yet against Hamas. At one point, in
a leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded his release
and made a rare direct threat against Arafat.
	   The radical group opposes any peace with Israel and has carried
out more than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several years.

Italian premier denies plans to expel Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's premier on Wednesday denied reports that his
center-left government was involved in negotiations to send Turkish
Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah Ocalan to a third country, saying the
leader was free to go where he pleased.
	   Italian and Turkish newspapers in recent days have been filled
with reports claiming Ocalan, whose detention here Nov. 12 created
an international incident, was about to be kicked out of Italy.
	   The list of countries mentioned include Estonia, South Africa,
Libya, Pakistan and South Africa.
	   But Premier Massimo D'Alema said a ruling by Rome's appeals
court last week to lift all restrictions on Ocalan made him free to
choose his own destiny.
	   ``The most probable outcome is that Ocalan will leave the
country,'' D'Alema said during a year-end news conference. ``But
for this to happen Ocalan must decide on his own.''
	   D'Alema insisted that there were ``no negotiations of any kind
underway'' to find a country which would take Ocalan.
	   Corriere della Sera daily on Wednesday quoted an Italian
Communist lawmaker who had met with Ocalan as saying the Kurd was
refusing to leave Italy unless he was guaranteed a safe haven
elsewhere.
	   Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, had
requested political asylum in Italy.
	   Italian RAI state television, however, said Ocalan's departure
was a matter of hours or at the most, days.
	   Ocalan's arrival in Italy on a flight from Moscow unleashed a
political and legal battle with Turkey, which wants him extradited
so he can be tried on terrorism charges.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan citing Italian laws that
prevent the extradition of suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey.
	   Earlier this week a Rome magistrate indicated that Ocalan could
be extradited for crimes that do not carry the death penalty.
D'Alema said it was up to the courts to decide on the matter and
insisted that Italy would ``fully abide'' its laws.
	   Italy's refusal to extradite Ocalan angered the Turkish
government and people, prompting unofficial boycotts of Italian
goods.
	   On Wednesday, D'Alema said the ``tensions'' with Turkey had been
``overcome'' and expressed optimism about a solution to the
impasse.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group
began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

NATO commander for Europe warns of escalating Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO's top commander for Europe,
American Gen. Wesley Clark, warned Wednesday of escalating violence
in Serbia's turbulent Kosovo province.
	   ``We are watching the situation very closely and we are seeing
increasingly aggressive Serb military and police activities,''
Clark told reporters after meeting Macedonian authorities in the
capital, Skopje.
	   NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe said these activities
were ``not in conformation with the promises made by the Yugoslav
government'' and that the matter causes great concern for the
international community.
	   ``We are calling on all parties, including the (Kosovo) Albanian
parties, to refrain from violence,'' Clark said after his meeting
with Macedonia Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
	   Clark reiterated that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
top military commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must
comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   Clark flew to Macedonia from Brussels on a brief visit to the
alliance's 1,800-strong Extraction Force, deployed here for the
purpose of rescuing unarmed international monitors in Kosovo,
should they come in harm's way.
	   Two months ago, Milosevic pledged _ under the threat of NATO
airstrikes _ to reduce his government troops in the southern
Serbian province that borders Macedonia and allow deployment of
unarmed peace verifiers in Kosovo.
	   But a continuing spiral of violence threatens to unravel
Kosovo's tenuous October truce.
	   ``I came here to visit the facilities ... and also to thank the
Macedonian government for its very warm hospitality and support for
the NATO mission,'' Clark said.
	   He was due to inspect NATO's Extraction Force facilities in the
northern town of Kumanovo and visit about 500 American soldiers.
	   The Americans are part of a UN mission deployed in Macedonia
since 1992 to prevent the conflict within former Yugoslavia from
spreading to the vulnerable area.
	   Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 _ the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

Government approves recruitment of 40,000 militias in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government has approved a military
plan to recruit civilians to help police fight crime in Indonesia,
an official said Wednesday.
	   Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah said 40,000 civilians
would be recruited in January and would be trained in all military
training centers across the country.
	   He said Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto has reported the plan to
a meeting of Cabinet ministers dealing with security and political
affairs.
	   ``The government has given its approval to the plan,'' Yosfiah
said after the Cabinet meeting, presided over by President B.J.
Habibie.
	   Yosfiah said the recruits would undergo four-month training
until April.
	   ``Their task is to help the Indonesian police in safeguarding
the people's environment, especially during the meetings of the
People's Assembly,' Yosfiah said.
	   He reasserted that the civilian militias would only help police
instead of ``defending the state.''
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto had suggested the controversial plan
following near-daily protests in Jakarta and other cities mainly by
students pressing for swifter democratic reform.
	   Under the plan, as many 200,000 young, unemployed people might
eventually be recruited for the group, dubbed ``Ratih,'' an acronym
for ``Rakyat Terlatih,'' or trained people. They would be equipped
with sticks, riot shields and handcuffs and will have powers of
arrest.
	   Government critics and human rights activists have criticized
the plan to establish a militia, arguing that the deployment of
thousands of young men in the streets would only exacerbate unrest.
	   There are fears of more unrest as newly formed political parties
jostle for influence ahead of general elections scheduled for June.
	   Justice Minister Muladi has said that the government has drafted
a law, to be submitted to Parliament next month, that would allow
their formation.
	   Indonesia is facing political uncertainty since Habibie took
office in May, replacing President Suharto, who was forced from
office by widespread protests over his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie has been implementing political reforms, but students
say he is not moving fast enough, and some still considered his
administration as merely continuation of his predecessor.
	   Student have often clashed with security forces during rallies
to demand the trial of Suharto for alleged corruption and the end
of the military's political role.

Memorial service held for Tojo, hanged war criminals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A half-century after they were hanged by the
Allies, wartime Japanese leader Hideki Tojo and six other convicted
war criminals were quietly honored Wednesday in a memorial service
in Tokyo.
	   More than 600 people gathered for a three-hour service at the
Kudan Kaikan hall in downtown Tokyo, a hall spokesman said. The
memorial was sponsored by a group planning to build a permanent
hall for those executed.
	   Participants sang the Japanese national anthem and offered a
one-minute prayer for the souls of the war dead at the start of the
ceremony, which included statements by Tojo's granddaughter, Kyodo
News agency reported.
	   As Japan's prime minister from 1941 to 1944, Tojo authorized the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. After Japan's surrender in 1945,
Tojo and six other top leaders were found guilty of war crimes in
the Tokyo trials and hanged on Dec. 23, 1948.
	   While Tojo is widely reviled abroad as a symbol of Tokyo's
brutal rule over a wide swath of Asia and its war against the
Allies, he is a more ambiguous figure at home.
	   A popular film released in May depicted him as a gentle family
man who went to war in self-defense _ a popular notion among
right-wing activists and revisionist academics who say Japan should
not be ashamed of its past.
	   Officials from the Showa Memorial Hall Preparation Committee,
which sponsored Wednesday's service, were not available, but a
phone message machine at their official urged ``any Japanese who
loves Japan'' to come to the memorial.
	   The conservative Sankei Shimbun newspaper reported Tuesday that
Tojo's granddaughter, Yuko Tojo, is working to build a memorial
hall to the executed war criminals to reestablish their
reputations.
	   ``I would like to hand over from generation to generation the
historical facts which are not being taught at school,'' Yuko Tojo
was quoted as saying by the Sankei.
	   Still, Tojo and the other war criminals symbolize times that
many in Japan would rather forget.
	   National broadcaster NHK made no mention of the memorial on
Wednesday, which was also a national holiday to honor Emperor
Akihito's birthday. Kyodo News carried a report on its
English-language service, but had no story in Japanese.

Sudanese parliament re-elects Turabi as speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's lawmakers on Wednesday
re-nominated the country's most influential politician as
Parliament speaker, two days after he had resigned to work full
time for the ruling party.
	   Members in the 400-seat National Assembly unanimously supported
Hassan Turabi by a voice vote, backing his nomination by calls of
``Allahu Akbar'' or ``God is great.'' Turabi did not attend the
house.
	   If he accepts the nomination as expected, he will hold the post
until the end of the Parliament's term in April 2000.
	   Turabi had submitted his resignation to the house on Monday,
saying he wanted to devote all his time to the ruling National
Congress Party at a time when Sudan is making tentative moves
toward a multi-party system from Jan. 1.
	   Turabi's re-nomination took place without any hitch.
	   Deputy Speaker Alison Manani Magaya opened the session by asking
for nominations to fill the speaker's post. Another deputy speaker,
Abdul-Aziz Shidou, proposed Turabi's name. No other name was
proposed and the proceedings were called to an end.
	   Magaya, the deputy speaker, then told the legislators: ``Dr.
Turabi could resume his post anytime he wants.''
	   On Tuesday, Sudan's Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha had
called on legislators to respect Turabi's wish to resign. Taha said
his call was endorsed by President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Under a new law el-Bashir's government will on Jan. 1 legalize
political groups that may contest elections.
	   El-Bashir had banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup. He, however, said recently that the door
was open for opposition figures in exile to come back and form
political associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish. Political analysts
interpreted Turabi's resignation as a government attempt to ease
those fears.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the opposition on his
re-nomination.
	   There were also some apprehension about the law, which only
speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi was strongly opposed
to some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut reference to
``political parties.''

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others found guilty of corruption

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more guilty verdicts; Claes getting 3
year suspended sentence &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The supreme court on Wednesday found
ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and two other former government ministers
guilty of corruption in awarding two defense contracts in the
1980s.
	   It gave Claes, 60, a three-year suspended jail term and former
defense minister Guy Coeme, 52, a two-year suspended sentence.
	   It also convicted former premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge
Dassault, 75, head of France's Dassault aviation concern, of
corruption but did not immediately announce sentences.
	   Eight others _ former aides and associates _ were to hear later
Wednesday if they are guilty or not.
	   The court said Claes, 60, must have known Italy's Agusta SpA
paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil the awarding of a
December 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a decision that took hours to read.
	   He said Claes' and his co-defendants bent the rules to favor
Agusta at the expense of France's Aerospatiale SA in a helicopter
contract award.
	   The court also found that Dassault Aviation SA's payment of 60
million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) constituted corruption _ to win
a June 1989 deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics to
beat out U.S.-based Litton Industries Inc. in the bidding.
	   Each contracts was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Claes
and the other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2, pleading
innocent.
	   Agusta and Dassault paid bribes to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The trial in the 15-judge high court came after the
parliamentary immunity of Claes and the others had been lifted. It
was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the 1990s, ran
their political families out of their wallets, unhindered by laws
banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989 that Belgium outlawed such donations.
	   Thus, prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts that Claes and the others simply had to
know they were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991,
presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO secretary-general in September 1994.
	   He quit in disgrace 13 months later when the Augusta
investigation made it untenable for him to lead the western
alliance.
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
Spitaels, the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of
French-speaking socialists.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed
Yassin was freed Wednesday by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
from nearly two months of house arrest.
	   Outside Yassin's house in a slum neighborhood of Gaza City, a
crowd of rejoicing followers surrounded the frail, ailing sheik in
his wheelchair, kissing and greeting him.
	   Yassin's release is likely to heighten tensions between the
Palestinians and Israel, coming as the two sides accuse each other
of violations of the now-stalled Wye River land-for-security
accord.
	   Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight
Islamic militants like Hamas, and word of Yassin's release drew new
criticism from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority has to decide whether it wants to
meet its commitments to fight Hamas terror and move the peace
process forward or turn a blind eye to the terrorist activities of
the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said.
	   A spokesman for Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said the group welcomed
the decision to free Yassin.
	   Yassin was put under house arrest on Oct. 29, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli children. The attack came only six days
after the signing of the Wye River accord.
	   Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his following, was
one of Arafat's strongest steps yet against Hamas. At one point, in
a leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded his release
and made a rare direct threat against Arafat.
	   The radical group opposes any peace with Israel and has carried
out more than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several years.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Anglo American Platinum Corp.,
or Amplats, the world's largest refiner of platinum, said Wednesday
that a strike begun by a quarter of its workforce has had only a
``minimal effect on production.''
	   Members of the National Union of Mineworkers downed tools
Wednesday after 11th-hour talks to salvage a new wage and working
conditions pact failed late Tuesday.
	   The key stumbling block remains acceptance of an arbitrator
agreeable to the NUM and Amplats management, said Steve Calladine,
a company spokesman.
	   Calladine said trying to secure the services of an arbitrator
during the Christmas holiday period has proved difficult, but he is
hopeful a mutually acceptable candidate could be found within the
next 24-48 hours.
	   The NUM represents approximately 10,000 workers of a company
roster of 40,000. The striking workers are centered at Amplats'
mining and smelting operations.
	   The two sides also are divided on wage increases.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A 36-year-old woman was beaten
to death after disclosing she was HIV positive, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Gugu Dlamini was beaten last Saturday in KwaMancinza, a town in
eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 20 to 30 percent
of the population has HIV or AIDS. She died of her injuries in the
hospital, The Star reported.
	   Dlamini had publicly disclosed she her HIV status at an AIDS
awareness gathering. Details on when the gathering took place were
not immediately available, and it was unclear if the murder was
directly linked to her disclosure.
	   However, some officials saw a linkage.
	   ``It could be one of our most devastating setbacks in our fight
against AIDS if it prevents people from going out and telling their
partners their status and advising others on how to live with the
disease,'' Health Department spokesman Dave McGlew was quoted as
saying in the Johannesburg newspaper.
	   Dlamini is survived by a 13-year-old daughter.
	   --
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ The United Nations has
extended a peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic
until next December to strengthen a fragile peace in the country,
U.N. officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.N. troops will help restructure the country's military,
which has staged three major rebellions against President
Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   In the wake of parliamentary elections that weakened the ruling
party earlier this month, the military appears more divided before
between loyalists and opponents of Patasse.
	   U.N. officials said Wednesday that the rival groups clashed on
Monday in barracks in the capital of Bangui. No casualties were
reported.
	   The Security Council authorized the peacekeeping mission in
March to replace French troops who had been in the country to help
enforce a peace agreement.
	   Election figures from the second round of staggered voting were
released by the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, indicating the
ruling Movement for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique
won 47 seats in a parliament of 109. A coalition of several
opposition parties control 29 seats after the two rounds of voting,
the court said.
	   The remaining seats belong to a variety of independent
candidates or smaller opposition groups, which may now play a key
role in helping either the MLPC or the opposition coalition control
the legislative branch of government.
	   The election is seen as an important effort to stabilize the
Central African Republic, which has been wracked by ethnic and
factional violence since independence more than three decades ago.
	   Patasse's position is not affected by the vote and presidential
elections are not immediately planned.

Int'l monitors hail Dutch-Russian destruction cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ International monitors on
Wednesday welcomed an agreement under which Dutch experts will help
Russia to destroy part of its decaying arsenal of Cold War chemical
weapons.
	   The Dutch government has pledged to donate 10 million guilders
(dlrs 5.3 million) to help fund a project to destroy 6,500 metric
tons of poison that has been stored since the 1950s at a depot in
Kambarka, 1,200 kilometers (744 miles) east of Moscow in the Udmurt
Republic.
	   Serguei Batsanov of The Hague-based Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said the Dutch gesture should
prompt other governments to help Russia destroy its 40,000 tons of
chemical weapons _ the world's largest such stockpile.
	   While Russian authorities have said the destruction is a
priority, they add that they cannot afford to complete the task
themselves.
	   ``While welcoming this particular agreement, the director
general believes it would be a good example for other countries
which have not yet joined this cooperation process to follow
suit,'' Batsanov said.
	   Under the agreement, a Dutch expert from the Defense Ministry
will oversee the delicate operation to destroy arsenic-based
lewisite poison gas.
	   Russian officials say they expect foreign money to cover about
dlrs 1 billion of the estimated dlrs 6 billion cost of destroying
their chemical weapons.

Prosecutor General asks court to invalidate referendum that
</HEADLINE>
abolished monarchy
 &UR; With AP Photo &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's top prosecutor appealed to the
country's constitutional court to throw out a referendum to abolish
the monarchy passed 52 years ago, state media reported.
	   Bulgarian Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev appealed to the 12
judges of the constitutional court to invalidate the 1946 law that
called for the referendum. He argued the law was against the
constitution then and still is now, as neither envisaged the
possibility to be amended by a referendum.
	   It was not immediately clear when the court, which is empowered
to review legislation, would rule. Also not clear is whether a
possible invalidation of the law would directly resurrect monarchy.
	   Tatarchev's move coincided with a meeting between Bulgaria's
President Petar Stoyanov and the country's former king Simeon II,
who is visiting his homeland for Christmas and New Year.
	   ``I will probably have to tell you something at the end of my
stay here, but now I can just wish you a merry Christmas,'' Simeon
told state radio after the meeting.
	   In the ceremonial hall of his office, Stoyanov showed the king
Bulgaria's new coat of arms, on which the royal regalia _ a crown
and three crowned lions _ have been restored half a century after
being abolished by communists. No further details of hour-long
discussions were disclosed.
	   The referendum was organized by the communists, who the Soviet
army installed in 1944, and held while Soviet troops were present
in Bulgaria. Critics of the referendum say it was rigged and
illegal.
	   Supporters say it reflected wide public resentment to monarchy
because of its role in allying Bulgaria with Nazi Germany in World
War II and persecuting anti-Nazi resisters.
	   Simeon, 61, acceded to the throne at the age of six in 1943,
when his father Boris III died shortly after making Bulgaria a
German ally. He reigned under regencies until the 1946 referendum,
after which he and his family were exiled.
	   Although the vast majority of modern Bulgarians feel republican,
Simeon commands wide respect for his non-partisan behavior and
European touch. They received the former monarch, now a
businessman, living in Madrid, Spain, with a tumultuous welcome
during two brief visits to his homeland in 1996 and 1997.

Israeli police target prostitution ring using illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police said Wednesday they had
uncovered a crime ring that snared couples that had illegally
immigrated from Ukraine, forcing the women to work as prostitutes
and the men to engage in criminal activities.
	   Gang members working in the Ukraine were obtaining passports
from Jewish couples who did not intend to go to Israel and forging
them for use by other couples, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin.
	   When those couples arrived in Israel, ringleaders here would
force them to go to work for the gang. The crime ring also
fraudulently collected government subsidies for new immigrants, the
police spokeswoman said.
	   On Wednesday, police arrested a man and woman in the northern
city of Haifa for involvement with the gang. The woman had been
trying to flee the prostitution ring, Menuhin said.
	   She said more arrests were expected.
	   Stories about sex slavery in Israel began surfacing shortly
after the mass immigration of Soviet Jews began in 1989, eventually
bringing nearly 800,000 newcomers to Israel.
	   Russian-based crime gangs used the influx of immigrants as a
cover for sneaking in an estimated 10,000 prostitutes over the past
decade. The sex trade has grown into a dlrs 450-million-a year
business, with women often finding themselves virtually enslaved by
crime bosses.

Two state radio journalists held for treason in Congo

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Two state radio broadcasters were
recently arrested in the Congo, bringing to 10 the number of
journalists imprisoned in the war-torn Central African country, a
press freedom group said Wednesday.
	   Yvette Idi Lupantsha, a news anchorwoman, and Risasi Gisonga, an
editor for the state-owned Radio-Television National du Congo were
arrested on December 19, the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists said in a letter to Congo's President Laurent Kabila.
	   By Wednesday, neither had been released. Idi is the first female
journalist detained in the country.
	   At least 67 journalists have been arrested or received death
threats from the government since Kabila took power in May last
year, the CPJ said.
	   ``This multitude of press freedom violations demonstrates a
blatant disregard for the most basic standards of free expression
established by international law,'' the letter said.
	   Both Idi and Risasi were accused by the government of being
``traitors to the republic'' colluding with the United States over
broadcasting their opinions about a press conference held by
Kabila.
	   The CPJ said it regarded the journalists' arrests as violations
of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African
Charter of Human and People's Rights, both of which Congo has
signed.
	   Confronted by growing economic problems and a rebellion in
eastern Congo that has drawn in at least six other countries,
Kabila's military has instituted a press crackdown by jailing,
deporting and assaulting foreign and local journalists who
disseminate stories unfavorable to the government. Political
opponents of Kabila have also been summarily jailed and tortured.

Austrian president marries former aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrians received an early Christmas
present from their president Wednesday _ a new first lady.
	   After weeks of speculation as to when and where Thomas Klestil
would marry his former aide, Margot Loeffler, the president
surprised Austria with an unannounced private ceremony Wednesday at
Vienna City Hall.
	   In the past few weeks, speculation as to where Klestil and
Loeffler would marry was the talk of Vienna's tabloids. Wednesday's
ceremony was not disclosed in advance and no guests attended, the
Austria Press Agency reported.
	   The couple's relations have been widely published, since
Klestil's former wife, Edith, walked out of the presidential palace
on New Year's Eve 1993 after 40 years of marriage. It was rumored
that Klestil's relationship with Loeffler had caused the breakup.
	   Nevertheless, the president won a second six-year term in the
largely ceremonial post last April, defeating four challengers with
63 percent of the vote. In September, he finalized his divorce.
	   The 44-year-old Loeffler first met Klestil in the 1980s and
later worked as his office manager during his first two years in
office. In 1994, she transferred to the foreign ministry.
	   Klestil, 66, is a career diplomat widely credited with helping
restore Austria's credibility, which was damaged by the controversy
over the Nazi German wartime service of his predecessor, Kurt
Waldheim.

Junior high school boy arrested in murder of woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday on
suspicion of stabbing an 80-year-old woman to death with a kitchen
knife in an attempted robbery, police said.
	   The boy told police investigators that he first threw a stone
against the front door of Miyoshi Moriyama's residence at 5:30 a.m.
Tuesday, an official said.
	   When Moriyama opened the door, the boy went into the house and
stabbed her, said a police official at Neyagawa, western Japan,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the boy tried to take money from Moriyama, who
owned an apartment house and lived alone. But Moriyama screamed and
went out of the house and the boy ran away without taking any
money, the official said. The woman later died.
	   The police are withholding the name of the boy because he is a
minor.
	   The killing comes as Japan is increasingly concerned about a
rise in juvenile crime. Last year, a 14-year-old was arrested for
killing a younger schoolmate and leaving his severed and mutilated
head at a school gate.
	   This year through November, 144,228 juveniles between the age of
14 and 19 were arrested or taken into protective custody for
alleged criminal offenses, up 3.1 percent from the same period in
1997, according to a report released recently by the National
Police Agency.
	   Strict gun laws have limited the number of firearm-related
crimes committed in Japan, but the use of knives has become popular
in recent years among juvenile delinquents.

Indonesia to ratify three ILO conventions on human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has formally
declared its intention to ratify next year three conventions of the
International Labor Organization on human rights, a report said
Wednesday.
	   A letter of intent to ratify the conventions was signed
Wednesday by Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris and ILO Director in
Jakarta, Iftikhar Ahmed, witnessed by President B.J. Habibie, the
official Antara news agency said.
	   Under the letter of intent, Jakarta reaffirms its commitment to
ratify the remaining three core conventions by June 1999, Antara
said, quoting a statement from ILO office.
	   The three conventions were No. 105 on the abolition of forced
labor, No. 111 on discrimination, employment and occupation, and
No. 138 on the minimum age of employment.
	   The ratification would make Indonesia the first East Asia
country to ratify all seven of the ILO's all seven fundamental
human rights conventions. the statement said.
	   Indonesia has already ratified ILO Conventions on the freedom of
association and the right to organize, forced labor, the right to
organize and collective bargaining, and equal remuneration.
	   Some 40 countries have ratified all seven conventions while 55
other have endorsed six of the seven, the statement said.
	   Habibie, who replaced authoritarian President Suharto in May,
has relaxed tight restrictions on labor unions and delivered a list
of liberalizing reforms by opening the door to freedom of
expression and association.
	   Suharto resigned amid widespread violence and student-led
protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.

U.N. peacekeeping troops to stay in Central African Republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ The United Nations has
extended a peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic
until next December to strengthen the country's fragile peace, U.N.
officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.N. troops will help restructure the country's military,
which has staged three major rebellions against President
Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   Since this month's parliamentary elections that weakened the
ruling party, the military appears more divided between loyalists
and opponents of Patasse.
	   U.N. officials said the rival groups clashed Monday in barracks
in the capital of Bangui. No casualties were reported.
	   The Security Council authorized the peacekeeping mission in
March to replace French troops who had been in the country to help
enforce a peace agreement.
	   Election figures from the second round of staggered voting were
released Tuesday, indicating the ruling Movement for the Liberation
of the People of Centrafrique won 47 of 109 parliamentary seats. A
coalition of several opposition parties control 29 seats after the
two rounds of voting.
	   The remaining seats belong to a variety of independent
candidates or smaller opposition groups, which could play a key
role in helping the MLPC or the opposition coalition to control the
legislative branch of government.
	   The election is seen as an important effort to stabilize the
Central African Republic, which has been wracked by ethnic and
factional violence since independence more than three decades ago.
	   Patasse's position is not affected by the vote and presidential
elections are not immediately planned.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a
visit to Kazakstan, said Wednesday that his country will repay all
its debts, but would need to restructure them because of the
country's economic crisis.
	   ``Russia will not declare default, we have no intention of
declaring default,'' Primakov said in Kazakstan's capital Astana.
``Russia will pay all debts, both internal and external.''
	   But he stressed that the government would seek to reschedule its
obligations. ``Russia is interested in debt restructuring,''
Primakov told reporters.
	   Russia faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall due
next year, but the government has only earmarked dlrs 9.5 billion
for foreign debt servicing and wants to reschedule the remainder
with creditors.
	   After the latest economic crisis hit in August, the government
stopped making payments on dlrs 40 billion worth of treasury bills.
Creditors regarded this as a default, and restructuring
negotiations are still underway.
	   The government badly needs new loans from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders to pay off its debts. It has
included dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans in next year's proposed
budget, although there's no guarantee they will materialize.
	   The World Bank on Tuesday promised to release a dlrs 400 million
loan for repairs and construction on Russia's vast road system, but
said that it wouldn't release dlrs 950 million in promised loans
for economic restructuring, social security and the coal industry
until at least March.
	   The IMF and other lenders say a sound federal budget is a key
condition for granting new loans. They also urge the government to
more effectively combat tax-dodging that remains widespread.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko on Wednesday
acknowledged that a huge share of the economy has remained out of
reach of the tax collector.
	   ``The amount of money spent by the population is two to three
times higher than the official incomes,'' she said at a news
conference.
	   Parliament is generally supportive of Primakov's government and
have indicated that the next year's budget could win a quicker
approval without bitter debates of recent years that dragged out
for months.
	   However, there are still plenty of opponents.
	   ``The budget stands no chance to win approval in its current
shape,'' Eduard Rossel, the governor of the industrial
Yekaterinburg region in the Ural Mountains, told a news conference
Wednesday.
	   He ruled out a quick passage of the budget, saying the
government will have to listen to regional leaders who don't want
to see their share of the budget cut.
	   Also Wednesday, Russia's parliament again turned down a proposed
land code that would have allowed increased land sales, including
the sale of some farmland.
	   President Boris Yeltsin supported the measure, but the
Communists and other hard-liners in parliament want to keep most
land, and farm land in particular, in state hands.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov held talks with Kazak President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and agreed to increase the amount of Kazak oil going
through Russian territory and reduce Russian railway tariffs for
Kazak goods.
	   Relations are generally good, despite some tension in the past
over the alleged discrimination against ethnic Russians in
Kazakstan and a dispute over mutual debts.

Crocodile stalks Singapore member of Parliament

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A ruling party member of Singapore's parliament
had an unwelcome visitor while enjoying a quiet Sunday home with
the family _ a meter-long (yard-long) crocodile.
	   Mohamad Maidin Packer, who is also Parliamentary Secretary for
the Ministry of	   Mohamad Education, called the police when the animal wandered
into his yard, state-run TV reported.
	   A total of ten men _ police and animal handlers _ restrained the

Department was investigating.
	   The escaped animal was believed to be a neighbor's. It is
illegal in Singapore to keep wild animals without a license, the
report said.

Russian ambassador heads back to the United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW 6th graf with comment from Russian foreign minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to the United States headed
back to Washington on Wednesday a week after he was recalled for
consultations on the American air strikes against Iraq.
	   The Russians harshly denounced the U.S. and British bombing
raids against Iraq, and recalled ambassadors from both countries.
But Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov was returning to his post in
Washington, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the air strikes only complicated any settlement in the long-running
confrontation between the Arab nation and United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   The bombings have increased anti-American sentiment in Russia.
But next month's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``will be important for overcoming the negative
consequences of the U.S. use of force against Iraq,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday.
	   The Russians were still holding discussions with Great Britain
about the return of Moscow's ambassador to London.
	   ``It does not mean that Russia's relations with Britain are more
difficult than those with the United States,'' Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov told Russian news agencies. ``It only means that
certain points need to be clarified.''
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and are to remain in place until U.N. inspectors verify that
all weapons of mass destruction have been dismantled.

Amid anger, Lebanon mourns victims of Israeli air raid

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Hundreds of people shouting ``Death to
Israel'' gathered in the main square of Baalbek Wednesday for the
funeral of a woman and her six children who were killed in an
Israeli air raid.
	   The bodies of Nada Othman and her children aged 2 to 13 were
laid in the square in coffins wrapped by red flags symbolizing
martyrdom. They included a small casket containing the remains of
the youngest victim, Sobhi Othman.
	   The family was in a farm that took a direct hit Tuesday from a
rocket launched by an Israeli warplane on a village, about 23
kilometers (14 miles) southwest of Baalbek, a stronghold of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   The deaths, the highest civilian casualties since 1996 in
Israel's conflict with the guerrillas, triggered a barrage of
Katyusha rockets by the Hezbollah on northern Israel early
Wednesday, injuring at least 13 people. The Israeli army expressed
regret at the civilian deaths and the country's Parliament offered
its condolences.
	   The father of the victims, Mohammed Othman, who survived along
with a 11-year-old son, wept bitterly at the funeral in the town
square.
	   Speakers and mourners, meanwhile, vented their anger at Israel
and the United States, Israel's main arms supplier. Many Arabs
consider Washington equally responsible for attacks by the Jewish
state.
	   ``America is the principal enemy ... The aggression against this
family is a confirmation of American-Israel (designs) to kill us,''
Sheik Mohammed Yazbek, a senior Hezbollah official, said.
	   Hundreds of mourners shouted ``Death to America'' and ``Death to
Israel'' as they waved clenched fists in the air.
	   Many Arabs are already angered by last week's U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq during Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``The Israelis came to complete what their masters (Americans)
had done in `Desert Fox' when they terrified our dear people of
Iraq,'' Yazbek said.
	   He said the morning Katyusha attacks were ``a sea of revenge ...
in retaliation against the murderers of children, infants and
women.''
	   The coffins are expected to be taken by car to the victims' home
village of Tufeil, 35 kilometers (20 miles) from Baalbek, in the
Lebanese border mountain range for burial.
	   Hezbollah is leading the guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops
and an allied Lebanese militia from a swath of South Lebanon that
Israel occupies in the form of a buffer zone to protect its
northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   However, Israeli planes frequently target Hezbollah hideouts
deep inside Lebanon. The area hit Tuesday was 75 kilometers (45
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   On Wednesday, the guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in the
security zone, killing one fighter and injuring another of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, Lebanese security officials
said.

NATO troops remove Croatian police from disputed border area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Croatia's request for NATO troops to withdraw &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force in
Bosnia removed Croatian police from a disputed area along Bosnia's
western border with Croatia, NATO announced Wednesday.
	   Although the action in Martin Brod, some 220 kilometers (150
miles) west of Bosnia's capital Sarajevo, went on without incident,
it infuriated the Croatian government. President Franjo Tudjman
spoke with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the alliance's
commander for Europe, Wesley Clark, asking that the NATO troops _
Canadian peacekeepers _ withdraw immediately.
	   ``Such a one-sided action ... could have unforeseen harmful
consequences,'' Croatia's National Security Council said in a
statement carried by state-run radio.
	   Tudjman called an emergency session of the top national body,
the radio said.
	   Civilian authorities should take control of the disputed area
until the two countries solve the dispute, the statement said.
	   Earlier this week, Tudjman said he was ready to send his troops
to Martin Brod if NATO-led troops attempt to take control of the
now Croat-controlled half of the city.
	   Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define the
border near Martin Brod.
	   Martin Brod was considered part of Bosnia before the 1991-95
war. But since the fighting ended, Croatian authorities moved the
border deeper into Bosnian territory, claiming that part of the
city should belong to Croatia.
	   When they returned into the area after fighting stopped, many of
the residents of Martin Brod found their homes or land on the other
side of the border, in Croatia. Croatian border police prevented
them from going there.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, sent a
letter to both countries saying until the two border commissions
agree on the frontier, he will consider the pre-war demarcation
line to be valid.
	   This means that the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation should be in
charge of the area instead of Croatia.
	   In response to a request from Westendorp's office, the NATO-led
peace force removed the Croatian police without any incident, a
NATO news release said, adding that territory ``is now under the
jurisdiction of the Federation police,'' their statement said.

Ethiopia denies being aided by Sudan in conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ethiopia on Wednesday denied claims that
it is using Port Sudan on Sudan's Red Sea coast for logistical
support in its seven-month border conflict with Eritrea.
	   In a statement received in Nairobi, the Ethiopian government
said the claim made by Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae
Tuesday was baseless.
	   ``The Eritrean regime is once again lying to the international
community,'' said the statement, using the strong language that
come to characterized public statements from both countries since
fighting erupted in May.
	   ``Ethiopia has not received a single imported item _ not even a
single pencil or food supplies _ let alone arms, through Port
Sudan,'' the statement said.
	   Before the outbreak of fighting, landlocked Ethiopia received
and shipped most of its goods through the Eritrean Red Sea ports of
Assab and Massawa. But it now uses Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden for
most imports and exports.
	   Weldensae also accused Ethiopia of moving troops into Djibouti
to outflank Eritrea.
	   The Ethiopian statement said ``the accusation against Djibouti
is not new, and it has resulted in the decision of Djibouti to
sever diplomatic relations with Eritrea.''
	   No comment was available from authorities in Djibouti.
	   Hostilities erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May over
undemarcated colonial boundaries, and heavy fighting in the first
half of June killed several hundred people.
	   Since then, thousands of troops from both sides are hunkered
down along both sides of their common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile)
border. Periodic shelling at hot spots and large-scale build up of
weapons has sustained tensions.
	   Djibouti severed diplomatic ties with Eritrea Nov. 18, following
Eritrean allegations that the tiny port state in the crook of the
Horn of Africa was aiding the Ethiopian war effort.
	   Ertirea and Sudan broke relations in 1994 amid accusations that
each suppported the other's rebel movements.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others convicted of corruption; sentenced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sentencing details &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO secretary general Willy Claes
received a three-year suspended jail sentence Wednesday after being
convicted of bribe-taking in two defense contracts he awarded as
economics minister in the late 1980s.
	   After a four month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year
suspended sentences each to ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
former premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge Dassault, 75, head of
France's Dassault aviation concern after convicting them of
corruption, too.
	   The penalty for Claes, 60, was the maximum possible. Eight
former aides and associates were also convicted and received
suspended sentences of up to two years.
	   The court said Claes had to know that when Italy's Agusta SpA
was ready to pay 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to win a
December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters, it was talking
about a bribe for his Dutch-speaking socialist party.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a summation of the case that took four hours to read out.
	   He said Claes' and others bent the contract rules at the expense
of France's Aerospatiale SA which had a valid rival bid for ther
helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June, 1989, deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat a rival
bid by Litton Industries Inc. of the United States.
	   The contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.
Claes and the other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2, pleading
innocent.
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The high court trial came after the parliamentary immunity of
Claes and the others had been been lifted.
	   It was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the 1990s,
ran their political families out of their wallets, unhindered by
laws banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations.
	   Thus, prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991,
presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months when the investigation into his role in the Agusta case
heated up making it untenable for him to stay at the western
alliance.
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at government expense.

Group of former Iranian MP's criticize arrest of cleric
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A group of former members of Parliament have
condemned as unconstitutional the arrest last week of a cleric and
former parliamentarian, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Assadollah Bayat was arrested last Wednesday and sentenced to
one year in prison and a fine of one million rials (dlrs 333) on
charges of fraud and forgery.
	   Bayat, a former member of Majlis, or parliament, was tried by
the Special Court for the Clergy, which only tries clerics.
	   Bayat, a reform-minded cleric and an ally of President Mohammad
Khatami, was a prayer leader in a mosque north of the capital
Tehran. He also directed a financial institute affiliated to the
mosque.
	   Since he came to power last year, Khatami has been locked in a
power struggle with conservative clergymen opposed to his political
and social reforms. Many of Khatami's supporters have become
victims in the conflict.
	   In a statement published in Wednesday's newspapers, the
Association of Former Majlis Members accused the special court of
using its powers to stem dissent.
	   ``Today, unfortunately, this court ... has become a pressure
tool (to punish) clergy with different opinions,'' said the
statement published in the Emrooz and other newspapers.
	   The statement said the special court was illegal because there
is no provision in Iran's constitution for a court that tries only
clergy. The statement said that it was also unconstitutional to be
tried without access to a lawyer, as was the case in the special
court.
	   Bayat was a deputy speaker in the Majlis from 1989 to 1993. In
October, he was banned by hard-liners from running for a key
assembly that appoints the supreme leader after running afoul of
hard-liners for openly supporting Khatami.

Official: Russia has found investor to keep Mir in orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space officials announced Wednesday that
they have found a private investor to keep the Mir station in orbit
for three more years instead of only until mid-1999, when they had
planned to discard it.
	   ``We have an investor who is ready to provide funding under the
government's guarantees,'' Yuri Semyonov, the chief of Russia's
Energia space company, was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Energia built the Mir and is pushing to extend the space
station's stay in orbit in spite of international demands that
Russia spend all of its limited resources earmarked for space on
the international space station.
	   Semyonov refused to identify the investor, or say how much
funding the investor would provide. He said that the Russian
government is already drafting a document that would provide
guarantees for the Mir investment, and that a funding agreement can
be signed as soon as that document is completed.
	   Russia has been under intense international criticism for
continuing to spend money on the Mir even as the country's economic
problems have caused repeated delays in the construction of the
international space station. The first two elements of the
16-nation station were launched into orbit over the last two
months.
	   Russian space officials have promised they would keep the aging
Mir in orbit only if they can find new funding.
	   Mir's operation requires about dlrs 250 million each year.
Russia will need to spend dlrs 270 million next year on the
international space station.
	   Russia's draft 1999 budget, under review in parliament, earmarks
a meager dlrs 143 million for space research, Russian Space Agency
director Yuri Koptev has said.
	   Mir now houses two Russian cosmonauts. A joint crew of Russian,
French and Slovak astronauts is expected to be sent to Mir in
February.
	   Two Russians are then expected to stay on the Mir to gradually
lower its orbit to prepare for sinking the 120-ton station in the
ocean.

Hamas spiritual leader freed from house arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Yassin comment &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, freed Wednesday from two months of house arrest on
Wednesday, declared that the radical Islamic group's ``pact with
God'' would continue.
	   Outside Yassin's house in a slum neighborhood of Gaza City, a
crowd of rejoicing followers surrounded the frail, ailing sheik in
his wheelchair, kissing and greeting him.
	   Speaking to reporters inside, Yassin declared the Wye River
land-for-security accord a failure, and said his release was a sign
of that.
	   ``At the time that Wye was signed, the intent was to prove that
no voice was higher that that of Wye,'' he said. ``Today, after the
sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is inevitable that other
voices will become audible.''
	   The release of Yassin by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
is likely to heighten tensions between the Palestinians and Israel,
coming as the two sides accuse each other of violations of the
now-stalled Wye River land-for-security accord.
	   Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight
Islamic militant groups like Hamas, and Yassin's release drew new
criticism from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority has to decide whether it wants to
meet its commitments to fight Hamas terror and move the peace
process forward or turn a blind eye to the terrorist activities of
the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said.
	   Hamas opposes any peace with Israel and has carried out more
than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several years. Yassin
said Hamas' fundamental beliefs had not changed.
	   ``Our pact with God is more important ... We will hold on to our
strategy,'' he said.
	   The sheik was put under house arrest on Oct. 29, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli children. The attack came only six days
after the signing of the Wye River accord.
	   Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his following, was
one of Arafat's strongest steps yet against Hamas. At one point, in
a leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded his release
and made a rare direct threat against Arafat.

Wednesday, a news agency reported.
	   Ivan Orlov, 65, died of a heart attack in the Buturskaya prison
hospital, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Orlov was arrested on Nov. 4, immediately after he drove his car
across Red Square, jumped out, and detonated a bomb just outside
the Spassky Gate.
	   The blast severely wounded three Kremlin guards, but Orlov
sustained only minor injuries.
	   Doctors diagnosed Orlov with schizophrenia soon after the
arrest, but transferred him to prison to await trial on treason
charges. He would have faced 10 to 20 years in prison if convicted.
	   Orlov worked as a freelance journalist for the Russian Pravda
newspaper, which prints nationalistic and anti-Semitic articles.
The paper's editor said Orlov was angry over President Boris
Yeltsin's policies.
	   Yeltsin's main office is inside the Kremlin, but the president
was not in Moscow when the bomb went off.
	   Before the attack, Orlov bought a plot of land at a cemetery in
his home town, and set up a gravestone with his name and picture on
it. In a letter sent at the time, he asked that all his belongings
be given to the local Communist Party branch.

Int'l monitors hail Dutch-Russian destruction cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ International monitors welcomed
Wednesday a Dutch pledge to help Russia destroy part of its
decaying arsenal of Cold War chemical weapons.
	   The Dutch government has said it will donate 10 million guilders
(dlrs 5.3 million) to help fund a project for Dutch experts to
destroy 6,500 metric tons of poison that has been stored since the
1950s at a depot in Kambarka, 1,200 kilometers (744 miles) east of
Moscow in the Udmurt Republic.
	   Serguei Batsanov of The Hague-based Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said the Dutch gesture should
prompt other governments to help Russia destroy its 40,000 tons of
chemical weapons _ the world's largest such stockpile.
	   While Russian authorities have said the destruction is a
priority, they add that they cannot afford to complete the task
themselves.
	   Russian officials say they expect foreign money to cover about
dlrs 1 billion of the estimated dlrs 6 billion cost of destroying
their chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, freed Wednesday from two months of house arrest, declared
that the radical Islamic group's ``pact with God'' would continue.
	   Outside Yassin's house in a slum neighborhood of Gaza City, a
crowd of rejoicing followers surrounded the frail, ailing sheik in
his wheelchair, kissing and greeting him.
	   Speaking to reporters inside, Yassin declared the Wye River
land-for-security accord a failure, and said his release was a sign
of that.
	   ``At the time that Wye was signed, the intent was to prove that
no voice was higher that that of Wye,'' he said. ``Today, after the
sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is inevitable that other
voices will become audible.''
	   The release of Yassin by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
is likely to heighten tensions between the Palestinians and Israel,
coming as the two sides accuse each other of violations of the
now-stalled Wye River land-for-security accord.
	   Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight
Islamic militant groups like Hamas, and Yassin's release drew new
criticism from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority has to decide whether it wants to
meet its commitments to fight Hamas terror and move the peace
process forward or turn a blind eye to the terrorist activities of
the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said.
	   Hamas opposes any peace with Israel and has carried out more
than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several years. Yassin
said Hamas' fundamental beliefs had not changed.
	   ``Our pact with God is more important,'' he said. ``We will hold
on to our strategy.''
	   The sheik was put under house arrest on Oct. 29, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli children. The attack came only six days
after the signing of the Wye River accord.
	   Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his following, was
one of Arafat's strongest steps yet against Hamas. At one point, in
a leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded his release
and made a rare direct threat against Arafat.

Ukrainian soldier sentenced to death for killing four servicemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian court sentenced a former border
guard to death after convicting him of murdering four fellow
servicemen, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The Supreme Court of Ukraine's autonomous republic of Crimea
ruled Tuesday that Vadym Sobko, 19, was guilty of killing three
soldiers and an officer from his garrison and then deserting the
unit with stolen weapons, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Sobko confessed to the murders, which he committed on June 25
this year, but said they were prompted by hazing inflicted on him
by senior soldiers.
	   However, the court said it found no evidence of hazing against
Sobko, while medical tests showed that he did not suffer from any
mental diseases to free him from legal responsibility, according to
Interfax.
	   Hazing of young recruits is widespread in the Ukrainian army, as
well as in the armies of Russia and other former Soviet republics.
Many young soldiers try to evade military service for fear of
violence.
	   Sobko is unlikely to be executed, though, as Ukraine has imposed
a moratorium on capital punishment to meet its obligations as a
member of the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human
rights body.
	   Ukrainian courts have sentenced more than 80 people to death so
far this year, but none has been executed.

 &UR; British helicopter crash kills three in Bosnia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with eyewitness account of crash, quote; changes

<TEXT>
	   TRNOVACA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two British soldiers were
killed and another was injured when their military helicopter
crashed just outside a NATO base in central Bosnia, alliance
officials said Wednesday.
	   Capt. Phil Jarvis, 27, and Sgt. David Kinsley, 34, died in the
British helicopter crash near the Gornju Vakuf base Tuesday
afternoon. The third, a British soldier who was not identified, was
seriously injured, NATO said in a news release. The hometowns of
the three were released.
	   The Lynx helicopter, carrying three people, crashed some 70
kilometers (40 miles) west of Sarajevo, near the village of
Trnovaca.
	   Maj. Keith Jarvis, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, said no further
details would be released until a formal military investigation is
completed.
	   The owner of a grocery store in Trnovaca, Branko Prskalo, said
the helicopter was flying slowly, only 150 meters (500 feet) off
the ground, just before the crash.
	   ``At one point the chopper made four or five spins in the air
and then the noise of the engine was no longer to be heard,'' he
said, adding that the helicopter caught fire after hitting the
ground.
	   Since NATO deployed the peace force three years ago, 92 members
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic
accidents or landmine blasts.

<TEXT>
	   OBERHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) _ A women's super-giant slalom race
wiped out by fog at Megeve, France, on Monday, was rescheduled for
Jan. 22 in the Italian resort of Cortina, the International Ski
Federation announced Wednesday.
	   After delaying the start by nearly three hours Monday in the
hope that the fog would clear, race officials were forced to send
home skiers early for their Christmas break.
	   It was the first time this season that a women's World Cup race
had been postponed.
	   The super-giant slalom will add to a heavy schedule of women's
competition at Cortina, where three races already had been planned.
	   The downhill originally set for Jan. 22 has been moved to
Thursday, Jan. 21 with consecutive super-giant slaloms the next two
days. A giant slalom will be staged as originally scheduled on
Sunday, Jan. 24.

German goverment seeks to smooth over nuclear row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Greens
party allies sought Wednesday to smooth over their first major row,
agreeing that all sides would have to compromise to reach a deal on
phasing out nuclear energy.
	   The Social Democratic chancellor had publicly rebuked his Green
environment minister, Juergen Trittin, on Tuesday for firing the
government's two advisory panels on nuclear safety without clearing
it first with him.
	   Schroeder accused Trittin of substituing ``pompous airs'' and
political symbolism for serious negotiations.
	   He later told German television that both parties in his
government are committed to closing Germany's nuclear power plants,
but the question of how has yet to be decided. He said he was
obligated to step in to prevent any fights from endangering the
chances of reaching a consensus.
	   Trittin described the row as a question of form, stressing that
he also recognized the importance of compromise. ``The exit will
only succeed if all those involved come to agree on a sound and
broad consensus.''
	   The center-left coalition is to meet Jan. 13 to hammer out a
common strategy for talks with the nuclear industry, which begin
Jan. 26.
	   If a voluntary timetable for shutting down the country's 19
nuclear power plants is not agreed to within a year, the government
has pledged to legislate one.

Court recommends sentence reductions for anti-Basque 'dirty war'

convicts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Wednesday partially pardoned
a former interior minister and his deputy for their role in a
`dirty war' against Basque separatists, reducing their 10-year jail
sentences by two-thirds.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
granted the pardon to ex-minister Jose Barrionuevo, 56, and his
ex-chief of state security, Rafael Vera, 53, following a
recommendation of the Supreme Court of Justice.
	   The ruling entitles the two men to apply for further benefits,
including an open-prison regime allowing them to spend most of
their time at home.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   Wednesday's partial pardon also affects eight other government
officials and policemen convicted for the abduction that was the
first act attributed to the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation
Groups, or GAL.
	   GAL killed 27 people over the next five years in a campaign
against ETA. Many of its victims were mistaken targets.
	   Former Prime Minister Felip Gonzalez has long maintained that
both Barrionuevo and Vera, who worked in his Socialist government,
had nothing to do with the GAL.
	   On Tuesday the Supreme Court recommended the partial pardon
arguing that although the kidnapping was a serious criminal act, it
had taken place 15 years ago and that Barrionuevo or Vera had not
been seeking personal benefits.
	   After a four-hour hearing the court recommended similar
reductions for eight other people it had found guilty in the same
case in July and sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 10
years.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It has
been observing a unilateral cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there
are moves afoot for negotiations to resolve the conflict.

Chinese leader signals yearlong crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The trials of three outspoken dissidents over,
President Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a
crackdown on dissent throughout next year.
	   In his second hardline speech in six days, Jiang vowed to crush
any challenges to Communist Party rule and preserve ``social
stability.'' He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' _ a
euphemism for following party orders.
	   The speech, to senior law enforcement officials, used
uncompromising language heard less frequently over the past 18
months as Chinese leaders sought to improve relations abroad.
	   Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions
for subversion this week of three political critics who tried to
form an opposition party.
	   To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national newspapers
ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- and
11-year prison terms given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang
Youcai. Dissidents are rarely mentioned by official media, and the
reports served as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people.
	   In the speech, reported by state television, Jiang said
stability was crucial over the next year. He noted two key events
on the political calendar: the 50th anniversary of Communist Party
rule on Oct. 1 and China's recovery of the Portuguese colony of
Macau on Dec. 20.
	   ``We must strengthen the ideological and political education of
officials and raise their awareness of and resistance to the
sabotaging acts of hostile domestic and foreign forces,'' China
Central Television quoted Jiang as saying.
	   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Jiang did not exclusively target political enemies. He likened
their threat to that of white-collar and ordinary criminals and
ticked off a list of potentially volatile problems _ inefficient
state industries, legions of laid-off workers, stagnating farmers'
incomes and corrupt officials.
	   The emphasis on stability and warnings to those who would
disrupt it were reminiscent of party pronouncements in the waning
years of Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping.
	   After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from a
major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform,
not stability, were the bywords of the past year.
	   Academic debates over the past year were the boldest in 10 years
by China's relatively controlled standards. Party leaders too
touted efforts to build a more comprehensive, predictable legal
system and won praise from Western governments for signing U.N.
rights treaties.
	   ``Our active developments of foreign affairs has reached new
achievements,'' Jiang said. ``Our country's stature has risen a
step higher.''
	   By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three
weeks, China trampled its own legal safeguards for criminal
suspects and raised questions about its commitments to U.N. rights
treaties it signed over the past 15 months.
	   Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents have
continued to campaign for justice.
	   Four elder members of the dissident community sent a letter to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China to stop persecuting
political critics and release political prisoners.
	   ``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock''
over the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent
detentions of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter
dated Tuesday that was released by New York-based Human Rights in
China on Wednesday.

Situation grave in Russia's north, but not bad enough yet for
</HEADLINE>
evacuation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has drawn up emergency plans to
evacuate remote areas of Russia's north, but is unlikely to take
action unless the situation there gets far worse, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Many of Russia's far-flung regions have suffered fuel and
electricity shortages this winter, after being stranded when
Russia's financial crisis prevented supplies from getting
delivered.
	   Some small villages on the Chukotka peninsula, which juts out
toward Alaska, have been completely abandoned for larger towns in
the region. But the government does not expect the population to
retreat any further.
	   Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said the north of
Russia is far too vast to conduct a large evacuation, and the
situation is still manageable. The ministry will continue bringing
supplies instead of moving people out.
	   ``Look, more than 40 percent of Russia is in the north,'' he
said. ``Yes, the situation is sufficiently complicated, but far
from hopeless.''
	   Russia's far-flung regions were barely hanging on even before
the latest crisis. After the collapse of the Soviet Union they were
cut off from large government subsidies, and received just enough
supplies in the summers to scrape by.
	   Now the government is more broke than ever. It managed to send
supply caravans with fuel and spare parts to Chukotka, but only
after some towns were left without electricity because power
generators broke down and there were no tools to fix them.
	   A fuel tanker recently arrived on the Kamchatka peninsula, south
of Chukotka. Beforehand, residents had to get by for more than a
month with only a few hours of electricity each day.
	   ``There's not an emergency situation today,'' said Emergency
Situations Ministry spokeswoman Marina Ricklina. ``There is food,
there is water. What's bad is the heating. If there isn't heating
in one particular house, the residents go to a hotel.''

Demontrators burn photos of Indian actress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nearly 50 Nepalese protesters Wednesday
burned the photographs of an Indian actress who in a radio
interview said the Himalayan nation was once part of India.
	   They gathered outside her hotel and demanded an apology from
Madhuri Dixit. She is visiting Katmandu for the release of the
audio album of her new movie.
	   Dixit's costar in the movie Akshaya Kumar apologized to the
crowd for her ignorance. Nepal, a predominantly Hindu nation, was
never part of India.
	   Police later dispersed the protesters. Indian film stars are
revered in Nepal where most theaters run Hindi language movies.

	   TRNOVACA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two British soldiers were
killed and another was injured when their military helicopter
crashed just outside a NATO base in central Bosnia, alliance
officials said Wednesday.
	   Capt. Phil Jarvis, 27, and Sgt. David Kinsley, 34, died in the
British helicopter crash near the Gornju Vakuf base Tuesday
afternoon. The third, a British soldier who was not identified, was
seriously injured, NATO said in a news release. The hometowns of
the three were not released.
	   The Lynx helicopter, carrying three people, crashed some 70
kilometers (40 miles) west of Sarajevo, near the village of
Trnovaca.
	   Maj. Keith Jarvis, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, said no further
details would be released until a formal military investigation is
completed.
	   The owner of a grocery store in Trnovaca, Branko Prskalo, said
the helicopter was flying slowly, only 150 meters (500 feet) off
the ground, just before the crash.
	   ``At one point the chopper made four or five spins in the air
and then the noise of the engine was no longer to be heard,'' he
said, adding that the helicopter caught fire after hitting the
ground.
	   Since NATO deployed the peace force three years ago, 92 members
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic
accidents or landmine blasts.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others sentenced for corruption

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Former NATO Secretary-General Willy
Claes received a three-year suspended jail sentence Wednesday after
being convicted of corruption in the awarding of defense contracts
in the late 1980s while he was Belgium's economics minister.
	   After a four-month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year
suspended sentences for corruption to ex-defense minister Guy
Coeme, 52, former premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge Dassault, 75,
head of France's Dassault aviation concern.
	   The penalty for Claes, 60, was the maximum possible. Eight
former aides and associates were also convicted and received
suspended sentences of up to two years.
	   The court said Claes had to know that Italy's Agusta SpA payment
of 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to win a December 1988,
contract for army helicopters constituted a bribe for his
Dutch-speaking socialist party.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a decision that took four hours to read.
	   He said Claes' and others bent the rules at the expense of
France's Aerospatiale SA which had a valid rival bid for ther
helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June, 1989, deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat out its
U.S. rival, Litton Industries Inc.
	   Each contracts was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Claes
and the other 11 defendants, who pleaded innocent, went on trial
Sept. 2.
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The high court trial came after the parliamentary immunity of
Claes and the others had been lifted.
	   It was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the 1990s,
ran their political families out of their wallets, unhindered by
laws banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations.
	   Thus, prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991,
presumably because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO Secretary-General in September 1994. He quit
13 months later when the Augusta investigation made it untenable
for him to lead the western alliance.
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
	   For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the
supreme court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for
corruption.

Impoverished Russian city wants Formula One track

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug to conform to style; EDITS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A run-down Russian industrial city is vying to
become a stop on the prestigious and costly Formula One auto racing
circuit, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The bid seems unlikely to succeed. Tula, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) south of Moscow, is suffering from a severe post-Soviet
slump made worse by Russia's latest financial crisis.
	   The city of 580,000 also has no existing track and none of the
necessary infrastructure.
	   But city administrators in Tula said they have a rich investor
to pay for the dlrs 300 million track and plan to renovate the
airport, according to the Moscow Times newspaper.
	   They also have the support of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who signed a decree last week giving his nod of approval.
	   Even with the investor and Primakov's support, the odds are
against Tula. Formula One racing is is one of the world's most
expensive sports, and most race stops have had their stop on the
circuit for decades.
	   Tula would also have to build a track first and go through a
long application process before Formula One officials consider the
city.
	   ``It's not absolutely impossible, but to say it's possible is
premature,'' Francesco Longanesi, a spokesman for the International
Automobile Federation (FIA), told the Moscow Times.

Canal Plus banks on new chief to score for beleaguered PSG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A year ago, Paris Saint-Germain was one of the most
feared clubs in Europe. Three coaches, three presidents and
countless embarrassing defeats later, France's richest club is
mired in a deep crisis.
	   PSG president Charles Bietry quit this week to cap a disastrous
year for the club - and raise questions about the role of its
owner, the television broadcaster Canal Plus.
	   ``We need to rediscover our dynamism,'' Canal Plus president
Pierre Lescure told reporters this week. ``I am not happy that
things are going so badly. I am not happy that Bietry left.''
	   Broadcasters are bidding to buy England's Manchester United and
Newcastle United, but PSG was the first European soccer club to be
acquired by a media company
	   With Canal Plus funding, it became France's No. 1 team, winning
the French championship in 1994 and the European Cup Winners' Cup
in 1996 with such stars as Youri Djorkaeff, David Ginola, Leonardo,
Rai and George Weah.
	   In 1997, it was unlucky to lose the Cup Winners' Cup final to
Barcelona, and last season won four European Champions league
matches, narrowly missing out on a place in the quarterfinals on
goal difference.
	   But PSG has been in free fall since the summer, when president
Michel Denisot switched jobs with Bietry, Canal Plus' head of
sports.
	   First, coach Ricardo quit. Then, after only three months in
charge, his replacement Alain Giresse was fired by Bietry after an
embarrassing loss to Israeli minnow Maccabi Haifa.
	   Bizarrely, PSG re-appointed Artur Jorge as coach. Jorge, during
his first stint at PSG, had accused Canal Plus, and Bietry in
particular, of driving him out of the job.
	   Canal Plus says its ownership has been good for the club.
	   ``What Canal Plus decision has held back PSG? What exactly have
we done to prevent its progress?'' Lescure asked. ``PSG was in very
bad health when we took over.''
	   But the TV company came under fire for appointing Bietry.
	   Accused by players and officials of meddling in team affairs,
Bietry often showed up at training in shorts looking for a game.
	   He befriended some stars and assailed others, who responded in
kind.
	   A hands-on president, Bietry took control of transfers.
	   In all, he spent 210 million francs (dlrs 38 million) on
transfer fees, but several of his signings, including Jay-Jay
Okocha and Nicolas Oudec, proved expensive flops.
	   Then he sold Florian Maurice to archrival Marseille, where the
striker is now in brilliant form.
	   Toward the end of Bietry's last match at the Parc des Princes,
angry PSG fans cheered whenever opponent Strasbourg had a
goalscoring chance.
	   Without a goal in five games, PSG lies 11th place in the
standings, just seven points clear of the relegation zone.
	   ``I won't play with words about who is responsible and guilty,''
Bietry's resignation letter read. ``I am responsible and guilty.''
	   ``Was Bietry a good president? Some people thought not,'' said
midfielder Bruno Carotti. ``He was involved. He liked to come to
training. There comes a time when you need to respect the work of
the coach.''
	   Lescure appointed another Canal Plus executive, former finance
director Laurent Perpere, to turn the club around with a new
management style.
	   ``The club is counting on Perpere to normalize the club and make
it more functional,'' Lescure said. ``We want a balance between
strictness and adventure. Perpere has demonstrated these qualities.
He is not just an accountant.''
	   Perpere says he will be less involved in team affairs than
Bietry and improve the club's organization.
	   ``A soccer club has the characteristics of a company. It is in
sports, but behind it is a complex machine that must be managed. I
want to keep out of the fray and out of daily affairs,'' Perpere
said.
	   ``We have seen too many statements and counter-statements,''
Perpere said. ``The team is in a spiral of mediocrity and lacks
confidence. We need serenity and cohesion.''
	   Still, when it comes to transfers ``I will take the decisions,''
he said.
	   PSG's shell-shocked stars, many of whom are now expected to
leave, need to be convinced.
	   ``It's a real mess at PSG,'' said defender Nicolas Laspalles,
who blames Jorge rather than Bietry for the team's travails. ``Now
that the president has gone I have no reason to stay at the club.''
	   Carotti is also gloomy.
	   ``Will a new president after a new coach change anything? I'm
not even certain that an electric shock would be strong enough to
revive us.''

Ten die in Lithuania as truck crashes into river

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Ten people died when their logging
truck carrying a load of Christmas trees and firewood missed a
bridge and plunged into the ice-cold Venta River.
	   The accident near the town of Kursenai, 250 kms (155 miles)
northwest of the capital Vilnius, happened Tuesday and was reported
Wednesday by local media and the Baltic News Service.
	   The driver reportedly was intoxicated at the time of the crash.
He survived. Five others were seriously injured.
	   ``I saw this huge vehicle sliding from one side to another as a
drunk man,'' said Liudas Lapinskas who lives near the bridge.
``Then it hit the piers, fell into the water and overturned.
Several bodies fell out of the truck.''

Cyprus welcomes U.N. resolutions as positive
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus welcomed Wednesday two U.N.
Security Council resolutions that suggested a new impetus toward
its call for disarmament and negotiations on the war-divided
island.
	   In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos also
greeted the resolutions as showing that the world body realized
``the dangers contained in a prolongation of the problem.''
	   In its late Tuesday session, the council renewed the mandate of
the 2,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force which patrols a buffer
zone between the Turkish-occupied north of the island and the
Greek-dominated south.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The council called the status quo ``unacceptable'' and said
``negotiations on a final political solution of the Cyprus problem
have been at an impasse for too long.''
	   It demanded compliance with U.N. resolutions that call for a
reduction of troops and weapons and the island's reunification.
	   Briefing reporters Wednesday, Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis
Cassoulides said: ``This is the first time in many years that the
Security Council demands compliance with its previous resolutions
on Cyprus, particularly with regard to refraining from the threat
or the use of force, and on the reduction of troops and armaments.
	   ``This gives emphasis to what is important for us,'' he added.
	   Cassoulides also welcomed a statement by U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday in which he undertook to ``take all necessary steps
to support a sustained effort'' for the implementation of the
council's resolutions.
	   In Athens, Pangalos praised Clinton's comments, but he added
that the United States should ``ask Turkey to immediately withdraw
the American weapons systems in (northern Cyprus).''
	   Tension has been rising on the island recently following Turkish
threats to prevent the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Greece said it will support Cyprus if
it is attacked in line with their joint defense agreement.
	   The resolutions did not mention the missiles, but the council
expressed ``its grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of
military force and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate
at which they are being expanded.''
	   Cyprus has been under strong pressure from the United States and
the European Union to cancel the missiles' deployment.
	   President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, maintains
he is ready to do so, provided there is progress toward peace
negotiations and the demilitarisation of the island.
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the U.N.
talks in August 1997, demanding recognition of his breakaway state
and cancellation of the Cypriot accession negotiations with the
European Union.

	   Demirel picked Yalim Erez, the industry and trade minister, in
hopes he could draw wide support from Turkey's bickering political
parties. ``I will search for a consensus,'' Erez told reporters.
	   Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party abandoned efforts to
form a new government on Monday after a 3-week-old attempt failed
to receive enough backing to secure a majority in Parliament.
	   Demirel turned to an independent lawmaker instead of a party
leader after most parties _ unable to overcome their differences to
form alliances _ said they would support a government led by a

NATO commander for Europe warns of escalating Kosovo violence

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO's top commander for Europe,
American Gen. Wesley Clark, warned Wednesday of escalating violence
in Serbia's turbulent Kosovo province.
	   ``We are watching the situation very closely and we are seeing
increasingly aggressive Serb military and police activities,''
Clark said after meeting Macedonian authorities in the capital,
Skopje.
	   NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe said these activities
did not keep promises of the Yugoslav government and that the
matter causes great concern for the international community.
	   ``We are calling on all parties, including the (Kosovo) Albanian
parties, to refrain from violence,'' Clark said after his meeting
with Macedonia Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
	   Clark reiterated that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
top military commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must
comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   Clark flew to Macedonia from Brussels on a brief visit to the
alliance's 1,800-strong Extraction Force, deployed here for the
purpose of rescuing unarmed international monitors in Kosovo,
should they come in harm's way.
	   Two months ago, Milosevic pledged _ under the threat of NATO
airstrikes _ to reduce his government troops in the southern
Serbian province that borders Macedonia and allow deployment of
unarmed peace verifiers in Kosovo.
	   But a continuing spiral of violence threatens to unravel
Kosovo's tenuous October truce.
	   ``I came here to visit the facilities ... and also to thank the
Macedonian government for its very warm hospitality and support for
the NATO mission,'' Clark said.
	   He was due to inspect NATO's Extraction Force facilities in the
northern town of Kumanovo and visit about 500 American soldiers.
	   The Americans are part of a U.N. mission deployed in Macedonia
since 1992 to prevent the conflict within former Yugoslavia from
spreading to the vulnerable area.
	   Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 _ the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

 &UR; Korda escapes ban after positive drug test; ITF to review policies &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Tennis Federation's decision not
to suspend Australian Open champion Petr Korda for a positive
doping test raised doubts Wednesday on the federation's commitment
to a unified program to combat drugs in sport.
	   But ITF communications manager Alun James said the ITF was not
taking a soft stance on drugs and would be an active participant in
the International Olympic Committee's drug summit in February.
	   James said the ITF had pursued Korda's case vigorously and had
followed procedure by allowing its independent appeals committee to
rule on his punishment.
	   Korda tested positive to the steroid nandrolone after the
quarterfinals at this year's Wimbledon championships but he later
appealed, claiming he didn't know how the drug got into his system.
	   The ITF didn't make Korda's positive test public until Tuesday,
when the appeals committee announced it had accepted Korda's claim
and had decided not to impose a ban.
	   Instead, the 30-year-old Czech was stripped of 199 rankings
points and U.S. dlrs 94,529 prize money he earned at Wimbledon.
	   However, James admitted the ITF ``needs to evaluate its drugs
program'' in the wake of recent criticim and the IOC's push for
harmonious programs for all federations.
	   James said he couldn't comment on punishments in other sports
but agreed there was a growing concensus that athletes should be
held fully accountable for themselves in doping tests.
	   ``(The ITF) approves of a unified drug program but we believe
there is a case for sports to have individual policies _ (at the
IOC summit) we'll support a harmonious program with certain
provisions.''
	   James said the ITF was bound to support the findings of its
independent appeals committee but ``we need to evaluate (the
program) after what's happened.''
	   ``The committee comprises legal, medical and technical
experts,'' he said. ``It is a transparent program in the hands of
experts and, if the committee decides on a punishment after hearing
all the evidence and taking into account mitigating circumstances,
then that decision is final.''
	   James said the ITF had not kept Korda's positive doping tests a
secret.
	   ``Unlike a lot of other sports, we don't make results of drugs
tests public after A and B samples have been analyzed. We wait
until the whole process is complete,'' he said.
	   ``Tennis is very keen on confidentiality...so the players remain
innocent until proven guilty.''
	   Korda issued a statement Tuesday saying he had made exhaustive
but unsuccessful attempts to find the source of the illegal
substance.
	   ``I wish to state categorically that I am not a drugs cheat and
would never seek to obtain a competitive advantage over my fellow
professionals by such means,'' Korda said.
	   ``This allegation came as a tremendous shock and caused
considerable distress to me and my family,'' said Korda.
	   ``From a professional standpoint my performances since August
suffered, as my recent results have shown.
	   ``Whilst I am in the final stages of my career I still love the
game. I am delighted that the committee has cleared my name and
that I am free to carry on playing and competing.''
	   Korda broke through for his first Grand Slam title in February
when he beat Marcelo Rios in the final of the Australian Open in
Melbourne.
	   A spokeswoman for the event said Wednesday that Korda had passed
a drugs test at that tournament.
	   ``Petr Korda was tested after he won the 1998 Australian Open
men's final and the result was negative,'' she said in a statement.
	   The statement said players are randomly tested throughout the
tournament, then all players involved in the singles from the
quarter-finals onwards are tested.
	   Korda is the highest profile tennis player to test positive for
drugs since former World No. 1 Mats Wilander and his doubles
partner Karel Novacek returned positive tests for cocaine at the
1995 French Open.
	   Both players were later banned for three months and ordered to
return prize money and forfeit rankings points.
	   Korda also became the second player to be given the benefit of
the doubt by the ITF this year.
	   American teenager Samantha Reeves also tested positve for
nandrolone in an out-of-competition test last year but the ITF
appeals committee decided not to impose any sanctions due to
``exceptional circumstances''.
	   The ITF said Reeves never disputed that the banned substances
were found in her sample, and that she acted in ``good faith'' in
taking a product which she believed was for weight loss.
	   Australian Sports Drug Agency spokeswoman Vicki Kapernick said
Wednesday that nandrolone was an artificial version of the hormone
testosterone which could only be injected.
	   `It has a performance-enhancing effect and helps in muscle
building and recovery from injury while training,'' she said.
	   Australian sports medicine practitioner Peter Larkins said it
was hard to believe Korda had not known what substance he had been
injected with.
	   `How often have we heard the story, I didn't know where it came
from?,'' Larkins said.
	   `Elite athletes have a lot of people wanting to help them and
there is a lot of shonky advice around. Maybe he could have been
that naive.''
	   Larkins said any sport that has a drug code has an obligation to
educate its members.
	   ``Either (tennis) hasn't informed the athletes or they haven't
taken it seriously,'' he said.
	   `It just doesn't gel with me, that he didn't know what it was,
especially at that elite level. That wouldn't get you a defence in
the eyes of the International Olympic Committee.''

	   The president bucked the longstanding tradition of designating
the leader of the largest party in Parliament as premier _ a move
that would have brought the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party to power.
	   The military would have been sure to oppose such a government.
Turkey's generals pressured an Islamic predecessor of the Virtue
Party out of power in June 1997, accusing it of trying to raise the
profile of Islam in society.
	   Erez appears to be chosen because he sided with the pro-secular
establishment. He resigned from a ministerial post that he held
during an earlier coalition between his center-right True Path
Party and the earlier Islamic party in April 1997, two months after
the military warned the government to abide by Turkey's strictly
secular constitution.
	   Erez has since fallen out with True Path leader Tansu Ciller,
despite being one of her closest aides.
	   Welfare was shut down by the constitutional court earlier this
year for anti-secular activities.

Lebanese guerrillas rocket northern Israel; 13 hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu visit, defense minister comment, other
Israeli reaction, northern residents told to stay in shelters all
day &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel early Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, expecting retaliation for an Israeli
air strike in Lebanon the day before that killed seven civilians.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the electricity was
knocked out in some areas but later restored. Another rocket bore a
hole in an apartment building, scattering sheets of plaster and
hunks of twisted metal on the ground below.
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   Northern Israel had braced for an attack by Hezbollah guerrillas
after Israeli airstrike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children
in eastern Lebanon. That was the highest civilian casualty toll
this year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying they
had been accidental and that the target of the air strike had been
a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   Even so, senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan called the rocket
attack ``totally unwarranted'' and warned it could lead to an
escalation of the war in Lebanon.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai noted that the 7:30 a.m.
barrage was timed to hit when the guerrillas had apparently thought
people would be leaving their shelters.
	   ``There is a difference between a malfunction we are sorry for
... and an intended action to harm civilians at a time when they
thought they would be on their way out to schools and other
places,'' he said.
	   One Cabinet minister called for Israel to retaliate by knocking
out electricity to Beirut.
	   ``You can't have a sovereign country that puts its residents
into shelters while we ... sit helpless and wait for Katyusha
rockets,'' Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told army
radio.
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks. ``Murderers must pay the price
of their crimes,'' the statement said. ``We renew our pledge to
protect our people and their villages, no matter how great the
struggle.''
	   Dozens of rockets were fired in Wednesday's attack, falling with
enormous booms that could be heard for miles.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerrillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerrilla.
	   More rockets were fired at the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some fell harmlessly into the sea, but
others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and collective farms.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one rocket hit a house
where agricultural workers from Thailand lived _ just minutes after
the workers left the building. The house was heavily damaged, but
none of the workers was hurt.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

NBA commissioner may seek authorization to cancel season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Stands for Sports-NBA Lockout-Stern on Sports Digest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If Billy Hunter won't talk to him, American
National Basketball Association commissioner David Stern says he'll
talk to the league's Board of Governors about getting permission to
cancel the season.
	   Stern, interviewed while on vacation at Aspen, Colorado, by the
cable television outlet Fox Sports News, said he called Hunter, the
head of the players union.
	   ``I've told him we have serious disagreements,'' Stern said.
``I'd love to sit down and negotiate. I would say we are getting
pretty close'' to losing the season for lack of a contract after
owners locked out players.
	   ``If nothing happens in the next several days,'' Stern added,
``I think I'll be required to schedule a board meeting of our Board
of Governors for right after the first of the year.''
	   The NBA has locked out its players since completion of last
season's championship series in June over a disagreement on its
collective bargainaing agreement and hasn't played a game since.
	   Stern must receive permission from the Board of Governors,
essentially the club owners, to cancel the season.
	   ``We told the players exactly what our position is,'' Stern
said. ``Billy Hunter has taken the position that if the owners are
not prepared to pay the players more than they were paying, a
higher percentage than when the deal was reopened, that we should
simply cancel the season. I haven't taken him up on that offer
quite yet.''
	   Stern said he's ``not that interested in blowing it (the season)
up. But if he (Hunter) insists we do that, we may not have any
other choice.''
	   The comments come as a second player in essence broke ranks with
the union's stand.
	   Toronto Raptors forward Kevin Willis said Tuesday joined with
Utah forward Karl Malone, who earlier this week called the latest
proposal from the club owners ``fair.''
	   ``The majority (of players) would vote for the owners' latest
proposal, just to start playing ball again,'' Willis said.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA), owners can prohibit _ or
lock out _ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The CBA sets the ground rules for things like minimum salaries,
pension and health insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary
cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is money. The owners
have insisted on maximum salary costs and the union has refused to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.

Amid anger, Lebanon mourns victims of Israeli air raid

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Hundreds of Lebanese shouting ``Death to
Israel'' gathered Wednesday for the funeral of a woman and her six
children who were killed in an Israeli air raid.
	   The bodies of Nada Othman and her children aged 2 to 13 were
laid in the square of Baalbek in coffins wrapped by red flags
symbolizing martyrdom. A small casket contained the remains of the
youngest victim, Sobhi Othman.
	   The family was in a farm hit Tuesday by an Israeli rocket
launched at a village, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of
Baalbek, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla
group.
	   Hezbollah is leading the guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops
and an allied Lebanese militia from a swath of South Lebanon that
Israel occupies in the form of a buffer zone to protect its
northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   The deaths, the highest civilian casualties since 1996 in
Israel's conflict with the guerrillas, triggered a barrage of
Katyusha rockets by the Hezbollah on northern Israel early
Wednesday, injuring at least 13 people. The Israeli army expressed
regret at the civilian deaths and the country's Parliament offered
its condolences.
	   The father of the victims, Mohammed Othman, who survived along
with an 11-year-old son, wept bitterly at the funeral in the town
square.
	   Speakers and mourners, meanwhile, vented their anger at Israel
and the United States, Israel's main arms supplier. Many Arabs
consider Washington equally responsible for attacks by the Jewish
state.
	   ``America is the principal enemy,'' said Sheik Mohammed Yazbek,
a senior Hezbollah official. ``The aggression against this family
is a confirmation of American-Israel (designs) to kill us.''
	   Hundreds of mourners shouted ``Death to America'' and ``Death to
Israel'' as they waved clenched fists in the air.
	   Many Arabs are already angered by last week's U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq during Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``The Israelis came to complete what their masters (Americans)
had done in `Desert Fox' when they terrified our dear people of
Iraq,'' Yazbek said.
	   He said the morning Katyusha attacks were ``a sea of revenge ...
in retaliation against the murderers of children, infants and
women.''
	   The coffins are expected to be taken by car to the victims' home
village of Tufeil, 35 kilometers (20 miles) from Baalbek, in the
Lebanese border mountain range for burial.
	   Israeli planes frequently target Hezbollah hideouts deep inside
Lebanon. The area hit Tuesday was 75 kilometers (45 miles) north of
the Israeli border.
	   On Wednesday, the guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in the
security zone, killing one fighter and injuring another of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, Lebanese security officials
said.

	   Erez must now undergo a vote of confidence in parliament to
determine whether he can command a majority of votes.
	   If he fails, Turkey's president will have to come up with a new
plan to govern the country until the elections.
	   One scenario is for Demirel to ask Erez to govern even if he
fails to win a confidence vote.
	   Erez, 54, a businessman-turned-politician, is now expected to
meet with party leaders and appoint Cabinet members from most of
the parties represented in parliament.
	   A Virtue lawmaker, Ali Goren, said his party could support Erez
``as long as he intends to form a broad-based government.''
	   Erez reportedly has the backing of Ecevit and acting Premier
Mesut Yilmaz. Tansu Ciller's party declared it would not back Erez.
	   Labor unions issued a joint statement declaring support for
Erez.
	   Yilmaz's government collapsed last month in a vote of
no-confidence over a mafia and corruption scandal.

Fearing rebel attack, ECOMOG troops launch barrage from Freetown

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ West African troops fighting for
Sierra Leone's government pounded the outskirts of the capital with
heavy artillery and air attacks Wednesday morning amid fears of a
rebel advance on the city.
	   But after several hours of shelling, the Nigerian-led West
African force called ECOMOG said the supposed rebel attack they had
been trying to repel was a false alarm.
	   There were no immediate damage or casualty reports from the
attack, which occurred in the heavily wooded Mount Aureol
neighborhood near Freetown's Fourah Bay College overlooking the
coastal city.
	   ``After a couple of hours of heavy bombardment, ECOMOG
discovered there were no rebels,'' Information Minister Julius
Spencer said in a state radio broadcast.
	   ``It is possible there will be a repeat of this morning's
incident from time to time because ECOMOG is concerned that nothing
goes wrong in Freetown. They will use maximum force,'' Spencer
added.
	   The bombardment followed several days of fighting between ECOMOG
and rebels in towns surrounding Freetown.
	   Thousands of refugees have poured into Sierra Leone's capital
Tuesday while the rebel alliance, which is based in remote jungle
hideouts in the country's interior, drew nearer to the city.
	   Villagers carried their few possessions on their heads and slept
in the sweltering sun in the city along sidewalks while others
pitched tents and some sought shelter in shop doorways.
	   Although Sierra Leone's roads and towns are mostly controlled by
ECOMOG and the civilian Kamajor militiamen also fighting on behalf
of the government, bands of rebels somehow made their way to heavy
forests within a short distance from the capital past hundreds of
military checkpoints.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah insisted on state radio Tuesday
night that ECOMOG and the Kamajors had ``virtually destroyed'' the
attackers, who he said were being led by Sam Bockarie and Dennis
Musa, two of the rebels' most feared leaders known by their
nicknames ``Maskita (Mosquito)'' and ``Superman.''
	   Witnesses said Tuesday the rebel fighters burned houses and
randomly killed civilians with assault rifles in the town of
Wellington, about 20 miles to the east. The chairman of Sierra
Leone's YMCA was killed after his eyes were gouged out by the
rebels.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its rebel allies since
March, when Kabbah returned to power following the the ouster of
the ruling military junta that had deposed him last year.
	   Sierra Leone's rebellious military was deposed earlier this
year, when Kabbah handed over national defense duties to the
Kamajors and ECOMOG.
	   The rebels are believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of rural villagers in a revenge campaign aimed at
widening their influence through fear.

King Birendra appoints reappoints Nepali prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ King Birendra re-appointed Girija Prasad
Koirala as Nepal's prime minister on Wednesday, three days after he
lost his parliamentary majority and then cobbled together another
coalition, a palace statement said.
	   Nepal's politics has been in turmoil since no party has a clear
majority in Parliament and successive governments have been
short-lived. Koirala is the fifth prime minister in the last four
years.
	   Koirala's Nepali Congress party will govern along with the
United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal and the Nepal
Goodwill Party. The parties will jointly contest the general
elections to be held by April.
	   ``Elections will be held by April 13 as agreed between the
parties,'' Koirala said Wednesday. The Nepalese calendar year ends
that day.
	   Another leftist party, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of
Nepal, brought down Koirala's government over local disputes.
	   The other communist party then backed Koirala after he agreed to
advance the November general elections.
	   Koirala's Nepali Congress, which has 87 seats, holds a majority
in the 205-member legislature with the help of 49 communists and
three lawmakers from the Goodwill Party.
	   Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy, but a pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that reduced King Birendra
to a figurehead.

Vatican, San Marino working out how to mint euros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ San Marino as well as the Vatican, which have been
using the Italian lira, are trying to work out the details of
minting euros.
	   On Jan. 1, European Monetary Union goes into effect, with Italy
among the 11 charter members from the European Union. While
electronic transactions, including credit card purchase and banking
transfers, can start on that date, the actual euro hard currency
will go into circulation in 2002 and lire will then go out of use.
	   French-franc-using Monaco, another independent state, at the
edge of France, is in a situation similar to that of San Marino and
the Vatican.
	   Italian newspapers reported Wednesday that San Marino, a tiny
republic on the Italian peninsula, was trying to work out an
arrangement with the Italian state mint, which would physically
produce the San Marino euros.
	   As for the Vatican, now that the European Commission on Monday
agreed to allow the three small states to use the euro, ``all the
details of this new reality must now be negotiated,'' said Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
	   But Navarro-Valls, in his brief statement Tuesday, made no
mention of a potentially controversial aspect -- whether or not the
pope's image would be on any Vatican euro.
	   In October, a French newspaper reported that Paris would not
recognize any euro coins stamped with the image of the pope.

Responsibility claimed for bomb at German Jewish leader's grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin prosecutors said Wednesday they were
investigating a letter claiming responsibility for a weekend bomb
blast at the grave of a German Jewish leader.
	   In the letter, sent to prosecutors and a Berlin newspaper, the
alleged perpetrator denies any extreme-right political motive,
claiming he wanted mainly to protest against the renaming of a
Berlin street after the late leader, Heinz Galinski.
	   Justice Department spokesman Matthias Rebentisch declined to
release any more details, saying only that the letter was being
examined to determine if it is authentic.
	   The Saturday night bombing at a Jewish cemetery in western
Berlin stirred nationwide shock. The homemade bomb destroyed a
marble slab marking Galinski's grave.
	   Galinski headed Germany's Central Council of Jews from 1988
until his death in 1992. He had headed Berlin's Jewish community
since 1949.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Saudi Arabia will establish their
first direct shipping links within two weeks, the Iranian Commerce
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Ships will ply the Gulf waters between the eastern Saudi port of
Dammam and the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, a ministry
spokesman said.
	   In addition, the two states will shortly allow planes to fly
between the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and the northeastern
Iranian city of Mashhad as well as between the Saudi capital,
Riyadh, and the southern Iranian city of Shiraz, the spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He did not give a date for the new air links.
	   The holy city of Mashhad is the burial site of Imam Reza, a
Shiite Muslim saint. Saudi Arabia's minority Shiite population of
two million is based in the eastern province, which is served by
Dhahran airport.
	   The two countries established air links between the Saudi port
of Jiddah and the Iranian capital, Tehran, last year after a gap of
18 years.
	   Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari signed the
accord on the new links earlier this week while on a visit to Saudi
Arabia, said the spokesman.
	   ____
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has finalized plans to set up a gas
refinery in the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The refinery will be built in the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat, at
a cost of dlrs 50 million, the agency said, quoting the head of
Iran's oil ministry office in Turkmenistan, Karim Tafreshi.
	   Construction will start soon and is expected to be completed
within 27 months, the agency said.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The new head of the Kuwait Investment Authority,
the government's foreign investment arm, is to be Abdul-Mohsen
al-Hneif, the Kuwait News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Al-Hneif is an undersecretary at the Finance Ministry and a
member of the KIA board.
	   KIA manages Kuwait's empire of foreign investments, which is
estimated at dlrs 40 billion.
	   Its current managing director, Ali al-Bader, had said he is not
interested in renewing his contract, which expires at the end of
the year.
	   KUNA quoted the finance minister, Sheik Ali Salem al-Ali
al-Sabah, as saying the decision to appoint al-Hneif was made by
KIA's board of directors at their meeting Wednesday. He thanked
al-Bader for a fruitful six-year tenure.
	   Al-Hneif will be appointed initially as ``acting'' managing
director.

Yeltsin tries to give tax collectors more authority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the latest attempt to boost Russia's tax
revenues, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has given the Federal Tax
Service new authority by transforming it into a new ministry, the
presidential press service said Wednesday.
	   The Ministry on Taxes and Collections has been established in
order to ``strengthen state control over the prompt transfer of
taxes and other obligatory payments to the government ... and over
the production and distribution of alcohol,'' said the presidential
decree.
	   The Russian tax system is considered unusually complicated and
taxes punitive, leading to widespread tax evasion and perennial
underfunding of the government.
	   Earlier this month, Yeltsin took personal control of the tax
police, who have carried out a few controversial, highly publicized
raids on the homes and offices of prominent businessmen.
	   Yeltsin appointed the present head of the tax service, Georgy
Boos, head of the new ministry.

Kyrgyzstan's government resigns amid economic shortcomings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with acting prime minister named. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) _ With the economy stumbling,
Kyrgyzstan's entire government resigned Wednesday and President
Askar Akayev named an acting prime minister to revive the fortunes
of the small, impoverished Central Asian nation.
	   Like many ex-Soviet republics, Kyrgyzstan has felt the
aftershocks of the economic crisis that hit Russia. But Akayev also
accused his Cabinet of incompetence in dealing with the country's
economic problems.
	   ``It is impossible to work with such a Cabinet,'' Akayev was
quoted as saying by the presidential press service. He said
Kyrgyzstan should enter the new year with ``a new, more capable
government.''
	   Akayev has led Kyrgyzstan since it won independence in the 1991
Soviet breakup. The country has enjoyed political stability, but
there's been minimal economic development in the mountainous
country, which has little industry.
	   The president named Boris Silayev, who was deputy prime
minister, as the acting prime minister, replacing Kubanychbek
Zhumaliyev, Russian news agencies reported.
	   ``The previous government has not committed grave errors,''
Silayev, 53, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. But,
he added, it was slow to implement economic reforms and did not
respond quickly after Russia's economy slid into turmoil in August.
	   He also said that Kyrgyzstan could not shift the blame for its
own problems.
	   ``We should stop blaming everything on Russia,'' Silayev said.
``Kyrgyzstan is still suffering from its own unsettled problems.''
	   According to government figures, the economy has grown 1.7
percent this year, which would make Kyrgyzstan one of the few
ex-Soviet republics that hasn't seen an economic contraction in
1998.
	   However, the country suffers from high inflation, a trade
deficit and a weakening currency.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel early Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, expecting retaliation for an Israeli
airstrike in Lebanon the day before that killed seven civilians.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the electricity was
knocked out in some areas but later restored. Another rocket bore a
hole in an apartment building, scattering sheets of plaster and
hunks of twisted metal on the ground below.
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   Northern Israel had braced for an attack by Hezbollah guerrillas
after Israeli airstrike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children
in eastern Lebanon. That was the highest civilian casualty toll
this year in the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying they
had been accidental and that the target of the airstrike had been a
Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   Even so, senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan called the rocket
attack ``totally unwarranted'' and warned it could lead to an
escalation of the war in Lebanon.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai noted that the morning
barrage was timed to hit when the guerrillas had apparently thought
people would be leaving their shelters.
	   ``There is a difference between a malfunction we are sorry for
... and an intended action to harm civilians at a time when they
thought they would be on their way out to schools and other
places,'' he said.
	   One Cabinet minister called for Israel to retaliate by knocking
out electricity to Beirut.
	   ``You can't have a sovereign country that puts its residents
into shelters while we ... sit helpless and wait for Katyusha
rockets,'' Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told army
radio.
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks. ``Murderers must pay the price
of their crimes,'' the statement said. ``We renew our pledge to
protect our people and their villages, no matter how great the
struggle.''
	   Dozens of rockets were fired in Wednesday's attack, falling with
enormous booms that could be heard for miles.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   ``My entire house was destroyed, covered in glass,'' a woman
whose house was hit told army radio. ``I lay down on top of my son
_ I threw him down on the floor so he wouldn't be hurt.''
	   Hezbollah guerrillas last fired rockets on Kiryat Shemona in
August, after Israel killed a leading southern Lebanese guerrilla.
	   More rockets were fired at the western Galilee region, closer to
the Mediterranean sea. Some fell harmlessly into the sea, but
others collapsed roofs of houses in villages and collective farms.
	   In the western Galilee, eyewitnesses said one rocket hit a house
where agricultural workers from Thailand lived _ just minutes after
the workers left the building. The house was heavily damaged, but
none of the workers was hurt.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Demonstrators burn photos of Indian actress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nearly 50 Nepalese protesters Wednesday
burned photographs of an Indian actress who in a radio interview
said the Himalayan nation was once part of India.
	   They gathered outside Madhuri Dixit's hotel and demanded that
she apologize for the comments made Tuesday. The actress is
visiting Katmandu for the release of an album from her new movie.
	   Dixit's costar in the movie, Akshaya Kumar, apologized to the
crowd for Dixit's comments. Nepal, a predominantly Hindu nation,
was never part of India.
	   Police later dispersed the protesters. Indian film stars are
revered in Nepal where most theaters run Hindi language movies.

Milosevic's wife calls for closer ties with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The influential neo-communist wife
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has blasted America's
``aggressive'' policies and is calling for closer ties with Russia.
	   During her two-day trip to Moscow this week , Mira Markovic said
Russia, China and India should form an alliance against U.S.
domination, according to reports in the state-run media here.
	   ``The great Russian, Chinese and Indian people are capable of
taking over the responsibility for the fate of the whole world,''
the newspaper Politika quoted her as saying.
	   Her remarks reflected those of Russia's Communists who have
called for a defense partnership with India and China to offset
what they perceive as the military dominance of the United States.
China has rejected such an axis.
	   ``Mira Markovic expressed her conviction that a new
counter-balance to NATO and aggressive aspirations of the U.S. will
be formed on the Euro-Asian territory,'' Politika said.
	   Markovic's trip to Russia Monday and Tuesday received wide
coverage by Belgrade's state-run press. In Moscow, she met Russian
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov; the Communist speaker of
Russia's lower house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov; and Russian
Patriarch Alexy II.
	   Politika said that during Markovic's trip, she and her hosts
concluded that ``the West threatens Slavic peoples'' and that they
should unite ``against the contemporary tyranny'' of the United
States.
	   She received ``honorary membership'' by Russia's writers union
for her three books of diaries which are often ridiculed by some
Yugoslav authors for their literary value.
	   Markovic's JUL neo-communist party is allied with Milosevic's
Socialists and ultra-nationalist Radicals in Serbia's government.
	   Opposition parties in Serbia have seen Markovic's trip to Russia
as her attempt to form a formal alliance of Russia, Belarus and
Yugoslavia, apparently in the spirit of common Slavic roots,
Orthodox religion and distrust to West and NATO.
	   The idea was launched by Serbia's ultra-nationalist official
Vojislav Seselj in the wake of NATO's threats to bomb Serbia
because of Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanians in the
troubled Kosovo province.
	   But Serbia's opposition officials have claimed that the real
idea behind the proposed alliance is to cement the
communist-nationalist rule in Serbia which has been shaken by deep
social, economic and political problems.

NATO troops remove Croatian police from disputed border area

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force in
Bosnia removed Croatian police Wednesday from a disputed area along
the western border with Croatia, drawing an angry response from
Zagreb.
	   The action in Martin Brod, some 220 kilometers (150 miles) west
of Bosnia's capital Sarajevo, was carried out without incident. But
it prompted President Franjo Tudjman to ask NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana and the alliance's commander for Europe, Wesley
Clark, that the NATO troops _ Canadian peacekeepers _ be withdrawn
immediately.
	   ``Such a one-sided action ... could have unforeseen harmful
consequences,'' Croatia's National Security Council said in a
statement carried by state-run radio.
	   Tudjman called an emergency session of the top national body,
the radio said.
	   Civilian authorities should take control of the disputed area
until the two countries solve the dispute, the statement said.
	   Earlier this week, Tudjman said he was ready to send his troops
to Martin Brod if NATO-led troops attempted to take control of the
now Croat-controlled half of the city.
	   The top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
said he was disappointed such an action had to be taken but
indicated it came only after Croatia failed to keep promises it
would remove the police in question.
	   In a statement issued by his office, he also said the situation
was not helped by recent inflammatory public speeches. He said he
hoped such disputes can be resolved in the future by the joint
border commission.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO secretary general Willy Claes
received a three-year suspended jail sentence Wednesday after being
convicted of corruption in two defense contracts he awarded as
economics minister in the late 1980s.
	   After a four month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year
suspended sentences each to ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
former vice-premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge Dassault, 75, head
of France's Dassault aviation concern after convicting them of
corruption, too.
	   Eight former aides and associates received suspended sentences
of up to two years, also for corruption. All defendants lost their
civic rights meaning they cannot vote in elections or run for
office for up to five years.
	   The court said Claes, 60, had to know that when Italy's Agusta
SpA said it was ready to pay 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million)
to win a December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters, it was a
bribe for his Dutch-speaking socialist party.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a summation of the case that took four hours to read out.
	   He said Claes' and others bent the contract rules at the expense
of France's Aerospatiale SA which had a valid rival bid for
helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June, 1989, deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat rival
Litton Industries Inc. of the United States. Another 30 million
francs (almost dlrs 900,000) from Dassault ended up in the coffers
of French-speaking socialists.
	   The Agusta and Dassault contracts were worth hundreds of
millions of dollars each.
	   Claes and the other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2,
pleading innocent. All attended the sentencing hearing. In addition
to suspended jail terms, Claes and three former aides were ordered
to repay 110 million francs (dlrs 3.2 million).
	   Appeal to the high court ruling is not possible.
	   A haggard-looking Claes hurried out through a side door and made
no statement. The others expressed shock.
	   ``In the 11 years as president of the (French-speaking)
socialist party, the socialist party never committed an act of
corruption,'' said Spitaels. ``I will defend that on my children's
honor until my last breath.''
	   Coeme, the former defense minister, said he was innocent and
spoke of ``an enormous judicial error.''
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The high court trial came after the parliamentary immunity of
Claes and the others had been been lifted.
	   It was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the 1990s,
ran their political families out of their wallets, unhindered by
laws banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations. Thus,
prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid in 1988
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a onetime socialist minister slain in 1991, presumably
because he knew of financial wrongdoing in socialist ranks.
	   Claes became NATO secretary general Sept. 29, 1994. He quit 13
months when the investigation into his role in the Agusta case
heated up making it untenable for him to stay at the western
alliance.
	   He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party.
	   For Coeme, a francophone socialist, the trial was his second in
two years. In 1996, the supreme court gave him a two-year suspended
jail term for corruption involving phony, opinion surveys at
government expense.

Experts split over cause of fire at Turin cathedral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Experts looking into the 1997 fire in the
cathedral housing the shroud of Turin are split over whether the
blaze was an accident or arson.
	   Italian newspapers reported Wednesday that three members of the
team concluded it was an accident, while one thought the fire was
deliberately set.
	   The fire involved the cathedral and adjoining chapel, where the
shroud was kept.
	   The burial cloth many believe shrouded Jesus was rescued
undamaged by firemen, but the flames devastated the marble-faced
chapel, the wooden dome of the cathedral and some of the Royal
Palace nearby.
	   Turin province's chief firefighter, Michele Ferraro, blamed the
fire on arson, concluding the flames had spread too fast for an
accident.
	   The three other experts said an overheated stove or lamp sparked
the fire, which then fed off flammable solvents being used in the
cathedral at the time for restoration work.
	   Those three ruled out arson, saying there were no signs of a
break-in and that chemical analysis did not reveal the presence of
any extraneous material that would have been brought in by an
arsonist.
	   All four experts, who are aiding investigators, agreed that the
cathedral's security and fire hazard system had been inadequately
maintained. They said damage would have been greatly reduced if the
system had been functioning properly.
	   Restoration of the palace and the shroud's chapel is expected to
last another four years.
	   The shroud went on display for several weeks earlier this year
and will next go on view in 2000.

Court recommends sentence reductions for anti-Basque 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
convicts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government on Wednesday pardoned a
former interior minister and his deputy for their role in a `dirty
war' against Basque separatists, reducing their 10-year jail
sentences by two-thirds.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
granted the partial pardon to ex-minister Jose Barrionuevo, 56, and
his ex-chief of state security, Rafael Vera, 53, based on a
recommendation of the Supreme Court of Justice.
	   The ruling entitles the two men to apply for further benefits,
including the chance to spend most of their time at home.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   Wednesday's pardon also affects eight other government officials
and policemen convicted for the abduction, the first violation
attributed to the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or
GAL.
	   GAL killed 27 people over the next five years in a campaign
against ETA. Many of its victims were mistaken targets.
	   Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has long maintained that
both Barrionuevo and Vera, who worked in his Socialist government,
had nothing to do with the GAL.
	   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court recommended the partial pardon. It
argued that the kidnapping, though a serious criminal act, had
taken place 15 years ago and that Barrionuevo or Vera had not
sought personal benefit.
	   After a four-hour hearing the court recommended similar
reductions for eight other convicts in the case who were sentenced
to two to 10 years in jail.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It has
been observing a unilateral cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there
are moves afoot for negotiations to resolve the conflict.

Air France pilots agree to reform plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pilots of France's state-owned airline Air France
have voted to accept a pay cut in exchange for company shares,
enabling the airline to implement its three-year reform plan.
	   The majority pilot union, SNPL, said Wednesday that 78.2 percent
of pilots who voted agreed to the reform.
	   The proposal finalized in October provides for a definitive, but
voluntary, annual pay cut of 11,575 francs (dlrs 2,104) in exchange
for Air France shares.
	   The cut represents between 2 and 3 percent of salary.
	   Pilots may chose a further pay cut of 12,000 francs (dlrs 2,181)
per year for a maximum of seven years, and will be granted
additional stocks.
	   Refusal to agree to a pay cut in exchange for shares was one of
the main reasons behind a June pilots' strike that disrupted the
World Cup.
	   Air France refused to back down and the pilots came under
pressure from other company employees to agree to the deal.
	   The flag carrier's goal is to bring its payrolls in line with
its competitors' levels.
	   The company may also subcontract up to 5 percent of the distance
traveled by aircraft of between 51 and 100 seats.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel asked an
independent lawmaker in Turkey's Cabinet to form a new government
Wednesday after a veteran leftist leader failed to gather enough
support in parliament.
	   Demirel picked Yalim Erez, the industry and trade minister, in
hopes he could draw wide support from Turkey's bickering political
parties.
	   Erez told reporters he would search for consensus, saying, ``I
am at an equal distance to all of the parties.''
	   ``Today is not a day for political squabbles and small political
calculations,'' he said. ``Turkey has no more patience for a
government crisis.''
	   The government of Mesut Yilmaz, who is now acting premier,
collapsed last month in a vote of no-confidence over a mafia and
corruption scandal.
	   Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party abandoned efforts to
form a new government on Monday after a 3-week-old attempt failed
to receive enough backing to secure a majority in Parliament.
	   Demirel turned to an independent lawmaker instead of a party
leader after most parties _ unable to overcome their differences to
form alliances _ said they would support a government led by a
low-profile figure until April elections.
	   The president bucked the longstanding tradition of designating
the leader of the largest party in Parliament as premier _ which
would have brought the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party to power.
	   The military would have been sure to oppose such a government.
Turkey's generals pressured an Islamic predecessor of the Virtue
Party out of power in June 1997, accusing it of trying to raise the
profile of Islam in society.
	   Erez appears to be chosen in part because he sided with the
pro-secular establishment. He resigned from a ministerial post that
he held during an earlier coalition between his center-right True
Path Party and the earlier Islamic party in April 1997, two months
after the military warned the government to abide by Turkey's
strictly secular constitution.
	   On Tuesday, Turkey's top general, Huseyin Kivrikoglu, issued a
statement reminding the country that the armed forces were
committed to protecting secular traditions.
	   Erez, 54, a businessman-turned-politican, must now undergo a
vote of confidence in parliament to determine whether he can
command a majority of votes. He said he would start negotiations on
a new coalition on Monday, when he will talk with Virtue leaders.
	   A Virtue lawmaker, Ali Goren, said his party could support Erez
``as long as he intends to form a broad-based government.''
	   Even if Erez loses the vote of confidence, Demirel legally could
still ask him to govern until the April elections seat a new
parliament.
	   Erez reportedly has the backing of Ecevit and Yilmaz. Tansu
Ciller's True Path party declared it would not back Erez.
	   Erez is of Kurdish origins. Kurds are a minority in Turkey and
claim discrimination by the establishment. Kurdish rebels are
fighting a 14-year-old guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast.
	   Erez raised controversy in 1995 when he advocated social and
economic measures _ as well as military means _ to improve life in
the Kurdish-dominated southeast. Lately, the military itself has
supported the idea.
	   Turkey has had other prominent government leaders of Kurdish
origins, including current parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and late
President Turgut Ozal.

Pinochet may leave house for medical treatment, not Mass
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates with Pinochet can leave house for urgent treatment,
not church service. Pre-trial hearing moved back to Feb. 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet may leave his home if needs
urgent medical treatment but the former Chilean dictator would not
be allowed out for Christmas church services, a judge said
Wednesday.
	   In an application to Bow Street Magistrates Court in central
London, Pinochet's lawyer, Michael Caplan, did not ask that the
general be allowed to attend Mass.
	   But because of heavy press speculation that he would do so,
Caplan told the judge that his client would be seen by a priest on
Christmas Eve at the house.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
agreed that a private service was better.
	   ``I would not have agreed to him going to church. It has got to
come to him,'' Parkinson said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile and is fighting a bid to
extradite him to Spain
	   The court on Wednesday did agree that Pinochet should be allowed
to leave his rented home if he needed urgent medical or dental
treatment.
	   Caplan said Pinochet had received some dental treatment in the
house a few days ago.
	   On hearing that the Spanish government, represented in court by
Campaspe Lloyd-Jacob, did not object to the bail conditions being
amended in this way, Parkinson agreed to the change.
	   Parkinson also agreed to move the date of General Pinochet's
pre-trial hearing back from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1 to allow his lawyers'
appeal to the House of Lords against the extradition case to be
heard fully.
	   Jan. 18 is expected to be the date the Lords, Britain's highest
court, will rehear Pinochet's claim that under British law his
status as a former foreign head of state gives him immunity.
	   On Dec. 17, the Lords set aside the original ruling against
immunity because a judge failed to disclose his ties to Amnesty
International.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Wednesday partially pardoned
a former interior minister and his deputy for their role in a
`dirty war' against Basque separatists, reducing their 10-year jail
sentences by two-thirds.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
granted the pardon to ex-minister Jose Barrionuevo, 56, and his
ex-chief of state security, Rafael Vera, 53, following a
recommendation of the Supreme Court of Justice.
	   The ruling entitles the two men to apply for further benefits,
including an open-prison regime allowing them to spend most of
their time at home.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   Wednesday's partial pardon also affects eight other government
officials and policemen convicted for the abduction that was the
first act attributed to the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation
Groups, or GAL.
	   GAL killed 27 people over the next five years in a campaign
against ETA. Many of its victims were mistaken targets.
	   Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has long maintained that
both Barrionuevo and Vera, who worked in his Socialist government,
had nothing to do with the GAL.
	   On Tuesday the Supreme Court recommended the partial pardon
arguing that although the kidnapping was a serious criminal act, it
had taken place 15 years ago and that Barrionuevo or Vera had not
been seeking personal benefits.
	   After a four-hour hearing the court recommended similar
reductions for eight other people it had found guilty in the same
case in July and sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 10
years.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It has
been observing a unilateral cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there
are moves afoot for negotiations to resolve the conflict.

Live carp for sale, hay under the tablecloth: It's Christmas in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With a nod and a point, then a wave of
dismissal, Krystyna Marcherek took her time Wednesday in choosing a
crucial component of her family's Christmas tradition _ a fat,
squirming carp.
	   In decades past, her mother and grandmother probably bought
their's from a street vendor, but Marcherek stood four deep in line
at a giant, modern supermarket.
	   Surroundings have changed as Poland modernizes in its march to
the West, but Christmas traditions of yesteryear remain firmly
entrenched.
	   In this predominantly Roman Catholic country, Christmas and
Easter are the holiest times of the year, each steeped in religious
practices while taking on a distinctly Polish flavor.
	   Opinion polls released this week indicated most Poles _ 80
percent or more _ will follow at least some time-honored
traditions, many with religious ties.
	   The main event of the holiday is the Christmas Eve dinner, when
families gather to celebrate. Most will abstain from meat, place
hay beneath the tablecloth to recreate the manger of Jesus' birth,
share a wafer among all present, sing carols and celebrate a
midnight Mass.
	   Even political leaders get in the act. Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek had a wafer-sharing ceremony Tuesday with several political,
artistic and religious leaders. Local media widely reported the
event.
	   Rev. Adam Schulz, a spokesman for the Polish Episcopate,
explained the religious roots of most of the traditions. Abstaining
from meat on Christmas Eve is a way of preparing for Christ's birth
through cleansing, he said, while sharing the wafer means sharing
the bread of life, which Schulz called a symbol of forgiveness and
reconciliation in the family.
	   Singing carols is a form of prayer leading to the midnight Mass,
the most spiritual event in preparing for Christ's coming, Schulz
said.
	   Without meat at the Christmas Eve supper, most Poles opt for
carp because it is easily available, relatively cheap and, well,
the tradition.
	   At the Carrefour hypermarket in a Warsaw suburb, Marcherek, 50,
waited patiently for her turn to pick from an overcrowded tub of
large, slimy carp selling for 6.99 zlotys per kilogram (just under
dlrs 1 per pound).
	   She shook her head at the first offering, about 18 inches (45
centimeters) long. A second also was rejected before she settled on
a slightly larger, plumper specimen immediately shoved into a
plastic bag and left writhing in her cart.
	   ``The best are carp without shells,'' she said, still wearing
her winter gear _ blue knit cap, gray scarf, heavy coat and boots _
while standing in the jostling crowd. ``You don't have to scrub the
shells off, they are easier to prepare.''
	   Off to the side, Tomasz Denis, 20, watched the commotion before
wading in to buy a live carp for his parents.
	   ``We will put it in the bath tub so it can swim for a while
longer,'' he said. ``Tomorrow morning, my father will kill it.''
	   Tomorrow morning? What if someone wants to bathe Wednesday
night?
	   ``No, because the carp will be in the tub,'' he laughed. ``The
carp is more important.''

Lukashenko boasts economic growth, admits poverty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko announced
Wednesday that Belarus has seen remarkable economic growth this
year, but admitted that the nation is mired in poverty.
	   Lukashenko, who addressed a government meeting setting next
year's economic guidelines, said the gross domestic product had
risen by 8 percent this year.
	   ``Nonetheless, the people's life is nasty,'' he added.
	   Western economists say that Belarus' economic statistics distort
the real situation in the economy, which is paralyzed by the rigid
Soviet-era state controls.
	   The generous infusion of cash into the economy has created a
false impression of growth, but also contributed to the steady fall
of the national currency. With prices controlled by the state,
store shelves have emptied, leading to rationing and long lines for
basic food reminiscent of the Soviet era.
	   The average salary now is the equivalent of around dlrs 20 a
month.
	   Fallout from the latest economic crisis in Russia _ Belarus'
main trading partner _ has made the situation even worse.
	   Lukashenko says he keeps state controls over prices to prevent a
further drop in living standards. He gives regular, public
scoldings to top officials, blaming them for the food shortages.
	   ``The main target for the next year is to ensure a normal life
for the Belarusian people,'' he told officials Wednesday.
	   Lukashenko said that average monthly inflation amounted to 7
percent this year instead of the 2 percent target. However, even
that figure appears unrealistic, as the Belarusian ruble fell from
about 40,000 to the dollar early this year to more than 200,000
now.
	   Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union, sees a way out of
the current economic turmoil in a closer alliance with its giant
eastern neighbor, Russia.
	   During a trip to Moscow last week, he pushed for setting up a
single currency _ a tacit way of asking for Russian subsidies. The
cash-strapped Russian government hasn't given an immediate answer.
	   However, a Belarusian government official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Wednesday that Lukashenko will again visit
Moscow later this week to sign ``landmark'' agreements with
President Boris Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One agreement would allow Belarus to buy Russia's natural gas at
a domestic price that is far lower than the world market price, it
said. Belarus depends on Russia for its energy resources and has
run up a huge debt for previous supplies.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Breezy to windy conditions will prevail through Christmas, with
occasional patches of clouds and showers producing varying amounts
of sunshine.
	   Satellite photos this morning show a more concentrated area of
low clouds and showers lined up from the Virgin Islands eastward
for a few hundred miles, with winds becoming a bit more easterly
this morning.
	   These clouds and showers are likely to march due west through
the local area this afternoon and evening to produce a higher
frequency of showers.
	   The forecast calls for a 50 percent chance of showers across
most of the area this afternoon. However, depending on your exact
location this afternoon, you could see several passing showers
across your area.
	   A perfectly circular low-level cloud swirl clearly evident on
satellite photos the past few days was moving west-southwest into
the northern windward islands late this morning and was weakening.
	   This system has weakened into a surface trough and will move
well south of our local area this evening and tonight. This may
cause a further increase in wind and seas across our already rough
coastal waters and may produce wind gusts in excess of 30 knots.
	   Small craft advisories are now in effect for all local waters
and will likely remain in effect through Christmas.

Elton upsets British soccer establishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rock star Sir Elton John stunned Britain's soccer
establishment in a rare public outing as chairman of division one
team Watford by describing Premier League players as lazy and
overpaid.
	   The multi-millionaire entertainer dominated British sports
headlines Wednesday after attending a press conference Tuesday with
Watford manager and former England coach Graham Taylor.
	   ``Premiership prima donnas keep on breaking Elton John's
heart,'' the broadsheet Daily Telegraph reported, while the Daily
Express described John's comments as a ``Rocket from the rocket
man.''
	   In John's first press conference at the Watford club in almost
three years, he described the 18-million-pound (dlrs 30 million)
transfer price tag on England striker Alan Shearer as ``ridiculous
for someone who hasn't found his form after coming back from injury
and didn't play well at the World Cup.''
	   ``The cost of players is spiralling out of control. People say
the Premiership is the finest league in the world but you can't say
that from results in Europe,'' he said.
	   ``Then you see the players' attitudes _ they are paid so much
money and they are just strolling around the pitch.''
	   John also said England coach Glen Hoddle had allowed petty
jealousy to influence his handling of Manchester United midfielder
David Beckham early in the World Cup.
	   Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said Wednesday that John was
entitled to his opinion but was missing the true picture.
	   ``No-one is suggesting that the Premiership is perfect, but
there is much to be proud of and many countries around the world
look at the Premier League with admiration and envy,'' he said.
	   ``English football in general is in a very healthy state.''
	   John said Watford, currently fourth in the division one
standings, had ambitions of elevation to the Premier League but
would struggle to compete with the big budget clubs in the market.

NATO officials voice concern over worsening situation in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned with the
fast-deteriorating situation in Kosovo, two top NATO officials
warned both sides in the conflict Wednesday against launching more
attacks.
	   NATO's top commander for Europe, American Gen. Wesley Clark,
complained of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police
activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said the
alliance is watching closely to ensure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed at
halting bloodshed in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Echoing the security concerns, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings
in recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The officials' comments came as reports said one man was killed
and three others wounded in the latest two shootouts in Kosovo _ in
the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica and in a suburb of the
capital Pristina late Tuesday.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said an unidentified gunman burst into
an Albanian-owned bar in Kosovska Mitrovica wounded two ethnic
Albanians, one of whom died Wednesday. The survivor is known for
his loyalty to Serbian authorities.
	   Police sealed off the district where the bar is located and were
pursuing the perpetrator, the report said.
	   Two Serbian police officers were also reported wounded when
``terrorists'' opened fire with machine-guns in a Pristina suburb,
the Serb center said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the
all-out war that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and
Serb security forces from February to October. During that time
some 1,000 people lost their lives and another 300,000 lost their
homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities were not in
conformance with Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He
reiterated that Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade
have been told they ``must comply with their promises made to
NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case the unarmed international verifiers in Kosovo are
threatened.
	   International officials also have criticized Kosovo Albanian
rebels for endangering the cease-fire by carrying out provocative
missions.
	   Solana warned both sides ``not to try to use the Christmas and
New Year period to launch attacks or to conduct operations which
would undermine the fragile security situation in Kosovo and
further jeopardize the prospects for a peaceful solution.''
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''
	   Also Wednesday, 26 ethnic Albanians went on trial in Pristina,
charged with ``terrorism and hostile activity against the state''
for allegedly carrying out three armed attacks. Nine of the men
have been in custody since June, while the others will be tried in
absentia.
	   The trial adjourned shortly after court opened and the defense
was given until mid-January to prepare the case and examine new
evidence.
	   The Albanians' defense lawyer, Rexhep Haxhimusa, told reporters
the trial was political and staged, lacking firm evidence against
his clients.

Thousands of teachers go on strike in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 29,000 children in Ukraine stayed
home from school Wednesday because teachers across the country have
joined a strike to protest unpaid wages, the Education Ministry
said.
	   Nearly 2,500 teachers at 44 schools in four Ukrainian regions
were protesting Wednesday, more than double the number on strike
last week. Of these, 28 schools already have been closed for nearly
two months, the ministry said.
	   Scattered protests involving thousands of the former Soviet
republic's 500,000 teachers began at the start of the school year
in September.
	   Wage debts have continued their steady rise despite the
protests, reaching 456 million hryvna (dlrs 133 million) as of last
week, the ministry said.
	   The debt could further increase after the New Year because extra
money will have to be allocated to provide heating for schools in
many rural areas, education officials say.
	   Ukraine's government has chronic problems in collecting taxes,
leaving it without money to pay huge wage debts.

German defense minister visits Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ German Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping arrived for a pre-Christmas visit to his troops
serving the NATO-led peace force mission in Bosnia on Wednesday.
	   During his visit to the Bosnian capital, Scharping met
commanders of the NATO-led peace force and his soldiers in the
German base in the Sarajevo suburb of Rajlovac.
	   Sharping said based on what he'd seen on the ground, Bosnia's
main problems no longer concern the military, but civil
reconstruction, the lack of cooperation between the ethnic groups
and protecting security.
	   He emphasized that multi-ethnic civilian projects are a large
part of what German troops are doing in Bosnia.
	   ``The Bundeswehr is cooperating only with those companies who
have workers from all three ethnic groups,'' he said. ``This way a
signal is sent out that if they can work together ... they can live
together.''
	   Germany currently contributes some 3,000 troops to the
32,000-strong international peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
	   Asked how long the German soldiers will stay in Bosnia,
Scharping said: ``I believe, that we will stay for a longer time,
just like everybody else.''
	   It's the second time Scharping has visited German troops in
Bosnia since he took the post.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets at northern Israel early Wednesday, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people. Israel swore to
react.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, expecting retaliation for an Israeli
air strike in Lebanon the day before that killed seven civilians.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the electricity was
knocked out in some areas but later restored. Another rocket bore a
hole in an apartment building, scattering sheets of plaster and
hunks of twisted metal on the ground below.
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations,
when we want. And we will react.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO secretary general Willy Claes
received a three-year suspended jail sentence Wednesday after being
convicted of corruption in two defense contracts he awarded in the
late 1980s while economics minister.
	   After a four-month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year
suspended sentences for corruption to ex-defense minister Guy
Coeme, 52, former vice-premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge
Dassault, 75, head of France's Dassault aviation concern.
	   Eight former aides and associates received suspended sentences
of up to two years, also for corruption. All defendants lost the
right to vote in elections or run for office for up to five years.
	   The court said Claes, 60, had to know that Italy's Agusta SpA
offer to pay 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to win a
December 1988 contract for 46 army helicopters was a bribe for his
Dutch-speaking socialist party.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a decision that took four hours to read.
	   He said Claes' and others bent the rules at the expense of
France's Aerospatiale SA, which was also bidding for the contract.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June 1989 deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat a U.S.
rival, Litton Industries Inc. Another 30 million francs (almost
dlrs 900,000) from Dassault ended up in the coffers of
French-speaking socialists.
	   The Agusta and Dassault contracts were each worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
	   Claes and the other 11 defendants, who pleaded innocent, went on
trial Sept. 2. In addition to suspended jail terms, Claes and three
former aides were ordered to repay 110 million francs (dlrs 3.2
million).
	   Appeals of the high court ruling are not possible.
	   A haggard-looking Claes hurried out through a side door and made
no statement. The others expressed shock.
	   ``In the 11 years as president of the (French-speaking)
socialist party, the socialist party never committed an act of
corruption,'' said Spitaels. ``I will defend that on my children's
honor until my last breath.''
	   Coeme, the former defense minister, said he was innocent and
spoke of ``an enormous judicial error.''
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to Belgium's Dutch and
French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The high court trial came after the parliamentary immunity of
Claes and the others had been lifted.
	   It was a final curtain for party bosses who, until the 1990s,
paid political expenses out of their wallets, unhindered by laws
banning corporate political donations.
	   It was not until 1989, Belgium outlawed such donations. Thus,
prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid in 1988
but that the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to
the awarding of contracts Claes and the others had to know they
were bribes.
	   The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of Andre
Cools, a one-time socialist minister slain in 1991, presumably
because he knew of financial wrongdoing.
	   Claes became NATO Secretary-General in September 1994. He quit
13 months when the Augusta investigation made it untenable for him
to lead the western alliance.
	   He was long a power broker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist
Party.
	   For Coeme, a francophone socialist, the trial was his second in
two years. In 1996, the supreme court gave him a two-year suspended
jail term for corruption.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nearly 50 Nepalese protesters Wednesday
burned photographs of an Indian actress who in a radio interview
said the Himalayan nation was once part of India.
	   They gathered outside Madhuri Dixit's hotel and demanded that
she apologize for the comments made Tuesday. The actress is
visiting Katmandu for the release of an album from her new movie.
	   Dixit's costar in the movie, Akshay Kumar, apologized to the
crowd for Dixit's comments. Nepal, a predominantly Hindu nation,
was never part of India.
	   Police later dispersed the protesters. Indian film stars are
revered in Nepal where most theaters run Hindi language movies.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Christmas tradition of reconciliation
has finally united Poland's polarized political opponents. But only
on radio.
	   Listeners of private Radio Zet, a nationwide station, for the
past week have heard the voices of former communists and leading
members of the Solidarity movement that toppled communist rule
mixed together in singing Wsrod Nocnej Ciszy (In The Quiet of the
Night), a popular Polish carol.
	   The broadcaster had 15 politicians and public figures, including
Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski and ex-communist leader Leszek
Miller, sing the carol individually, a Radio Zet technician said
Wednesday. Then it took a line or two from each version to compile
the completed song.
	   Some of the voices are decidedly off-key, while others sound
better, particularly those of ex-communists Danuta Waniek, who ran
the successful 1995 electoral campaign for President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, and Izabella Sierakowska, an outspoken, hardline
leftist parliament deputy.
	   Solidarity founder and former President Lech Walesa declined to
sing, claiming he has no voice. But he cues the carol with a word
pun in Polish that translates to ``Known people sing carols only
with us.''

Chinese leader signals yearlong crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with dissidents in China planning
100-day series of 24-hour fasts, two detained in Liaoning. No

 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The trials of three outspoken dissidents over,
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China
will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year.
	   In his second hard-line speech in six days, Jiang vowed to crush
any challenges to Communist Party rule and preserve social
stability. He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' _ a
euphemism for following party orders.
	   The speech, to senior law enforcement officials, used
uncompromising language heard less frequently over the past 18
months as Chinese leaders sought to improve relations abroad.
	   Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions
for subversion this week of three political critics who tried to
form an opposition party.
	   To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national newspapers
ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- and
11-year prison terms given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang
Youcai. Dissidents are rarely mentioned by official media, and the
reports served as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people.
	   In the speech, reported by state television, Jiang said
stability was crucial over the next year. He noted two key events
on the political calendar: the 50th anniversary of Communist Party
rule on Oct. 1 and China's recovery of the Portuguese colony of
Macau on Dec. 20.
	   ``We must strengthen the ideological and political education of
officials and raise their awareness of and resistance to the
sabotaging acts of hostile domestic and foreign forces,'' China
Central Television quoted Jiang as saying.
	   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Jiang did not exclusively target political enemies. He likened
their threat to that of white-collar and ordinary criminals and
ticked off a list of potentially volatile problems _ inefficient
state industries, legions of laid-off workers, stagnating farmers'
incomes and corrupt officials.
	   The emphasis on stability and warnings to those who would
disrupt it were reminiscent of party pronouncements in the waning
years of Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping.
	   After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from a
major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform,
not stability, were the bywords of the past year.
	   Academic debates over the past year were the boldest in 10 years
by China's relatively controlled standards. Party leaders too
touted efforts to build a more comprehensive, predictable legal
system and won praise from Western governments for signing U.N.
rights treaties.
	   ``Our active developments of foreign affairs has reached new
achievements,'' Jiang said. ``Our country's stature has risen a
step higher.''
	   By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three
weeks, China trampled its own legal safeguards for criminal
suspects and raised questions about its commitments to U.N. rights
treaties it signed over the past 15 months.
	   Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents have
continued to campaign for justice.
	   Four elder members of the dissident community sent a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China to stop persecuting
political critics and release political prisoners.
	   ``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock''
over the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent
detentions of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter
dated Tuesday that was released by New York-based Human Rights in
China on Wednesday.
	   In addition, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of
rotating 24-hour fasts beginning Thursday to protest the sentences,
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China reported Wednesday night.
	   The fasts were to have begun with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom
authorities prevented from representing Wang Youcai, and Wang
Zechen in Liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two
activists were detained by police Wednesday evening, the Hong
Kong-based center said.
	   The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others
delivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the
immediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London
confirmed on Wednesday. It was conveyed on behalf of the European
Union, the United States, Canada and Norway.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Two men suspected of sabotaging train
tracks in an attempt to extort 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million)
from the German railway have been arrested, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Authorities had been chasing the blackmailers for weeks amid a
growing holiday-season scare for railway passengers and employees.
Air force reconnaissance planes, helicopters and 400 extra border
police were called out last weekend to patrol rail lines.
	   The suspects, one of them reportedly a former railway worker,
were blamed for three attacks since late November on rail lines
around Berlin.
	   The most serious caused a cargo train to derail last Friday. No
one was hurt but damage estimates were in the millions.
	   After that accident, rail officials revealed they had received
four letters since Nov. 23 demanding money.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Ulrich Kersten, head of the
Federal Criminal Police Office in Wiesbaden, said the decision was
made to go public with the threats in an attempt to re-establish
contact with the extortionists.
	   The main suspect, identified only as an unemployed 46-year-old
German from the eastern state of Saxony, called German rail
headquarters in Frankfurt that same day and again on Saturday,
Kersten said.
	   The suspect initially demanded police turn over the money in
Frankfurt Tuesday morning, but then directed them in a series of
phone calls across hundreds of kilometers (miles) into Bavaria.
	   He was finally arrested Tuesday night at a highway rest stop on
the autobahn between Munich and Salzburg. Federal agents, including
members of an anti-terrorist squad, nabbed him as he was looking
for the money in the trunk of a police car.
	   After the arrest, Kersten said the suspect confessed to the
three sabotage acts. He also warned that bombs planted in train
stations in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and Hamburg would explode if he
wasn't released.
	   Those stations were temporarily closed and searched, causing
headaches for travelers, but no bombs were found.
	   A 44-year-old man suspected of also being involved in the plot
was arrested Wednesday morning in his apartment in Chemnitz, a city
in Saxony, Kersten said.
	   The two men had been in trouble before for extortion, he added.
	   German Transport Minister Franz Muentefering voiced relief at
the arrests, calling them ``reassuring news for the safety of all
train travelers at Christmas time.''
	   The cargo train, carrying paper rolls, derailed Friday near
Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Berlin, after someone
loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No one was hurt.
	   Officials believe the tools used were stolen from the railway.
	   Also linked to the extortion was a similar attack that forced a
high-speed ICE passenger train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into
an emergency stop on Dec. 8.

	   The suspect initially demanded police turn over the money in
Frankfurt Tuesday morning, but then directed them in a series of
phone calls across hundreds of kilometers (miles) into Bavaria.
	   He was finally arrested Tuesday night at a highway rest stop on
the autobahn between Munich and Salzburg. Federal agents, including
members of an anti-terrorist squad, nabbed him as he was looking
for the money in the trunk of a police car.
	   After the arrest, Kersten said the suspect confessed to the
three sabotage acts. He also warned that bombs planted in train
stations in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and Hamburg would explode if he
wasn't released.
	   Those stations were temporarily closed and searched, causing
headaches for travelers, but no bombs were found.
	   A 44-year-old man suspected of also being involved in the plot
was arrested Wednesday morning in his apartment in Chemnitz, a city
in Saxony, Kersten said.
	   The two men had been in trouble before for extortion, he added.
	   German Transport Minister Franz Muentefering voiced relief at
the arrests, calling them ``reassuring news for the safety of all
train travelers at Christmas time.''
	   The cargo train, carrying paper rolls, derailed Friday near
Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Berlin, after someone
loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No one was hurt.
	   Officials believe the tools used were stolen from the railway.
	   Also linked to the extortion was a similar attack that forced a
high-speed ICE passenger train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into
an emergency stop on Dec. 8.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin will make several trips abroad next
year since doctors have judged him able to travel, the presidential
chief of staff said Wednesday, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, head of the presidential administration, met
with Yeltsin at the president's country residence, Gorky-9, just
west of Moscow.
	   He told reporters after the meeting that Yeltsin planned to
travel extensively in Russia and would confer with regional
governors, as well as the heads of political parties, Interfax
said.
	   He said that he had talked with Yeltsin about ways of increasing
the presidential administration's influence over political
developments in the regions, and proposed that Yeltsin should
coordinate more with regional governors.
	   The schedule for Yeltsin's foreign travels is still being drawn
up, but the president has promised several foreign leaders that he
will visit their countries, Bordyuzha was quoted as saying.
	   The administration ``must play an active role in the life of the
country and help Russia climb out of the abyss,'' Bordyuzha said.
	   Bordyuzha, who is also secretary of Yeltsin's Security Council,
said that ``today there is no sphere of activity that doesn't hold
danger for the state.''
	   He said that the presidential administration and Security
Council would therefore take an active role in elaborating
legislation, including laws dealing with economic reform, political
extremism and the fight against economic crime, Interfax said.
	   Yeltsin has made only occasional trips to the Kremlin recently,
spending most of his time at Gorky-9 while recuperating from
illnesses including a recent bout of pneumonia. He canceled several
foreign trips in the autumn because of health problems.
	   The 67-year-old leader underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery
two years ago. But he insists he has no crippling illness and
intends to serve out his term, which runs until mid-2000.

Responsibility claimed for bomb at German Jewish leader's grave
</HEADLINE>

offered &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin prosecutors said Wednesday they were
investigating a letter claiming responsibility for a weekend bomb
blast at the grave of a German Jewish leader.
	   In the letter, sent to prosecutors and a Berlin newspaper, the
alleged perpetrator denies any extreme-right political motive,
claiming he wanted mainly to protest against the renaming of a
Berlin street after the late leader, Heinz Galinski.
	   Justice Department spokesman Matthias Rebentisch declined to
release any more details, saying only that the letter was being
examined to determine if it is authentic.
	   The Saturday night bombing at a Jewish cemetery in western
Berlin stirred nationwide shock. The homemade bomb destroyed a
marble slab marking Galinski's grave.
	   Galinski headed Germany's Central Council of Jews from 1988
until his death in 1992. He had headed Berlin's Jewish community
since 1949.
	   An official in the Berlin district of Wedding, where a street
near the Jewish Hospital was renamed Nov. 27, said there were a few
protests at the time, including unfriendly letters.
	   ``One of them was in a language very reminiscent of '33,'' Hans
Nisble said, referring to the year the Nazis took power in Germany.
But he said there was no known far-right scene in Wedding.
	   Police have offered a 20,000 mark (dlrs 12,000) reward for
information in the bombing.

Iraq tells U.N. cease-fire monitors to cancel flight

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   The regime offered no explanation for the decision.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The 93 aid workers
returned to Iraq Tuesday night.
	   They were withdrawn after the United States and Britain launched
attacks last week against military and government targets to punish
Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections. The arms monitors are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the arms inspectors to return.
	   The Wednesday flight would have been the first since the
beginning of the bombardment.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners are still on alert, and U.N.
officials said the flight may have been canceled to avoid any
danger. A U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
he hoped the measure was temporary.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Hiro Ueki said that ``Iraqi
authorities notified the United Nations they would not allow U.N.
flights in Iraq under the present circumstances. We don't know
why.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had
planned to fly out of Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by
road to Amman.
	   The U.N. observer force monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait cease-fire
line and a demilitarized zone between the two countries. It was set
up after U.S.-led forces expelled Iraq soldiers from Kuwait in 1991
following Baghdad's seven-month occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
	   Syria also denied the United Nations clearance for the flight,
U.N. officials said. The planned route would have carried the
aircraft through Syrian air space.
	   UNIKOM has offices in Baghdad and Kuwait and its officials
regularly visit both capitals for consultations.
	   The flights are routinely scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays,
U.N. officials said.
	   U.N. aid workers inspected grain silos and food warehouses as
they began to assess the damage caused by the raids, a U.N.
official said.
	   The attacks destroyed a warehouse filled with 2,600 tons of rice
in Tikrit, the hometown of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   A U.N. official said he was unaware of any other aid stocks that
were destroyed but cautioned that the survey was not yet complete.
	   The U.N.-approved aid program is designed to alleviate the
suffering of Iraqi civilians caused by U.N. trade sanctions. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its programs to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered that the survey take no more than
a week.
	   Iraq has ordered an assessment of casualties and material losses
from the bombardment. Iraqi officials have said the strikes killed
62 soldiers and an unspecified number of civilians.
	   In a front-page editorial, Al-Thawra newspaper called on the
U.N. Security Council to demand that the United States and Britain
``pay full reparations to Iraq for both human and material
losses.'' The Arabic daily is published by the ruling Baath Party.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired
a hail of rockets Wednesday at northern Israel, causing heavy
property damage and injuring at least 13 people. Israel swore to
react.
	   Although the cross-border attack with Katyusha rockets was the
heaviest in nearly three years, most people in Israel's north had
spent the night in shelters, expecting retaliation for an Israeli
air strike in Lebanon the day before that killed seven civilians.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and the electricity was
knocked out in some areas but later restored. Another rocket bore a
hole in an apartment building, scattering sheets of plaster and
hunks of twisted metal on the ground below.
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations,
when we want. And we will react.''

Court orders medical examination of former communist leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A provincial court on Wednesday ordered a
medical examination for retired Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to
establish if the former communist leader can stand trial.
	   Jaruzelski, 75, is accused of ordering riot police to open fire
on workers rioting over price increases in December 1970. He was
defense minister at the time, when riot police killed 44 workers in
the cities of Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Elblag.
	   The Provincial Court in Gdansk, a Baltic Sea port, opened a case
against Jaruzelski and 11 other former communist officials on March
28, 1996, but the trial was delayed by the repeated absence of some
of the defendants or their lawyers.
	   Last year, Jaruzelski and four other accused were temporarily
exempted from the trial due to ill health. His doctors cited kidney
and back problems, as well as depression.
	   The Gdansk court decided Wednesday that Jaruzelski should be
examined to check if his health improved enough to appear in court,
Judge Jacek Hyla told the PAP state news agency.
	   All of the former communist officials could receive up to 25
years in prison if convicted of ordering and directing the riot
police shooting.
	   In 1981, Jaruzelski was Poland's leader and ordered the martial
law crackdown on the Solidarity democratic movement. While many
Poles believe he should be prosecuted for the martial law period,
in which human rights abuses occurred, Jaruzelski has so far
avoided standing trial.

Russia, U.S. sign food aid deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia signed a dlrs 625
million food aid agreement Wednesday after months of negotiations,
clearing the way for deliveries of American food to prevent hunger
among Russia's needy.
	   The United States will donate 1.5 metric tons of wheat to Russia
free of charge, and provide another 1.5 metric tons of various
agricultural commodities under a long-term loan. An additional
100,000 tons of various foodstuffs will be distributed directly to
Russia's poor.
	   The aid will be arriving ``over the next several months,'' said
John Tefft, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow,
who signed the deal along with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik.
	   No specific date has been set for the start of the deliveries.
But officials have said the aid is likely to start arriving early
next month.
	   Russia's current economic crisis, coming on top of the worst
grain harvest in 40 years, has spurred serious worries about food
shortages during the winter.
	   Plenty of food has remained in stores so far, but inflation that
has soared since the crisis hit in August has put much of the food
out of the reach of impoverished Russians.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government also worries about its ability
to deliver food to far-flung northern regions.
	   Much of the U.S. food aid is to be sold in stores in those
regions, with revenues going to Russia's pension fund to help pay
off many months' backlog of pensions, Tefft said.
	   ``This hopefully will make food purchases somewhat less
burdensome for those older Russians who have been particularly hard
hit by the current financial crisis,'' he said.
	   Previous aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and the work
on the latest agreement has stretched out for two months as the
United States insisted on working out guarantees that the aid will
be used properly this time.
	   The agreement follows Russia's sharp criticism of the United
States over last week's bombings of Iraq, when President Boris
Yeltsin and other top officials used angry rhetoric unheard since
the end of the Cold War.
	   Kulik said Wednesday that he didn't think Russia should have
turned down food aid because of the dispute.
	   ``It was never said anywhere publicly that this should become a
hurdle to the development of economic, cultural and other ties that
for many years have connected our two countries,'' he told
reporters.

NATO troops remove Croatian police from disputed border area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Croatia's request for NATO troops to
withdraw, Westendorp siding with action. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peace force in
Bosnia removed Croatian police Wednesday from a disputed town along
the two countries' border, drawing an angry response from Croatia.
	   A group of Canadian peacekeepers expelled the Croatian police
without incident from the town of Martin Brod, an area where Bosnia
and Croatia are still negotiating over the border, a NATO statement
said.
	   Martin Brod, about 150 miles (250 kilometers) west of Sarajevo,
was considered part of Bosnia before the 1991-95 war. But during
fighting, Croatian forces moved the border deeper into Bosnian
territory and claimed about half of the town.
	   The half that had been under control of Croatian police was put
under the jurisdiction of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation, the
statement said. International officials say Bosnia should control
the area until its status is settled.
	   Croat President Franjo Tudjman condemned the NATO move and
contacted NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana to demand the
alliance's troops be removed.
	   ``Such a one-sided action could have unforeseen harmful
consequences,'' Croatia's National Security Council said in a
statement carried by state-run radio.
	   Earlier this week, Tudjman threatened to send troops to Martin
Brod if NATO-led forced tried to take control of the
Croat-controlled half of the city.
	   The top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
said in a statement that the peacekeepers were forced to eject the
police after Croatia failed to keep promises to remove them.

Ex-NATO chief Claes, others convicted of corruption; sentenced

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Claes taking conviction to European Court of

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO secretary general Willy Claes
received a three-year suspended jail sentence Wednesday after being
convicted of corruption in two defense contracts he awarded as
economics minister in the late 1980s.
	   After a four-month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year
suspended sentences each to ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52,
former vice-premier Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge Dassault, 75, head
of France's Dassault aviation concern after convicting them of
corruption, too.
	   Eight former aides and associates received suspended sentences
of up to two years. All defendants lost their civic rights meaning
they cannot vote in elections or run for office for up to five
years.
	   The court said Claes, 60, had to know that when Italy's Agusta
SpA said it was ready to pay 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million)
to win a December, 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters, it was a
bribe for his Dutch-speaking socialist party.
	   ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the contract,
(Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept the
offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge,
said in a summation of the case that took four hours to read out.
	   He said Claes' and others bent the contract rules at the expense
of France's Aerospatiale SA which had a valid rival bid for
helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June, 1989, deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat rival
Litton Industries Inc. of the United States. Another 30 million
francs (almost dlrs 900,000) from Dassault ended up in the coffers
of French-speaking socialists.
	   The Agusta and Dassault contracts were worth hundreds of
millions of dollars each.
	   Claes and the other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2,
pleading innocent. All attended the sentencing hearing. In addition
to suspended jail terms, Claes and three former aides were ordered
to repay 110 million francs (dlrs 3.2 million).
	   Appeal to the high court ruling is not possible. Claes issued a
brief statement calling the case against him politically motivated
and said he would launch an appeal with the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg, France.
	   ``The logic of prosecution, which earlier led to my resignation
as NATO secretary general, demanded a conviction,'' he said. ``This
is totally unjust (and) I don't accept it.''
	   An appeal to the human rights court will take years and will not
suspend implementation of Claes' conviction and sentence in
Belgium.
	   Other defendants sounded equally bitter.

Round-the-world balloonists leave China's airspace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES China-Balloon Quest and UPDATES with balloon
leaves Chinese airspace, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists flew out of Chinese airspace
toward the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, keeping alive their bid to
be the first to circle the world in a balloon.
	   After two days of diplomatic tension over the balloon's passage
through prohibited Chinese territory, the craft finally cleared
Chinese airspace shortly before 1530 GMT, the project's ground crew
said.
	   The ICO Global balloon was at 26,000 feet (8,000 meters),
traveling at about 40 knots (45 mph, 72 kph), a speed that would
take about 10 hours to reach Japanese air space on a track between
the cities of Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, a spokeswoman added.
	   One Chinese air traffic controller grumbled on Wednesday that
planes flying between Xi'an, site of China's famed terra-cotta
warriors, and the capital Beijing were having to adjust their
flight paths because of the balloon.
	   ``People don't like uninvited guests,'' said the controller at
Xianyang Airport, near Xi'an. He refused to give his name.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, flying with American millionaire
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden, told BBC Radio by
telephone that they hoped the hot air and helium balloon could get
across the Pacific in a couple of days ``and be just coming in over
the American border for Christmas Day. Washington (state) is where
we think we'll be taken.'' Balloon pilots navigate by changing the
lift of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind
systems, and cannot plan their courses and speeds precisely.
	   ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese
finally let us through,'' he said.
	   Beijing had said the balloonists could cross China below 26
degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted further north on
Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed
airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The project ground crew said the Chinese asked the balloonists
to land at the Lhasa airfield Tuesday morning, but that the balloon
overshot the field and it was impossible to come down anywhere
else.
	   British diplomats worked late into the evening Tuesday seeking
Chinese permission for the round-the-world balloon to continue its
course.
	   China's Foreign Ministry finally telephoned Britain's ambassador
in Beijing at about 9:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) to say that the balloon
could carry on ``but it has to leave Chinese airspace as soon as
possible,'' said embassy spokeswoman Harriet Hall.
	   The ground crew said the Pacific leg of the journey was the most
hazardous.
	   ``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate
that far out,'' project director Mike Kendrick told Sky News.
	   ``The frequency of shipping is not good. If they ditch in the
Pacific it is very difficult and the chances of survival are not
good, though we have to make sure everything is right.''
	   ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said Kendrick. ``We
are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which will give us a
good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.''
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days
to nearly three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere
in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight,
which will take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific
and the United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Former leader of militant Quebec group dies at 60
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Pierre Vallieres, who was jailed in the 1960s
for his leading role in a bombing campaign by Quebec separatists in
Canada, has died after a long illness. He was 60.
	   Vallieres never fully recovered from a heart attack suffered in
1997. He spent weeks in a coma, had another heart attack last week,
and died in a hospital Tuesday night.
	   A leftist journalist, Vallieres became a leader of the Quebec
Liberation Front, which carried out a series of bombings in the
mid-1960s in a bid to gain independence for the mostly
French-speaking province.
	   When fellow members of the group were arrested, Vallieres fled
to New York City, but was arrested there.
	   Deported to Canada in 1967, he used his four years in jail to
write a book, ``White Niggers of America,'' which contended that
French-Canadians suffered from oppression comparable to blacks in
the southern United States.
	   In 1971, Vallieres resumed his career as a journalist and
renounced violence.
	   In 1980, he abandoned support for Quebec independence, arguing
that Quebec was doomed to assimilation within Canada. But he
continued to crusade for other causes, speaking up for Indians
during a 1990 armed standoff at a Quebec reservation and later
forming a Quebec-Bosnia solidarity committee.

Vatican, San Marino working out how to use euros
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD background on EU proposals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Vatican and the tiny republic of San Marino _
two sovereign states that now use Italy's lira _ are looking at
arrangements for their own transitions to the euro.
	   On Jan. 1, European Monetary Union goes into effect, with Italy
among the 11 charter members from the European Union.
	   While electronic transactions, including credit card purchases
and banking transfers, can start on that date, the actual euro hard
currency will go into circulation in 2002 _ and lire will then go
out of use.
	   That's a problem for the Vatican and for San Marino, as well as
for the republic of Monaco, which uses the French franc. They all
lack currencies of their own.
	   As non-EU members, they need permission from the euro club to
use the currency.
	   On Monday, the EU Commission put forth a series of proposals
that would let the three small states use the euro _ but Italy and
France would mint the coins for them, and would have to approve any
special design.
	   EU finance ministers are expected to approve the EU Commission
proposals when they meet in Brussels on Jan. 31.
	   Italian newspapers reported Wednesday that San Marino, a
republic on the Italian peninsula, was trying to work out a deal
with the Italian state mint.
	   As for the Vatican, ``all the details of this new reality must
now be negotiated,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
	   But Navarro-Valls, in his brief statement Tuesday, made no
mention of a potentially controversial aspect -- whether or not the
pope's image would be on any Vatican euro.
	   In October, a French newspaper reported that Paris would not
recognize any euro coins stamped with the image of the pope.

Russian prime minister says country will pay all debts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word ``pay'' in 2nd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a
visit to Kazakstan, said Wednesday that his country would repay all
of its debts despite the country's economic crisis.
	   ``Russia will not declare default, we have no intention of
declaring default,'' Primakov said in Kazakstan's capital Astana.
``Russia will pay all debts, both internal and external.''
	   Russia is facing huge debt repayments it cannot afford, and is
seeking to restructure its obligations with creditors.
	   After the latest economic crisis hit in August, the government
stopped making payments on dlrs 40 billion worth of treasury bills.
Creditors regarded this as a default, and restructuring
negotiations are still underway.
	   Russia also faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall
due next year. Primakov has previously acknowledged that Russia
won't be able to make all the payments on time, and plans to
restructure the debts are underway.
	   Meanwhile, Primakov called for closer relations with Kazakstan,
a former Soviet republic.
	   Relations are generally good, despite some tension in the past
over the alleged discrimination against ethnic Russians in
Kazakstan and a dispute over mutual debts.
	   The Kazak government has accused Russia of failing to pay the
agreed rent for leasing the former Soviet cosmodrome in Baikonur,
while the cash-strapped Russian government cited Kazakstan's own
debts to Moscow. Earlier this year, the two nations have agreed to
clear mutual debts.
	   ``There are no problems in relations between Russia and
Kazakstan,'' Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev said after
meeting with Primakov on Wednesday.
	   The two leaders agreed to increase the amount of Kazak oil going
through Russian territory and reduce Russian railway tariffs for
Kazak goods.
	   ``We must unite to resolve our common problems,'' Primakov said.
	   Speaking at a news conference after the talks, Primakov warned
NATO against embracing any former Soviet republics.
	   If any of them join the alliance, Moscow will be ``forced to
take certain steps,'' he said without elaboration.
	   NATO's move to incorporate former Soviet allies in Central and
Eastern Europe have drawn strong protests in Russia, which said it
threatens national security. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the
three former Soviet republics, have also long been pushing for
NATO's membership.

Iraq tells U.N. cease-fire monitors to cancel flight

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   The regime offered no explanation for the decision.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The 93 aid workers
returned to Iraq Tuesday night.
	   They were withdrawn after the United States and Britain launched
attacks last week against military and government targets to punish
Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections. The arms monitors are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the arms inspectors to return.
	   The Wednesday flight would have been the first since the
beginning of the bombardment.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners are still on alert, and U.N.
officials said the flight may have been canceled to avoid any
danger. A U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
he hoped the measure was temporary.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Hiro Ueki said that ``Iraqi
authorities notified the United Nations they would not allow U.N.
flights in Iraq under the present circumstances. We don't know
why.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had
planned to fly out of Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by
road to Amman.
	   The U.N. observer force monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait cease-fire
line and a demilitarized zone between the two countries. It was set
up after U.S.-led forces expelled Iraq soldiers from Kuwait in 1991
following Baghdad's seven-month occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
	   Syria also denied the United Nations clearance for the flight,
U.N. officials said. The planned route would have carried the
aircraft through Syrian air space.
	   UNIKOM has offices in Baghdad and Kuwait and its officials
regularly visit both capitals for consultations.
	   The flights are routinely scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays,
U.N. officials said.
	   U.N. aid workers inspected grain silos and food warehouses as
they began to assess the damage caused by the raids, a U.N.
official said.
	   The attacks destroyed a warehouse filled with 2,600 tons of rice
in Tikrit, the hometown of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   A U.N. official said he was unaware of any other aid stocks that
were destroyed but cautioned that the survey was not yet complete.
	   The U.N.-approved aid program is designed to alleviate the
suffering of Iraqi civilians caused by U.N. trade sanctions. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its programs to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered that the survey take no more than
a week.
	   Iraq has ordered an assessment of casualties and material losses
from the bombardment. Iraqi officials have said the strikes killed
62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians.
	   The latest casualty was a 9-year-old boy who died when a device
dropped during the U.S.-British airstrikes exploded, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday. The boy's father and brother
were injured, INA said.
	   The agency said the incident occurred while the three were
tending sheep in the southern Iraqi province of Muthana.
	   In a front-page editorial, Al-Thawra newspaper called on the
U.N. Security Council to demand that the United States and Britain
``pay full reparations to Iraq for both human and material
losses.'' The Arabic daily is published by the ruling Baath Party.

Turkish prosecutors seek death sentences for bombing suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's prosecutors said Wednesday they
would seek the death penalty against five Kurdish activists accused
of setting off a bomb that killed seven people at an Istanbul
market.
	   Several foreign tourists were among the 127 people injured in
the June 9 blast at the entrance to the centuries-old spice market.
	   A statement from the prosecutor's office said the five had been
charged with murder and Kurdish separatism.
	   The five reportedly were members of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK. The group is fighting for autonomy for Kurds
in Turkey's southeast.
	   Authorities indicted another 10 defendants on charges of aiding
and abetting. They could face up to 31 years in prison if
convicted.
	   The prosecutors' decision comes at a time when Turkey is pushing
Italy to extradite PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. Italy has refused
extradition, saying its laws forbid returning suspects to countries
where they face the death penalty.
	   Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. It insists it would
not execute Ocalan, who is now being tried in absentia.

Fighting between Angolan army, rebels continues in central

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government forces and UNITA rebels battled
Wednesday, while reports indicated that the army had taken over two
UNITA towns in the central highlands, worsening the plight of
thousands of displaced people.
	   In Huambo province, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast
of the capital Luanda, ``battles rage all over the place,''
according to an aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The government has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of
Caala,'' the aid worker said, referring to two towns approximately
40 kilometers (25 miles) from Huambo city.
	   ``I went 15 kilometers (10 miles) out of Huambo and I could hear
the artillery fire,'' the aid worker said, adding that the city
itself had not been shelled.
	   Vila Nova, one of UNITA's bases in Huambo province, lies between
Huambo and Kuito, the capital of neighboring Bie province, 130
kilometers (80 miles) northeast and under rebel siege.
	   Huambo, perched high in the central highlands, was reduced to
rubble in one of the country's most brutal sieges, when government
troops ousted UNITA rebels in 1993.
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
following the vast southwest African country's independence from
Portugal. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first
elections and returned to war.
	   The resumption of fighting this month has sent more than 50,000
displaced people flooding into Huambo, which had a population of
about 100,000.
	   ``This outbreak of fighting coincided with harvest time, so all
the harvest was lost, and all the shops are out of stock,'' the aid
worker said.
	   Roads leading into Huambo ``are open, but almost impassable
because they're in poor conditions and it's not safe,'' the aid
worker added.
	   The airport, under military control, has closed to commercial
flights.
	   The United Nations' World Food Program is planning to fly about
300 tons of food supplies into Huambo over the next two weeks.
	   In the neighboring Bie province, the center of Kuito _ hit
Tuesday by rebel artillery shells _ was quiet Wednesday, the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Bie told state radio, RNA.
	   The rebels have kept the provincial capital under siege for
about two weeks. An International Red Cross statement said there
was 160 people wounded, some in serious condition.
	   There are some 160,000 people holed up in the city and the
airport is closed.
	   The government and UNITA signed a second peace agreement in
1994, under the auspices of the United Nations, but unending
friction between them have led to renewed clashes in the diamond-
and oil-rich country.
	   In a statement released Wednesday in Luanda, the government
condemned the international community for its ``passivity and
complicity'' in face of UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994
accord.
	   It added that UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ now has a 40,000-strong army equipped with
``armored vehicles, long-range artillery and great fire power,''

Journalist indicted for libeling President Tudjman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A district attorney office filed charges
against a political analyst for slandering Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman, state run news agency HINA reported Wednesday.
	   In an interview with Slovene weekly Mladina Letica said that
Tudjman ``feels a certain attraction to ... criminals, paramilitary
criminals, prostitutes. These people fascinate him, because they're
bringing some fun into his boring, bureaucratic life.''
	   Letica also said Tudjman was responsible for the increased gap
between the rich and the poor in Croatia and for tolerating the use
of intelligence services in his ruling party's internal struggles.
	   No date for the trial has been set. The trial will be the second
in Croatia based on new legislation that makes it illegal to insult
top state officials, including the president. If convicted, Letica
faces three years in prison.
	   Earlier this week, two independent journalist charged with
insulting Tudjman and tried under the legislation were acquitted.
	   Letica, a professor at the Medical university and a political
analyst, was Tudjman's adviser in 1991. Later he became his harsh
critic.
	   Critics have said such trials are reminiscent of communist
repression of the media and are in fact an attempt by Tudjman's
authoritarian government to silence critics and clamp down on
independent media.

National Front executive formally kicks out rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ A feud within the far-right National
Front further intensified Wednesday when the executive committee
formally expelled the party's No. 2 leader.
	   ``The National Front is not a free-for-all,'' the party's
Secretary-General Bruno Gollnisch said in announcing the expulsion
of Bruno Megret and six other leaders.
	   ``In face of the seriousness of those actions, the executive
bureau, holding a disciplinary meeting, took that painful but firm
decision,'' he told a news conference at the party headquarters in
this western Paris suburb.
	   The others expelled were Serge Martinez, Daniel Simonpieri,
Jean-Yves Le Gallou, Franck Timmermans, Philippe Olivier et Pierre
Vial.
	   Megret and the six others had already been suspended from the
party earlier this month after challenging the party's founder and
leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
	   The latest crisis within the National Front was centered on
Megret's call for a special party congress to heal divisions -- a
move Le Pen saw as a trap to unseat him.
	   Martinez said earlier in the day that the Megret faction had
collected 14,000 party member signatures calling for the congress
on Jan. 24.
	   The ambitious Megret, 47, first challenged the fiery 70-year-old
Le Pen this fall by insisting that he, not Le Pen's wife Jany, lead
the party slate in next year's European Parliament elections.
	   Le Pen wanted his wife to run after he was threatened by court
action that could bar him from politics.
	   The anti-immigration party, accused of racism and anti-Semitism,
traditionally wins about 15 percent of the national vote in
elections.
	   But a recent poll indicated the National Front could lose up to
half its voting bloc over the feud.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The 93 aid workers
returned to Iraq Tuesday night.
	   They were withdrawn after the United States and Britain launched
attacks last week against military and government targets to punish
Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections. The arms monitors are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the arms inspectors to return.
	   The Wednesday flight would have been the first since the
beginning of the bombardment.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq ordered
cancellation of the flight because ``they were worried that there
could be an accident.''
	   The Iraqis cited their report that U.S. and British warplanes
violated Iraqi airspace Tuesday and fired two ``stray missiles'' in
the direction of the southern city of Basra. The Pentagon and
Britain's Ministry of Defense denied the report.
	   ``I would hope that this is a temporary situation,'' Annan said.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had planned to fly out of
Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by road to Amman.

Yemen frees foreign journalist who interviewed German hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The Yemeni authorities freed Wednesday a
foreign correspondent whom they detained for interviewing four
German hostages, a journalists' union official said.
	   Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who writes for the Berliner
Zeitung newspaper, was handed over to Mahboub Ali, the regional
director of the International Organization for Journalists, after
seven days in detention.
	   ``He is frustrated that he was detained while he was doing his
job. He is tired but he thinks what happened to him comes with the
job,'' Ali said after taking Hamaiel to the German Embassy.
	   Police arrested Hamaiel on Thursday as he returned from a
meeting with the hostages _ three women and one man _ in Marib
province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital,
San`a.
	   Hamaiel, and two Yemenis accompanying him, were charged with
traveling in tribal areas without government permission.
	   In June, three British Broadcasting Corp. television journalists
were detained for several days on a charge of filming without
government permission after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan
tribe. The BBC journalists were acquitted by a Yemeni court.
	   Ali said Hamaiel was scheduled to return to Germany on Sunday.
	   The Germans were abducted Dec. 7 by three gunmen from the Bani
Dhabyan tribe in Marib. The German Embassy has not given their
names, but the Yeman Times has identified them as Norbert Degen,
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner.
	   Negotiations between the tribesmen and authorities have so far
failed to secure the release of the Germans. The Bani Dhabyan are
reported to be seeking more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and
roads in their area.
	   Large parts of Yemen, one of the world's poorest states, are
lawless. Tribesmen often kidnap foreigners to use in their
bargaining with the government for more public services. The
hostages are usually freed unharmed.

	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners are still on alert, and U.N.
officials said the flight may have been canceled to avoid any
danger. A U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
he hoped the measure was temporary.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Hiro Ueki said that ``Iraqi
authorities notified the United Nations they would not allow U.N.
flights in Iraq under the present circumstances. We don't know
why.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had
planned to fly out of Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by
road to Amman.
	   The U.N. observer force monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait cease-fire
line and a demilitarized zone between the two countries. It was set
up after U.S.-led forces expelled Iraq soldiers from Kuwait in 1991
following Baghdad's seven-month occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
	   Syria also denied the United Nations clearance for the flight,
U.N. officials said. The planned route would have carried the
aircraft through Syrian air space.
	   UNIKOM has offices in Baghdad and Kuwait and its officials
regularly visit both capitals for consultations.
	   The flights are routinely scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays,
U.N. officials said.
	   U.N. aid workers inspected grain silos and food warehouses as
they began to assess the damage caused by the raids, a U.N.
official said.
	   The attacks destroyed a warehouse filled with 2,600 tons of rice
in Tikrit, the hometown of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   A U.N. official said he was unaware of any other aid stocks that
were destroyed but cautioned that the survey was not yet complete.
	   The U.N.-approved aid program is designed to alleviate the
suffering of Iraqi civilians caused by U.N. trade sanctions. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be
lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its programs to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. humanitarian program at U.N.
headquarters in New York, ordered that the survey take no more than
a week.
	   Iraq has ordered an assessment of casualties and material losses
from the bombardment. Iraqi officials have said the strikes killed
62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians.
	   The latest casualty was a 9-year-old boy who died when a device
dropped during the U.S.-British airstrikes exploded, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday. The boy's father and brother
were injured, INA said.
	   The agency said the incident occurred while the three were
tending sheep in the southern Iraqi province of Muthana.
	   In a front-page editorial, Al-Thawra newspaper called on the
U.N. Security Council to demand that the United States and Britain
``pay full reparations to Iraq for both human and material
losses.'' The Arabic daily is published by the ruling Baath Party.

Robbers on a roll at Christmas highstreets

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Santa needs some security.
	   Stick-up men are on their annual rampage, taking advantage of
the Christmas bustle to snatch money from banks, post offices and
cash delivery vans.
	   A pair of armed robbers Wednesday were caught between double
doors at bank in the northern port of Salonica, but still managed
to break out, media reports said.
	   In another part of Salonica, the job was a lot easier. Two
gunmen went into post office and walked out with a bag full of
money five minutes later.
	   In Athens, two women punched and kicked an 80-year-old lady at
home and took her savings of 300,000 drachmas (dlrs 1,100). Other
lonely elderly people were also targeted.
	   The rash of holiday holdups, mostly in Athens, comes despite
heightened police measures. A 250-officer Bank Robbery Squad was
created last month and began foot and motorcycle patrols of
downtown Athens and ``high risk'' districts.
	   But Christmas heists must be worth the risk. More money is
changing hands that at any other time of the year. And Greeks, by
law, get paid an extra monthly salary as a Christmas bonus every
year. Taxi fares go up for the same reason.
	   Earlier this week, a man in Athens drove off with a truck
carrying 1,300 turkeys donated to workers at a cigarette company by
the American Farm School in northern Greece. And on Dec. 17,
robbers showed up after a bank had closed, but smashed the door
with the sledge hammer and snatched 117 million drachmas (dlrs
400,000). That was this year's record.
	   The seasonal larceny ends a particularly lawless year in Greece.
	   About 110 banks have fallen prey to armed robbers this year, not
including this week's spate and frequent hold-ups at supermarkets
and post offices.
	   Dimitris Kouselas, leader of the national bank employees union,
said many banks are still largely defenseless against robbers.
``There are two problems, the safety measures are not enough and
they are not enforced,'' Kouselas said.
	   His union helped draw up new security guidelines expected to
take effect in February which will force banks to install double
doors and bullet-proof cashier windows. Stiff fines will be imposed
on banks that do not follow the new codes.
	   ``We'll see if these measures work in practice,'' he said. ``If
they're not enforced, we are ready for dynamic protests,'' _ union
jargon for a strike.

Brazil tops year-end rankings for fifth straight time

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Despite losing the World Cup final to
France, Brazil finished atop the FIFA World Rankings for the the
fifth straight year Wednesday, while Asian Games participants made
the biggest jump from last month.
	   Brazil, France, Germany, Croatia and Argentina retained their
places in the top five from November, with Croatia finishing as the
``Best Mover of the Year.'' Croatia started the year in 19th place
and climbed 15 places thanks largely to its victory over the
Netherlands and third-place finish at the World Cup.
	   Several teams climbed many more places than Croatia, but FIFA
calculates the best movers by multiplying their total points at the
end of the year by the number of points gained in that year, taking
into account that the higher the ranking, the harder it is to earn
points.
	   Others in the ``best movers'' category were France, which
climbed from sixth to second; and Argentina, which jumped 12 places
to fifth and Yugoslavia, which moved 14 places upward to finish
sixth in 1998.
	   Behind Yugoslavia in the year-end rankings were Italy in
seventh, followed by the Czech Repuplic, England and Mexico, the
latter three all dropping five spots from a year ago.
	   The recently completed Asian Games had the biggest impact on
this month's ratings, with champion Iran climbing 17 spots to 27th
(a 19-spot improvement over 1997) and third-place China leaping 32
spots to 37th (18 places better).
	   Uzbekistan, which was beaten 4-0 by Iran in the Asian Games
quarterfinals, rocketed 41 places to 66th, while Asian Games host
and runner-up Thailand climbed six places to 45th.
	   The team to make the biggest jump in 1998 was Tahiti, which
jumped 38 places to 123rd (placing it eighth in the best movers
category), while three teams in the Americas dropped the farthest.
Ecuador and Canada each fell 35 places to 63rd and 101st; Uruguay
sunk 36 notches (including 29 places in December) to 76th, and
Bolivia plummeted 37 spots to 61st.

Round-the-world balloonists head for Pacific

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trio of balloonists soaring over northern Asia
swept across the Yellow Sea on Wednesday, leaving prohibited
Chinese airspace and heading for the United States in their bid to
make the first nonstop balloon voyage around the world.
	   After two days of diplomatic tension over the balloon's passage
through China, the craft finally cleared Chinese airspace shortly
before 1530 GMT, the project's ground crew said.
	   The ICO Global balloon carrying British tycoon Richard Branson,
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden,
was moving at about 40 knots (45 mph and 72 kph) when it left China
_ a speed that would take it to Japan in about 10 hours on a path
between the cities of Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, a spokeswoman said.
	   Branson spoke to BBC Radio Wednesday morning as his craft flew
over China, saying he hoped to cross the Pacific in a couple of
days ``and be just coming in over the American border for Christmas
Day. Washington (state) is where we think we'll be taken.''
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   Beijing had said the balloonists could cross China below 26
degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted further north on
Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed
airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia. After diplomatic
communications between Britain and China, the balloonists were
allowed to continue flying if they left China as quickly as
possible.
	   ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese
finally let us through,'' Branson said.
	   The ground crew said the Pacific leg of the journey was the most
hazardous.
	   ``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate
that far out,'' project director Mike Kendrick told Sky TV.
	   ``The frequency of shipping is not good. If they ditch in the
Pacific it is very difficult and the chances of survival are not
good, though we have to make sure everything is right.''
	   ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said Kendrick. ``We
are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which will give us a
good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.''
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days
to nearly three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere
in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight,
which will take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific
and the United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Former NATO chief Willy Claes found guilty of accepting bribes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's high court convicted found
former NATO chief Willy Claes of accepting bribes Wednesday in the
awarding of lucrative defense contracts to European firms during
the 1980s.
	   The Supreme Court gave Claes, 60, the maximum penalty following
a 3 1/2-month trial: a three-year suspended jail term and the loss
of his civic rights, which means he is barred from voting or being
voted into office for five years.
	   The 15-judge court also gave former Defense Minister Guy Coeme a
two-year suspended sentence for corruption involving Italy's Agusta
SpA and France's Dassault aviation firm and similarly convicted
former Vice Premier Guy Spitaels and Serge Dassault, the head of
Dassault.
	   Eight former aides and associates also were convicted and
received suspended sentences of up to two years.
	   The court, which held the trial after the parliamentary immunity
of Claes and the other former Cabinet members had been lifted, said
Claes had to have known Agusta paid dlrs 1.37 million to pave the
way toward the awarding of a 1988 contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault's payment of dlrs 1.62 million to
win a 1989 deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics
involved corruption and other irregularities at the expense of a
rival bid by Litton Industries Inc. of Woodland Hills, California.
	   The trial was considered the final curtain for a generation of
Belgian party leaders who, until the 1990s, ruled unhindered by any
law banning corporate political donations.
	   Belgium didn't outlaw such donations until 1989. To prove
corruption, prosecutors were required to show that ``gifts'' from
Agusta and Dassault were timed so closely to the awarding of
contracts that Claes and the others must have known they were
bribes.
	   The trial's origin, however, lies in the still-unresolved murder
of Andre Cools, a one-time socialist minister who was slain by
hired killers in 1991, presumably because he knew of financial
wrongdoing and was about to talk.
	   Claes became NATO secretary-general in September 1994. He quit
13 months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days
as Belgian economics minister.
	   Claes hurried out through a side door of the court today and
made no statement. The others expressed shock.
	   ``In the 11 years as president of the (French-speaking)
socialist party, the socialist party never committed an act of
corruption,'' Spitaels said. ``I will defend that on my children's
honor until my last breath.''
	   Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge, said in summarizing
a case that took hours to read: ``It is not excluded that, prior to
awarding the contract, (Claes) gave his assent to his chief Cabinet
aide to accept the offer made by Agusta.''
	   He said Claes' and his co-defendants altered the contract rules
to favor Agusta at the expense of France's Aerospatiale SA, which
had a valid rival bid for the helicopters.
	   The Agusta and Dassault bribes were paid to this nation's Dutch
and French-speaking socialist parties through secret Swiss and
Luxembourg bank accounts.
	   The contracts were worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.
Claes and the other defendants went on trial Sept. 2, pleading
innocent.
	   Claes was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist
Party. Spitaels, 67, has been the mainstay of French-speaking
socialists.
	   Since leaving the government, Claes has written a book on world
politics and had tried to make a political comeback.
	   For Coeme, a 52-year-old francophone socialist, the trial was
his second in two years. In 1996, the Supreme Court gave him a
two-year suspended jail term for corruption involving phony opinion
surveys paid for at government expense.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A grandson of Mohandas Gandhi is to
receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Natal, the

	   Gopal Gandhi, a former Indian High Commissioner to South Africa,
is one of seven people to be awarded honorary degrees at the

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned with the
fast-deteriorating situation in Kosovo, two top NATO officials
warned both sides in the conflict Wednesday against launching more
attacks.
	   NATO's top commander for Europe, American Gen. Wesley Clark,
complained of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police
activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said the
alliance is watching closely to ensure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed at
halting bloodshed in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Echoing the security concerns, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings
in recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The officials' comments came as reports said one man was killed
and three others wounded in the latest two shootouts late Tuesday
in Kosovo _ in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica and in a
suburb of the capital, Pristina.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said an unidentified gunman burst into
an Albanian-owned bar in Kosovska Mitrovica wounded two ethnic
Albanians, one of whom died Wednesday. The survivor is known for
his loyalty to Serbian authorities.
	   Police sealed off the district where the bar is located and were
pursuing the perpetrator, the report said.
	   Two Serbian police officers were also reported wounded when
``terrorists'' opened fire with machine-guns in a Pristina suburb,
the Serb center said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the
all-out war that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and
Serb security forces from February to October. During that time
some 1,000 people lost their lives and another 300,000 lost their
homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities were not in
conformance with Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He
reiterated that Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade
have been told they ``must comply with their promises made to
NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case the unarmed international verifiers in Kosovo are
threatened.
	   International officials also have criticized Kosovo Albanian
rebels for endangering the cease-fire by carrying out provocative
missions.
	   Solana warned both sides ``not to try to use the Christmas and
New Year period to launch attacks or to conduct operations which
would undermine the fragile security situation in Kosovo and
further jeopardize the prospects for a peaceful solution.''
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''
	   Also Wednesday, 26 ethnic Albanians went on trial in Pristina,
charged with ``terrorism and hostile activity against the state''
for allegedly carrying out three armed attacks. Nine of the men
have been in custody since June, while the others will be tried in
absentia.
	   The trial adjourned shortly after court opened and the defense
was given until mid-January to prepare the case and examine new
evidence.
	   The Albanians' defense lawyer, Rexhep Haxhimusa, told reporters
the trial was political and staged, lacking firm evidence against
his clients.

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Hermann ``The Herminator''
Maier and Katja Seizinger provided year-long quality. Picabo Street
and Alberto Tomba tugged at hearts.
	   Maier, Austria's Racing Bricklayer, gave the men's Alpine World
Cup tour a new star just as the old one, Tomba, called it a career.
Seizinger vaulted into the sport's top echelon with a second
overall title and became the first skier to retain an Olympic
downhill crown.
	   Street, whose fast skis and quick mouth made her the Tomba of
the women's tour, showed she also had the Italian's flair for the
dramatic when she won the most unlikely gold medal of the Olympic
Winter Games at Nagano, Japan.
	   Yet the one picture of the Olympics, and of the season, was of
Maier's somersaulting crash in the downhill at Nagano. He landed on
his helmeted head, crashed through two supposedly racer-proof crash
fences and down a gully into a snowdrift. Incredibly, he emerged in
one piece, rising unsteadily to his feet and waving his ski poles
to a crowd that seconds before thought he was vaulting to his
death.
	   Getting to his feet was only the first part of the drama. Two
days later, despite bruises and sore muscles, Maier won the
super-giant slalom and capped his games by adding the giant slalom
title. And he did it all with a grin on his face. After all, this
was a guy who was booted off the Austrian team years before because
he was too scrawny, only to use stints as a ski instructor and a
bricklayer to make him a powerful and versatile racer.
	   Before and after the Olympics, Maier was almost unbeatable,
winning 10 times and finishing among the top three an incredible 19
times in 23 events. He won the first four super-G races of the
season and prevailed in a season-long battle with Switzerland's
Michael von Gruenigen in the giant slalom. Maier lost the downhill
title in large part because he missed four races due to injury, too
big an advantage to give to a superb skier like teammate Andreas
Schifferer.
	   Maier carved a niche in the record book when he became the first
skier to have a victory taken away for violating the rule against
finish-area advertising. After completing a winning GS run at Val
d'Isere, France, Maier stepped out his skis and put them to his
shoulder, a practice every racer has mastered as payback to the
sponsors who provide their high-tech hardware. Maier's sin was to
take his skis off too soon, before crossing the red line in the
finish area where unstrapping is allowed.
	   As it turned out, the lost victory didn't cost him a thing,
although he had to go an extra week before officially clinching the
overall title.
	   Seizinger was just as dominant on the women's side, claiming her
fourth downhill championship and fifth super-G title along with an
overall trophy to add to one she earned in 1996.
	   What was different this time around was the smile. For years,
the German was admired but hardly loved. In 1998, she displayed a
sunny personality that pulled in fans like a magnet.
	   Why the change?
	   ``I found love,'' she said.
	   Turns out the German coaches, ever striving for an edge, put
Seizinger and the rest of the troops through a series of
death-defying stunts so they'd think skiing down an icy trail at
110 kph (70 mph) was tame stuff. One of the tests was skydiving and
Seizinger found her man on the other side of the tandem chute with
which she made her first jump.
	   Street stole some of Seizinger's thunder by winning the Olympic
super-G, completing a year-long comeback from a severe knee injury.
The celebration was still going on when Seizinger got revenge with
a smashing victory in the downhill, followed with gold in combined
and added a giant slalom bronze for good measure.
	   As the year ended, Seizinger and Street were both staring forced
retirement square in the eyes after devastating knee injuries.
	   Tomba, Italy's gift to skiing for the past decade, went out like
the champion he so often was by winning the last slalom of his
career. It was victory No. 50, the second-highest total in history
(Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark won 86) and allowed Tomba that rarest of
athletic achievements: leaving on his own terms.
	   Two of the best stories of the season involved Austria's Stephan
Eberharter and Sweden's Ylva Nowen. Failure, not victory, had been
the companion of each through many long winters, with Eberharter
actually being tossed off the team and Nowen almost deciding to
begin that long-delayed college education.
	   Eberharter came back through the Europa Cup, skiing's minor
leagues, to earn another chance, and made the most of it, getting
his first race victory and vaulting to third behind Maier and
Schifferer in the overall standings. And Nowen won four times on
the way to collecting the season slalom title, becoming the only
non-German speaker to win a World Cup title.
	   In the Nordic world, Bjorn Daehlie of became history's
winningest Winter Olympian by winning the prestigious 50-kilometer
race, his eighth gold medal in three Olympics since 1992 and third
in the Nagano Games.
	   ``I think it was my hardest race ever,'' he said.
	   Russia swept all women's Olympic races, Larissa Lazutina leading
the team with three golds, a silver and a bronze.
	   Thomas Alsgaard, another Norwegian, captured the season-long
World Cup title for the first time with Daehlie finishing second.
No other skier has more World Cup victories (42nd) than Daehlie.
	   On the women's side, Lazutina finished ahead of Bente Martinsen
of Norway.
	   In ski jumping, Kazuyoshi Funaki was the big star of the season.
Competing before his fellow countrymen at Nagano, Funaki clinched
the gold medal in the team competition and also won the large hill
(120 meter) and a normal hill (90 meter) silver medal.
	   Slovenia's Primoz Peterka took the World Cup crown with Funaki
finishing second.
	   Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway dominated the Nordic combined,
winning two gold at Nagano and then clinching the World Cup title
before his home fans at Holmenkollen outside Oslo, the cradle of
Nordic skiing.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Dozens of policemen were combing through
a tropical region in Bolivia for the killers of a Roman Catholic
nun and priest from Colombia, police said Wednesday.
	   Father Alvaro Lopez, 39, and Sister Maria Celina, 37, were shot
Monday evening in the tropical Quiquibey region, 450 miles (700
kilometers) north of the capital, La Paz. A third person was
hospitalized under stable condition.
	   Witnesses say the two assassins asked the Catholic nun and
priest for money and shot them after they indicated they were not
carrying any. Lopez and Celina were working with poor farmers and
loggers in the area.
	   Area residents were also helping police in the search and said
they would lynch the assassins once they were found.

Slovak government skips pay hikes to try to improve economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new government decided
Wednesday to forego wage hikes for state employees, including
government officials, as part of efforts to improve the struggling
economy.
	   Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda told reporters that a package of
other measures will be introduced Jan. 7.
	   As part of the push, electricity and water prices are being
increased nationwide as of the first of the year.

Russian ambassadors heading back to United States, Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with ambassador returning to Britain,
Ivanov telephone conversation with Cook. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to the United States headed
back to Washington on Wednesday, a week after he was recalled for
consultations on the American air strikes against Iraq, and the
Foreign Ministry said its envoy to Britain would soon return to his
mission in London.
	   The Russians harshly denounced the U.S. and British bombing
raids against Iraq, and recalled ambassadors from both countries.
Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov was returning to his post in Washington,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said, and Ambassador Yuri Fokin will
return to work in London on Monday, said a duty officer at the
Foreign Ministry.
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the air strikes only complicated any settlement in the long-running
confrontation between the Arab nation and United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   The bombings have increased anti-American sentiment in Russia.
But next month's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ``will be important for overcoming the negative
consequences of the U.S. use of force against Iraq,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov spoke over the telephone Wednesday
with his British counterpart Robin Cook, and the two discussed
Cook's upcoming trip to Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said in a
press release.
	   Ivanov urged that the U.N. Security Council again take the lead
in dealing with Iraq, and said that particular attention had to be
paid to massive humanitarian efforts by the United Nations to help
the Iraqi people, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and are to remain in place until U.N. inspectors verify that
all weapons of mass destruction have been dismantled.

British American challenge restrictive Formula One rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRACKLEY, England (AP) _ British American Racing launched legal
action Wednesday against auto racing's world governing body over a
rule which could restrict the team's sponsorship in its debut
season on the Formula One circuit.
	   A statement released Wednesday by British American Racing
confirmed the team had instigated a legal challenge against FIA
concerning a new rule which requires each team to ``run its cars in
substantially the same livery at each Grand Prix.''
	   ``British American Racing believes this inhibits its commercial
freedom when dealing with potential sponsors,'' the statement
continued.
	   British American Racing managing director Craig Pollock said
papers had been filed to challenge the authority of FIA to
introduce such a rule and a decision was expected by mid-January.
	   ``We have tried to explore every possible avenue to resolve the
matter and avoid taking this course of action,'' he said.
``However, FIA did not give us any other option and we have
therefore intiated formal legal proceedings.''
	   ``We have already demonstrated that we will do everything
possible to be a serious contender in Formula One and therefore
have no choice but to take all legal steps available to protect our
interests and those of our sponsors.''

Big fish in Blair's Cabinet resigns as home loan questioned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; adds background, comment &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Peter Mandelson, the master of spin in Prime
Minister Tony Blair's election victory a year ago, resigned from
the Cabinet Wednesday following questions about a big loan from a
colleague.
	   Mandelson was instrumental in reviving a Labor Party battered
into irrelevance in the 1980s by internal feuding and unpopular
policies. His going left a little mud sticking to a government that
prided itself on high standards.
	   Mandelson, 45, resigned as secretary for trade and industry a
day after The Guardian newspaper disclosed that he received a home
loan of 373,000 pounds (dlrs 627,000) in 1996 from fellow
legislator Geoffrey Robinson.
	   Mandelson hadn't told Blair about that until last week, and he
hadn't told his department when it started investigating some of
Robinson's business interests. Hours after Mandelson resigned,
Robinson, 50, resigned as paymaster general at the Treasury.
	   ``We are all going to sleep easier because if it had carried on
festering horrendously over Christmas the government would have
suffered.'' said Rhodri Morgan, a Labor lawmaker from Wales.
	   However, The Guardian said questions were now being raised about
Robinson's financial support for Gordon Brown, now the Treasury
chief, before the 1997 election. The Treasury refused Tuesday to
answer questions on that issue, The Guardian said.
	   Robinson apologized to the House of Commons last month for
failing to disclose some of his financial interests, including a
stake in an offshore trust.
	   Mandelson protested that he had not transgressed Blair's code of
conduct, but the case produced hostile headlines Wednesday. The
Sun, the largest-circulation tabloid, quoted Blair's past calls for
Labor to be ``purer than pure,'' and headlined: ``So how the hell
can Mandy stay?''
	   ``I should not, with all candor, have entered into the
arrangement,'' Mandelson said in a resignation letter to Blair. ``I
should, having done so, have told you and other colleagues whose
advice I value ...''
	   Mandelson remains in Parliament and many expect him to return to
prominence after a period of penitence on the backbenches.
	   Stephen Byers, already in the Cabinet as chief secretary to the
Treasury, will replace Mandelson, Blair's office said.
	   Defending himself on Tuesday, Mandelson described himself and
Robinson as ``fairly publicity-friendly, controversial, fairly
exotic personalities.''
	   Robinson was controversial because of the way he used his
wealth, and sheltered it from taxes; Mandelson because of his power
and his closeness to Blair. Mandelson gave Labor a new red rose
symbol in the 1980s, and he masterminded the lavish Millennium Dome
now rising in Greenwich which symbolizes Blair's aspirations for
Britain's future.
	   There was a media kerfuffle last month when a columnist claimed
on television that Mandelson was gay. The claim was hardly new, but
the BBC's order to its reporters to not repeat it insured that it
was widely reported everywhere else.
	   Labor has stumbled before on money matters. After Blair backed
an exemption for Formula One racing from a proposed European ban on
tobacco advertising in sport, it was disclosed that Formula One
boss Bernie Ecclestone gave the party a million pounds (dlrs 1.7
million) before the election. Labor refunded his contribution.
	   Derek Draper, a former sidekick of Mandelson, was fired from a
lobbying firm after journalists caught him boasting that he could
offer his paying clients access to powerful figures in government.
	   Mandelson was born to politics. His grandfather, Herbert
Morrison, was a member of Winston Churchill's war-time Cabinet and
briefly foreign secretary under Labor Prime Minister Clement
Attlee.
	   Mandelson won a seat in the House of Commons in 1992, and was
promoted to the Cabinet earlier this year.

Israel historian to examine German media giant's Nazi past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ An Israeli historian specializing in the Nazi era
will lead a panel examining German media giant Bertelsmann's
wartime activities, the company announced Wednesday.
	   In a statement, Bertelsmann board chairman Thomas Middelhoff
said Saul Friedlaender would have unrestricted access to company
archives and would publish his findings ``without influence from
Bertelsmann.''
	   Friedlaender, 66, lives in Jerusalem and teaches history at the
University of Tel Aviv and at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
	   Bertelsmann last week announced it would re-examine its
corporate history in light of new charges that the company had
covered up its Nazi past.
	   Founded in 1835 as a publisher of prayer books and hymnals,
Bertelsmann is now the world's third largest media concern, owner
of Random House and a partner in ventures ranging from Europe's
biggest commercial broadcaster to Barnes &AMP; Noble's Internet
bookstore.
	   In a corporate history prepared for its 150th anniversary,
Bertelsmann maintained it was shut down by the Nazis in 1943
because of the devout Christianity of its then-boss, Heinrich Mohn.
	   However, a German sociologist reported in a Swiss newspaper in
October that Mohn was a ``passive'' member of the SS. He also wrote
that Bertelsmann published pro-Hitler books used by the Nazi
propaganda machine in the 1930s and '40s as well as action stories
glorifying battles and anti-Semitic works.

Light plane's engine catches fire in Puerto Rico, no injuries

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A small airplane skidded off the
runway of San Juan's main airport Wednesday after the pilot landed
because of a burning engine.
	   The left engine of the Cessna 402 caught fire shortly after
takeoff at about 10:15 a.m., said Puerto Rico Ports Authority
spokesman Raul Torres.
	   Pilot William Ford managed to land the aircraft at Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport, but as it touched down the right
landing gear collapsed, sending the airplane into a grassy area
near the runway.
	   Firefighters extinguished the flames, and the pilot was unhurt,
Torres said. The aircraft carried no passengers or cargo.
	   The airport closed 2,000 feet of the runway while federal
officials investigate the accident. The airplane is owned by
Tol-Air, a local air freight company.
	   Flights continued uninterrupted on the airport's second runway.

Kosovo Albanian media to defy government warnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Several Albanian-language newspapers
in Kosovo rebuffed on Wednesday Serbia's warning to change their
pro-secession editorial policies or face shutdown.
	   Editors of Kosovo's two largest dailies and the press chief for
the main Kosovo Albanian pro-independence party told reporters they
will defy any attempt at a crackdown resembling that carried out
last October on Serbian-language independent media.
	   ``The Serbian regime is trying to destroy journalism in Kosovo
and put it under state control,'' said Enver Maloku, head of the
Kosovo Information Center, close to Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We won't accept any ultimatum although we are aware that we
carry on at our own risk,'' Maloku said. He also said resources are
limited and the papers don't expect to survive without outside
help.
	   Last week, Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic warned
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian newspapers to cease their support of
``terrorism'' or face punishment under a restrictive new media law.
Vucic also demanded the media outlets register with the authorities
and pay tax.
	   There are about two dozen Albanian-language periodicals in
Kosovo, ranging from dailies to monthly entertainment magazines.
Most are not registered with the authorities, because of the
decades-old ethnic Albanian boycott of central Serbian authorities.
	   Serbian authorities have criticized Kosovo's papers for
publishing statements from the guerrillas, including appeals for
financial help and calls from the KLA for young recruits.
	   In recent months, some independent news organizations in Serbian
have been fined or shut down for their criticism of the Serbia's
autocratic government.
	   Vucic had initially said he would give the Albanian-language
media ``some time'' to adjust their writing to ``respect
territorial integrity of the country,'' following an October
agreement that ended heavy fighting in the province.
	   Binak Kelmendi, editor-in-chief of Bujku, said the state-run
printer has refused to print the daily, citing unpaid debts.
	   ``The same day we received the warning (from the ministry) the
financial pressure on us began,'' Kelmendi said. ``They even
switched off our power supply.''
	   ``We have no weapons to fight against the regime,'' said Baton
Haxhiu, editor of the province's main daily, Koha Ditore. ``Our
only weapon is freedom of speech, and we won't give that up.''

Brazil's president tells new Cabinet to deliver votes or else
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's president told his new Cabinet
Wednesday to help push his economic austerity plan through Congress
_ or else.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who begins his second
four-year term on Jan. 1, said he will fire ministers who don't
deliver their party's votes on the proposals to slash 28 billion
reals, or dlrs 23 billion, from next year's budget.
	   ``If they're not supporting the government, how can they
continue in the government?'' Cardoso said at a press conference in
the capital. ``Of course I'll fire them.''
	   The reforms are aimed at cutting the budget deficit, now around
dlrs 65 billion. Worries about Brazil's ability to pay led
investors to pull more than dlrs 36 billion out of the country
since August.
	   The International Monetary Fund has approved a dlrs 41.5 billion
credit line for Brazil _ provided it meets the targets for cutting
the deficit.
	   The Cabinet _ 22 ministers and eight cabinet-level secretaries _
was picked largely to please the five parties that helped Cardoso
win re-election in October.
	   Despite some new names and innovations, the list is largely
unchanged from the first term. In all, 16 ministers will be back.
	   Powerful Finance Minister Pedro Malan will stay on. So will
Planning Minister Paulo Paiva, although now in the newly created
post of Budget and Management.
	   The most eagerly awaited change was the creation of a ``super
ministry'' of development, commerce and industry, expected to lead
the economy out of a recession predicted to begin in early 1999.
	   Businessmen wanted someone in their corner to fight for lower
interest rates and renewed growth. But the post went to Celso
Lafer, a political scientist and former foreign minister who seems
unlikely to challenge Malan's tough austerity policy.
	   ``Lafer won't fight,'' said political analyst Franklin Martins
of the Globo TV network. The reshuffle was ``like changing six for
half a dozen,'' he said.
	   Another change Cardoso proposed was to fuse four military
ministries in a single defense ministry, to be headed by former
senator, Elcio Alvares, a civilian.
	   Some members of the armed forces, which seized power in a 1964
coup and ruled until 1985, have opposed the change. Congress still
must ratify the idea.
	   Among the newcomers is Jose Pimenta da Veiga, a founding member
of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, as minister of
communications. Jose Sarney Filho, son of former President Jose
Sarney, will get the environment ministry.
	   Of the outgoing ministers, Cardoso tried unsuccessfully to
persuade one to stay on: Pele, the special minister of sports. The
legendary soccer star said he would continue to back the
government's projects but not as minister.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel asked an
independent lawmaker in Turkey's Cabinet to form a new government
Wednesday after a veteran leftist leader failed to gather enough
support in parliament.
	   Demirel picked Yalim Erez, the industry and trade minister, in
hopes he could draw wide support from Turkey's bickering political
parties.
	   Erez told reporters he would search for consensus, saying, ``I
am at an equal distance to all of the parties.''
	   ``Today is not a day for political squabbles and small political
calculations,'' he said. ``Turkey has no more patience for a
government crisis.''
	   The government of Mesut Yilmaz, who is now acting premier,
collapsed last month in a vote of no-confidence over a mafia and
corruption scandal.
	   Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party abandoned efforts to
form a new government on Monday after a 3-week-old attempt failed
to receive enough backing to secure a majority in Parliament.
	   Demirel turned to an independent lawmaker instead of a party
leader after most parties _ unable to overcome their differences to
form alliances _ said they would support a government led by a
low-profile figure until April elections.
	   The president bucked the longstanding tradition of designating
the leader of the largest party in Parliament as premier _ which
would have brought the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party to power.
	   The military would have been sure to oppose such a government.
Turkey's generals pressured an Islamic predecessor of the Virtue
Party out of power in June 1997, accusing it of trying to raise the
profile of Islam in society.
	   Erez appears to be chosen in part because he sided with the
pro-secular establishment. He resigned from a ministerial post that
he held during an earlier coalition between his center-right True
Path Party and the earlier Islamic party in April 1997, two months
after the military warned the government to abide by Turkey's
strictly secular constitution.
	   On Tuesday, Turkey's top general, Huseyin Kivrikoglu, issued a
statement reminding the country that the armed forces were
committed to protecting secular traditions.
	   Erez, 54, a businessman-turned-politican, must now undergo a
vote of confidence in parliament to determine whether he can
command a majority of votes. He said he would start negotiations on
a new coalition on Monday, when he will talk with Virtue leaders.
	   A Virtue lawmaker, Ali Goren, said his party could support Erez
``as long as he intends to form a broad-based government.''
	   Even if Erez loses the vote of confidence, Demirel legally could
still ask him to govern until the April elections seat a new
parliament.
	   Erez reportedly has the backing of Ecevit and Yilmaz. Tansu
Ciller's True Path party declared it would not back Erez.
	   Erez is of Kurdish origins. Kurds are a minority in Turkey and
claim discrimination by the establishment. Kurdish rebels are
fighting a 14-year-old guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast.
	   Erez raised controversy in 1995 when he advocated social and
economic measures _ as well as military means _ to improve life in
the Kurdish-dominated southeast. Lately, the military itself has
supported the idea.
	   Turkey has had other prominent government leaders of Kurdish
origins, including current parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and late
President Turgut Ozal.

National Front executive formally kicks out rebels

	   SAINT-CLOUD, France (AP) _ A feud within the far-right National
Front further intensified Wednesday when the executive committee
formally expelled the party's No. 2 leader, whose rebellious allies
pressed ahead for a party congress.
	   ``The National Front is not a free-for-all,'' the party's
Secretary-General Bruno Gollnisch said in announcing the expulsion
of Bruno Megret and six other leaders.
	   ``In face of the seriousness of those actions, the executive
bureau, holding a disciplinary meeting, took that painful but firm
decision,'' he told a news conference at the party headquarters in
this western Paris suburb.
	   Megret and the six others had already been suspended from the
party earlier this month after challenging the party's founder and
leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
	   The others expelled were Serge Martinez, Daniel Simonpieri,
Jean-Yves Le Gallou, Franck Timmermans, Philippe Olivier et Pierre
Vial.
	   The latest crisis within the National Front was centered on
Megret's call for a special party congress to heal divisions -- a
move Le Pen saw as a trap to unseat him.
	   Martinez said earlier in the day that the Megret faction had
collected the signatures of 14,000 party members calling for the
congress on Jan. 24. ``That's more than one-third'' of the part
membership, he told a news conference.
	   The sacks of mail with the members' letters were to arrive at
the
	   Gollnisch said the claim was a ``gigantic bluff'' and called the
proposed meeting a ``pirate congress.''
	   The ambitious Megret, 47, first challenged the fiery 70-year-old
Le Pen this fall by insisting that he, not Le Pen's wife Jany, lead
the party slate in next year's European Parliament elections.
	   Le Pen wanted his wife to run after he was threatened by court
action that could bar him from politics.
	   The anti-immigration party, accused of racism and anti-Semitism,
traditionally wins about 15 percent of the national vote in
elections.
	   But a recent poll indicated the National Front could lose up to
half its voting bloc over the feud.

Former NATO chief Willy Claes found guilty of accepting bribes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's high court convicted found
former NATO chief Willy Claes of accepting bribes Wednesday in the
awarding of lucrative defense contracts to European firms during
the 1980s.
	   The Supreme Court gave Claes, 60, the maximum penalty following
a 3 1/2-month trial: a three-year suspended jail term and the loss
of his civic rights, which means he is barred from voting or being
voted into office for five years.
	   The 15-judge court also gave former Defense Minister Guy Coeme a
two-year suspended sentence for corruption involving Italy's Agusta
SpA and France's Dassault aviation firm and similarly convicted
former Vice Premier Guy Spitaels and Serge Dassault, the head of
Dassault.
	   Eight former aides and associates also were convicted and
received suspended sentences of up to two years.
	   The court, which held the trial after the parliamentary immunity
of Claes and the other former Cabinet members had been lifted, said
Claes had to have known Agusta paid dlrs 1.37 million to pave the
way toward the awarding of a 1988 contract for 46 army helicopters.
	   The court also found Dassault's payment of dlrs 1.62 million to
win a 1989 deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics
involved corruption and other irregularities at the expense of a
rival bid by Litton Industries Inc. of Woodland Hills, California.
	   The trial was considered the final curtain for a generation of
Belgian party leaders who, until the 1990s, ruled unhindered by any
law banning corporate political donations.
	   Belgium didn't outlaw such donations until 1989. To prove
corruption, prosecutors were required to show that ``gifts'' from
Agusta and Dassault were timed so closely to the awarding of
contracts that Claes and the others must have known they were
bribes.
	   The trial's origin, however, lies in the still-unresolved murder
of Andre Cools, a one-time socialist minister who was slain by
hired killers in 1991, presumably because he knew of financial
wrongdoing and was about to talk.
	   Claes became NATO secretary-general in September 1994. He quit
13 months later amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days
as Belgian economics minister.
	   Claes issued a brief statement calling the case against him
politically motivated and said he would appeal to the European
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Appeal to the high
court ruling is not possible.
	   ``The logic of prosecution, which earlier led to my resignation
as NATO secretary-general, demanded a conviction,'' he said. ``This
is totally unjust (and) I don't accept it.''
	   An appeal to the human rights court will take years and will not
suspend implementation of Claes' conviction and sentence in
Belgium.
	   Other defendants sounded equally bitter.

Twelve killed as truck goes off cliff in Peru's Andes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A truck carrying cattle ranchers over a rocky
road high in Peru's Andes mountains plummeted off a cliff, killing
12 people and injuring three, police said Wednesday.
	   The open bed truck was carrying 25 passengers and meat to a
local fair Monday when it swerved off the road and rolled down a
165-foot (50-meter) cliff in the department of Cuzco, 350 miles
(565 kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   Rescuers had to scramble down the steep embankment to reach the
truck, which came to rest on a riverbank at the bottom of the
ravine, a police spokesman said.
	   News of the accident was delayed by the accident's remote
location. The site was more than 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) above
sea level.
	   Police blamed the accident on excessive speed and the poor
condition of the unpaved road, which lacked guard rails.

Polish miners suspend underground sit-in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Miners from the Solidarity trade union on
Wednesday suspended an underground sit-in that spread to more than
50 mines.
	   Hundreds of coal miners taking part in the protest went home in
the afternoon after being told by union leaders the sit-in was
suspended until after the Christmas and New Year holidays, the PAP
state news agency reported.
	   The suspension followed government promises Tuesday that miners
and others working in dangerous conditions can still get full
pensions when they retire after 25 years of work, despite changes
in a new pension bill that set retirement ages of 65 for men and 60
for women.
	   Protesting miners demanded that the current system, with full
pension paid to people of any age who work 25 years, remain intact.
	   Solidarity leaders continued talks with government officials
Wednesday on details of the government proposal guaranteeing early
retirement pensions for the miners.
	   The sit-in began Dec. 10 at a coal mine in the Silesia region of
southern Poland and spread to more than 50 mines, involving more
than 400 workers, as of Tuesday.
	   During negotiations Tuesday, employers proposed that workers in
dangerous conditions would receive so-called ``bridge'' pensions of
70 percent of their monthly wages if they retire with 25 years of
service before the legal age. They would receive the regular full
pension when they reach the legal retirement age.
	   Details of the plan _ such as who will pay for the bridge
pensions _ still remained to be worked out, with more talks
scheduled between the government and employers in early January.
	   Henryk Nakonieczny, leader of the Solidarity union's National
Hard Coal Mining section, said the protest would be resumed in
January. The union also has threatened a national strike at an
undetermined date if no agreement is reached.
	   Solidarity miners also oppose a mining restructuring plan that
would cut jobs and production.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's Solidarity-led governing coalition,
which took power in October 1997 from a leftist government, has
been working on widespread social and economic reforms expected to
complete Poland's transition from communism to a market economy.
	   The reforms include restructuring ailing industries such as
mining and steel. Coal mining restructuring calls for reducing
production from 137 million tons last year to 110 million tons in
2002, as well as cutting jobs by more than 40 percent _ from
245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Israel pledged to retaliate
against Lebanese guerrillas who launched a hail of rockets across
the northern border Wednesday, raising tensions on an additional
front as the peace with the Palestinians unravels.
	   The attack from the Hezbollah militia came at 7:30 a.m., just as
school children were emerging from bomb shelters where they had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack.
	   The north had braced for an attack after an Israeli airstrike
Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in eastern Lebanon.
Israel said the building was targeted by mistake, but it was the
highest civilian casualty toll this year in the war between Israel
and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In the retaliatory Katyusha rocket attack, 16 Israelis were
injured _ 15 suffering from shock, and one suffering moderate
wounds _ and there was extensive property damage.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations,
when we want. And we will react.''
	   Israel's parliament has just agreed to go to early elections,
likely to take place by June _ a decision sparked by the collapse
of peace talks with the Palestinians and a wave of anti-Israel
violence. Security issues _ and peace with Israel's neighbors _
will likely dominate the campaign.
	   Attacks such as the one on Wednesday reinforce pro-withdrawal
sentiment among some Israelis, who say Israel should unilaterally
withdraw its troops from a country where they are not wanted.
	   ``Government error, not pilot error'' was to blame for the
damage in the north, dovish legislator Dedi Zucker told Israel
radio.
	   Other Israelis say withdrawal would increase the vulnerability
of Israel's northern border. One Cabinet minister called for Israel
to retaliate by knocking out electricity to Beirut.
	   ``Hezbollah should know, before they force residents of the
north into shelters that (their activities) will force residents of
Beirut into shelters,'' Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
told army radio.
	   Senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan called the rocket attack
``totally unwarranted'' and warned it could lead to an escalation
of the war in Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's barrage was the heaviest Katyusha attack in nearly
three years.
	   Dozens of rockets fell with enormous booms that could be heard
for kilometers (miles).
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks. ``Murderers must pay the price
of their crimes,'' the statement said.
	   Hundreds of people shouting ``Death to Israel'' gathered in the
main square of Baalbek Wednesday for the funeral of the woman and
her six children.
	   The bodies of Nada Othman and her children aged 2 to 13 were
laid in the square in coffins wrapped by red flags symbolizing
martyrdom. They included a small casket containing the remains of
the youngest victim, Sobhi Othman.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying the
target of the air strike had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no
comparison between the two actions.
	   ``There is a difference between a malfunction we are sorry for
... and an intended action to harm civilians at a time when they
thought they would be on their way out to schools and other
places,'' Mordechai said during his own northern tour.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Ethiopia denies being aided by Sudan in conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ethiopia on Wednesday denied claims that
it is using Port Sudan on Sudan's Red Sea coast for logistical
support in its seven-month border conflict with Eritrea.
	   In a statement received in Nairobi, the Ethiopian government
said the claim made by Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae
Tuesday was baseless.
	   ``The Eritrean regime is once again lying to the international
community,'' said the statement, using the strong language that
come to characterized public statements from both countries since
fighting erupted in May.
	   ``Ethiopia has not received a single imported item _ not even a
single pencil or food supplies _ let alone arms, through Port
Sudan,'' the statement said.
	   Before the outbreak of fighting, landlocked Ethiopia received
and shipped most of its goods through the Eritrean Red Sea ports of
Assab and Massawa. But it now uses Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden for
most imports and exports.
	   Weldensae also accused Ethiopia of moving troops into Djibouti
to outflank Eritrea.
	   The Ethiopian statement said ``the accusation against Djibouti
is not new, and it has resulted in the decision of Djibouti to
sever diplomatic relations with Eritrea.''
	   No comment was available from authorities in Djibouti.
	   Hostilities erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May over
undemarcated colonial boundaries, and heavy fighting in the first
half of June killed several hundred people.
	   Since then, thousands of troops from both sides are hunkered
down along both sides of their common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile)
border. Periodic shelling at hot spots and large-scale build up of
weapons has sustained tensions.
	   Djibouti severed diplomatic ties with Eritrea Nov. 18, following
Eritrean allegations that the tiny port state in the crook of the
Horn of Africa was aiding the Ethiopian war effort.
	   Ertirea and Sudan broke relations in 1994 amid accusations that
each suppported the other's rebel movements.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
on Wednesday criticized the recent airstrikes against Iraq, but
said President Saddam Hussain must allow in the U.N. inspection
team.
	   ``We firmly believe that the United Nations can play a key role
in resolving the crisis in Iraq,'' Hasina told reporters.
	   The prime minister said the international community should look
for a peaceful way to convince Iraq to comply with the U.N.
resolutions.
	   Muslim extremists in Bangladesh staged street protests last week
to condemn the airstrikes. They burned U.S. flags, calling the
attacks as Western aggression.

Ocalan's lawyer: Ex-Soviet Union most likely haven
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's 5-week-old impasse over an asylum-seeking
Kurdish rebel leader will probably end with Abdullah Ocalan leaving
Italy, Premier Massimo D'Alema said Wednesday.
	   D'Alema's comments came amid growing speculation that the rebel
leader's departure was imminent. Ocalan's Italian lawyer, Giuliano
Pisapia, said the most likely outcome was that Ocalan would go to a
country of the former Soviet Union.
	   Ocalan came to Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum from Turkey, which
is trying him in absentia as a terrorist. His case has strained
relations between Turkey and Italy, which has refused to send him
back to Turkey on the grounds he might face the death penalty
there.
	   ``There aren't any negotiations with foreign countries, but the
most probable conclusion of the Ocalan affair is that the Kurdish
leader will go away from Italy,'' D'Alema told reporters.
	   Pisapia rejected the idea of Ocalan going to a European Union
country, including Greece, Turkey's rival. He indicated Ocalan's
camp had heard nothing from South Africa on the issue of refuge.
	   Ukraine has been one of the countries most talked about as a
possible haven for Ocalan. The ITAR-Tass news agency on Wednesday
quoted the foreign ministries of both Ukraine and Estonia as saying
they had no information about any entry visas being issued to
Ocalan by their missions abroad.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old guerrilla and bombing war seeking autonomy for
Kurds in Turkey's southeast. His odyssey started when Syria
expelled him under Turkish pressure earlier this year.
	   Italian authorities arrested him on a German warrant as soon as
he stepped off a plane from Moscow, which had refused him asylum.
Germany later withdrew its warrant and Ocalan is now a free man at
a villa at Rome.

 &UR; Ukraine's president travels to Turkmenistan for gas talks &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gas deal signing, details, fresh quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ The presidents of Turkmenistan and
Ukraine signed an agreement Wednesday on Turkmen gas imports to
Ukraine in 1999 and agreed to immediately resume gas supplies,
which have been suspended for more than a year.
	   Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov and his Ukrainian
counterpart Leonid Kuchma agreed on supplies of 20 billion cubic
meters (700 billion cubic feet) of gas to Ukraine next year,
Niyazov's press service said.
	   Kuchma arrived in Turkmenistan Wednesday for a two-day visit
dedicated largely to gas imports.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest gas consumer and has
pressed for the resumption of gas supplies from Turkmenistan to
lessen its dependence on neighboring Russia, which covers about 70
percent of Ukraine's gas needs.
	   The former Soviet republic consumes around 80 billion cubic
meters (2.8 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually.
	   ``We have finally cut the Gordian knot, having lifted Russia's
two-year resistance to the buyers' and sellers' plans for Turkmen
gas,'' Kuchma said.
	   ``Thanks to your efforts, we have solved the problem today,''
Niyazov responded.
	   Supplies to Ukraine were suspended in March 1997 over the
country's gas debt of up to dlrs 1 billion and Russia's
disagreement with the price it is paid for transporting Turkmen gas
to Ukraine.
	   Niyazov and Kuchma said Russia's giant Gazprom already has
agreed to let Turkmen gas through its pipeline, and is to confirm
that in a special agreement with Ukraine's state gas monopoly
Naftogaz Ukrainy this week.
	   Niyazov said Turkmenistan was ready to begin sending its gas to
Ukraine as early as this week.
	   Turkmen officials said Ukraine would pay off around dlrs 430
million, or 60 percent of the dlrs 720 million gas deal, with
commodities and the rest with cash.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After going from the top of the ice
hockey world in early 1996 to the bottom later that same year, the
Czech Republic climbed back to the pinnacle in 1998, and waved at
the United States going the other way.
	   When it won the World Championship in May of 1996, the Czechs
became a strong favorite for the North American National Hockey
League-organized World Cup in August and September.
	   But with their North American-based pros, the Czechs collapsed.
They lost three straight and were outscored 17-4 to finish last in
the field of eight.
	   At the same time the Americans were surprising the Russians and
the Canadians and shocked the ice hockey world by winning the
title.
	   So by the time the Olympics _ the first with the much-ballyhooed
``best players in the world'' _ rolled around in February, roles
had been reversed. This time the Americans were the
much-anticipated arrivals, while the Czechs were considered
also-rans.
	   A puck, like a ball, doesn't always bounce the way its supposed
to.
	   While the Americans bombed out, beating only lowly Belarus in
four games, the Czechs rode Dominik Hasek's hot pads, gloves and
reactions to the gold medal.
	   Hasek sprawled and stretched all over the crease, allowed only
six goals in six games and none in the final, enabling the Czech
Republic to beat Russia 1-0 for the title.
	   Defenseman Petr Svoboda scored the lone goal with 11:52 left.
	   ``We don't even know what bonus there will be for winning the
gold medal. We are so proud to represent our country that we
haven't talked about money,'' Hasek said immediately after the
game.
	   ``The difference in the game has just one name _ it's Hasek,''
Russian defenseman Sergei Gonchar said. ``It's impossible to fake
him out. Not even Pavel Bure could do it, and who else can do it
when Pavel can't?''
	   Hasek, whose only big goal left is to win the Stanley Cup with
the Buffalo Sabres, wasn't tested severely in the final. But he was
at his very best in the semifinal round when he stopped five
straight NHL stars in the shootout to lift the Czechs past Canada
2-1.
	   A day later, the international career Gretzky came to an end in
Canada's flat performance against Finland, a 3-2 loss in the
bronze-medal game. Jari Kurri, the Great One's former linemate
during the Edmonton Oilers' heydays in the 1980s, capped a great
career by scoring one goal for the Finns.
	   Finland opened the tournament with two straight losses, then
ended up eliminating defending champion Sweden en route to the
bronze.
	   Sweden, which wound up a disappointing fifth, got its revenge by
edging the Finns 1-0 in two games in the World Championship final
in Switzerland.
	   It was the seventh title for Sweden and the first for Kent
Forsberg in three years as coach.
	   ``It was a very special feeling to win with my dad,'' said Peter
Forsberg, who led Sweden to the 1994 Olympic gold in Lillehammer,
Norway, and later won a Stanley Cup ring with the Colorado
Avalanche.
	   Forsberg and Toronto Maple Leafs star Mats Sundin each had 11
points and goalie Tommy Salo of the New York Islanders recorded
three shutouts and made the All-Star team for the second straight
year. Eight top-flight NHLers played for Sweden.
	   Meanwhile, unlike the Czechs, Swedes or Finns, the Americans
kept spiraling downward after their Olympic elimination and
sixth-place finish. Upon their tournament ouster, unidentified
Americans players trashed their dorm rooms. The culprits, who broke
chairs, damaged walls and doors and set off fire extinguishers in
the early morning of Feb. 18, were never identified.
	   Later, U.S. team captain Chris Chelios sent an apology and a
dlrs 3,000 check to Japanese Olympic officials to cover the
damages, which already had been paid by the U.S. Olympic Committee
and the NHL.
	   But it got worse for the United States at the World
Championships. With its best players busy in the NHL playoffs and
others declining to play, the United States finished last of 12
teams in Switzerland.
	   An unlikely patchwork of NHL oldtimers and leftovers came to the
rescue of the Americans in November in the qualifying tournament
for next year's World Championships in Norway.
	   Led by a trio of veterans, including two from the ``Miracle on
Ice'' squad that stunned the Soviet Union en route to the 1980
Olympic gold, the U.S. team allowed just one goal in three games.
Victories over Olympic quarterfinalist Kazakstan (3-0), Estonia
(7-1) and Austria (2-0) kept the Americans' in the Group A finals
in Norway.
	   With the men providing only disappointment, the United States
had to rely on its women to salvage their pride.
	   The Americans won the first-ever Olympic women's gold medal by
going unbeaten before prevailing over Canada 3-1 in the final at
Nagano, a tournament which showed only three teams in the top tier.
Finland easily beat China 4-1 for the bronze, but in the earlier
rounds, the bottom three teams were outscored 81-22.
	   Elsewhere Finland went unbeaten as hosts to win the World Junior
Championships, beating Russia in the final.
	   The Czech Republic finished ahead of Sweden in the European
Hockey Tour, which consists of the continent's leading tournaments.
Obscure Feldkirch of Austria, led by Swede Bengt-Ake Gustafsson,
formerly of the Washington Capitals, stunned the Nordic countries
top teams to win the European Hockey League.

	   LONDON (AP) _ General Electric Co. PLC of Britain and
Finmeccanica of Italy have formed a defense and electronics joint
venture combining their ground, naval, missile system and air
traffic control activities, the companies announced Wednesday.
	   The venture, Alenia Marconi Systems, will have turnover of about
1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) a year, they said.
	   The agreement comes a day after GEC said it would split its
civil operations from its defense activities to prepare for
European consolidation in defense and aerospace.
	   The company, which is not related to General Electric in the
United States, has been reported to be among the firms talking to
British Aerospace PLC about possible mergers.
	   GE and Finmeccanica also joined with France's Lagardere SA and
Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace to merge their satellite
activities, the companies announced in Paris.
	   General Electric Company rose 6 pence to close at 543.5 pence on
the London Stock Exchange.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet may leave his home if he
needs urgent medical treatment but the former Chilean dictator
would not be allowed out for Christmas church services, a judge
said Wednesday.
	   In an application to Bow Street Magistrates Court in central
London, Pinochet's lawyer, Michael Caplan, did not ask that the
general be allowed to attend Mass.
	   But because of heavy press speculation that he would do so,
Caplan told the judge that his client would be seen by a priest on
Christmas Eve at the house.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
agreed that a private service was better.
	   ``I would not have agreed to him going to church. It has got to
come to him,'' Parkinson said.
	   A Chilean priest was also understood to be flying from Santiago
to be with the Pinochet family over the Christmas period, said a
Chilean embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ukraine's parliament approves Crimean constitution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved
a new constitution for Crimea, allowing the Black Sea resort region
to become the country's only autonomous republic.
	   The 450-seat parliament voted 230-67 to approve the document,
which formally allows Crimea to have its own government and
legislature and permits the republic to independently sign foreign
trade deals.
	   The constitution entitles Crimea to channel to the regional
budget all taxes and duties collected on its territory, and jointly
agree with the central government on appointment of the regional
chief of police and other senior officials.
	   Wednesday's vote appeared to have ended years of confrontation
between the national government and Crimea over the extent of
sovereignty the peninsula should be allowed to have.
	   Crimean lawmakers have submitted four constitutional drafts to
the parliament over the past six years, but all were either
rejected or approved only partially, due to what deputies
considered separatist provisions.
	   Crimea, populated mostly by ethnic Russians, has been part of
Ukraine since Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to the
then-Soviet republic in 1954.
	   It became part of independent Ukraine after the Soviet collapse
in 1991, but many ethnic Russians want it returned to Moscow's
rule. Ukraine's central government has accused Crimea's leaders for
years of pursing a separatist, pro-Russian agenda.
	   The latest draft of the constitution was rejected last week, but
deputies agreed to approve it after inserting a separate provision
that bans Crimea from approving legislation not in accord with
Ukrainian law.
	   The constitution also provides for unfettered use of the Russian
language and the languages of ethnic minorities populating the
region, including Crimean Tatars, who have long demanded legal
confirmation of their rights.
	   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported the large Crimean Tatar
populace to Central Asia in 1944, but about 250,000 of them have
returned to Crimea since the late 1980s, and currently make up
about 10 percent of its population.

Red Wings make their mark while NHL makes changes in 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-1998-Ice Hockey &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Ice Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While the Detroit Red Wings took the shortest
route to the Stanley Cup, the North American National Hockey League
went to some lengths to improve its product in 1998.
	   Not long after the Red Wings swept Washington in the finals for
their second straight Cup, the league literally went back to the
drawing board and among other things changed the look of the ice
for the 1998-99 season.
	   Among the NHL's concerns: A steady decline in scoring through
the 1990s. Among the solutions: Shortening the neutral zone and
enlarging the offensive zones, including the space behind the goal
line, in hopes of opening up the game.
	   While that was still a work in progress, it was business as
usual for the NHL _ and, in some cases, business disasters. The
Pittsburgh Penguins faced possible crippling financial problems and
the New York Islanders, claiming unsafe conditions, tried to break
their lease at the Nassau Coliseum.
	   Both threatened to become public relations nightmares for the
NHL. But both issues were resolved, at least for the moment.
	   The Penguins went into bankruptcy and received a dlrs 20 million
loan from a French bank, allowing the team to remain in business
until the start of the 1999-2000 season. The Islanders remained at
the Coliseum after the building was ruled safe by an engineer, paid
for by the NHL, and after a Nassau County judge issued a temporary
restraining order stopping the team from playing anywhere other
than the Coliseum.
	   Lack of scoring and troubled franchises weren't the only
concerns for the NHL.
	   The league was also worried about the mounting number of
concussions, particularly to such headliners as Anaheim's Paul
Kariya, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine of the New
York Rangers during the 1997-98 season. With Colin Campbell
replacing Brian Burke as the NHL's disciplinarian, the league
aggressively went after head-hunters and cheap-shot artists. It
resulted in a long list of suspended players from the start of
training camp in 1998.
	   Meanwhile, the Phoenix Coyotes presented a different kind of
headache to the teams they faced. The Coyotes were the biggest team
story of the new season with a 14-game unbeaten streak.
	   The Coyotes also put together another amazing streak early in
the 1998-99 season _ holding opponents to two goals or less for 17
straight games. It was one short of the modern NHL record of 18
held by the 1959-60 Montreal Canadiens.
	   Among the great individual stories, John Cullen's was both
amazing and motivational. The Tampa Bay forward sat out a year
battling cancer, but came back for another shot at ice hockey in
the 1998-99 season. His comeback try ended after a short time in
the NHL and then the minor leagues before his retirement. Referee
Paul Stewart, another cancer victim, did return and stuck around
longer.
	   The Red Wings, though, might have topped them all in the
motivational department. Russian defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov
was among those seriously hurt in an automobile accident following
the Red Wings' first Cup victory in 42 years in the spring of 1997.
	   Konstantinov, who suffered brain trauma in the accident and went
through rehabilitation in Florida, served as a motivational
rallying point for the Red Wings in the 1997-98 season. He was
present, front and center, when the Red Wings completed their sweep
at Washington's MCI Center in June to give coach Scotty Bowman his
record-tying eighth Stanley Cup.
	   After Konstantinov made a return visit to Detroit in December,
the Red Wings seemed inspired again by his presence as they beat
the Edmonton Oilers 3-2.
	   ``It's good for us and it's good for him, too,'' Detroit forward
Doug Brown said of Konstantinov's visit. ``It makes us realize how
lucky we are to do what we're doing, and it makes us work that much
harder.''
	   Other than the new look on the ice, the NHL broke with tradition
in some other ways by using two referees on a selective basis for
the first time in its history. The NHL hoped to eliminate
obstruction penalties that didn't allow skill players to operate.
	   The 1998-99 season not only opened with new rules, but a new
team in Nashville, Tennessee, to bring the NHL total to 27. Once a
six-team league, the NHL was now a six-division league for the
first time.
	   Along with the Predators at the Nashville Arena, the Florida
Panthers became another team to christen a new arena when they
opened the new season in Sunrise, Florida. It followed a trend that
has seen 16 new arenas open in the NHL in the 1990s with Toronto on
tap in 1999.
	   Business was good in Nashville, and generally good around the
NHL. While some teams were down at the gate, the league reported
that attendance was on track to break the all-time record of
17,640,529 set in the 1996-97 season.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Israel pledged to retaliate
against Lebanese guerrillas who launched a hail of rockets across
the northern border Wednesday, raising tensions on an additional
front as the peace with the Palestinians unravels.
	   The attack from the Hezbollah militia came at 7:30 a.m., just as
school children were emerging from bomb shelters where they had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack.
	   The north had braced for an attack after an Israeli airstrike
Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in eastern Lebanon.
Israel said the building was targeted by mistake, but it was the
highest civilian casualty toll this year in the war between Israel
and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In the retaliatory Katyusha rocket attack, 16 Israelis were
injured _ 15 suffering from shock, and one suffering moderate
wounds _ and there was extensive property damage.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations,
when we want. And we will react.''
	   Israel's parliament has just agreed to go to early elections,
likely to take place by June _ a decision sparked by the collapse
of peace talks with the Palestinians and a wave of anti-Israel
violence. Security issues _ and peace with Israel's neighbors _
will likely dominate the campaign.
	   The attack came as tensions increased between Palestinians and
Israel following the release Wednesday of Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The Palestinian authority had placed Yassin under house arrest
on Oct. 29, after a Hamas activist killed himself in an
unsuccessful attempt to blow up a school bus full of Israeli
children.
	   Attacks such as the one on Wednesday reinforce pro-withdrawal
sentiment among some Israelis, who say Israel should unilaterally
withdraw its troops from a country where they are not wanted.
	   ``Government error, not pilot error'' was to blame for the
damage in the north, dovish legislator Dedi Zucker told Israel
radio.
	   Other Israelis say withdrawal would increase the vulnerability
of Israel's northern border. One Cabinet minister called for Israel
to retaliate by knocking out electricity to Beirut.
	   ``Hezbollah should know, before they force residents of the
north into shelters that (their activities) will force residents of
Beirut into shelters,'' Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
told army radio.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the armed forces chief of staff, said
withdrawal would create more problems than it would solve.
	   ``To sit on the border without an agreement and without anyone
taking responsibility for the defense of the northern residents ...
will give less security to residents of the north and bring more
work for us,'' Mofaz said.
	   Senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan called the rocket attack
``totally unwarranted'' and warned it could lead to an escalation
of the war in Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's barrage was the heaviest Katyusha attack in nearly
three years.
	   Dozens of rockets fell with enormous booms that could be heard
for kilometers (miles).
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks. ``Murderers must pay the price
of their crimes,'' the statement said.
	   Hundreds of people shouting ``Death to Israel'' gathered in the
main square of Baalbek Wednesday for the funeral of the woman and
her six children.
	   The bodies of Nada Othman and her children aged 2 to 13 were
laid in the square in coffins wrapped by red flags symbolizing
martyrdom. They included a small casket containing the remains of
the youngest victim, Sobhi Othman.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying the
target of the air strike had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   ``The error was human, in incorrectly identifying the target,''
Mofaz said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no
comparison between the two actions.
	   ``There is a difference between a malfunction we are sorry for
... and an intended action to harm civilians at a time when they
thought they would be on their way out to schools and other
places,'' Mordechai said during his own northern tour.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Independent lawmaker asked to form Turkey's next government

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An independent lawmaker agreed Wednesday
to try to put together a new coalition government for Turkey and
indicated he was open to including the country's Islamic party.
	   President Suleyman Demirel asked Yalim Erez, the acting industry
and trade minister, to try for the premiership after a center-left
party leader tried and failed to form a coalition government that
excluded the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party.
	   ``I have no preconceived government formulas,'' Erez told
reporters after getting the nod. ``I am at an equal distance to all
of the parties.''
	   Erez, a 54-year-old businessman-turned-politician of Kurdish
origins, said he would begin negotiations on Monday, starting with
the Virtue Party. At 144 deputies, Virtue is the largest bloc in
the 550-seat parliament.
	   Erez's political rise came after he sided with the military-led,
pro-secular establishment last year, resigning from his
center-right True Path party to protest its alliance with an
earlier Islamic party.
	   Turkey has been searching for a new government since a coalition
government led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed last month over
allegations that the acting premier rigged the sale of a bank.
	   Veteran leftist politician Bulent Ecevit gave up Monday after
three weeks of trying to piece together a coalition of Turkey's
bickering center-left and center-right parties. He had refused to
negotiate with Virtue.
	   Turkey's political instability comes at a time when it is
battling economic troubles, with inflation running at 80 percent
annually; striving to gain membership in the European Union; and
fighting a diplomatic battle for extradition of a Kurdish rebel
leader.
	   By turning to Erez, Demirel snubbed Virtue, breaking with the
tradition of handing the premiership to the leader the largest
party in Parliament.
	   A government led by Virtue's predecessor, Welfare, was pressured
out of power by the military last year, and the party itself was
closed down by the constitutional court for anti-secular
activities.
	   The military is opposed to any deal that would bring Virtue to
power. Leading Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu reminded the country on
Tuesday that the armed forces were committed to protecting secular
traditions.
	   Erez was expected to ask a range of parties to contribute
ministers to his Cabinet. True Path leader Tansu Ciller has been
the only party leader to announce her opposition.
	   Erez must submit any eventual coalition to a parliamentary vote
of confidence to see if it can command a majority in the
legislature. Even if he loses, Demirel still could ask him to
govern until new parliamentary elections, set for April.
	   Erez caused a stir in 1995 when he advocated social and economic
measures _ as well as military means _ to improve life in the
Kurdish-dominated southeast. Lately, however, the military itself
has supported the idea.
	   Turkey's has 12 million Kurds, who seek wider cultural rights
such as the use of the Kurdish language in education and
broadcasts. A Kurdish rebel group is fighting a 14-year-old war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
	   Turkey has had other prominent leaders of Kurdish origins,
including current parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and late
President Turgut Ozal.

Round-the-world balloonists head for Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest position of balloon, tracking of ships; No

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trio of balloonists soaring over northern Asia
swept across the Yellow Sea on Wednesday, leaving prohibited
Chinese airspace and heading for the United States in their bid to
make the first nonstop balloon voyage around the world.
	   After two days of diplomatic tension over the balloon's passage
through China, the craft finally cleared Chinese airspace shortly
before 1530 GMT, the project's ground crew said.
	   The ICO Global balloon carrying British tycoon Richard Branson,
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden,
was moving at about 40 knots (45 mph and 72 kph) when it left China
_ a speed that would take it to Japan in about 10 hours on a path
between the cities of Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, a spokeswoman said.
	   ``We are quietly confident that this next sector is going to be
O.K.,'' project director Mike Kendrick told SKY News on Wednesday
evening, referring to the balloon's approach toward the Pacific.
	   ``We are actually now in the jet, we are doing about 85 miles
per hour (137 kilometers per hour), we are heading straight to the
core of the jet, and we expect to accelerate to speeds of up to 130
miles per hour 130 (209 kilometers per hour) in the next three or
four hours,'' he said. ``If that happens we have a great shot at
being in America for Christmas.''
	   Branson had told to BBC Radio earlier Wednesday that he expected
the craft to float into the United States over Washington state.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   Beijing had said the balloonists could cross China below 26
degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted further north on
Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed
airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia. After diplomatic
communications between Britain and China, the balloonists were
allowed to continue flying if they left China as quickly as
possible.
	   ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese
finally let us through,'' Branson said.
	   The ground crew said the Pacific leg of the journey was the most
hazardous.
	   ``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate
that far out,'' project director Mike Kendrick told Sky TV.
	   ``The frequency of shipping is not good. If they ditch in the
Pacific it is very difficult and the chances of survival are not
good, though we have to make sure everything is right.''
	   He said ground crew are tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific should the balloonists
need rescuing by the nearest ship.
	   ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said Kendrick. ``We
are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which will give us a
good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.''
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days
to nearly three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere
in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight,
which will take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific
and the United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
all parties in Lebanon Wednesday to end military action and stop
endangering civilians.
	   ``He deplores the death of Lebanese civilians in an Israeli air
raid which prompted the firing of rockets by Lebanese armed
elements into northern Israel, endangering Israeli civilians,'' a
U.N. spokesman said.
	   An Israeli airstrike Tuesday killed a woman and her six children
in eastern Lebanon. Israel said the building was targeted by
mistake, but it was the highest civilian casualty toll this year in
the war between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In a retaliatory attack, Lebanese guerrillas launched Katuysha
rockets across the Israeli border Wednesday, injuring 16 Israelis
at Kiryat Shemona _ 15 suffering from shock, and one suffering
moderate wounds.
	   Secretary-general Annan urged ``the parties concerned to put an
end to the violence and in particular to respect the noncombatant
status of civilians,'' the U.N. spokesman said.

Fighting between Angolan army, rebels continues in central

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan government forces and UNITA rebels
battled Wednesday, while reports indicated that the army had taken
over two rebel towns in the central highlands, worsening the plight
of thousands of displaced people.
	   In Huambo province, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast
of the capital, Luanda, ``battles rage all over the place,''
according to an aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The government has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of
Caala,'' the aid worker said, referring to two towns approximately
40 kilometers (25 miles) from Huambo city.
	   ``I went 15 kilometers (10 miles) out of Huambo and I could hear
the artillery fire,'' the aid worker said, adding that the city
itself had not been shelled.
	   Vila Nova, one of UNITA's bases in Huambo province, lies between
Huambo and Kuito, the capital of neighboring Bie province, 130
kilometers (80 miles) northeast and under rebel siege.
	   Huambo, perched high in the central highlands, was reduced to
rubble in one of the country's most brutal sieges, when government
troops ousted UNITA rebels in 1993.
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
following the vast southwest African country's independence from
Portugal. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first
elections and returned to war.
	   The resumption of fighting this month has sent more than 50,000
displaced people flooding into Huambo, which had a population of
about 100,000.
	   ``This outbreak of fighting coincided with harvest time, so all
the harvest was lost, and all the shops are out of stock,'' the aid
worker said.
	   Roads leading into Huambo ``are open, but almost impassable
because they're in poor conditions and it's not safe,'' the aid
worker added.
	   The airport, under military control, has closed to commercial
flights.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is planning to fly about 300 tons of
food supplies into Huambo over the next two weeks.
	   In the neighboring Bie province, the center of Kuito _ hit
Tuesday by rebel artillery shells _ was quiet Wednesday, the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Bie told state radio, RNA.
	   The rebels have kept the provincial capital under siege for
about two weeks. An International Red Cross statement said there
was 160 people wounded, some in serious condition.
	   There are some 160,000 people holed up in the city and the
airport is closed.
	   The government and UNITA signed a second peace agreement in
1994, under the auspices of the United Nations, but unending
friction between them have led to renewed clashes in the diamond-
and oil-rich country.
	   In a statement released Wednesday in Luanda, the government
condemned the international community for its ``passivity and
complicity'' in face of UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994
accord.
	   It added that UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ now has a 40,000-strong army equipped with
``armored vehicles, long-range artillery and great fire power,''
despite the agreement's stipulations that the rebels should disarm.

Amnesty: fighters in Republic of Congo commit atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Amnesty International on
Wednesday accused government and rebel militia fighters in Republic
of Congo of wholesale civilian executions, raping women and
shelling populous neighborhoods.
	   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's personal Cobra militia had
reportedly slaughtered unarmed civilians accused of supporting the
rival Ninja militia loyal to former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas,
Amnesty said in a written statement received here.
	   Government forces had also used rocket launchers and heavy
artillery to shell densely-populated neighborhoods said to be Ninja
strongholds, the human rights group added.
	   As many as 15,000 people have fled from the southern part of the
country to neighboring Congo, the former Zaire, and thousands of
others were taking refuge in forests south of Brazzaville. The U.N.
World Food Program on Tuesday estimated that at least 20,000
refugees had poured into the capital of Brazzaville.
	   Amnesty appealed to the governments of Angola and Chad, which
have soldiers in Republic of Congo backing Sassou-Nguesso, to use
their influence with the government to ``prevent abuses and protect
unarmed civilians.''
	   Recent abuses bear a resemblance to atrocities committed during
Republic of Congo's 1997 civil war, in which as many as 10,000
people were killed, according to Amnesty which called for an
independent investigation into abuses committed by both sides.
	   After weekend clashes, relative calm has been restored to the
already crumbling capital of Brazzaville. But few people ventured
back to their homes.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of last year's civil war that
ravaged Brazzaville when Sassou-Nguesso, backed by his ``Cobra''
militia, captured the presidency from Pascal Lissouba, a sometime
ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator who is now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multi-party elections in 1992.

	   The introduction of the euro, a common currency for 11 countries
in Europe, on Jan. 4 will bring several changes to two AP financial
market fixtures. Here's a rundown:
	    &UR; FOREIGN CURRENCY TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting with tables produced Monday, Jan. 4, quotes for the ECU
and its forward contracts will be listed as euro. This item is
slugged BC-US-Foreign Exchange and moves to all points.
	   The currencies from the 11 participating countries will still
appear in the table. There will be a three-year transition period
during which euros and the existing national currencies will both
be recognized as legal tender.
	   However, during this time, the national currencies from the 11
countries will be locked to the euro, meaning that they will move
in unison against the dollar and other currencies as the euro does.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
	    &UR; FOREIGN STOCK TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting Jan. 4, tables that show the prices of stocks traded in
the 11 countries using the euro will be quoted in euros. This item
is slugged BC-Europe Markets, which moves to subscribers in Europe
and Latin America.
	   The list that moves Dec. 31 will contain the current stock price
and the previous stock price in the existing currency. The list
that moves Jan. 4 will have both prices in euros.
	   The exchanges affected are: Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
Madrid, Milan, Paris. Exchanges in the list that won't be changing
are: Johannesburg, London, Stockholm and Zurich.

Russian parliament rejects bill to expand land ownership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zyuganov reaction, fresh quotes, in new grafs

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday rejected the latest
version of a land bill designed to expand the ownership of private
property, including farmland.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has been battling with the
Communist-dominated parliament for years in a bid to increase
private land ownership.
	   But seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia
still has no comprehensive law on land ownership. Land could not be
privately owned during Soviet times.
	   The proposed Land Code has been going back and forth between
Yeltsin's administration and parliament for the past year.
	   Seeking to win the bill's approval, Yeltsin has offered several
concessions to Communists and other hard-line lawmakers who want to
keep most land, and particularly farmland, under state ownership.
	   The version that was turned down Wednesday would have allowed
limited private ownership of farmland, but would have banned its
sale from one private individual to another.
	   Lawmakers rejected the bill in two separate votes Wednesday.
	   The bill can be adopted only if it includes a ``clear provision
banning the sale of agricultural land,'' said Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, he voted for the bill in order to ``curb lawlessness''
in land sales, ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
	   Since the 1991 Soviet breakup, Russian citizens have been
permitted to own land in urban areas, but agricultural plots mostly
remain state property and are often farmed collectively as in
Soviet times.
	   Communists and their allies argue that if privatization of
farmland is allowed, it would be snapped up by rich Russians and
foreigners who would take it out of agricultural use.
	   In the absence of a Land Code, Yeltsin has been regulating minor
land ownership issues by decree, and several regions have adopted
their own land laws.
	   Last spring, the Volga River region of Saratov held Russia's
first auction of farm land since the Russian revolution in 1917.
Yeltsin praised the auction while parliament condemned it.

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Israel pledged to retaliate
against Lebanese guerrillas who launched a hail of rockets
Wednesday across the northern border, raising tensions on an
additional front as the peace with the Palestinians unravels.
	   The attack from the Hezbollah militia came in the morning, just
as school children were emerging from bomb shelters where they had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack.
	   The north had braced for an attack after an Israeli airstrike
Tuesday killed a woman and her six children in eastern Lebanon.
Israel said the building was targeted by mistake, but it was the
highest civilian casualty toll this year in the war between Israel
and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In the retaliatory Katyusha rocket attack, 16 Israelis were
injured _ 15 suffering from shock, and one suffering moderate
wounds _ and there was extensive property damage.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of
his security Cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter
to the area that had come under attack.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations,
when we want. And we will react.''
	   Israel's parliament has just agreed to go to early elections,
likely to take place by June _ a decision sparked by the collapse
of peace talks with the Palestinians and a wave of anti-Israel
violence. Security issues _ and peace with Israel's neighbors _
will likely dominate the campaign.
	   The attack came as tensions increased between Palestinians and
Israel following the release Wednesday of Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The Palestinian authority had placed Yassin under house arrest
on Oct. 29, after a Hamas activist killed himself in an
unsuccessful attempt to blow up a school bus full of Israeli
children.
	   Attacks such as the one on Wednesday reinforce pro-withdrawal
sentiment among some Israelis, who say Israel should unilaterally
withdraw its troops from a country where they are not wanted.
	   ``Government error, not pilot error'' was to blame for the
damage in the north, dovish legislator Dedi Zucker told Israel
radio.
	   Other Israelis say withdrawal would increase the vulnerability
of Israel's northern border. One Cabinet minister called for Israel
to retaliate by knocking out electricity to Beirut.
	   ``Hezbollah should know, before they force residents of the
north into shelters that (their activities) will force residents of
Beirut into shelters,'' Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
told army radio.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the armed forces chief of staff, said
withdrawal would create more problems than it would solve.
	   ``To sit on the border without an agreement and without anyone
taking responsibility for the defense of the northern residents ...
will give less security to residents of the north and bring more
work for us,'' Mofaz said.
	   Senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan called the rocket attack
``totally unwarranted'' and warned it could lead to an escalation
of the war in Lebanon.
	   Wednesday's barrage was the heaviest Katyusha attack in nearly
three years.
	   Dozens of rockets fell with enormous booms that could be heard
for kilometers (miles).
	   Tens of thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay
in shelters all day. Israel's army said its forces returned
artillery fire, but gave no other details about the military
response.
	   In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so often hit by rocket
attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' _ one rocket
smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken glass
littered the streets.
	   ``What is here is tremendous damage _ to property,'' Mayor Chaim
Barbivai told army radio. ``People were in shelters... We were
ready for this situation.''
	   In its claim of responsibility for Wednesday's rocketing,
Hezbollah threatened more attacks. ``Murderers must pay the price
of their crimes,'' the statement said.	   Hundreds of people shouting ``Death to Israel'' gathered in the
main square of Baalbek Wednesday for the funeral of the woman and
her six children.
	   The bodies of Nada Othman and her children aged 2 to 13 were
laid in the square in coffins wrapped by red flags symbolizing
martyrdom. They included a small casket containing the remains of
the youngest victim, Sobhi Othman.
	   Israel expressed regret over the civilian deaths, saying the
target of the air strike had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   ``The error was human, in incorrectly identifying the target,''
Mofaz said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no
comparison between the two actions.
	   ``There is a difference between a malfunction we are sorry for
... and an intended action to harm civilians at a time when they
thought they would be on their way out to schools and other
places,'' Mordechai said during his own northern tour.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000
soldiers out of its occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Greece's robbers on a roll at Christmas highstreets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEREK GATOPOULOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Santa needs some security in Greece.
	   Stick-up men are on their annual rampage, taking advantage of
the Christmas bustle to snatch money from banks, post offices and
cash delivery vans.
	   A pair of armed robbers Wednesday were caught between double
doors at bank in the northern port of Salonica, but still managed
to break out, media reports said.
	   In another part of Salonica, the job was a lot easier. Two
gunmen went into post office and walked out with a bag full of
money five minutes later.
	   In Athens, two women punched and kicked an 80-year-old lady at
home and took her savings of 300,000 drachmas (dlrs 1,100). Other
lonely elderly people were also targeted.
	   The rash of holiday holdups, mostly in Athens, comes despite
heightened police measures. A 250-officer Bank Robbery Squad was
created last month and began foot and motorcycle patrols of
downtown Athens and ``high risk'' districts.
	   But Christmas heists must be worth the risk. More money is
changing hands that at any other time of the year. And Greeks, by
law, get paid an extra monthly salary as a Christmas bonus every
year. Taxi fares go up for the same reason.
	   Earlier this week, a man in Athens drove off with a truck
carrying 1,300 turkeys donated to workers at a cigarette company by
the American Farm School in northern Greece. And on Dec. 17,
robbers showed up after a bank had closed, but smashed the door
with the sledge hammer and snatched 117 million drachmas (dlrs
400,000). That was this year's record.
	   The seasonal larceny ends a particularly lawless year in Greece.
	   About 110 banks have fallen prey to armed robbers this year, not
including this week's spate and frequent hold-ups at supermarkets
and post offices.
	   Dimitris Kouselas, leader of the national bank employees union,
said many banks are still largely defenseless against robbers.
``There are two problems, the safety measures are not enough and
they are not enforced,'' Kouselas said.
	   His union helped draw up new security guidelines expected to
take effect in February which will force banks to install double
doors and bullet-proof cashier windows. Stiff fines will be imposed
on banks that do not follow the new codes.
	   ``We'll see if these measures work in practice,'' he said. ``If
they're not enforced, we are ready for dynamic protests,'' _ union
jargon for a strike.

Villa aim to charge into new year in pole position
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa boss John Gregory is confident his
Birmingham outfit will finish 1998 with a winning double as Premier
League teams chase a crucial six points on offer between Christmas
and New Year.
	   Villa has a three point buffer over Chelsea at the top of the
standings and has matches against Blackburn on Boxing Day and
Sheffield Wednesday on Monday before the league goes into recess
for F.A. Cup matches.
	   Wins over the struggling Blackburn Rovers and Wednesday would
see Villa into the new year as outright league leaders.
	   Only two teams, Manchester United in 1993-94 and Blackburn in
1994-95, have been able to extend a mid-season lead into a
premiership title since the Premier League was formed.
	   Last season, Manchester United had a 13-point lead over Arsenal
at New Year before squandering the advantage as the Gunners fought
back to win the league and F.A. Cup double.
	   However, Gregory said he believes Villa is capable of holding
off season-ending challenges from teams like Chelsea, Arsenal and
Manchester United and he can't see why they can't go all the way.
	   ``Our major strength this season has been the desire and will to
win,'' Gregory said Monday after Villa ground out a 1-0 win over
Charlton.
	   Gregory described his all-English squad _ the only foreign
player in the squad is injured Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich _
as ``a team of grinders.''
	   ``I don't have the players that Manchester United or Chelsea
have but it's a hard-working unit with resilient players who don't
know how to give up. They will get better and better.''
	   West Ham manager Harry Redknapp is expecting former Arsenal
striker Ian Wright to be given a hero's welcome when the Hammers
visit Highbury on Boxing Day.
	   Wright, Arsenal's record goal-scorer, will be returning to
Highbury for the first time since leaving the north London club for
West Ham after last season's double title campaign.
	   West Ham, Arsenal and Leeds share fifth place in the standings
on 29 points, with the Gunners edging ahead of the Hammers on goal
difference. Both teams will be playing for a win to break the
deadlock.
	   Wright had hit a barren patch in front of goal for West Ham
recently, although the former England striker is expected to
produce the goods when he pairs with John Hartson in the front line
on Saturday.
	   Arsenal and West Ham will return to the field Monday to play
Charlton and Coventry respectively.
	   Liverpool will be pinning a return to the winners' circle on the
return of Steve McManaman against Middlesbrough on Saturday.
	   Reds boss Gerard Houllier this week rated McManaman among the
top 10 players in Europe and included the 26-year-old winger in his
squad for the Middlesbrough match.
	   McMananam has been out for six weeks with an achilles injury and
the Merseysiders have lost six of nine games without him.
	   ``He has a sparkling creativeness and I have always said that he
has a different touch to his game,'' Houllier said. ``Just look at
the results we have had when he has not been playing. It speaks for
itself.''
	   A win over Middlesbrough would restore some confidence in the
Liverpool camp before its backs-up two days later to play
Newcastle, currently one point behind them in 10th place in the
standings.
	   Despite a 3-2 win over Manchester United which elevated
Middlesbrough into No. 4 in the standings and the return of Paul
Gascoigne, Boro manager Bryan Robson is still insisting his team is
not yet safe from relegation.
	   ``We're still building at the club and we've still got a long
way to go to get up there with the likes of the Arsenals and Man
Uniteds, but we feel that we're going the right way,'' he said.
	   Boro is unbeaten in its last 11 Premier League matches and is
unbeaten at home in 15 months.
	   Robson said the inclusion of Gascoigne for the matches against
Liverpool and Derby was a boost but said the team had managed
without him.
	   ``It's smashing that the lads got on with the job at Man United
and got a great result like that without Gazza,'' he said. ``That
shows that the whole squad is doing well.''
	   In other Premier League matches on Boxing Day, Chelsea should
extend its charge up the standings with a win over Southampton,
while Coventry hosts Tottenham, Everton is at home to Derby,
Newcastle take on Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday host Leicester and
Wimbledon play Charlton.
	   Manchester United is expected to atone for its loss to Boro with
a win over last-placed Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford.
	   Forest is playing to avoid equalling the humiliating record of
16 consecutive league matches without a win _ a record set by
Forest two years ago.
	   Current captain Steve Chettle, a member of the team which set
the original mark, said his team faced an uphill battle to avoid
the record after squandering a 2-0 lead over Blackburn on Saturday
and settling for a draw.
	   ``It was a terrible feeling last time when we broke the existing
record and it's not something I want to experience again.''
	   In division one matches on Boxing Day, league leaders Sunderland
travel to Tranmere, Ipswich take on struggling Portsmouth, Bolton
and Bradford meet in the clash of the round, Birmingham play
Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers are at home to Norwich.
	   In the Scottish Premier League matches Saturday, league leaders
Rangers play St. Johnstone and Kilmarnock host Hearts.
	   On Sunday, Dundee take on Celtic.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday
freed Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest,
a move immediately branded by Israel as ``acquiescing'' to the
radical Islamic group.
	   The ailing sheik's release adds a volatile new element to angry
debate that has flared in recent weeks over the 2-month-old Wye
River peace accord.
	   Israel has already suspended its compliance with the
U.S.-brokered land-for-security pact, and Arafat's decision to end
Yassin's unpopular detention could signal growing unwillingness on
the Palestinian leader's part to run political risks for the sake
of the faltering agreement.
	   In the slums of Gaza City, the charismatic Islamic cleric's

	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said releasing the

tried to blow up a school bus full of Jewish settler children in
the Gaza Strip _ amounted to a show of bad faith.
	   Citing what he called the Palestinians' ``revolving-door
policy'' on jailed militants, Fogel said Arafat's government has
``conducted a high-profile policy of ostensibly taking actions
against Hamas ... but in reality, quietly acquiescing to Hamas
activities.''
	   Palestinian officials, furious over Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's failure to carry out a promised troop withdrawal in the
West Bank earlier this month, have been saying for days that Israel
is in no position to lecture them about the accord's provisions
while it refuses to comply with them.
	   Well aware of how sensitive a subject Yassin's release was,
Arafat's government made no statement about it. The release was
carried out quietly; Palestinian police simply appeared at Yassin's
door to inform him he could leave the house.
	   Although Palestinian leaders resent Israeli criticism over
freeing Yassin _ after all, Israel itself let him out of prison 16
months ago, as part of a deal to ransom Israeli agents who botched
a bid to assassinate another Hamas leader _ the sheik's release is
far from good news for Arafat himself.
	   Yassin's presence in Gaza serves as a constant reminder of the
threat that unforgivingly fundamentalist groups like Hamas pose to
Arafat's far more secular, freewheeling leadership circle. If there
is to be a Palestinian state, Hamas wants it to be an Islamic
republic.
	   Hamas, which opposes any peace with Israel, has proved over and
over again its ability to derail peace talks by setting off suicide
bombs. By freeing Yassin, Arafat leaves himself open to familiar
Israeli accusations that he has failed to contain Islamic militants
_ particularly if Hamas stages some new attack.
	   It has only been nine days since Arafat stood in triumph with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza, basking in Palestinian
euphoria over the boost to statehood hopes that the presidential
visit conferred.
	   But last week's U.S. airstrikes against Iraq put a damper on
Palestinian goodwill toward America and the peace process. Faced
with angry protests, Arafat may have seen the release of Yassin as
something of a safety valve.
	   Acting against Yassin has always been politically difficult for
Arafat because of the sheik's street following, especially in Gaza.
And it could prove personally dangerous as well.
	   During Yassin's house arrest, in a leaflet signed by its
military wing Izzedine al Qassam, Hamas demanded Yassin's release
and made a rare direct threat against the Palestinian leader if the
sheik were not freed.
	   Despite that, Hamas appeared to be trying to smooth over the
entire episode, avoiding at least the appearance of anger at
Arafat. Hamas leader Ismail Abu Shanab said Yassin's release would
``reinforce the solidarity of the Palestinian people.''
	   The sheik himself appeared content _ for the moment _ to declare
victory, calling his release a sign of the peace process' failure.
	   ``At the time that Wye was signed, the intent was to prove that
no voice was louder that that of Wye,'' Yassin told reporters.
``Today, after the sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is
inevitable that other voices will be heard.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   The regime offered no explanation for the decision to ban the
flight, which would have been the first since U.S. and British
airstrikes on government and military targets to punish Iraq for
blocking U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The arms monitors are responsible for eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. Iraq has
said it will not let them inspectors return.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of bombardment. The 93 aid workers, who were withdrawn after the
airstrikes, returned Tuesday night to Iraq.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners are still on alert, and U.N.
officials said the flight may have been canceled to avoid any
danger. A U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
he hoped the measure was temporary.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq ordered
cancellation of the flight because ``they were worried that there
could be an accident.''
	   The Iraqis cited their report that U.S. and British warplanes
violated Iraqi airspace Tuesday and fired two ``stray missiles'' in
the direction of the southern city of Basra. The Pentagon and
Britain's Ministry of Defense denied the report.
	   ``I would hope that this is a temporary situation,'' Annan said.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had planned to fly out of
Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by road to Amman.

Nilsson prepares for Swedish comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Coventry's veteran defender Roland
Nilsson is slowly winding down his Premier League career, but the
34-year-old Swede is not yet ready to retire.
	   On Wednesday, Nilsson announced that he plans a comeback next
May with his former Swedish club, reigning Swedish cup winners'
Helsingborgs IF.
	   ``The kids are so big that it is time to move home now,''
Nilsson told the Swedish news agency TT.
	   In March, Nilsson hopes to get his 100th cap for Sweden. But if
he doesn't suffer serious injury and is in good shape he doesn't
plan to retire until after Sweden's Euro 2000 campaign.
	   After his active career, Nilsson has been offered a position
with Helsingborgs' management.
	   ``It's a new challenge, and a different aspect of something I've
been involved with all my life,'' Nilsson said.
	   Nilsson has also played for Sheffield Wednesday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday
freed Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest,
a move immediately branded by Israel as ``acquiescing'' to the
radical Islamic group.
	   The ailing sheik's release adds a volatile new element to angry
debate that has flared in recent weeks over the two-month-old Wye
River peace accord.
	   Israel has already suspended its compliance with the
U.S.-brokered land-for-security pact, and Arafat's decision to end
Yassin's unpopular detention could signal growing unwillingness on
the Palestinian leader's part to run political risks for the sake
of the faltering agreement.
	   In the slums of Gaza City, the charismatic Islamic cleric's
release set off rejoicing among his disciples. Outside the simple
concrete home where Yassin had been confined since Oct. 29, a knot
of neighbors gathered around his wheelchair, showering him with
kisses and offering respectful greetings.
	   For Israel and the Palestinians, the freeing of Yassin is cause
for yet another outbreak of mutual mistrust.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said releasing the
sheik _ who had been placed under house arrest hours after Hamas
tried to blow up a school bus full of Jewish settler children in
the Gaza Strip _ amounted to a show of bad faith.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's lawmakers on Wednesday selected
the country's most influential politician as Parliament speaker two
days after he had resigned to work full time for the ruling party.
	   Members in the 400-seat National Assembly unanimously supported
Muslim cleric Hassan Turabi in a voice vote amid shouts of ``Allahu
Akbar'' or ``God is great.'' Turabi did not attend the session.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported late Wednesday that
Turabi later visited the Parliament and told the legislators he
would accept the post. He can hold it until the end of the
Parliament's term in April 2000.
	   Turabi had submitted his resignation on Monday, saying he wanted
to devote all his time to the ruling National Congress Party as
Sudan moves toward a multi-party system starting Jan. 1.
	   The formal submission followed weeks of rumors _ and then
confirmed reports _ that he planned to leave the position.
	   Turabi's re-nomination took place without any hitch.
	   Deputy Speaker Alison Manani Magaya opened the session by asking
for nominations to fill the speaker's post. Another deputy speaker,
Abdul-Aziz Shidou, proposed Turabi's name. No other name was
proposed and the proceedings were called to an end.
	   Magaya then told the legislators: ``Dr. Turabi could resume his
post anytime he wants.''
	   On Tuesday, Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha had
called on legislators to respect Turabi's wish to resign. Taha said
his statement was endorsed by President Omar el-Bashir.
	   A new law recently passed by el-Bashir's government will
legalize political groupings starting Jan. 1. They will be allowed
to contest elections.
	   El-Bashir had banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup. He said recently that the door was open
for opposition politicians in exile to come back and form political
associations.
	   But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of
Parliament has cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the opposition to Turabi's
re-nomination.
	   There also was apprehension that the new law speaks only of
``political associations.'' Turabi had strongly opposed the demand
by some Parliament members for a clear-cut reference to ``political
parties.''

Study: AIDS care costs less than thought, researchers say

	   Care for AIDS patients in the United States is less expensive
than generally believed _ about dlrs 20,000 per person per year,
according to a new study.
	   The study estimated a total cost of dlrs 6.7 billion annually,
or less than 1 percent of all U.S. medical expenditures on
patients.
	   ``Compared to what we spend on all kinds of other things, it's
just not that much money'' for the government to spend, said
project co-director Dr. Samuel A. Bozzette, a health care
researcher at RAND, the Santa Monica, California, think tank
overseeing the government-sponsored research.
	   The dlrs 20,000 tab is roughly one-third of the estimates from
the early 1990s, when firm figures were hard to come by, and before
the advent of AIDS drug cocktails that have proven powerfully
effective in fending off the disease and keeping patients out of
the hospital.
	   The study was conducted in 1996, just as the combination therapy
was coming into widespread use. It found 55 percent of people being
treated for HIV were taking one of the newer AIDS drugs by December
1996. Doctors believe use of the new drugs has since risen sharply.
	   The study estimated that only half of all American adults
infected with the AIDS virus saw their doctor at least once every
six months. Many of those not getting care were unaware they were
infected.
	   However, an encouraging 85 percent of those with full-blown AIDS
were getting regular care, with most of them seeing AIDS
specialists.
	   Early treatment can slow the disease, extend lifespan and save
money by reducing hospitalizations.
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. It was based on interviews of 3,072 people treated in
hospitals or doctors' offices in dozens of urban and rural areas
around the country.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government forces and UNITA rebels
continued fighting Wednesday in the central highlands further
undermining a 1994 peace pact, while reports indicated that the
army had taken control of two rebel-held towns.
	   In Huambo province, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast
of the capital Luanda, ``battles rage all over the place,''
according to an aid worker, who asked not to be identified.
	   ``The government has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of
Caala,'' the aid worker said, referring to two towns approximately
40 kilometers (25 miles) from Huambo city.
	   The resumption of fighting this month has sent more than 50,000
displaced people flooding into Huambo, about half of the existing
population.
	   Stores in the city were empty because the harvest had been
destroyed by the fighting and the roads leading into the city were
unpassable, the aid worker said in Luanda, adding that the airport
was under military control but closed to commercial flights.
	   The United Nations' World Food Program is planning to fly about
300 tons of food supplies into Huambo over the next two weeks.
	   Another aid worker, speaking from Huambo on condition of
anonymity, said Namibian troops were flewn into Huambo two days
ago.
	   The government had denied rebel claims that Zimbabwe and Namibia
have sent troops to support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Meanwhile, UNITA rebels continued their two-week-long siege of
the city of Kuito, capital of neighboring Bie province some 130
kilometers (80 miles). An International Red Cross statement said
there were 160 wounded, some in serious condition.
	   The center of Kuito _ which was hit Tuesday by rebel artillery
shells _ was quiet Wednesday, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bie told
state radio, RNA.
	   The United Nations brokered a 1994 peace agreement between the
government and UNITA, but festering friction led to renewed clashes
in the diamond- and oil-rich country.
	   In a statement released Wednesday in Luanda, the government
condemned the U.N. for its ``passivity and complicity'' in face of
UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994 accord.
	   The statement said instead of disbanding its rebel forces as it
agreed in the 1994 pact, UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ has built up a 40,000-strong army equipped
with ``armored vehicles, long-range artillery and great fire
power.''
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, said Wednesday he
understood the government's disappointment that the accord had not
been fully implemented but that negotiation was still the key to
peace.
	   ``We must think the solution to Angola's problem is compromise,
peace, and dialogue,'' he said in an interview broadcast on state
radio.
	   ``It's the most expensive way, but one we must insist on,'' he
added.
	   The U.N. spent dlrs 1.3 billion on implementing the 1994 accord
and at one time had 7,000 international peacekeepers stationed in
the vast nation.
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
following the vast southwest African country's independence from
Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first elections
and returned to war.

Britain's GEC announces two joint ventures with European companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes and more detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British engineering group General Electric Co. PLC
announced twin deals Wednesday with other European businesses to
create joint ventures in the missile and satellite industries.
	   The deals mark the latest step in the long-running consolidation
of the European defense and aerospace industries, aimed at creating
European giants to rival the top defense groups in the United
States.
	   In the defense field, GEC announced a 50-50 joint venture with
Italian defense engineering group Finmeccanica combining their
ground, naval, missile system and air traffic control activities.
	   The new company, to be called Alenia Marconi Systems, will have
turnover of about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) a year, they
said.
	   In the space sector, GEC has joined with France's Lagadere,
Germany's Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace (Dasa) and again with Italy's
Finmeccanica to merge satellite activities.
	   That venture will have turnover of about 1.8 billion pounds
(dlrs 2.9 billion) a year and will be subject to approval by
authorities in each of the countries involved as well as from the
European Union.
	   The name of the new space company was not immediately available.
	   GEC is already part-owner of Matra Marconi Space, a joint
venture with Lagardere.
	   Under the latest deal, Matra Marconi Space will merge its
activities with the space industry business of Dasa and
Finmeccanica's space division Alenia Spazio.
	   ``The new company, with an unrivaled scientific potential in
Europe will play a key leadership role in the conquest of the solar
system and the associated programs,'' Phillipe Camus, chief
executive of Matra Hautes Technologies, and Peter Gershon, chief
executive of Marconi Electronic Systems, said in a joint statement.
	   A spokesman for GEC said the new space group would have a
``comprehensive capability'' in making satellites for observation
and telecommunications.
	   The group's main competition will be the U.S. aerospace group
Lockheed Martin.
	   The agreement comes a day after GEC said it would split its
civil operations from its defense activities to prepare for
European consolidation in defense and aerospace.
	   The company, which is not related to General Electric in the

Russia's Communist boss endorses allies' anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist leader, effectively endorsing
the anti-Semitic rhetoric of his allies, accused Jews on Wednesday
of bringing on the ``extinction'' of Russia's people and the
country's economic woes, according to a news agency report.
	   Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov _ a prominent politician
who finished second in the 1996 presidential election _ also
suggested that Russia's Jewish community condemn Zionism, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Zionism, a movement supporting the Jewish state of Israel, is
often used by Russian anti-Semites to refer to a perceived Jewish
conspiracy against other ethnic and religious groups.
	   ``Our people are not blind. They cannot fail to see that the
spread of Zionism in the state government in Russia is one of the
reasons for the current catastrophic condition of the country, the
mass impoverishment and the process of extinction of its people,''
Zyuganov said in what Interfax described as an open letter.
	   The letter to President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff and
national security chief Nikolai Bordyuzha and Justice Minister
Pavel Krasheninnikov was Zyuganov's most blatant public expression
of anti-Semitism. No one was available in either of the addressees'
offices or the Communist Party on Wednesday evening to comment on
the letter or to provide a copy.
	   In the past, Zyuganov has mostly confined himself to tacit
support for his overtly anti-Semitic allies.
	   Zyuganov's letter came in response to demands by Russian
liberals and international Jewish organizations that the Communist
Party, the largest party in Russia, censure virulent anti-Semitic
remarks by two of its members.
	   Under Zyuganov, the party has taken on an increasingly
aggressive, nationalistic tone. Anti-Semitic rhetoric has grown
with the nation's economic troubles _ the traditional spark for
scapegoating.
	   Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have
called for banning the party, saying it had evolved into a fascist
grouping.
	   In his letter, Zyuganov outlined the ``aggressive, destructive
role of Zionist capital in the collapse of Russia's economy and the
pilfering of its national wealth,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The root of all our evils is the criminal policy of the
anti-national, non-national oligarchy,'' Zyuganov wrote.
	   At the same time, Zyuganov insisted that he condemned
anti-Semitism and was only calling for fighting an alleged Jewish
conspiracy for world domination.
	   The Soviet Communist Party had also said it was against
anti-Semitism _ at the same time suppressing Jewish culture and
imposing quotas on Jews in universities and high-paying or
government jobs.
	   Virulent anti-Semitic statements by Russia's Communists have
been reaching increasingly higher levels of the party in recent
months, culminating Wednesday with Zyuganov's letter.
	   In speeches this fall, Communist lawmaker Albert Makashov, a
retired general, blamed the country's problems on ``zhidy,'' or
``yids,'' a derogatory term for Jews.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution condemning him.
	   This month, prominent Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin accused
Jews of waging ``genocide'' on Russians. He also said that Russia's
post-Soviet collapse would not have occurred if Russia's government
was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of
Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but they have
always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians.
	   Russia has a history of discriminating against Jews, dating to
czarist times. The discrimination, based more on ethnicity than
religion, prompted waves of Russian Jews to emigrate.
	   Since the Soviet-era restrictions were lifted, grassroots
anti-Semitism has remained widespread. It has been spilling out
since Russia plunged into its latest economic troubles.

U.S. Justice Department launches formal investigation into Salt
</HEADLINE>
Lake bid &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI on
Wednesday formally opened an investigation into alleged
improprieties in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002
Winter Olympics.
	   A Justice Department prosecutor met in Salt Lake City on
Wednesday with FBI and other law enforcement officials looking at
accusations that members of the Utah bid committee used
scholarships and other gifts and favors to buy the votes of
International Olympic Committee members.
	   ``We've opened an investigation into allegations of
improprieties in connection with the Salt Lake City Olympics bid,''
department spokesman Myron Marlin said in Washington.
	   Marlin would not elaborate on the possible charges or focus of
the investigation.
	   Until now, the department said only that it was conducting a
preliminary review. But after Wednesday's meeting, law enforcement
officials decided they had enough information to broaden the
investigation, law enforcement sources said on the condition of
anonymity.
	   The formal investigation starts immediately. The Justice
Department refused to comment on the scope or duration of the
investigation.
	   In its Wednesday editions, national daily USA Today said the
preliminary review had focused on possible extortion and tax and
wire fraud.
	   Should investigators attempt to bring a tax fraud case,
according to USA Today, they would be required to show that Salt
Lake organizers misused tax-exempt funds by buying the lavish gifts
or by financing scholarships for relatives of IOC members.
	   The federal probe is the fourth inquiry into the Salt Lake
allegations, and only one of them is expected to be finished by the
time the IOC meets to discuss another major issue _ doping.
	   While the IOC expects to wrap up its own bribery probe by Jan.
23, at least two of the other inquiries won't finish until after a
worldwide doping summit set for Feb. 2-4.
	   On Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic Committee appointed a five-member
panel headed by former U.S. Senate leader and Northern Ireland
peace negotiator George Mitchell.
	   Mitchell, who also was considered for a seat on the U.S. Supreme
Court, said the panel would hold its first meeting next week and
finish work by the end of February.
	   ``We have to be thorough, but at the same time we have to do
this promptly,'' Mitchell said.
	   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee, meanwhile, said an
investigation by its ethics board would report its findings at a
Feb. 11 meeting.
	   ``All we need to do is determine what happened, at whose hand,
and why,'' said Gordon Hall, a former Utah Supreme Court justice
who heads the SLOC probe. ``I don't envision that it will take a
long time to do that.''

First three-star chef to hit stock market aims for larger empire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAULIEU, France (AP) _ Talking more like a Wall Street master of
the universe than a cook, Bernard Loiseau says becoming the first
three-star chef to sell stock will further expand his empire.
	   ``I'm on full power, I'm the leader of my profession, in good
financial health, and I have development projects,'' the outspoken
cuisinier said Wednesday, five days before his stock goes on sale.
	   The 322,500 shares, at a price of 49 francs (dlrs 8.75) each,
will hit the Secondary Market of the French Bourse on Monday. At
that price, that would amount to 15.8 million francs (dlrs 2.8
million).
	   ``The stock market isn't garbage. For a company to enter the
market means cutting debt, allowing self-financing and
investment,'' Loiseau said at his three-star Cote d'Or restaurant
in Saulieu, a Bourgogne city of eastern France.
	   ``I have 20 years before me. I want to make this little company
move,'' said Loiseau, who has managed to marry cuisine with
showmanship and marketing to hang on to Cote d'Or's three Michelin
Guide stars since 1991.
	   Loiseau wants to expand his current empire that also includes
Tante Louise in Paris, catering, consulting and a retail shop.
	   ``My greatest strength is that I have been able to diversify my
activities in the restaurant business between ``high fashion'' and
``ready-to-wear,'' he said.
	   ``When I was 15 years old I always said I would be the best cook
in France. Now I want to ensure the long-term life of my
companies.''
	   Could that mean less time in the kitchen?

Russian prime minister says country will pay all debts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with lawmakers planning to
postpone budget discussions, other details. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hopes for getting a desperately needed
budget soon dimmed Wednesday, as various parliamentary factions
warned they would demand that debates on the draft 1999 budget,
scheduled for Thursday, be postponed.
	   An austere, realistic budget is crucial for resolving the
economic crisis. A sound budget is also a key condition for getting
new international loans that Russia desperately needs.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, is scheduled to
begin discussing the draft budget Thursday.
	   But on Wednesday, the two largest factions in parliament _ one
Communist and one reformist, Our Home is Russia _ announced they
would ask for a postponement of the hearings at least until next
Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The decisions, which came only one day after factions across the
political spectrum expressed support for the draft budget, were
prompted by a message from the upper house of parliament, which
criticized the draft.
	   While the passage of past years' budgets has been stalled for
months by rancorous debates in the hardliner-dominated Duma, the
upper house, called the Federation Council, has usually passed the
budgets without much delay.
	   However, the draft 1999 budget includes the government's plans
to change the way tax revenues are distributed between the regions
and the federal government. Regional governors, who make up the
Federation Council, object to the plan.
	   Russia is gripped by its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Foreign lenders froze aid to the country after the
government defaulted on some debts and devalued the currency in
August.
	   Inflation has soared since the start of the crisis, reducing the
wages of millions of Russians to nearly negligible levels. About
one in three Russians are now living below the poverty line,
according to official figures.
	   Even those wages routinely go unpaid for months.
	   Russia's trade union chief Mikhail Shmakov warned Wednesday of
major protests next year if the government doesn't pay off overdue
wages and raise current ones, Interfax reported.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko said that in 1999,
the government plans to raise state workers' wages 50 percent to
try to compensate for inflation _ which is already running at 70
percent this year.
	   ``This is much less than the population needs, but it is the
maximum we can afford,'' Matviyenko said, according to Interfax.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov also said the government plans
to repay wage and pension arrears by the end of this year, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The government has warned it would resort to paying money to pay
off the wages and other expenses, unless it gets foreign aid. The
move is likely to spur further inflation.
	   But the government has only printed 16 billion rubles (dlrs 780
million) so far since October _ much less than the 25 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) it had planned to print in the fourth
quarter of the year, Zadornov said.
	   Russia signed a long-awaited agreement with the United States on
Wednesday for a dlrs 625 million food aid package, aimed at staving
off hunger by Russia's poor.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a visit
to Kazakstan, said Wednesday that his country will repay all its
debts, but would need to restructure them because of the economic
crisis.
	   Russia faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall due
next year, but the government has earmarked only dlrs 9.5 billion
for foreign debt servicing and wants to reschedule the remainder
with creditors.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek and Turkish Cypriots _ and their
allies in Greece and Turkey _ were divided Wednesday on U.N.
Security Council resolutions calling for moves to reunite the
island.
	   The Greek Cypriot government welcomed the resolutions, saying
they suggested a new impetus toward its call for disarmament and
negotiations on the divided island.
	   In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos also
greeted the resolutions as showing that the world body realized
``the dangers contained in a prolongation of the problem.''
	   But Turkey and Turkish Cypriots were critical, saying the
Security Council failed to consider Turkish Cypriot views or
recognize the existence of the breakaway Turkish state on the
island.
	   A statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said suggestions
in the resolutions were ``not based on agreements that should have
been reached between the sides concerned.''
	   The statement said the United Nations failed to consider a
proposal by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for a
confederation between the islands' governments.
	   A statement with similar wording was issued by Denktash.
	   In a session late Tuesday, the council renewed the mandate of
the 2,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force which patrols a buffer
zone between the Greek Cypriot community in the south and the
Turkish Cypriots in the north.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The council called the status quo ``unacceptable'' and said
``negotiations on a final political solution of the Cyprus problem
have been at an impasse for too long.''
	   It demanded compliance with U.N. resolutions that call for a
reduction of troops and weapons and the island's reunification.
	   Briefing reporters Wednesday, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister
Yiannakis Cassoulides said: ``This is the first time in many years
that the Security Council demands compliance with its previous
resolutions on Cyprus, particularly with regard to refraining from
the threat or the use of force, and on the reduction of troops and
armaments.
	   ``This gives emphasis to what is important for us,'' he added.
	   Cassoulides also welcomed a statement by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday in which he promised ``all necessary steps to
support a sustained effort'' to implement the council's
resolutions.
	   In Athens, Pangalos praised Clinton's comments, but he added
that the United States should ``ask Turkey to immediately withdraw
the American weapons systems'' in northern Cyprus.
	   Tension has been rising recently following Turkish threats to
prevent the planned deployment by the Greek Cypriots of Russian
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Greece said it will support Cyprus if
it is attacked in line with their joint defense agreement.
	   The resolutions did not mention the missiles, but the council
expressed ``its grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of
military force and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate
at which they are being expanded.''

NATO officials voice concern over worsening situation in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report by U.S. physicians' group alleging
systematic abuse by Serbs against Kosovo Albanian doctors and
patients &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concerned with the
fast-deteriorating situation in Kosovo, two top NATO officials
warned both sides in the conflict Wednesday against launching more
attacks.
	   NATO's top commander for Europe, American Gen. Wesley Clark,
complained of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police
activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said the
alliance is watching closely to ensure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed at
halting bloodshed in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Echoing the security concerns, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings
in recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The officials' comments came as reports said one man was killed
and three others wounded in the latest two shootouts in Kosovo _ in
the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica and in a suburb of the
capital Pristina late Tuesday.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said an unidentified gunman burst into
an Albanian-owned bar in Kosovska Mitrovica wounded two ethnic
Albanians, one of whom died Wednesday. The survivor is known for
his loyalty to Serbian authorities.
	   Police sealed off the district where the bar is located and were
pursuing the perpetrator, the report said.
	   Two Serbian police officers were also reported wounded when
``terrorists'' opened fire with machine-guns in a Pristina suburb,
the Serb center said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the
all-out war that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and
Serb security forces from February to October. During that time
some 1,000 people lost their lives and another 300,000 lost their
homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities were not in
conformance with Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He
reiterated that Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade
have been told they ``must comply with their promises made to
NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case the unarmed international verifiers in Kosovo are
threatened.
	   International officials also have criticized Kosovo Albanian
rebels for endangering the cease-fire by carrying out provocative
missions.
	   Solana warned both sides ``not to try to use the Christmas and
New Year period to launch attacks or to conduct operations which
would undermine the fragile security situation in Kosovo and
further jeopardize the prospects for a peaceful solution.''
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''
	   In a separate development, the U.S.-based Physicians for Human
Rights sent a letter to Milosevic objecting to what it called
``systematic and pervasive abuses'' by Serbs against Kosovo
Albanian physicians, other health workers and patients, continuing
since the October cease-fire.
	   The group released preliminary findings of a two-month study
documenting what it said was a pattern of Serbian intimidation of
Albanian doctors, ``marked by instances of murder, torture,
detention, imprisonment and forced disappearances.''
	   Kosovo Albanian medical facilities have been searched, property
confiscated and many clinics and health centers burned to the
ground, and patients have been beaten, the report said.
	   ``Attacks on health facilities, doctors and their patients are
war crimes,'' said Dr. Jennifer Leaning, one of the lead
researchers and a member of the group's board of directors. She
said the campaign by Serbian police and health professionals
``disregards norms of medical neutrality that are protected under
international human rights and humanitarian law.''
	   There was no immediate response from Serbian authorities.

Russian bill to ease production-sharing investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to attract foreign investors despite
Russia's economic crisis, the lower house of parliament on
Wednesday approved a bill that would give more concessions to
investors in natural-resource production.
	   The bill would make equipment purchases for production-sharing
projects exempt from import duties and the value-added tax, and
would also allow such projects to pay taxes in crude oil instead of
cash.
	   ``The mere fact that this bill was passed signifies a great
victory of reason,'' said Alexei Mikhailov, chairman of the State
Duma's Committee on Natural Resources.
	   The bill _ actually a package of amendments to
production-sharing legislation _ still needs to be approved by the
upper house of parliament and be signed by President Boris Yeltsin
to become law.
	   Earlier this month, the Duma finally passed another
production-sharing bill, which raises the limit on foreigners'
access to Russian natural resources from 10 percent to 30 percent
of overall production, and allows smaller projects to go ahead
without express parliamentary approval.
	   However, development of Russia's production-sharing potential is
still hobbled by the lack of a comprehensive list of projects that
qualify for the status, Mikhailov said Wednesday.
	   Only two production-sharing agreements with foreign investors _
oil projects Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 _ have been implemented in
Russia since its law on production-sharing agreements went into
effect at the beginning of 1996.
	   A list of projects that could be granted that status is being
finalized by parliament, and is expected to be up for a vote early
next year, a Duma official said.

Study of British aristocracy finds link between fertility, life

<TEXT>
	   Mothers who give birth to their first child later in life tend
to live longer than those who start large broods early on.
	   That's the conclusion of researchers who reviewed the British
aristocracy's 1,200 years of genealogical records. They found that
long-lived married women tended to have later first births and
fewer children than other women.
	   This is the latest study in the past decade to back up what
researchers have long suspected _ that fertility and longevity are
linked. The reasons for the link are not so apparent.
	   Some researchers say that giving birth and raising a family
simply take a physical toll on the body that shortens a woman's
lifespan. But the authors of the latest study say that deliberately
delaying motherhood will not necessarily make a woman live longer.
	   Instead, they argue that there is a genetic tradeoff between
fertility and longevity in women: Those who are programmed to live
long lives are less fertile.
	   ``If you have to invest such an enormous amount of energy into
maintaining the body for a long life, there must be a cost. And the
theory says there's a cost in fertility,'' said researcher Rudi
G.J. Westendorp of Leiden University Medical Centre in Leiden, the
Netherlands.
	   Similarly, fruit fly studies conducted in the early '90s found
that insects bred for a long life were less fertile.
	   The new study was published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature. Westendorp and Thomas B. L. Kirkwood of the University of
Manchester in England studied the computerized records for 13,667
married female aristocrats born in Britain between the years 740
and 1875.
	   Women who died between age 50 and 80 had an average of 2.4 to
2.6 children each, while those who lived into their 80s averaged
2.1 children and those who reached their 90s averaged 1.8
offspring.
	   Westendorp also found a link between lifespan and a woman's age
when she gave birth to her first child.
	   Those who died between age 50 and 80 had their first child on
average at age 24.3. But women who lived into their 80s gave birth
to their first child about age 25.1, and those living into their
90s had their first child at an average age of about 27.
	   The study only briefly touched on married women without
children. It said almost half the women who lived past 81 had no
children and fewer than one-third who died before that age were
childless.
	   Dr. Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at the Beth Israel-Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston, said differences in the number of
children were not that significant to support a big link between
longevity and reproduction.
	   But Perls said his own research last year suggests women who
give birth for the first time in their 40s have an increased chance
of living to 100. He suggested their biological clocks are ticking
slowly _ their fertility peaks later in life, and they age more
slowly.
	   Other researchers said Westendorp's findings hint that there may
be an optimal number of childbirths beyond which women pay a
physical toll.
	   ``It suggests that if you have a lot of kids at a young age
there's a drain on your resources and your life span is not as
long,'' said Caleb Finch, a professor of gerontology at the
University of Southern California.
	   Whatever the numbers show, they may only reflect the story of
the British aristocracy long ago _ a time of drafty manors, poor
diet and primitive medicine, said Richard Suzman, associate
director for behavioral and social research at the National
Institute on Aging.

Bus crashes into fuel truck in Turkey, killing at least 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAMSUN, Turkey (AP) _ A bus collided with a fuel truck on a
highway near the Black Sea port city of Samsun on Wednesday,
burning at least 11 people to death, news reports said.
	   At least 10 other people were injured in the fiery crash, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The two vehicles were still ablaze hours after the accident,
raising fears the casualty count would go higher.
	   The bus was en route to Samsun from the capital, Ankara, 420
kilometers (250 miles) to the southwest. The area is not a major
tourist destination.
	   Anatolia said the crash was caused by faulty passing and a
slippery road. It was not clear which of the two vehicles was at
fault.

Israel upsets Yugoslavia 2-0 in friendly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) _ Eidan Tal and Yossi Abuksis scored
second-half goals and Israel shocked European power Yugoslavia 2-0
in an international friendly on Wednesday.
	   Yugoslavia was without seven regulars and Israeli coach Shlomo
Sherf used the opportunity to experiment with several youngsters.
	   The Israelis overcame a scare when Darko Kovacevic had an
apparent goal disallowed by a controversial offside call in the
38th minute and finally took the lead when Tal, one of the
youngster, scored off Najwan Ghrayib's cross in the 57th minute.
	   Kovacevic was ejected for elbowing defender Amir Shelah midway
through the final half and Israel capitalized.
	   The hosts secured their victory in the 82nd minute when Haim
Revivo lifted the ball over the onrushing Yugoslavian defense to
Abuksis, who calmly chipped the ball over Yugoslavian keeper Ivica
Kralj.
	   After a first half in which neither team settled into a cohesive
pattern, the Israelis gradually took control following Kovacevic's
dismissal.
	   ``I'm satisfied with how we played,'' Sherf said. ``Games like
this build a team's character.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British engineering group General Electric Co. PLC
announced twin deals Wednesday with other European businesses to
create joint ventures in the missile and satellite industries.
	   The deals mark the latest step in the long-running consolidation
of the European defense and aerospace industries, aimed at creating
European giants to rival the top defense groups in the United
States.
	   In the defense field, GEC announced a 50-50 joint venture with
Italian defense engineering group Finmeccanica combining their
ground, naval, missile system and air traffic control activities.
	   The new company is to be called Alenia Marconi Systems. It will
have turnover of about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) a year,
they said, and will be the major supplier of missile systems
outside the United States.
	   In the space sector, the two have joined with France's Lagadere
and Germany's Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace (Dasa) to merge satellite
activities to form what they say will be Europe's top space
venture.
	   That will have turnover of about 1.8 billion euros (dlrs 2.9
billion) a year and will be subject to approval by authorities in
each of the countries involved as well as from the European Union.

Russia acknowledges problems in relations with Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov acknowledged
Wednesday that serious problems were hampering Russia's relations
with the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   After meeting in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Azeri
Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfagarov said his government was concerned
by Russia's military and technical ties with Armenia, Azerbaijan's
neighbor and rival, and by Russian-Azeri differences over how
Caspian Sea oil should be transported, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Azerbaijan favors a route through Turkey, while Russia is
pressing for a route through its own territory. The U.S. government
has been lobbying for the Turkish route, which it considers a way
of developing east-west oil and gas transportation corridors in
Central Asia, avoiding Russia and Iran.
	   Ivanov said that Russian-Armenian cooperation is based on
international law and ``is not aimed against Azerbaijan,'' Interfax
reported.
	   Ivanov pledged that Russia would do everything possible to
resolve the problems in bilateral relations, Interfax said.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Veteran Coventry defender Roland
Nilsson said Wednesday he will return to Sweden when the English
Premier League season and transfer to his former club, reigning
Swedish Cup champion Helsingborgs IF.
	   ``The kids are so big that it is time to move home now,''
Nilsson told the Swedish news agency TT.
	   In March, Nilsson hopes to earn his 100th cap for Sweden. But if
he doesn't suffer serious injury and is in good shape he doesn't
plan to retire until after Sweden's 2000 European Championship
campaign.
	   After his playing career, Nilsson has been offered a position
with Helsingborgs' management.
	   ``It's a new challenge, and a different aspect of something I've
been involved with all my life,'' Nilsson said.
	   Nilsson also has played for Sheffield Wednesday.

Opposite conclusions by studies on treating ulcer patients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Could it be that some cases of chronic indigestion are caused by
bacteria and not, say, stress and spicy food?
	   Two new studies came to opposite conclusions, leaving the
question unanswered.
	   Indigestion, which plagues 25 percent to 40 percent of people in
Western nations, is only partly understood. Its symptoms _ burning,
gas, nausea and pain _ can be caused by stress, stomach ulcers,
gallstones, inflammation of the esophagus and eating too much, too
fast or eating spicy or fatty foods. Treatment may include avoiding
stress and foods that trigger symptoms, taking antacids and
drinking milk.
	   Doctors have wondered whether Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria
that cause ulcers, might also play a role in the non-ulcer variety
of indigestion.
	   Antibiotics already are used to kill H. pylori in people with
ulcers. If H. pylori also causes indigestion, doctors could use the
same antibiotics to give sufferers relief.
	   Two large studies undertaken to determine whether H. pylori is
indeed a cause of indigestion were published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
	   Scottish researchers at the University of Glasgow studied 302
patients with indigestion but no ulcers and found that antibiotics
to fight H. pylori seemed to help.
	   Among the half treated for two weeks with two antibiotics and an
ulcer drug, the bacteria were eliminated in 85 percent and
indigestion cleared up in 21 percent a year later. In patients
given the ulcer drug but no antibiotics, the bacteria were absent
in 12 percent and indigestion resolved in only 7 percent after a
year.
	   However, a second, international study of 328 patients found no
clear benefit. Indigestion was resolved or greatly reduced in 21
percent of patients treated with an ulcer drug and dummy pills for
one week, and in 27 percent of those also given antibiotics. The
researchers said this difference was so small it could have been a
matter of chance.
	   Indigestion of the sort studied triggers 2 percent to 5 percent
of visits to family doctors in the United States, and costs more
than dlrs 1.3 billion annually for prescription drugs alone.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Lawrence S. Friedman of
Massachusetts General Hospital said that slight differences in the
patients' conditions between the two studies, how the severity of
indigestion was determined, and how patients were assessed after
treatment may help explain the opposite results.
	   Friedman said he expects breakthroughs in indigestion treatment
to come from the study of brain-gut interactions and sensitivity of
stomach tissue, not from learning more about H. pylori's role.

Corinthians beats Cruzeiro 2-0 for title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Corinthians gave Brazilian national
team manager Wanderley Luxemburgo a farewell gift Wendesday,
getting goals from Edilson and Marcelinho Carioca to be Cruzeiro
2-0 for the Brazilian national championship.
	   Luxemburgo, who stayed on as coach after being named Brazilian
manager in August, needed only a draw for Corinthians to win the
title, but scored twice in the final 25 minutes to take the crown
in style.
	   The teams had drawn twice in their two earlier meetings and
because Corinthians had a better record, another would have given
them the title in the three-game finale.
	   Both teams missed chances on free kicks in the fisst half, but
in the second Edilson easily dribbled past Cruzeiro keeper Dida to
tap the ball in with his right foot in the 65th minute.
	   Then in the 81st minute, it was Carioca's turn with a
spectacular header on a feed from Dinei.
	   Cruzeiro rallied back with a rapid fire series of near misses in
front of Corinthians keeper Nei, who managed to keep them at bay.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Corinthians: Nei, Indio, Batata (Cris), Gamarra, Silvinho,
Amaral, Vampeta, Rincon, Marcelinho Carioca, Edilson and Mirandinha

	   Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo (Alex Alves), Marcelo, Djian, W.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police have seen 244 of their number

about 3,000 Russian police officers who worked under the aegis of

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has drawn up emergency plans to evacuate
some remote northern areas if the heating or supply situation gets
worse, but officials said Wednesday they prefer to ship up
emergency supplies instead.
	   Many of Russia's far-flung regions have suffered fuel and
electricity shortages this winter, after being stranded when
Russia's financial crisis prevented supplies from getting
delivered.
	   Some small villages on the Chukotka peninsula, which juts out
toward Alaska, have been completely abandoned for larger towns in
the region. But the government does not expect the population to
retreat any further.
	   Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said the north of
Russia is far too vast to conduct a large evacuation, and the
situation is still manageable. The ministry will continue bringing
supplies instead of moving people out.
	   ``Look, more than 40 percent of Russia is in the north,'' he
said. ``Yes, the situation is sufficiently complicated, but far
from hopeless.''
	   Russia's far-flung regions were barely hanging on even before
the latest crisis. After the collapse of the Soviet Union they were
cut off from large government subsidies, and received just enough
supplies in the summers to scrape by.
	   Now the government is more broke than ever. It managed to send
supply caravans with fuel and spare parts to Chukotka, but only
after some towns were left without electricity because power
generators broke down and there were no tools to fix them.
	   A fuel tanker recently arrived on the Kamchatka peninsula, south
of Chukotka. Beforehand, residents had to get by for more than a
month with only a few hours of electricity each day.
	   ``There's not an emergency situation today,'' said Emergency
Situations Ministry spokeswoman Marina Ricklina. ``There is food,
there is water. What's bad is the heating. If there isn't heating
in one particular house, the residents go to a hotel.''
	   The United States and Russia signed a dlrs 625 million food aid
agreement in Moscow on Wednesday in hopes of staving off hunger
among Russia's needy. Much of the U.S. food aid is to be sold in
stores in isolated northern regions.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government forces and UNITA rebels battled
in Angola's highlands Wednesday, further straining a 1994 peace
deal meant to settle the southwest African country's two decade-old
civil war.
	   Angola's government seized two rebel-held towns in Hambo
province, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``The government has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of
Caala,'' the aid worker said, referring to two towns approximately
40 kilometers (25 miles) from Huambo city.
	   The resumption of fighting this month has sent more than 50,000
displaced people flooding into Huambo, about half of the existing
population.
	   Stores in the city were empty because the harvest had been
destroyed by the fighting and the roads leading into the city were
unpassable, the aid worker said in Luanda, adding that the airport
was under military control but closed to commercial flights.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is planning to fly about 300 tons of
food supplies into Huambo over the next two weeks.
	   Another aid worker, speaking from Huambo on condition of
anonymity, said Namibian troops were flew into Huambo two days ago
to back Angolan government forces. The government has denied rebel
claims that Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to support
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Meanwhile, UNITA rebels continued their two-week-long siege of
the city of Kuito, capital of neighboring Bie province some 130
kilometers (80 miles). An International Red Cross statement said
there were 160 wounded, some in serious condition.
	   The center of Kuito _ which was hit Tuesday by rebel artillery
shells _ was quiet Wednesday, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bie told
state radio, RNA.
	   The United Nations brokered a 1994 peace agreement between the
government and UNITA, but festering friction led to renewed clashes
in the diamond- and oil-rich country.
	   In a statement released Wednesday in Luanda, the government
condemned the United Nations for its ``passivity and complicity''
in face of UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994 accord.
	   The statement said instead of disbanding its rebel forces as it
agreed in the 1994 pact, UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ has built up a 40,000-strong army equipped
with ``armored vehicles, long-range artillery and great fire
power.''
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, said Wednesday he
understood the government's disappointment that the accord had not
been fully implemented, but insisted that negotiation was still the
key to peace.
	   ``We must think the solution to Angola's problem is compromise,
peace, and dialogue,'' he said in an interview broadcast on state
radio.
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
following the country's independence from Portugal. Mutual
accusations of military action have stymied the peace process.

Virgin Atlantic Airways to add route from London to Shanghai
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British-based Virgin Atlantic Airways will
introduce the first flights between London and Shanghai starting
next summer, the airline announced Wednesday.
	   The airline received news from the Civil Aviation Authority that
it will be running two flights a week to the southern Chinese city
just as its owner, British tycoon Richard Branson, was leaving
Chinese airspace after crossing the Chinese border into an
unauthorized zone on his bid to fly around the world by balloon.
	   The license represents the first time Virgin has been chosen
ahead of rival British Airways in a direct competition such as
this, said a spokesman for the company.
	   British Airways, which holds the license for the London-Beijing
route, said in a statement it was considering appealing the CAA
decision.

NATO officials voice concern over worsening situation in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with report by U.S. physicians' group
alleging systematic abuse by Serbs against Kosovo Albanian doctors
and patients &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with escalating violence in
Kosovo, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the separatist
province Wednesday against launching more attacks.
	   NATO's top commander for Europe, American Gen. Wesley Clark,
complained of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police
activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed at
halting bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels, Belgium that the escalating violence ``pose a
grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The NATO comments came as reports said one man was killed and
three others wounded in two shootouts Tuesday in Kosovo _ in the
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica and in a suburb of the capital,
Pristina.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said an unidentified gunman burst into
an Albanian-owned bar in Kosovska Mitrovica and wounded two ethnic
Albanians, one of whom died Wednesday. The survivor is known for
his loyalty to Serb authorities.
	   Two Serbian police officers were also wounded when separatists
opened fire with machine-guns in a Pristina suburb, the Serb center
said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the war
that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security
forces from February to October. During that time 1,000 people were
killed and another 300,000 lost their homes. Kosovo is a province
in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities were not in
conformance with Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He
reiterated that Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade
have been told they ``must comply with their promises made to
NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case international monitors in Kosovo are threatened.
	   Solana warned both sides ``not to try to use the Christmas and
New Year period to launch attacks or to conduct operations which
would undermine the fragile security situation in Kosovo.''
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''
	   In a separate development, the U.S.-based Physicians for Human
Rights sent a letter to Milosevic objecting to what it called
``systematic and pervasive abuses'' by Serbs against Kosovo
Albanian physicians, other health workers and patients.
	   The group documented what it said was a pattern of Serbian
intimidation of Albanian doctors, ``marked by instances of murder,
torture, detention, imprisonment and forced disappearances.''
	   Kosovo Albanian medical facilities have been searched, property
confiscated and many clinics and health centers burned to the
ground, and patients have been beaten, the report said.
	   ``Attacks on health facilities, doctors and their patients are
war crimes,'' said spokeswoman Dr. Jennifer Leaning.
	   There was no immediate response from Serbian authorities.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Veteran Coventry defender Roland
Nilsson said Wednesday he will return to Sweden when the English
Premier League season and transfer to his former club, reigning
Swedish Cup champion Helsingborgs IF.
	   ``The kids are so big that it is time to move home now,''
Nilsson told the Swedish news agency TT.
	   In March, Nilsson hopes to earn his 100th cap for Sweden. But if
he doesn't suffer serious injury and is in good shape he doesn't
plan to retire until after Sweden's 2000 European Championship
campaign.
	   After his playing career, Nilsson has been offered a position
with Helsingborgs' management.
	   ``It's a new challenge, and a different aspect of something I've
been involved with all my life,'' Nilsson said.
	   Nilsson also has played for Sheffield Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) _ Eidan Tal and Yossi Abuksis scored
second-half goals and Israel shocked European power Yugoslavia 2-0
in an international friendly on Wednesday.
	   Yugoslavia was without seven regulars and Israeli coach Shlomo
Sherf used the opportunity to experiment with several youngsters.
	   The Israelis overcame a scare when Darko Kovacevic had an
apparent goal disallowed by a controversial offside call in the
38th minute and finally took the lead when Tal, one of the
youngster, scored off Najwan Ghrayib's cross in the 57th minute.
	   Kovacevic was ejected for elbowing defender Amir Shelah midway
through the final half and Israel capitalized.
	   The hosts secured their victory in the 82nd minute when Haim
Revivo lifted the ball over the onrushing Yugoslavian defense to
Abuksis, who calmly chipped the ball over Yugoslavian keeper Ivica
Kralj.
	   After a first half in which neither team settled into a cohesive
pattern, the Israelis gradually took control following Kovacevic's
dismissal.
	   ``I'm satisfied with how we played,'' Sherf said. ``Games like
this build a team's character.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The 93 aid workers
returned to Iraq Tuesday night.
	   They were withdrawn after the United States and Britain launched
attacks last week against military and government targets to punish
Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections. The arms monitors are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the arms inspectors to return.
	   The Wednesday flight would have been the first since the
beginning of the bombardment.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq ordered
cancellation of the flight because ``they were worried that there
could be an accident.''
	   The Iraqis cited their report that U.S. and British warplanes
violated Iraqi airspace Tuesday and fired two ``stray missiles'' in
the direction of the southern city of Basra. The Pentagon and
Britain's Ministry of Defense denied the report.
	   ``I would hope that this is a temporary situation,'' Annan said.
	   On Wednesday, Iraqi officials took an Associated Press
Television News crew to the site 60 kilometers (40 miles) outside
of Basra where they said the missiles fell on Tuesday.
	   Two 2-meter-deep (6-foot-deep) craters were cut into the desert.
Nearby was a charred, overturned bus that the Iraqis said was
destroyed by the missiles.
	   The bus was parked outside an Iraqi military camp and was empty
at the time of the attack, the Iraqis said. They said there were no
injuries.
	   U.S. and British aircraft heavily targeted the Basra area last
week, and there was no way to determine exactly when the craters
were made.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had planned to fly out of
Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by road to Amman.

Senegal moves to ban female genital mutilation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHIKELUBA KENECHUKU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Senegal's government has drafted a law
banning female circumcision, a controversial traditional operation
still performed on about one-fifth of the girls in this West
African country.
	   The decision was made Monday during a Cabinet meeting and is
expected to be passed through the National Assembly early next
year, a government spokesman said Wednesday. Under the proposed
law, offenders will be liable to between one and five years in
prison.
	   The practice, sometimes called female genital mutilation, can
range from cutting the hood of the clitoris to removal of the
clitoris and external vaginal tissue. The most extreme form is
infibulation, in which the vaginal entrance is stitched shut until
marriage.
	   Health problems include difficult childbirth, bleeding,
infectious disease and sometimes death. The procedure is often
performed by traditional health practitioners using unsanitary
surgical methods.
	   Nevertheless, it is considered an important custom in dozens of
countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East where girls may
be seen as unclean and undeserving of marriage if they have not
undergone it. Because sexual contact is often uncomfortable or even
extremely painful for circumcised women, some husbands believe it
prevents their wives from being unfaithful.
	   The new legislation was quickly praised by Senegalese women's
groups. But Fatima Sall, a prominent human rights lawyer in Dakar,
said it would be difficult to root out the custom from the
country's Peulh, Wolof and other ethnic groups. Among the small
Joolas tribe in Senegal's southern Casamance province, Sall
estimated that as many as 90 percent of women and girls have been
circumcised.
	   ``It is a custom that dates back to ancient times,'' Sall said.
``Its certain that some people will defy the law and continue to
perform female circumcision. The success of this law will depend on
how it is enforced.''
	   At the end of the U.S. president's visit to Africa in February,
first lady Hillary Clinton met with villagers from Malicounda,
about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Dakar, who about two years
ago started a groundswell movement to end the tradition in about 10
Senegalese communities.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ West African troops fighting for
Sierra Leone's government pounded the outskirts of the capital with
heavy artillery and air attacks Wednesday amid fears of a rebel
advance on the city.
	   But after several hours of shelling, the Nigerian-led West
African force known as ECOMOG said the supposed rebel attack they
had been trying to repel was actually a false alarm.
	   There were no immediate damage or casualty reports from the
attack, which occurred in the heavily wooded Mount Aureol
neighborhood.
	   ``After a couple of hours of heavy bombardment, ECOMOG
discovered there were no rebels,'' Information Minister Julius
Spencer said in a state radio broadcast.
	   ``It is possible there will be a repeat of this morning's
incident from time to time because ECOMOG is concerned that nothing
goes wrong in Freetown. They will use maximum force,'' Spencer
added.
	   The bombardment followed several days of fighting between ECOMOG
and rebels in towns surrounding Freetown.
	   Britain on Wednesday advised its citizens to leave Sierra Leone
as a ``precautionary measure'' due to the worsening security
situation. Britain's small diplomatic staff in Freetown, however,
would stay to carry out an evacuation effort Britons if necessary,
a Foreign Office spokesman said.

<TEXT>
	   ROATAN, Honduras (AP) _ Take a post-hurricane peek at Honduras'
most popular tourist destination: A turquoise sea laps white-sand
beaches with tidy cottages set against emerald mountains. And not a
tourist in sight.
	   ``Mitch didn't wipe us out,'' said Jeff Farnum, 45, manager of
Sueno Del Mar dive shop and hotel in the island village of West
End. ``But the government telling people Honduras is destroyed, and
the bad press _ that's what's wiping us out.''
	   Honduras' tourism industry is struggling to get the word out
that the country's biggest attractions _ the Bay Islands of Roatan
and Utila and the Mayan Ruins of Copan _ were relatively unscathed
by Hurricane Mitch.
	   But at what is normally the peak season, tourism in Honduras is
down 80 percent from last year.
	   On Roatan, reggae music plays at empty seaside restaurants.
Bored souvenir vendors nod off to sleep in the sun.
	   ``Everyone assumes Roatan has been destroyed, but everything is
fine,'' said Elizabeth Waring of Roatan Properties, which sells
beachfront lots on the island. ``You can't even tell we had a
hurricane.''
	   With the banana and coffee industries on their knees, tourism is
one of the few options Honduras has left to generate much-needed
dollars, tourism Undersecretary Jacqueline Foglia Sandoval said.
	   The government's Honduran Tourism Institute hired Egret
Communications of Port Orford, Oregon, for an aggressive promotion
campaign. It sent mass mailings to travel outlets and set up the
country's first official tourism website with post-Mitch photos of
picturesque beaches and reefs.
	   It also got the U.S. State Department to change its travel
advisory warning Americans against going to Honduras to say Roatan
is OK to visit.
	   Honduras' congress voted this month to let foreign investors buy
land on the coast and Bay Islands to develop tourism. Coastal
residents, mostly Miskito Indians and Garifunas of African descent,
opposed the move, fearing their businesses will be pushed out. But
legislators said the law was necessary to rebuild Honduras.
	   Before the hurricane, tourism was steadily growing by about 25
percent a year. Americans account for more than three-fourths of
the visitors. Last year, Honduras pulled in dlrs 147 million in
tourism and officials had hoped to reach dlrs 180 million this
year.
	   More than half of last year's money came from Roatan. Ringed by
coral reefs, the former pirate island is renowned for its diving.
For three harrowing days, Hurricane Mitch spun 36 miles (58
kilometers) off Roatan, devastating neighboring Guanaja before it
turned south and slammed into the mainland.
	   Flooding and high winds destroyed homes in Punta Gorda, a
community about an hour north of Roatan's tourist area. Anthony's
Key, one of Roatan's most famous resorts, lost 14 cabins on stilts.
It plans to reopen Feb. 1.
	   Yet except for a handful of headless palm trees and damaged
docks, 90 percent of the island is back to normal.
	   ``Someone should call us the miracle island,'' said Donna
Arcaya, owner of the Inn of Last Resort, a lodge-style resort on a
lush private peninsula off the Caribbean sea.
	   Arcaya's resort, which is faring better than most on the island,
sent customers e-mail messages to avert cancellations. Nonetheless,
business is slow. Before the hurricane, veteran diver Steve
Blumberg had planned to come to Roatan with a group from Baltimore,
Maryland. After they got news from the Inn of Last Resort, they
merely delayed their visit a few weeks.
	   ``Roatan is world-class diving,'' said Blumberg, who has been on
31 dive trips to the Caribbean in the past eight years.
	   The tourism industry is banking on people like Blumberg to
spread the news.
	   ``Thank God for the few gringos who are still coming to see that
everything is fine,'' said Ivis Yolanda Sevilla, who manages
Joana's Gift Shop. ``Because they'll tell their friends that Roatan
is still beautiful.''

Irish euthanasia campaigner dies aged 81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Dr. Patrick Leahy, Ireland's leading
campaigner for euthanasia, has died at the age of 81.
	   Leahy, who had bladder cancer, died Dec. 17, according to a
death notice published in the Irish Times.
	   Leahy, who made headlines last year when he announced in an
Irish radio interview from Thailand that he had gone there to
commit suicide to end his suffering, died in his sleep at home in
Dublin, family members told the Irish Times.
	   Born in Thurles, Co Tipperary in 1917, he first courted
controversy in the 1970s while working in a Dublin health center
when he admitted prescribing contraceptives for patients, an
affront to Roman Catholic teachings. He was also a supporter of
abortion rights.
	   Contraceptives have since become widely available in Ireland,
but abortion remains outlawed.
	   Later in his career he became Ireland's most prominent
campaigner for euthanasia.
	   Before he went to Thailand last year to die, Leahy said in an
interview with Ireland's national RTE radio that he had helped
about 50 people to die and had referred other terminally ill people
to other pro-euthanasia doctors.
	   But he said he didn't want to get any other Irish doctors
involved in his own death, and so would end his own life in
Thailand, which he believed would have a more permissive attitude
to euthanasia.
	   He backed down after Thai medical authorities said euthanasia
was just as illegal there as in Ireland.
	   Leahy was married and had a son and daughter. He is also
survived by three sisters, six grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.

FISA moves regatta to Belgium over German protests against beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Rowing Federation
on Wednesday announced it will move its first World Cup regatta of
1999 from Munich, Germany, to Belgium because of a threatened
boycott by a group of German rowers over beer sponsorship.
	   The move follows the decision by the German brewery Krombacher
to pull out of its three-year sponsorship deal with the federation,
FISA.
	   ``It is very sad that the actions of this small group of rowers
have led to the loss of a significant sponsor and the German
federation's only annual major televised regatta,'' said Matt
Smith, FISA executive director.
	   A FISA statement said the rowers had carried out ``a sustained
campaign of attack via the media, coupled with threats of
boycotts,'' against FISA and Krombacher.
	   ``Beer advertising is clearly permitted in FISA rules and German
Rowing Federation rules ... and nearly all European countries,''
the statement said.
	   ``The German Rowing Federation has now officially withdrawn its
support of these rowers, has agreed to follow all rules of FISA and
will ensure that its clubs and rowers participating in
international competitions do as well,'' the statement continues.
	   The first stage of the 1999 Rowing World Cup will now take place
at Hazewinkel, near Brussels, on May 28-30.
	   The second regatta will be in Vienna, Austria, on June 18-20,
and the finals will be in Lucerne, Switzerland, July 9-11.
	   Germany has won the overall World Cup event for the past three
years.

Russia's ambassador to London returning after recall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to Britain, recalled last week
in protest of the U.S.-British bombing of Iraq, will return to
London within the next few days, the Foreign Office said Wednesday.
	   The move came after a phone call between Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov.
	   Ambassador Yuri Fokine was withdrawn from the embassy in London
last Friday as the joint British and American bombardment of Saddam
Hussein's regime intensified.
	   Russia announced on Tuesday that its ambassador to the United
States, who was also recalled last week, would return to
Washington.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the
political spectrum denounced the attacks on Iraq and demanded an
immediate halt to the campaign.

Pinochet wishes peace and harmony for Chile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet and his wife on
Wednesday published a Christmas message, offering hopes for peace
in Chile.
	   The message from Pinochet and his wife, Lucia Hiriart, was
printed as a paid advertisement in several local newspapers.
	   ``May peace and harmony prevail in our Chile,'' the
advertisement said.
	   ``In these moments of our lives, when God tests our faith and
gives us spiritual strength to resist the pain of being away from
our fatherland, we send our infinite appreciation to all the people
that have given us encouragement, love and support,'' Pinochet and
his wife said.
	   One daily printed it in Mrs. Pinochet's handwriting. The message
was signed ``Lucia and Augusto.''
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant issued by a
Spanish judge who charged him with murder and torture during his
1973-1990 rule in Chile.
	   The 83-year-old general is fighting a bid to extradite him to
Spain.
	   An official Chilean report says about 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   Meanwhile, right-wing Congressman Ivan Moreira was due in London
on Wednesday carrying nearly 100,000 Christmas cards sent to
Pinochet by his supporters.

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Dozens of policemen combed through a
tropical region in Bolivia for the killers of a Roman Catholic nun
and priest from Colombia, police said Wednesday.
	   Father Alvaro Lopez, 39, and Sister Maria Celina Posada, 37,
were shot Monday evening in the tropical Quiquibey region, 450
miles (700 kilometers) north of the capital, La Paz. A third person
was hospitalized under stable condition.
	   Witnesses say the two killers asked the Catholic nun and priest
for money and shot them after they indicated they were not carrying
any. Lopez and Celina were working with poor farmers and loggers in
the area.
	   Area residents were also helping police in the search and said
they would lynch the killers once they were found.
	   The killers stole the four-wheel drive vehicle the two were
traveling in and abandoned it shortly after getting into an

surround Quiquibey.
	   Father Lopez and Sister Posada will be buried in the nearby
village of Reyes. Their bodies not returned to Colombia.
	   The two missionaries were carrying out pastoral duties in this
subtropical region reachable after a 12-hour drive from La Paz. The
area is hilly and covered with dense forests.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that may increase already tense
relations with the United Nations, Baghdad on Wednesday ordered the
U.N. observer force that monitors the Iraqi-Kuwait border to cancel
a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   Also Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian aid workers went back to work
and began assessing the damage to aid programs caused by four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The 93 aid workers
returned to Iraq Tuesday night.
	   They were withdrawn after the United States and Britain launched
attacks last week against military and government targets to punish
Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections. The arms monitors are
responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the arms inspectors to return.
	   The Wednesday flight would have been the first since the
beginning of the bombardment.
	   The flight by the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, or UNIKOM,
was to have flown from the Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya
air base outside Baghdad, a U.N. official said.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq ordered
cancellation of the flight because ``they were worried that there
could be an accident.''
	   The Iraqis cited their report that U.S. and British warplanes
violated Iraqi airspace Tuesday and fired two ``stray missiles'' in
the direction of the southern city of Basra. The Pentagon and
Britain's Ministry of Defense denied the report.
	   ``I would hope that this is a temporary situation,'' Annan said.
	   On Wednesday, Iraqi officials took an Associated Press
Television News crew to the site 60 kilometers (40 miles) outside
of Basra where they said the missiles fell on Tuesday.
	   Two 2-meter-deep (6-foot-deep) craters were cut into the desert.
Nearby was a charred, overturned bus that the Iraqis said was
destroyed by the missiles.
	   The bus was parked outside an Iraqi military camp and was empty
at the time of the attack, the Iraqis said. They said there were no
injuries.
	   U.S. and British aircraft heavily targeted the Basra area last
week, and there was no way to determine exactly when the craters
were made.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had planned to fly out of
Baghdad on Wednesday but instead traveled by road to Amman.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gerald King scored a career-high 28
points Wednesday to lead Middle Tennessee State to a 93-78 victory
over American University of Puerto Rico in the seventh-place game
of the Puerto Rico Holiday Classic.
	   King, selected to the all-tournament team, was backed by Ali
McGhee with 14 points and Richard Duncan with 13. Dale Thomas added
10 for Middle Tennessee (3-8).
	   Ramon Gomez finished with 25 points to lead American (0-8) of
Division II. Gomez elbowed Oklahoma's Tim Heskett in the first
round, leading to a scuffle and Oklahoma's victory by forfeit.
Gomez was suspended for his team's loss Tuesday to St. Joseph's.
	   Kevin Nesbitt scored 16 points for the Pirates and
all-tournament selection Jesus Rivera had 15 to go with 10
rebounds.
	   Middle Tennessee opened the game with a 7-0 run and led 42-30 at
halftime. The Pirates drew to 46-41 but Middle Tennessee scored 20
of the next 22 points to go up 66-43 with 11:14 left.

Fryar's long, eventful road to retirement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ If Irving Fryar makes it to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame, he'll have plenty of stories to tell on those steps
in Canton, Ohio.
	   When he was picked No. 1 in the 1984 National Football League
draft, it was the beginning of a long, sometimes bizarre and
ultimately redemptive ride. The Philadelphia Eagles receiver said
Wednesday he's retiring after the final game of his 15th National
Football League season, ending a career that's included a Super
Bowl, a 1-15 season and enough personal catastrophes to write a
book.
	   Fryar conquered his renegade past to become one of the most
productive receivers in NFL history before finally crashing into
the limitations of age at 36. He has only 45 catches and two
touchdowns this season and cannot reach the performance incentives
needed to kick in the final two years of a contract extension he
signed in September.
	   ``I refuse to go somewhere else and play,'' said Fryar, a native
of Mount Holly, New Jersey, who will play his last game Sunday
against the New York Giants. ``I've already moved my family
twice.''
	   Fryar's consistency, longevity and numbers put him in elite
company. His 781 catches place him seventh on the NFL's career
list, and his 77 touchdowns receptions are 15th.
	   ``One of my goals was to catch 800 balls,'' Fryar said. ``And
that's not going to happen, unless by some miraculous reason they
throw me the ball a whole lot on Sunday.''
	   Fryar and the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson are the only two receivers
selected first in the draft. This season, he passed Charlie Joiner
in receptions, Don Maynard in yards and Fred Biletnikoff in
touchdown catches. All three are Hall of Famers.
	   With 53 receiving yards in his final game, Fryar would become
only the eighth player in NFL history to reach 12,000. With five
receptions, he'd extend his streak of 50-catch seasons to nine _
the longest current streak in the league.
	   Fryar played on New England's Super Bowl team in 1985, and
endured the Patriots' 1-15 campaign in 1990. He played for Don
Shula in Miami, Ray Berry in New England and Tom Osborne at
Nebraska.
	   Fryar abandoned a past that included drugs, arrests and marital
discord to become a minister. He wrote a book titled, ``Sunday is
My Day'' and is working on a master's degree in divinity.

Critical Board of Governors meeting set for Jan. 7

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting set for Jan. 7 &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association commissioner
David Stern will recommend canceling the 1998-99 season unless an
agreement to end the six-month-old lockout is reached by Jan. 7,
when the league's board of governors meet.
	   It would be the first time that a major professional sports
league in North America lost an entire season of competition for
any reason.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Wednesday that the labor
relations committee would make a report to the Board of Governors
at next month's meeting in New York.
	   ``If we do not have a collective bargaining agreement by that
date, then David and I will have to recommend to the board that the
1998-99 season be canceled,'' Granik said.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the National Basketball
Players Association. Stern is on vacation in Aspen, Colorado and
union leader Billy Hunter is in Oakland, California for the
holidays.
	   No talks are scheduled in the dispute, which centers on players
and owners trying to decide how to divide dlrs 2 billion in annual
revenue.
	   ``I assume that some additional negotiations will take place in
advance of Jan. 7, but nothing has been scheduled at this time,''
Granik said.
	   Before Wednesday, Stern had adamantly refused to discuss a
``drop dead date.''
	   Stern told Fox Sports News on Tuesday that he talked to Hunter
recently.
	   ``I've told him we have serious disagreements,'' Stern said.
``I'd love to sit down and negotiate. I would say we are getting
pretty close'' to losing the season for lack of a contract after
owners locked out players.
	   Before this season, the NBA had never lost a single game because
of labor disputes. So far, 358 games have been canceled.
	   On Wednesday, the shutdown reached its 158th day. The last round
of bargaining took place nearly two weeks ago, and players continue
to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries.
	   While baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972,
including a 232-day strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series, it
has never lost an entire season. In 1918, the season ended a month
early when the United States entered World War I.
	   The NFL and the NHL played through both World Wars and, like
baseball, never lost an entire season of competition to labor
strife.
	   In addition to salaries, some players are also losing
endorsement revenue. Nike, the world's largest athletic shoe
company, is exercising its option to withhold quarterly payments to
most of the 230 NBA players it has under contract. Fila USA also
has stopped paying five of its 10 NBA players, but Adidas is still
fulfilling its endorsement contracts.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A Venezuelan bank is suing the U.S.
Customs Service for dlrs 4 million it says it lost during an
undercover sting operation, bank officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. Customs agents allegedly used the money during Operation
Casablanca to mount a money-laundering scheme using two accounts in
Banco Industrial de Venezuela's Miami branch, bank president Rafael
Pena told The Associated Press.
	   Lawyers for Banco Industrial filed the lawsuit in federal court
in Los Angeles earlier this month, Pena said.
	   Bill Anthony, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service, said
officials in their Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles offices had no
knowledge of the lawsuit. He acknowledged, however, that it could
have been filed elsewhere in the country.
	   Operation Casablanca resulted in 160 indictments, including at
least two dozen Mexican bankers and five Venezuelan bankers
representing four banks. Many of them were lured to the United
States where they were arrested.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A truck carrying cattle ranchers high in
Peru's Andes mountains plummeted from a cliff, killing 12 people
and injuring three, police said Wednesday.
	   The open bed truck was carrying 25 passengers to a local fair
Monday when it swerved off the road and rolled down a 165-foot
(50-meter) cliff in the department of Cuzco, 350 miles (565
kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   Rescuers had to scramble down the steep embankment to reach the
truck, which came to rest on a riverbank at the bottom of the
ravine, a police spokesman said.
	   News of the accident was delayed because of its remote location.
	   Police blamed the accident on excessive speed and the poor
condition of the unpaved road.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The president-elect of
Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, will visit the Dominican Republic in
January before assuming power, Dominican president Leonel Fernandez
said Wednesday.
	   Fernandez said Chavez will visit on Jan. 8 and 9 to discuss
trade issues, including a recent deal to buy Venezuelan and Mexican
crude.
	   Chavez, who participated in a coup attempt in 1992, swept to an
election victory earlier this month and will be inaugurated on Feb.
2.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Risking more tension with the United
Nations, Iraq refused to let U.N. observers who are monitoring its
border with Kuwait fly into its territory as scheduled Wednesday.
U.N. aid workers, meanwhile, began assessing the damage to their
programs from last week's U.S. and British airstrikes. The 93 aid
workers withdrawn during the attacks returned to Iraq late Tuesday.
Wednesday's flight was supposed to carry observers from the
Jordanian capital Amman to the Habaniyya airbase outside Baghdad.
The team has been keeping tabs on the cease-fire that ended the
1991 Persian Gulf War and monitoring the demilitarized zone between
Iraq and Kuwait. (IRAQ-FLIGHT)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat freed Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest Wednesday, a
move immediately branded by Israel as bowing to the demands of the
radical Islamic group. The ailing sheik's release adds a volatile
new element to angry debate that has flared in recent weeks over
the 2-month-old Wye River peace accord. Israel has already
suspended its compliance with the U.S.-brokered land-for-security
pact, and Arafat's decision to end Yassin's unpopular detention
could signal growing unwillingness on his part to run political
risks for the sake of the faltering agreement.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with escalating violence in
Kosovo, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the separatist
province Wednesday against launching more attacks. NATO's top
commander for Europe, American Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of
``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police activities.''
Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed at
halting bloodshed in Kosovo. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
echoed those concerns, saying in Brussels that the escalating
violence and killings in recent days ``pose a grave risk to the
cease-fire.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist leader, effectively endorsing
the anti-Semitic rhetoric of his allies, accused Jews on Wednesday
of bringing on the ``extinction'' of Russia's people and the
country's economic woes, according to a news agency report.
Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov _ a prominent politician who
finished second in the 1996 presidential election _ also suggested
that Russia's Jewish community condemn Zionism, the Interfax news
agency reported. Zionism, a movement supporting the Jewish state of
Israel, is often used by Russian anti-Semites to refer to a
supposed Jewish conspiracy against other ethnic and religious
groups. (RUSSIA-ANTI-SEMITISM)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay urged senators
Wednesday not to rush into a censure deal but to ``spend plenty of
time in the evidence room'' with prosecutors' materials. If they
do, he said, the 67 votes for U.S. President Bill Clinton's removal
``may appear out of thin air.'' The Texas Republican, a driving
force in last week's impeachment vote, said the Senate should avoid
``rushing to judgment.'' DeLay's unsolicited advice came as one of
Clinton's Democratic allies strongly cautioned the White House and
House lawmakers not to try to influence discussions among senators.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As the Dow industrials moved closer to a record,
a runup in technology stocks drove other key indicators to all-time
highs Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 157.57, or
1.7 percent, to close at 9,202.03, extending its gains to 411
points over the past five sessions and nearing the Nov. 23 record
of 9,374.27. The Dow, which dropped below 7,500 as recently as Oct.
8, now is up 16.4 percent this year. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The American economy is expanding at a robust
pace despite trade problems linked to the world economic slump. The
gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and services produced
within U.S. borders _ grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate during the
July-September quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
That wasn't quite as fast as the 3.9 percent estimated by the
department last month, but it was nevertheless quite brisk,
especially considering that much of Asia, Russia and other
developing countries are in recession. The world slump has hurt
American factories and farms but so far hasn't much harmed other
sectors. And even manufacturing looked good in November. In a
separate report, the department said orders to factories for
big-ticket durable goods, items intended to last three or more
years, jumped 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 190.7
billion, the fifth increase in six months. (US-ECONOMY)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Shares in AB Volvo jumped 13 percent
Wednesday after a published report said the Swedish automaker is in
talks with Ford Motor Co. about a possible deal. The Swedish daily
newspaper Dagens Industri, quoting unnamed sources, said the
companies are holding talks but didn't specify the nature of any
planned deal. A Volvo spokesman declined to comment on the article
but said the company is ``talking to many companies about many
things, including possible cooperation.'' Ford spokesman John
Spelich said the company would not comment on speculation. More
global consolidation has been expected in the auto industry since
the merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. earlier
this year. (SWEDEN-VOLVO-FORD)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British engineering group General Electric Co. PLC
announced twin deals Wednesday with other European businesses to
create joint ventures in the missile and satellite industries. The
deals mark the latest step in the long-running consolidation of the
European defense and aerospace industries, aimed at creating
European giants to rival the top defense groups in the United
States. In the defense field, GEC announced a 50-50 joint venture
with Italian defense engineering group Finmeccanica combining their
ground, naval, missile system and air traffic control activities.
The new company, to be called Alenia Marconi Systems, will have
turnover of about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) a year, they
said. (BRITAIN-GEC-FINMECCANICA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pilots of France's state-owned airline Air France
have voted to accept a pay cut in exchange for company shares,
enabling the airline to implement its three-year reform plan. The
majority pilot union, SNPL, said Wednesday that 78.2 percent of
pilots who voted agreed to the reform. The proposal finalized in
October provides for a definitive, but voluntary, annual pay cut of
11,575 francs (dlrs 2,104) in exchange for Air France shares. The
cut represents between 2 and 3 percent of salary. Pilots may chose
a further pay cut of 12,000 francs (dlrs 2,181) per year for a
maximum of seven years, and will be granted additional stocks.
(FRANCE-AIR FRANCE)
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ Lockheed Martin Corp. expects
fourth-quarter earnings to fall below analyst expectations due to a
drop in sales and expenses associated with its CalComp Technology
subsidiary. The defense contractor predicted Wednesday that for all
of 1998 diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time items, will
rise between 2 percent and 4 percent. The company forecast that
fourth-quarter earnings would be down about 10 percent from dlrs
1.79 a share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. have
predicted the company would earn dlrs 2.06 a share for the quarter.
Financial results for the quarter and full year will be released
the week of Jan. 25. (US-LOCKHEED OUTLOOK)

 &UR; Eds: Included are items on actor Macaulay Culkin, gymnast San Lan,
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, baseball player Mark McGwire
and actor James Woods &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fire broke out Wednesday in two apartments of a
Manhattan high-rise that neighbors said were occupied by the family
of child actor Macaulay Culkin. Four people were killed, but a
publicist for the Culkins said the family was safe.
	   The apartments where the fire started, on the 19th floor, were
listed in 1997 court papers as the family's residence, and
neighbors said Macaulay's mother, Patricia Brentrup, and at least
several of the ``Home Alone'' star's six siblings still live there.
	   Macaulay recently moved out of the building after getting
married.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ With an economy in recession and a government
increasingly seen as authoritarian, Peruvians chose ``nobody'' as
the Man of the Year in 1998 in a poll released Wednesday.
	   ``Nobody'' easily topped President Alberto Fujimori, whose
once-high popularity has tumbled this year, from 28 percent to just
14 percent, a nationwide poll by the private company Datum showed.
	   Controversial TV news host Cesar Hildebrandt was a close third
with 13 percent. The fiery Hildebrandt gained fame by taking on
Fujimori and the military in his popular news program, breaking
human rights and corruption scandals.
	   Trailing Hildebrandt was popular Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade with
6 percent, followed by a soccer player and a gossip columnist.
	   	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sang Lan, the 17-year-old Chinese gymnast
paralyzed in a fall at the Goodwill Games, will help New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani ring in the new year at Times Square.
	   Lan will help drop the ceremonial lighted ball, an annual
tradition watched by approximately 250 million television viewers.
Thousands of people pack Times Square to watch the ball descend a
77-foot (23-meter) flagpole for one minute, until it reaches the
bottom at midnight.
	   ``This is a special honor, not only to me but also to the
Chinese people,'' Lan said Tuesday, smiling and waving from her
wheelchair. ``I love New York. I love you all.''
	   Lan, who has remained in the United States to undergo
rehabilitation for the spinal injury, said she was working hard.
``I am doing my exercises every day,'' she said through her U.S.
guardian and interpreter, Gina Liu.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ U.S. baseball's homerun slugger Mark McGwire,
proving himself a hero to children off the field as well, is making
good on a promise to give dlrs 1 million a year for three years to
help abused children.
	   This week, the Mark McGwire Foundation for Children sent out the
first four checks of dlrs175,000 each to two charities here and two
more in southern California that help abused children.
	   ``God gave me the ability to make people happy and help them
out,'' said the St. Louis Cardinal who broke the U.S. baseball home
run record.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Actor James Woods is parting company with
Hollywood on the subject of President Bill Clinton.
	   ``He's a certified liar, a card-carrying liar, and lying is the
cancer at the base of the spine of every crime ever committed,''
Woods told The Washington Post.
	   Many actors have lined up to support Clinton during his
impeachment proceedings, but Woods, no fan of the Republicans,
thinks he should be bounced.
	   ``I don't even like Republicans, by and large,'' he said.
However, ``This guy is a ... sociopath. I'm ashamed to be a
Democrat.''

	   AMUNDSEN-SCOTT STATION, Antarctica (AP) _ David Fischer ground
his teeth at a television monitor. In the scrolling list of
incoming military cargo planes, one blinking squib silently heckled
him.
	   ``TwO, Pt Hlls, 8:30.'' A tourist.
	   Down here?
	   Within minutes, the private Twin Otter charter from the Patriot
Hills refueling camp skittered down the South Pole's groomed ice
runway. The tiny orange aircraft looked like a dragonfly that took
a wrong turn at the rain forest.
	   On a brilliant summer morning in December, the temperature
climbs to minus 25 F (minus 32 C). But a gale bullwhips across the
two-mile (3.2-kilometer thick) glacier that extends forever in
every direction, generating wind chill that can freeze your
eyelids.
	   The South Pole is perhaps the most arduous place this side of
outer space.
	   And it's Fischer's domain. As manager of the United States'
permanent station here, he runs perhaps the world's most desolate
and important scientific outpost. He also directs round-the-clock
construction of its dlrs 153 million replacement for the National
Science Foundation.
	   The Pole is off-limits to all but approved researchers and
workers. But in the past few years, charter flights carrying
wealthy tourists and adventurers began to appear on the frosty
horizon, just as a decade earlier cruise ships began landing
passengers on Antarctica's handful of environmentally sensitive
beaches.
	   There may not be much to see but white. There isn't even a
penguin for a thousand miles (kilometers) in any direction. But
standing at the Pole remains a rare experience in a world of been
there, done that.
	   Fischer and other officials wince at the idea of their outpost
as an attraction, especially as diesel bulldozers and cranes help
to erect the new station's steel skeleton.
	   But visitors will come _ one or two at a time, uninvited, during
this research season. There's little anyone can do to stop them.
	   No nation owns Antarctica; 43 nations have signed treaties to
protect and study the icebound landmass as large as Mexico and the
United States combined.
	   The Pole is one of three large U.S. stations staffed year-round,
even during the Pole's eight months of pitch-black winter. The
unwritten code of the Ice compels its crew to help anyone who makes
it as far as 90 degrees south latitude, invited or not.
	   ``We don't encourage visitors,'' Fischer explained. ``People
don't realize that we're at 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) here. So, in
addition to being cold, they show up dehydrated and suffering from
altitude sickness.''
	   Or worse. A year ago, three sky divers were killed when their
parachutes failed to open over the ice runway.
	   The tourist arrived a few weeks after that tragedy. Emotions at
the station were still raw, and word of the small plane's safe
touchdown spread quickly. Who was this visitor? A brash tycoon like
Ted Turner? Another Amelia Earhart?
	   Nobody expected Penelope Teesdale.
	   Fischer found her in the cafeteria, hunched and shivering like a
lone sparrow on a frozen telephone wire. Her down snowmobile suit
was still fastened at the neck, and she'd pushed up her protective
face mask just enough to sip steaming tea from a mug offered by her
charter pilot.
	   Teesdale, a 73-year-old writer, had left New York three days
earlier, defying a chronic heart condition and vowing not to stop
until she stood at the bottom of the world.
	   Her twin-engine plane equipped with skis awaited, engines
running. The frigid drop-in cost about dlrs 20,000, as much as two
seasonal workers' wages.
	   ``I'm surprised I'm here,'' Teesdale chirped from beneath
several layers. ``I didn't even know it was possible until a few
months ago.''
	   Fischer managed a wan smile and a welcome. He made sure somebody
can dash outside to snap her photograph at the ceremonial pole
marker. He arranged for a heated van to chauffeur her to the plane.
	   He even pretended not to notice as her pilot helped himself to
cookies for the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) return flight to
Patriot Hills and South America.
	   ``We pump some hot liquids into them and give them a quick look
around,'' Fischer said. ``We get them on their way in a couple of
hours. There's no place to put them.''
	   No kidding.
	   The dome's original sleeping quarters for 33 men was opened in
1975. Now, as work on the new research station enters its second
season, 200 men and women cram into every available bed, including
the infirmary's, and sleep in shifts.
	   Prefabricated bunkhouses of plywood, canvas and plastic stretch
down the glacier in a polar version of suburban sprawl.
	   It is nicknamed Summer Camp and, like many camps, there's an
unlimited supply of fresh water. But melting ice with dlrs
12-per-gallon (3.8-liter) fuel makes showers, laundry and flush
toilets occasional luxuries. And the long walk to a community
bathroom can be slippery and teeth-rattling, even when the sun is
blazing at 3 a.m.

<TEXT>
	   The NSF guarantees one amenity: comfort food. Unlike early polar
explorers, residents will not have to eat their sled dogs. Crews
dine freely on steak, fish, pasta and an array of desserts.
(Surprisingly, ice cream is a big favorite.)
	   Preparing meals requires the sort of advance planning they don't
teach in culinary school. Ingredients require days to thaw in the
37-degree Fahrenheit (2.8 C) ``cooler.'' (Down here, the
refrigerator is where you go to warm up.)
	   Cook Dave Zybowski of Arvada, Colorado, satisfies the workers'
cravings for meat, potatoes and dinner rolls.
	   But Zybowski hankers for more exotic fare in a frozen world with
little sensory stimulation. ``I've ordered supplies for Thai
food,'' he said. ``They should be here in February.''
	   A tasty menu can't make up for the dangers of living in an aging
facility. Even a small fire means quick death if it knocks out heat
and electricity.
	   Like Teesdale the tourist, researchers here are obsessed with
the Pole _ but for a different reason. It is a unique place to
conduct science.
	   It's such a simple, extreme, pristine environment, and it's been
that way for so long that scientists can more readily detect the
ozone hole and other environmental changes, and trace their
sources. The skies are crystal-clear; the air, ultra-cold and dry.
That makes it a superb space observatory, too.
	   ``We're not down here because we love the Pole,'' explained
University of Chicago astrophysicist Robert Loewenstein, who
traveled the half-mile (one kilometer) from the dome to his
telescope on cross-country skis. ``If there was a better place for
astronomy, that's where we would be.''
	   The Pole is more often described as a small town where everyone
knows and helps each other. Maybe too small. Especially when nature
calls in an amorous way. ``If you decide to do something with
somebody at 2 a.m., everybody else knows about it by 5 a.m.,''
muttered maintenance worker Erika Nelson of Hood River, Oregon.
	   Twenty years ago, the first women on the Ice required military
escorts. A woman's voice on a radio would be followed by wolf
whistles and heavy breathing. Today, women account for one-third of
the summer work force and are treated as equals by co-workers.
	   In return, the Pole exacts its toll equally.
	   Studies show workers in extreme cold require three times longer
to complete a simple task. That's because the brain's chemistry
produces more of a hormone required for physical activity and
reduces levels of those engaged in problem-solving.
	   ``Just unbolting a little metal shed took me three or four
hours,'' Nelson said. ``You just can't seem to pull it together
down here.''
	   If conditions seem harsh now, just wait until winter.
	   In mid-February, the last aircraft skims the ice runway and
banks north. A skeletal crew of 28 ``winter-overs'' stays behind,
waving until the plane vanishes into the orange twilight. Night
will reign until October when spring, the sun and the airplane
return.
	   This winter, for the first time, NSF will double the winter
crew, adding construction workers to complete the new station's
heavy equipment garages.

	   AMUNDSON-SCOTT RESEARCH STATION, Antarctica (AP) _ The new dlrs
153 million U.S. research station here won't be The Plaza at the
Pole. A budget hotel may seem deluxe, by comparison.
	   The 8-by-8 (2.5-meter by 2.5-meter) bedrooms in the new outpost
will be smaller than some prison cells.
	   But when the temperature plunges to minus 100 Fahrenheit (minus
74 C) and the wind roars down the Queen Maud Mountains at 200 mph
(320 kph), these cozy little dens will beckon as many 153 people to
the frozen bottom of the world.
	   ``A bedroom is the size of walk-in closet back home,'' concedes
Frank Brier, project manager of the new station for the National
Science Foundation.
	   It will be several years _ no earlier than 2005 _ before anyone
checks into this polar hotel.
	   Whether that is soon enough will depend on cooperative weather
and careful maintenance of the fabled, but decrepit, existing
station protected by a circa-1975 geodesic dome that is being
rapidly buried by blowing snow from across Antarctica.
	   Polar diehards may wax lyrically of the beloved dome as an ark
on a frozen sea.
	   Others privately ridicule it as an icebound Mir, the balky
Russian space station that suffered fires, computer failures and
near-fatal decompression. Like many jokes, it contains some truth.
	   ``The U.S. would not send a ship to sea or a spacecraft into
orbit in such condition,'' says Norman Augustine, the CEO of
Lockheed Martin, who headed the blue-ribbon panel that recommended
the new station to Congress in 1997.
	   Lawmakers agreed, though they appropriated about dlrs 40 million
less than originally requested for a more elaborate facility.
	   One of the most formidable construction projects ever attempted
now is well underway. Metal clangs, bulldozers roar and welding
torches arc 24 hours a day, six days a week.
	   An acrid whiff of diesel fuel rides the cold wind blowing
through the squatters' village of temporary shelters known as
Summer Camp. It already was overcrowded before 60 construction
workers arrived.
	   Inside the old dome, a burly laborer slumps into a pink plastic
cafeteria chair. Wisps of steam rise from his matted hair as he
peels off layers of insulated coveralls. Icicles drip from his
beard.
	   ``Are we having fun yet?'' Wiley Ellis demands as his
frost-encrusted comrades clomp past in heavy rubber boots.
	   Ellis normally makes cabinets in Idaho, but a craving for
adventure _ not to mention a steady paycheck _ has lured him 9,000
miles (15,000 kilometers) from home.
	   Isolation and cold are extreme even by Antarctic standards. Some
workers relish the brutal conditions _ and the camaraderie. They
return to the Pole year after year to work as aircraft ``fuelie''
or cargo handler or dozens of other tasks. Others, like Ellis, sign
up to assemble the new polar station but are unlikely to return
after one four-month hitch. (``We're all miserable, but we're
company for each other,'' he says.)
	   Any romantic notion of pioneering quickly evaporates aboard a
Vietnam War-era cargo plane during a 13-hour flight from New
Zealand. Then the white, forever white hits _ with all the
aesthetic appeal of living in a Styrofoam picnic cooler.
	   With no place to go and nothing to buy, Ellis is more practical.
His aims are to survive and save money.
	   He could accumulate dlrs 10,000 by the time he heads north in
February. But even a fat paycheck can't entirely compensate for the
graveyard shift in a place where the sun doesn't set for five
months, yet metal tools crack in the cold.
	   ``The cold is really hard on my body,'' Ellis says, rubbing
aching legs. In his 40s, he is two decades older than most of his
mates. His muscles crave coffee breaks in the cozy cafeteria.
	   To simplify things, every piece of the new station will be
prefabricated and shipped in Hercules LC-130 cargo planes. They
will be assembled like a giant Lego sculpture on the Ice. Dozens of
cargo planes already arrive weekly to deliver materials and haul
away debris. It will take three construction seasons to airlift it
all.
	   ``The biggest headache in this project is the logistics,'' says
NSF project manager Brier. ``It accounts for a third of the cost of
the new station.''
	   Flights are so frequent that station officials have installed
the only stoplight in Antarctica next to the ice runway at the
Pole. The next traffic signal is 3,000 miles (4,800 kilomters)
north in New Zealand.
	   Its purpose is not to stop the airplanes. It's to prevent
preoccupied scientists and chilled workers from walking into a
Herc's whirling propellers.
	   Last summer, workers completed the first of the steel archways
on the station that will buffer new garages and heavy equipment
repair shops.
	   This year, they will erect a second protective arch and install
an expanded fuel system and power plant inside.
	   Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the station's design is
its foundation. The entire complex will stand on adjustable stilts
to allow snow to whistle beneath the station.
	   Blowing snow has drifted more than 20 feet (6 meters) around the
dome entrance, which now sits two stories below the glacier
surface. Rock-hard drifts must be blasted with dynamite and
excavated _ a waste of personnel and precious fuel.
	   ``I've spent summers fighting forest fires,'' says Erika Nelson
of Hood River, Oregon, who frequently toils on a snow-shoveling
detail. ``The work here is right up with that in terms of being
physically demanding.''

Birds help scientists document mercury pollution on remote island

	   ISLE ROYALE, Michigan (AP) _ An orange-tinged, full moon rises
above the dark line of trees along the shore as the motorboat hums
quietly across the still waters of Rock Harbor.
	   Biologist Joseph Kaplan stands in front, gripping a powerful
spotlight with one hand and a pair of binoculars with the other. He
and partner Keren Tischler, who is piloting the boat, are seeking a
family of common loons known to nest on Caribou Island, part of the
Lake Superior archipelago that forms Isle Royale National Park.
	   Their midnight mission: Capture a 6-week-old chick, pluck a few
feathers and draw a blood sample, which will be tested for mercury
contamination. It's part of a broader study of the extent to which
the poisonous element has tainted the island chain's ecosystem.
	   To the casual observer, Isle Royale might seem the last place
where industrial pollution would be a problem.
	   The 45-mile-long (70-kilometer-long) island chain is a federally
designated wilderness area, undeveloped except for a scattering of
houses, camping and boating facilities and the park headquarters.
Its lakes teem with fish. Moose sightings are common on its forest
trails, and nighttime silence occasionally is broken by a gray
wolf's ghostly howl.
	   But in the 1970s, researchers who tested Isle Royale's inland
lakes were shocked by the levels of toxic PCBs they found _ in some
cases, 30 times higher than in surrounding Lake Superior.
	   Conclusion: It must have traveled through the atmosphere.
	   ``It shows how much of a global problem airborne contamination
is,'' says Jack Oelfke, a National Park Service resource management
specialist. ``You can't just point your finger at the local
smokestack any more.''
	   Since then, elevated mercury levels have been found on and
around Isle Royale. While some probably came naturally from
bedrock, atmospheric contamination is the primary culprit, Oelfke
says.
	   With a dlrs 45,000 grant from Canon U.S.A., a team of scientists
is conducting a two-year investigation. In addition to the water
itself, they're studying sediments from lake bottoms, rain and
snow, microscopic plankton, fish (northern pike and yellow perch),
deer mice and moose.
	   And they're looking at loons _ web-footed birds with a
plaintive, high-pitched cry. Expert divers, they often stay beneath
the surface as long as a minute hunting for fish.
	   Their dietary choice makes loons a good indicator whether
mercury is progressing up the food chain. Recently hatched chicks
are especially useful because they've eaten only in one area, while
adults _ which migrate to the Gulf Coast for winter _ have foraged
elsewhere.
	   Another reason loons were picked for the study is their tendency
to return to the same area each spring, enabling scientists to
monitor them over the years. Some live as long as 30 years.
	   ``They're not very shy. Many times they'll swim right up and
look at us in our canoes,'' says Tischler. She and Kaplan are loon
specialists for BioDiversity Inc., a nonprofit ecological research
group based in Freeport, Maine. They've taken samples from 19 Isle
Royale loons in 1998.
	   Of course, the first step is finding them, which on this night
isn't easy. For more than an hour the biologists fruitlessly search
the chilly, clear water around Caribou Island, the family's
established territory.
	   Tischler frequently cuts the boat motor and Kaplan plays a
cassette recording of a loon's quavering wail. Sometimes the
serenade will draw a live response. Tonight, no takers.
	   Finally, while moving the spotlight in a sweeping arc across the
middle of the harbor, Kaplan sees them floating placidly on the
water surface.
	   Mom and Dad flee as the boat approaches, but curious Junior
swims toward the light. At one point he turns away, but the
scientists make soft hooting noises that keep him coming.
	   As the boat draws alongside, the chick suddenly dives. But
Kaplan swoops a long-handled net below the surface and hauls the
struggling loon aboard. They draw blood, weigh the bird, and affix
identification bands to its legs before releasing it.
	   The chick, and others the biologists studied in 1998, should
yield useful information for the mercury project. Its blood sample
will be compared with those from loons nesting around Sargent Lake,
one of the most heavily contaminated of Isle Royale's inland
waters.
	   One loon chick from an inland lake sampled in 1997 had mercury
levels six times higher than those of loons a few miles
(kilometers) away in Lake Superior.
	   Oelfke, the project director, hopes to release an analysis of
findings from all the field studies next summer. In addition to
documenting the extent of mercury contamination and its effects,
the report may shed light on where it's coming from.
	   One possible source is industrial emissions from Thunder Bay,
Ontario, 35 miles (60 kilometers) north. But there is evidence that
at least some of the mercury had more distant origins.
	   For example, inland lake water samples have turned up traces of
a herbicide commonly sprayed on Great Plains cornfields. Scientists
believe the poison may have been blown into the upper atmosphere
and traveled hundreds of miles (kilometers) before settling.
	   If so, atmospheric mercury may have done likewise, Oelfke says.
There's even speculation that some Isle Royale mercury drifted from
as far away as China, whose factories belch huge amounts.
	   ``It's important to document what's going on,'' Oelfke says.
``If we're having these kinds of problems on this remote island,
what's happening elsewhere?''

 &UR; UNITED STATES: U.S. orders expulsion of three Cuban diplomats &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The State Department ordered Wednesday the
expulsion of three Cuban diplomats at the United Nations for spying
activities.
	   It said two other Cubans who were alleged to have engaged in
similar activities left the country on their own several weeks ago.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Cuban mission
was informed that the three were being expelled ``for activities
incompatible with their diplomatic status'' _ diplomatic code words
for spying.
	   The three were said to have been linked to a case involving 10
people _ all alleged to be Cuban agents _ who were arrested in
Miami in September.
	   The names of the three Cubans were withheld. Two were said to be
low-ranking diplomats and the third was described as mid-to-senior
level. U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida E Silva said the three must
leave by 5 p.m. on Dec. 28.
	   ``This action was taken as a result of evidence developed during
an exhaustive investigation by the FBI,'' Rubin said.
	   He added that the United States cannot accept violations of U.S.
law and ``endangerment of our national security interests.''
	   The Cuban delegation to the U.N. was informed Monday night that
the United States tentatively planned to order the three to leave
the country, said an official, asking not to be identified.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Two hospitalized Americans say police beat them
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Two Americans hospitalized with
abdominal injuries say they were beaten by police in Barbados, and
the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it is ``very concerned'' and
investigating their charges.
	   Antonio Mendoza, 24, and Felipe Teron Collazo, 45, were detained
Friday. Both men are from Puerto Rico.
	   Inspector Oral Reid, the policeman spokesman, said the men
complained of abdominal pains Sunday and were taken to the
hospital.
	   Sources at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown said Mendoza
underwent emergency surgery for internal hemorrhaging and abdominal
injuries and Teron was treated for injuries to the stomach and
groin and then discharged. Mendoza remained in hospital Wednesday
in stable condition, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   The two were among 23 people from a visiting U.S. carnival, who
were detained Friday in connection with a Dec. 11 robbery of an
automatic bank machine. Reid said all but three of those detained
were released.
	   None of them, including Mendoza and Teron, have been charged in
connection with the burglary, though one man was convicted of
having a marijuana cigarette.
	   ``Obviously we are very concerned and we are investigating,''
said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Jennifer Clark.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Election officials certify statehood's loss
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Elections officials have confirmed
U.S. statehood's loss in a Dec. 13 referendum despite appeals from
Gov. Pedro Rossello's pro-statehood party.
	   State Elections Commission President Juan Melecio on Tuesday
certified the results, which show a protest vote, ``None of the
above'' winning over statehood 50.3 percent to 46.5 percent.
	   Rossello's New Progressive Party had argued ``None of the
above,'' which was supported by advocates of the the current
commonwealth arrangement, should not count. It had asked Melecio to
declare statehood the winner.
	   ``The commission acted in accordance with the law _ there was no
other alternative,'' said Damaris Mangual, one of three elections
commissioners, in Wednesday's El Nuevo Dia newspaper.
	   Rossello called the nonbinding vote on Puerto Rico's future
relationship with the United States after a similar binding
proposal failed in the U.S. Congress.
	   But supporters of the status quo claim the definition of
commonwealth on the ballot favored statehood. The definition
claimed, among other things, that Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship
could be taken away and that the U.S. Congress has complete control
over the island's affairs.
	   The official results show 71.3 percent of the 2,197,824 people
registered to vote cast ballots.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Cubans acquitted of hijacking plane still in jail
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Three Cuban refugees acquitted of hijacking a plane
to the United States are being held illegally by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service and should be released
immediately, two members of Congress said Wednesday.
	   An immigration judge ruled last week that the Cubans should be
granted political asylum, but federal officials said they can
detain the men while they decide whether to appeal the order.
	   ``The continued detention of Adel Regalado Ulloa, Jose Roberto
Bello-Puente and Leonardo Reyes Ramirez is totally unjustifiable.
And it violates the rule of law itself,'' said Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida, on Wednesday.
	   Diaz-Balart, who along with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has written
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno about the men without response,
said he would call for congressional hearings if they weren't
freed.
	   No one at the Justice Department was available for comment.
	   ``I can guarantee you that they do not have to detain (them),''
Diaz-Balart said. ``It's totally unjustifiable, inexcusable.''
	   But not illegal, according to Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for INS'
eastern region.
	   The statement that it's illegal to hold people after asylum is
granted may be true, but ``the immigration judge's decision is not
final until the appeals process is over,'' she said. ``They
technically haven't been granted asylum.''
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Man pleads innocent to burning prosecutor's
house
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A U.S. Virgin
Islands man pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges of burglarizing
and setting fire to the home of a U.S. prosecutor on Sept. 16.
	   Police claim Adaryll Gumbs, 20, and other burglars climbed up
wall of a home owned by Assistant U.S. Attorney Curtis Gomez and
entered through a bedroom window.
	   No one was home at the time. The fire caused smoke and water
damage to the home's first floor.
	   Prosecutors claim Gomez had prosecuted an armed robbery case in
which Gumbs was a co-defendant.
	   No date has been set for Gumbs' trial. Four other defendants
have entered guilty pleas for their involvement.
	   Joseph Emmett Simmonds, 20, pleaded guilty to arson and
burglary. Jahma Ludvig, 22; Ashbert Sylvester Lloyd, 20; and
Bertrand Alexis Penn, 21 pleaded guilty to burglary and carrying a
firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. The
defendants are being held without bail.
	   Last month, Jennifer Erema Hunte, Simmond's girlfriend, was
charged with harboring a fugitive and issuing false statements.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Report says U.S. focus group likes Jamaica, except for
crime
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A focus group of U.S. companies gave
Jamaica high marks as a site for investment, though it said the
island's high crime rate is worrisome.
	   The Investment Attitude Study of 29 firms doing business in
Jamaica was conducted by the U.S. Commerce Department in August and
released Monday.
	   The companies said Jamaica's primary attractions are its
political stability, culture, location close to the United States
and Central America, and preferential trade access under the
Caribbean Basin Initiative and Caribbean Community agreements.
	   Crime was cited as a major worry, and the group said the
island's road network is poor, especially in Kingston and Montego
Bay. But it gave high marks to Kingston's shipping port and the
island's air transport services.
	   All of the companies said their Jamaican operations have been
profitable over the last two years.
	   They also said Jamaican bureaucracy, cited in 1995 as the
largest obstacle to investment, has become more cooperative and the
government's investment promotion agency, Jampro, has helped
greatly.
	   The surveyed companies called for more competition in telephone
markets, primarily in cellular and value-added services. Jamaica
Cable and Wireless has a monopoly on wire telephone services.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Venezuelan president-elect to visit
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The president-elect of
Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, will visit the Dominican Republic in
January before assuming power, Dominican president Leonel Fernandez
said Wednesday.
	   Fernandez said Chavez will visit Jan. 8 and 9 to to discuss
trade issues, including a recent deal to buy Venezuelan and Mexican
crude.
	   ``I spoke with Chavez by telephone and he promised us that he
will come to the Dominican Republic so that we can discuss some
points of a bilateral agenda between the two nations,'' Fernandez
said.
	   Chavez also plans to attend a meeting of leaders from the
Caribbean Community and Latin American countries in Santo Domingo
in April, Fernandez said. Cuban President Fidel Castro is also
expected to attend.
	   Chavez, who participated in a coup attempt in 1992, swept to an
election victory earlier this month and will be inaugurated on Feb.
2.
	   Other countries in the Caribbean were initially wary of Chavez's
victory but have since said they are encouraged by conciliatory
statements he has made.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Light plane's engine catches fire, no injuries
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A small airplane skidded off the
runway of San Juan's main airport Wednesday after the pilot landed
because of a burning engine.
	   The left engine of the Cessna 402 caught fire shortly after
takeoff at about 10:15 a.m., said Puerto Rico Ports Authority
spokesman Raul Torres.
	   Pilot William Ford managed to land the aircraft at Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport, but as it touched down the right
landing gear collapsed, sending the airplane into a grassy area
near the runway.
	   Firefighters extinguished the flames, and the pilot was unhurt,
Torres said. The aircraft carried no passengers or cargo.
	   The airport closed 2,000 feet of the runway while federal
officials investigate the accident. The airplane is owned by
Tol-Air, a local air freight company.
	   Flights continued uninterrupted on the airport's second runway.

Cycling ends turbulent year with uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Professional cycling began 1998 in expectancy and
ended it, according to the Tour de France's race director, facing
extinction.
	   The doping scandals that marred the Tour were of such magnitude
that they not only overshadowed cycling, but proved to be a
catalyst for doping controversies in other sports, such as soccer,
and at the International Olympic Committee.
	   Other sports have had their image tarnished by drug scandals,
but none depends so heavily on a single event for its global
reputation, as cycling does on the Tour.
	   The Tour's travails began July 8, three days before the first
leg, when French customs officials caught Festina physiotherapist
Willy Voet was a stash of anabolic steroids and erythropoietin
(EPO).
	   The team was was expelled from the race when sporting director
Bruno Roussel admitted to the systematic use of banned drugs.
	   But cycling's image continued to be tarnished with almost daily
drug revelations.
	   Cyclists began to complain of brutal police tactics.
	   Their frustration boiled over July 29, when they staged an
unprecedented sit-in before the 17th stage to Aix-les-Bains.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' world No. 1 Laurent Jalabert said.
	   Some rivals saw it differently: Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour
winner, said that Jalabert and others were disrupting the race
because they had no chance of winning it.
	   The Tour seemed in jeopardy, but somehow limped on.
	   By the end, six out of the 21 teams had pulled out, citing
police tactics, leaving fewer than 100 riders from the original
189.
	   Four months on, the affair remains shrouded in mystery.
	   Why, for instance, did French authorities only begin
investigating TVM in July, when it had seized banned substances
from the Dutch team back in March?
	   In the courtroom and in the media, claim and counter-claim
continue to damage the image of the sport.
	   Festina team leader and 1997 Tour runner-up Richard Virenque,
one of two cyclists to maintain that he never knowingly took banned
substances, took legal action against Voet, who had publicly
accused him of taking EPO and other substances.
	   Voet response was to accuse Festina of ``facilitating and
inciting doping,'' outraging the Spanish watchmaker, and tell a
French tabloid that Virenque received up to 100 injections a year.
	   The pressure proved too much for Virenque, who was forced to
quit the sport at the age of 29, unable to find a team to back him
after breaking with Festina.
	   Festina's Voet, Roussel and team doctor Eric Ryckaert, and two
TVM officials - sporting director Cees Priem and doctor Andrei
Mikhailov - remain under formal investigation, one step short of
being formally charged.
	   Now, professional cycling enters perhaps the most important year
in its history, with federations desperate to repair the sport's
tattered image in the eyes of the public, sponsors and governments.
	   ``Cycling must undergo a moral revolution _ or disappear,''
warned Tour organizer Jean-Marie Leblanc.
	   Some are disappointed by the sport's initial response.
	   International Cycling Union rules allow federations to ban
cyclists who take drugs for up to a year.
	   But the Swiss federation only handed out eight month bans to
Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier - allowing them to
compete in next year's Tour - and fines of 3,000 Swiss franc (dlrs
2,164).
	   Sponsors that bankroll the sport are nervous.
	   Festina, which has cut its 1999 budget by half, is renegotiating
contracts with all its cyclists.
	   Away from the drug scandals, climbing specialist Marco Pantani,
who rides for Mercatone Uno, became the first cyclist to win the
Tour of France and the Tour of Italy in the same year since Miguel
Indurain in 1993.
	   In the Tour de France, Jan Ullrich, the defending champion, came
in second, with American Bobby Julich third.
	   In the Giro, Pantani came in ahead of Russia's Pavel Tonkov and
another Italian, Giuseppe Guerini, in third.
	   Spaniards dominated the Vuelta, Abraham Olano clinching first
place, ahead of countrymen Fernando Escartin and Jose Maria
Jimenez.
	   At the World Championships, Switzerland's Oscar Camenzind won
the top men's elite road race, ahead of Peter Van Petegem and
Michele Bartoli.
	   And at the track racing World Championships, France won six
golds in 12 events, equaling its total of last year.

Justice Department joins parade of probes into Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous NEW YORK-dated item &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI
began a full-fledged investigation of the Salt Lake City Olympics,
the fourth and potentially most serious inquiry into allegations
that Utah bought the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Announcement of their investigation comes a week after U.S.
authorities began reviewing accusations that Salt Lake officials
used scholarships and other gifts and favors to buy the votes of
International Olympic Committee members.
	   ``We've opened an investigation into allegations of
improprieties in connection with the Salt Lake City Olympics bid,''
Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said Wednesday in Washington.
	   Marlin would not elaborate on possible charges or areas of
investigation, or whether the inquiry will affect inquiries by the
U.S. Olympic Committee, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics
board and an IOC itself.
	   But federal investigators flying in from Washington to look into
possible criminal wrongdoing by local Olympic officials likely will
have a practical effect on the other inquiries.
	   ``You can be sure it will make it much more difficult to
investigate this because everyone is going to run and get their
attorney,'' said Nolan Karras, who represents the governor's office
on SLOC's board of trustees.
	   SLOC said it has retained the international law firm of Latham
and Watkins, with offices in Los Angeles and Washington, in
response to the federal investigation.
	   ``SLOC is asking all past and present employees to cooperate
with requests for information,'' a statement said.
	   Typical investigations into conspiracy and bribery cases focus
on the possibility of extortion and tax and wire fraud.
	   For example, to bring a tax fraud case, investigators would have
to prove Salt Lake organizers bought lavish gifts or financed
scholarships for relatives of IOC members with tax-exempt funds.
	   Past and present SLOC officials have acknowledged they paid
college tuition for relatives of some IOC members and gave some
members expensive rifles and skis during visits prior to Salt
Lake's selection as a Winter Olympics host.
	   A physician also said he was asked to perform cosmetic surgery
for an IOC member and two other members received free medical care
at Salt Lake-area hospitals.
	   Accusations of scandal and bribery _ primarily by IOC executive
board member Marc Hodler _ prompted the IOC to set up the first
inquiry. Last week, Salt Lake organizers asked their independent
ethics panel to investigate.
	   On Tuesday, the USOC appointed a five-member panel headed by
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to look into the
bidding process by American cities.
	   USOC President Bill Hybl said he was waiting to see if the new
federal inquiry will affect his agency's investigation.
	   The federal government could let the other investigations go
ahead, impose limits, or tell them to drop their work, according to
sources familiar with criminal prosecution who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   The IOC expects to wrap up its own investigation by Jan. 23.
	   Salt Lake organizers have said their ethics board would report
its findings no later than Feb. 11.
	   Any delays may irritate sponsors who pay an increasing
percentage of the multimillion-dollar sports budget and have told
Olympic brass they want the controversy dealt with swiftly.
	   Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to assure them
action is being taken to maintain the Olympics' image of high
ideals and ethics.

Tyson gives young prisoners advice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Mike Tyson was doing the talking _ and some
troubled youths were listening.
	   The former heavyweight champion drew upon his own criminal past
Wednesday to tell teenagers jailed in a tent prison to get their
lives together.
	   ``You're not here because somebody framed you even though we all
say we are,'' Tyson told a group of about 15 prisoners. ``Even
though I didn't take anything from that girl, I put myself in that
position.''
	   Tyson visited the Maricopa County facility, a series of tents
set up in the desert where youths convicted of crime serve
sentences in a bootcamp-like atmosphere.
	   He was followed by several television cameras, but said he was
sincere in his belief that he could make a difference in the lives
of the prisoners.
	   ``To all the people who complain about me being here, those
people should come and talk to them,'' Tyson said later. ``They're
scared to even look at those kids. They're afraid that they'll rob
them.''
	   Tyson, who has been training in Phoenix for his Jan. 16 comeback
fight against Francois Botha, drove to the prison camp in a purple
Rolls Royce after finishing five rounds of sparring in a downtown
gym.
	   He stood inside one of the tents and spoke for about 20 minutes
without stopping, telling the youths that he had been in their
situations, and urged her them to straighten out their lives before
they're sentenced to a real prison.
	   ``This is a horrible place to be, but this is great if you
compare it to other places,'' said Tyson, who served more than
three years in an Indiana prison after a 1991 rape conviction. ``I
just left prison a little while ago, and you don't want to go
there. They'll kill you there because they don't like the way you
walk.''
	   The youths, who at first appeared indifferent about Tyson's
visit, listened attentively as he went on. Then they crowded around
him, seeking autographs and advice.
	   ``It takes a lot of guts to come here and talk to us,'' said
17-year-old Philip Hagadora, ``I'm glad he came here. It's
miserable being here in the cold.''
	   Another inmate vowed that he would take Tyson's advice and stay
out of trouble.
	   ``God bless you, Mike,'' the youth said as he hugged Tyson.

From greatness to gridlock, NBA has skidded to a halt

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The image is an enduring one, Michael Jordan
stealing the ball from Karl Malone, dribbling downcourt and hitting
the shot that gave the Chicago Bulls their sixth championship of
the decade.
	   Sixth months later, no one knows if that was the end of Jordan's
career _ or the final game of the National Basketball Association's
heyday.
	   A lockout, imposed by the owners, has shut down the sport.
	   ``To go from that moment, maybe Michael Jordan's greatest, and
to have it come to this. It's just a shame,'' said Danny Schayes of
the Orlando Magic.
	   And that about sums it up. A shame.
	   Unable to agree on how to divide some dlrs 2 billion in annual
revenues, the NBA has been closed since July 1 as the owners and
players fight over the terms of a new collective bargaining
agreement.
	   The first three months of the 1998-99 season have been scrapped,
and the league hopes to play a 45- to 50-game schedule if the work
stoppage ever gets settled.
	   In the meantime, people wait.
	   But at least the most recent memories are worth recalling.
	   A rookie coach named Larry Bird and his Indiana Pacers nearly
ended Jordan's reign in the Eastern Conference finals. An upstart
named Kobe Bryant tried to steal the show from Jordan at the
All-Star game, only to have Western Conference coach George Karl
leave him on the bench in the fourth quarter when Jordan wrapped up
the MVP award.
	   That same coach was knocked out of the playoffs again and ended
his tumultuous association with the Seattle SuperSonics before
resurfacing in Milwaukee.
	   Another coach, Jeff Van Gundy, locked onto Alonzo Mourning's leg
during a fight at the end of Game 4 in the first-round Knicks-Heat
series _ a moment that would ultimately change the outcome of the
series and allow the student, Van Gundy, to overcome his old
teacher, Pat Riley.
	   A rookie, Tim Duncan, showed the versatility and talent to be
considered a great one already. A veteran, A.C. Green, extended the
sport's Ironman record to 978 consecutive games played.
	   A law professor, John Feerick, shortened Latrell Sprewell's
suspension and reinstated his contract.
	   Grant Hill and Penny Hardaway missed the playoffs. Isiah Thomas
left the Toronto Raptors _ along with nearly all of their players.
	   The Minnesota Timberwolves turned to Stephon Marbury, not Kevin
Garnett, in the clutch.
	   The Houston Rockets limped through another season before nearly
knocking off the Jazz in the playoffs as Clyde Drexler said
farewell.
	   The abysmal Denver Nuggets threatened to break the 1972-73
Philadelphia 76ers' record for futility.
	   And then, of course, there were the Bulls.
	   Treated like rock stars in every city they visited, they sold
out every game they played. Scottie Pippen, after starting the
season on the injured list, demanded a trade. Dennis Rodman was
disinterested, but still won his seventh straight rebounding title.
Jordan showed his usual brilliance, leading the league in scoring
for the 10th time and picking up his fifth MVP award. Chicago won
62 games, got past the Pacers in Game 7 of the Eastern finals and
made it to the championship round.
	   Against the Jazz, Pippen's defense helped the Bulls even the
series in Game 2. In Game 3, the Bulls held the Jazz to 54 points _
the lowest point total in league history since the advent of the
24-second clock.
	   Rodman lingered in the locker room at the opening tip of each
game, then blew off practice before Game 4 in favor of a wrestling
appearance.
	   Chicago failed to close out the Jazz at home in Game 5, but Game
6 was worth the wait.
	   Pippen, playing in pain, tried to match the game-changing
defense he produced in Games 2, 3 and 4.
	   Jordan capped his 45-point night with his steal and shot,
leaving his arm extended an extra moment as if to savor the
snapshot.
	   Was it, he was asked afterward, the way he envisioned ending his
career?
	   ``If that's the case, yes,'' he replied.
	   Back in Chicago after another victory celebration in Grant Park,
Phil Jackson ended things on his own terms, a defiant winner riding
off into the sunset on his Harley-Davidson.
	   Then, incredibly, came a summer of not knowing whether any of
them will be back. The greatest dynasty of the decade and the
so-called sport of the '90s were brought to a sudden, surreal halt
by the lockout.
	   The Bulls hired Tim Floyd, made him coach-in-waiting and
director of player personnel and vowed to take one last shot at
Jackson.
	   Jordan called a news conference at a golf tournament and
announced ``basketball is dead'' for him but said he would put off
a final decision on his future until the lockout ends.

	   RAJKOT, India (AP) _ They stormed in without warning, 300 men
who burned Bibles and told Hindu students that their Christian
school was trying to subvert their religion.
	   ``They said, `This religion is not worth following,''' said
Vibha Ghare, 15, a Hindu who attends the I.P. Mission School. The
school is run by Christians, but two-thirds of its students and
staff are Hindu.
	   This western Indian city is better known as the hometown of
Mohandas Gandhi, a Hindu and India's messiah of nonviolence and
religious tolerance. But lately, Rajkot and surrounding Gujrat
state are becoming known for what Christian leaders say is growing
intolerance linked to the rise to power of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   The mob that ransacked the school was searching for copies of
the New Testament that had been distributed by a traveling
Christian group. As the children watched, the attackers made a
bonfire of 400 Bibles and told the students, all girls, that the
school was conspiring to make them marry Christian men so they
would be forced to become Christian.
	   ``This is completely false,'' said S.H. Desai, an Indian
Christian who is principal of the 103-year-old school in Rajkot.
``They think, `These are Christians, very few in number, let's
intimidate them,'''
	   Christians make up just 2.5 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
people, while Hindus account for 80 percent of the population and
Muslims 12 percent. Despite their small numbers, Christians have a
certain prominence because schools founded by missionaries are
among the most prestigious in India. Hindu parents compete to
enroll their children.
	   The attack on the I.P. Mission School was one of more than 90
violent incidents aimed at Christians in 1998, according to the
United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a group of lay Christians.
The group says that was more than in any other year since India's
independence in 1947.
	   The forum blames what it says is an atmosphere of intolerance
that has accompanied the Bharatiya Janata Party's political rise.
The party won national elections in March and heads the national
governing coalition. It also controls the state government in
Gujrat.
	   Despite the troubles, the Christian community appears festive as
Christmas approaches. For now, fear of assault has eased. The
government, under political pressure, has tried to curb attacks
during the holidays.
	   On Dec. 4, Christian schools across India closed for a day in
protest over the violence. The Roman Catholic archbishop of New
Delhi, Alan de Lastic, addressed 5,000 demonstrators at a rally in
the capital.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has condemned attacks on
Christians. But his government also denies there is any
orchestrated anti-Christian campaign and questions the United
Christian Forum's numbers of such attacks.
	   In some cases, violence described as anti-Christian may have
other explanations. For instance, several men broke into a convent
in a remote area in central India in September and raped four nuns;
police later arrested 24 suspects, half of them Christians and half
Hindus.
	   But the forum and Indian news media have recounted serious
violence toward Christians. In April, a mob razed a Catholic church
in western India. Earlier, a priest in the eastern state of Bihar
was beaten and paraded naked by a mob who accused him of sodomizing
a boy.
	   Christians maintain the violence is being fanned by Hindu
right-wing groups closely linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party _
the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, and the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or National Volunteer Corps.
	   ``The Christians are making a fuss because they are afraid that
Hindus who have converted to Christianity want to return to their
religion,'' said Kishorebhai Mangalpara, a Hindu activist in
Rajkot.
	   Hindu groups say missionaries take advantage of the poverty and
backwardness of lower caste Hindus and tribal groups, beguiling
them into becoming Christians at revival meetings where they claim
to work miracles.
	   Although there are no overt calls for conversions at Christian
schools, subtle pressures exist. In Catholic schools run by nuns
and priests, prayers are held several times a day. In boarding
schools, non-Christian children sometimes are required to pray and
are encouraged to go to chapel and read the Bible.
	   Lower-caste Hindus considered social pariahs in their own
religion and indigenous peoples have been drawn to Christian
missionaries who run schools, hospitals and homes for the poor.
Many conversions occurred in tribal areas where extreme poverty
goes hand in hand with exploitation by upper-caste Hindu landlords.

Reclusive Mexican writer found to have died in 1986
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For a dozen years, Nellie Campobello was a
figure of mystery, a legendary writer and choreographer from
Mexico's `Golden Age' who seemed only to speak to Claudio Fuentes
Figueroa, a man once cleared on charges of kidnapping her.
	   Now, it appears Campobello has lain dead for a dozen years in a
barely marked grave and officials are hunting for Fuentes, who has
disappeared _ as has a treasure trove of Campobello's artworks.
	   ``It is a gothic horror story ... a tale of cynicism, arrogance
and moral monstrosity. Fuentes pretended for so many years she was
alive,'' said writer Carlos Monsivais, who signed a petition
earlier this year asking authorities to look for Campobello.
	   Investigators said Wednesday they have been unable to locate
Fuentes recently. Mexico City Attorney General Samuel del Villar
said he was seeking an arrest warrant for him.
	   During the last 12 years, Fuentes would regularly say he had
recently talked with Campobello, and that she was living a
reclusive life in the rural central state of Hidalgo.
	   He even offered to lead investigators to her in August _ but
halfway through the trip he reneged, saying he had changed his
mind.
	   Authorities announced Monday they had found her body _ in a
rural graveyard in a tomb marked only with her initials. A death
certificate filed in a nearby town indicated she died of heart
failure at 86 on July 9, 1986. Fuentes signed the certificate as a
witness.
	   But the mystery of the artworks, which Monsivais described as
``national treasures,'' remains.
	   Campobello was a luminary in the Golden Age of modern Mexican
culture in the 1920s to 1950s, contemporary and friend of the likes
of Diego Rivera, Frieda Kahlo and Jose Clemente Orozco.
	   ``She was a pioneer. She was the first to revive Mexico's folk
dances and Indian dances,'' said author Elena Poniatowska.
Campobello founded one of Mexico's famed Ballets Folklorico.
	   Orozco occasionally painted backdrops for her dances.
	   Campobello's two novels, ``Cartucho'' and ``My Mother's Hands,''
received little recognition in her day but are now required reading
at dozens of universities.
	   ``Because she was a woman, and Mexico is a country of machismo,
no one paid any attention to her'' as a writer, Poniatowska said.
In the last years of her life, few even saw her.
	   Monsivais described Campobello's last decade of life as similar
to the Hollywood movie ``Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,'' in which
a character is watched over by her abusive sister.
	   Campobello lived in a run-down old mansion in Mexico City's
downtown, watched over by Fuentes and his wife.
	   Fuentes had power of attorney and presented himself as her
``compadre,'' a term meaning friend or godparent. It was unclear
how the two first met.
	   Campobello had been reduced to a ``terrified child'' the last
time Monsivais saw her in public, during an April 1985 hearing on
criminal charges brought by a government arts council accusing
Fuentes of having kidnapped her. A court dismissed the charges for
lack of evidence.
	   In September 1997, Fuentes also filed a police report claiming
that millions of dollars in artworks had been stolen. Those works
presumably include a 1936 painting by Orozco commemorating the
death of Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca.
	   ``I don't think he (Fuentes) could have sold the Orozcos,
perhaps works by Carlos Merida and Roberto Montenegro. But no one
knows where they are,'' said Monsivais, who had seen the artworks
and called them ``of exceptional quality.''
	   A spokesman for the Mexico City Attorney General's Office said
prosecutors are investigating the case for possible criminal
conduct. City Human Rights Investigator Alejandro de la Portilla
said, ``The fundamental thing now is to exhume her body and perform
an autopsy. But it's been 12 years, and any signs of foul play may
have been lost.''
	   Poniatowska said Campobello's captivity may have lasted longer
than anyone thought.
	   ``I think she had been at the mercy of those two (Fuentes and
his wife) since she started getting old,'' Poniatowska said.

Stern sets Jan. 7 `drop-dead date'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Malone and Willis saying
players should accept owners' proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association owners and
players have just two weeks left to save their season.
	   Six months after locking out players, the league on Wednesday
set what appears to be a ``drop-dead date'' of Jan. 7.
	   If no agreement is reached by a Board of Governors meeting set
for that date in New York, NBA commissioner David Stern will
recommend canceling the 1998-99 season.
	   It would be the first time that a major professional sports
league in North America lost an entire season of competition for
any reason.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Thursday the labor
relations committee would make a report to the board on Jan. 7.
	   ``If we do not have a collective bargaining agreement by that
date, then David and I will have to recommend to the board that the
1998-99 season be canceled,'' Granik said.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the National Basketball
Players Association. Stern is on vacation in Aspen, Colorado and
union leader Billy Hunter is in Oakland, California for the
holidays.
	   ``It's my view that if the owners are unwilling to move from
their current proposal, the season will then be canceled,'' agent
Arn Tellem said. ``I believe that ultimately when the players
analyze this, there is no way they will ever take the deal on the
table.''
	   No talks are scheduled in the six-month-old dispute, which
centers on players and owners trying to decide how to divide dlrs 2
billion in annual revenue.
	   ``I assume that some additional negotiations will take place in
advance of Jan. 7, but nothing has been scheduled at this time,''
Granik said.
	   Before Wednesday, Stern had adamantly refused to discuss a
``drop dead'' date.
	   Stern told Fox Sports News on Tuesday that he talked to Hunter
recently.
	   ``I've told him we have serious disagreements,'' Stern said.
``I'd love to sit down and negotiate. I would say we are getting
pretty close'' to losing the season for lack of a contract after
owners locked out players.
	   Before this season, the NBA had never lost a single game because
of labor disputes. So far, 358 games have been canceled.
	   On Wednesday, the shutdown reached its 176th day. The last round
of bargaining took place nearly two weeks ago, and players continue
to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries.
	   Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz and Kevin Willis of the Toronto
Raptors have said players should accept the offer Stern mailed all
of them last week. Willis said players should hold a secret ballot.
	   ``The majority would vote for the owners' latest proposal, just
to start playing ball again,'' Willis said Tuesday.
	   Tellem, who represents Kobe Bryant and Reggie Miller, among
others, said that if the owners' latest proposal were accepted, the
number of players earning the minimum _ about dlrs 250,000 _ would
increase to about half the league over the next three years. He
said the number at the minimum salary already had gone up from 25
to 80 during the previous labor deal.
	   ``For players to accept what the owners want would be
devastating to the vast majority of all current players and to all
future players in the NBA,'' Tellem said.
	   While U.S. baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972,
including a 232-day strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series, it
has never lost an entire season. The National Football League and
the National Hockey League played through both World Wars and, like
baseball, never lost an entire season of competition to labor
strife.

New Zealand at full strength against India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Swing bowler Simon Doull came out
unscathed from two bowling spells to give New Zealand the option of
picking the strongest side for the second cricket test against
India at the Basin Reserve beginning Saturday.
	   Doull, who ruled himself out of the first test with an injured
right calf muscle, bowled well under 100 percent, but it was good
enough to convince coach Steve Rixon of his fitness.
	   ``I am happy with his level of fitness. The most important thing
is he is honest about it,'' Rixon said after the team's last
official training session at Kilburn Park on Thursday.
	   ``What mattered was his fitness, not how quick or well he bowled
today. He showed that he can bowl over a sustained period and
that's good enough for me.''
	   ``The good thing for us in this test is that we can choose
anyone without worrying about injuries. We haven't had that chance
for a long time.''
	   New Zealand has won just eight of its 33 home tests since
January 1990, four of them in succession against Sri Lanka and
Zimbabwe in 1997 and 1998 respectively.
	   Rixon refused to rule out the possibility of playing a second
spinner in Paul Wiseman given Wellington's recent track record as
spinner-friendly from the third day onwards.
	   ``We are certainly not ruling out Wiseman at this stage,'' Rixon
said.
	   He is mindful of the danger India's batsmen pose, especially
skipper Mohammed Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkar, who have 36
centuries between the them.
	   That total is 24 more than the entire New Zealand top order.
	   ``I'm not taking anything away from India, you can't because
they've got six great batsmen. (Rahul) Dravid is a quality player,
Tendulkar speaks for himself and Azharuddin's record indicates he
is a great player.''
	   Rixon described India's bowling as ``nicely balanced'' and said
the visitors should have the upper hand if the wicket takes spin.
	   ``If it is a turning track, it will benefit them. (Anil) Kumble
is a world-class bowler and they have two off spinners who could
slot in.''

New full-spectrum light bulb brightens museum art
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ In a forest in France, a woman makes
her way home with a stack of kindling tucked under her arm.
	   When you look closely at the white flecks in ``The Forest of
Fontainebleau,'' you realize it's not a path that guides her, but a
stream. Her dress is blue, not black. And the leaves of myriad
shades recede far into the distance.
	   In an adjoining room of 19th-century European paintings at the
Memorial Art Gallery, patrons don't have to put the same kind of
effort into seeing and appreciating every nuance in the
Impressionist landscapes of Paul Cezanne and Claude Monet.
	   The difference? The new ceiling lamps. They simulate daylight.
	   ``The better that people can see the paintings, the better we're
doing our job,'' said an exhilarated Candace Adelson, curator of
European art.
	   Since electric light must be toned way down in museums to
minimize artwork decay, SoLux daylight lamps are no more intense
than incandescent or tungsten ones used for illumination ever since
Thomas Edison created the light bulb in 1879.
	   In place of the usual yellowish hues, though, they radiate a
much brighter, whiter light. They are designed to allow more color
from the blue end of the spectrum and thereby replicate
full-spectrum daylight.
	   The effect on the paintings is dazzling: the finest details
become crisper and clearer, colors seem more intense, perspective
is more lifelike.
	   SoLux lamps were developed by Kevin McGuire, 37, a former
optical engineer at Eastman Kodak Co., and first tried out at the
University of Rochester-affiliated gallery in July.
	   Now spotlighting a Van Gogh exhibition at the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, they have drawn the curiosity of curators
worldwide. Dozens of U.S. museums are experimenting with them.
	   Judging by the gleeful remarks scribbled in a visitors' journal
at the Rochester gallery, they appear to have a bright future.
	   ``The colors seem to jump off the walls,'' marveled Janet
Schoenfeld of Baltimore. ``This was the only room that didn't hurt
my eyes,'' wrote Maria Razza of Rye Brook, New York. ``The strain
to interpret the colors under tungsten is relieved _ I feel more at
ease,'' echoed Neil Cowley of Houghton, New York.
	   At dlrs 10 to dlrs 15 apiece, the 2-inch-wide
(5-centimeter-wide) lamps cost twice as much as traditional
tungsten-halogen lamps but last at least twice as long, McGuire
said. Besides, he added, ``it's impossible to see the real genius
in these paintings without the proper light.''
	   McGuire has created similar lamps with higher intensities for
use in clothing and jewelry stores, Hollywood movie sets, dentists'
offices and even homes.
	   Imitation daylight is a highly sought-after commodity, and
dozens of products are jostling for an edge in the marketplace. But
McGuire's company, Tailored Lighting Inc., has at least gotten a
big jump on the competition with museum-tailored lamps.
	   ``No one replicates the daylight spectrum as identically as we
do, and that's why it's being used in these very demanding
applications,'' he said.
	   Steven Weintraub, a New York museum consultant who has long
explored ways to improve museum lighting, used a device made by
McGuire to calculate the ideal ``color temperature'' for viewing
art indoors.
	   SoLux lamps match his calculation _ 3,500 degrees Kelvin _
whereas tungsten bulbs emit about 3,000 degrees and incandescent
2,800 degrees.
	   ``In a lot of museums, you go in there and you simply can't see
the artwork very well, and people frequently complain,'' Weintraub
said.
	   Even museums with windows and skylights can have a cool,
overcast look without the addition of artificial lighting. And
since many artists work in daylight, their paintings are often best
viewed under a similar light, Weintraub said.
	   Fluorescent lamps don't work well, he added, because they give
off a narrow-wavelength light that makes ``everything look very
flat.''
	   He believes the SoLux brings out the best in paintings by the
Impressionists, who themselves often experimented on capturing
subtle lighting effects.
	   In Monet's ``Towing a Boat, Honfleur,'' which depicts fishermen
tugging a boat on shore in Normandy in 1865, a tiny light atop a
distant lighthouse reflects on the water.
	   Under tungsten, ``it appeared yellow and didn't contrast as much
with the orangey sky behind it,'' Adelson said. Under SoLux, ``the
little white dot is the focal point for the whole painting. It just
glows at you.''
	   Adelson spent 17 years working in galleries in Florence, Italy,
before moving here in 1992. She immediately took a dislike to ``The
Forest of Fontainebleau,'' painted by Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la
Pena in 1874.
	   ``I always thought it was a dull painting,'' she said.
	   But under SoLux, ``I could see that the artist was really
masterful at what he was doing,'' she said, smiling. ``All of a
sudden, it wasn't my unfavorite painting anymore.''

Venezuela's president-elect vows to shake up oil monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ It's one of the world's largest oil
companies and is considered an island of efficiency in a country
known for nightmarish bureaucracy.
	   Still, President-elect Hugo Chavez is vowing to shake up
Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, the state-owned oil monopoly and
No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the United States. He claims it
has become an elitist, money-squandering giant accountable to no
one.
	   ``PDVSA has become a state within a state,'' he said hours after
his landslide Dec. 6 victory. ``That is going to end.''
	   Chavez's plans for the franchiser of 14,500 U.S. gas stations
through its Citgo Petroleum Corp. are alarming PDVSA executives who
fear he will dismantle the company that is Venezuela's biggest
source of export earnings. They worry a shakeup will derail or slow
a multibillion-dollar expansion plan involving Mobil Corp., Exxon
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and others.
	   ``There is no company that is more supervised, controlled or
audited than PDVSA,'' said Luis Giusti, the company's highly
regarded president, who was trained at the University of Tulsa in
Oklahoma. He boasts of PDVSA's international reputation for
excellence.
	   Chavez already has announced he will fire Giusti, divert some of
PDVSA's profits to social spending and rein in plans to sharply
boost production.
	   At the election-night press conference, he denounced the
company's ``Saudi-style use of airplanes, out-of-control costs and
gold-card culture'' in a country where public hospitals lack
needles and bandages and more than half the population lives in
poverty.
	   Giusti scoffs at the attack.
	   ``A CEO of Exxon earns dlrs 5 million a year. We earn dlrs
250,000 a year,'' he said, adding he has received job offers that
``maybe will allow me to live like a rich man.''
	   Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976, booting out
international companies and giving PDVSA exclusive control over the
world's largest proven oil reserves outside the Middle East.
Foreign companies now permitted to pump Venezuelan oil must sell
all of their output to PDVSA.
	   But Chavez and other critics claim PDVSA has hijacked the
nation's oil policy, creating tax havens for its own benefit and
blocking external audits. One result is that the company maintains
overseas operations such as Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Citgo and Veba
Oel AG in Germany that barely turn a profit, he says. ``It's a
mystery.''
	   Giusti defends Citgo, the fourth-largest gas station chain in
the United States in terms of market share, as providing a
guaranteed distribution outlet for Venezuelan oil, and rejects
accusations that PDVSA escapes government oversight. Citgo reported
earnings of dlrs 211.2 million on revenue of dlrs 8.5 billion for
the first nine months of this year.
	   Industry experts say PDVSA has become highly independent partly
by default because the government is so disorganized. The
government has turned to PDVSA's huge pool of professionals for
help on everything from setting up a foreign exchange control
system to solving the Year 2000 computer problem.
	   PDVSA officials fear Chavez may appoint inexperienced people who
could ruin the company. They also fear he may raid its coffers to
finance a national budget deficit estimated at dlrs 5 billion and
growing. Oil accounts for about three-quarters of Venezuela's
export earnings.
	   ``You could quickly wreck the company, which would be
disastrous,'' said Robert Gay, Latin America strategist at New
York-based investment bank BT Alex. Brown.
	   Chavez and PDVSA also clash over the company's plans to boost
output capacity of 3.8 million barrels a day to 5.8 million barrels
a day by 2007. To help meet that goal, Venezuela is inviting back
industry giants such as Mobil, Exxon and Conoco Inc., which are
lining up billions of dollars to invest in joint ventures with
PDVSA.
	   Chavez says the plan is too much, too fast, and he wants the
foreign companies to focus on refining crude oil and producing
petrochemical products instead of just drilling wells and exporting
crude oil.

Tokyo shares down after bank sell-off, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices opened lower in early trading
Thursday after investors sold bank shares. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 85.71
points, or 0.62 percent, to 13,693.74 in the first 30 minutes of
morning trading. On Tuesday, the average closed down 373.50 points,
or 2.64 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.38 yen in early trading, down 1.70 yen
from its level of 117.08 late in Tokyo on Tuesday and below 115.96
yen late in New York on Wednesday.
	   Tokyo markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
	   Market players sold bank shares on fears that a recent drop in
bond prices and the subsequent rise in bond yields would cause bank
profits to fall, analysts said.
	   Bond prices tumbled Tuesday following the Japanese government's
announcement that it would issue new bonds to pay for massive
stimulus spending next fiscal year.
	   Also, a cut in the ratings of seven Japanese banks Tuesday by
U.S. ratings agency Standard and Poor's was seen hurting share
prices.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 6.23 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,076.23. On
Tuesday the market closed down 16.66 points, or 1.52 percent, to
1,082.46.
	   Stocks fell despite a strong gain overnight on Wall Street.
	   There, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 157.57, or 1.7
percent, to close at 9,202.03, extending its gains to 411 points
over the past five sessions and nearing the Nov. 23 record of
9,374.27.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell from its level in New York
on Wednesday as Japanese interbank players sold the U.S. currency
in thin dealings.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.810 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.900 percent,
pushing the price up to 99.91 yen from 99.19 yen.

NASA, University of Texas discuss Mars rock storage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ The Texas medical school planning a laboratory to
handle the world's most dangerous organisms is ready to take on the
universe.
	   The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, 45 miles
(70 kilometers) south of Houston, is discussing the possibility of
housing any Mars specimens returned to Earth in NASA's proposed
unmanned missions to the Red Planet next decade.
	   ``A memorandum of understanding has been formulated to formally
and informally talk about the problem of biohazard containment,''
said Michael McGinnis, associate director for UTMB's Center for
Tropical Diseases.
	   NASA spokeswoman Ann Hutchison confirmed the discussions,
calling them ``extremely preliminary.''
	   The center is preparing to build a high-security biological
containment facility that will adhere to the government's strictest
standards. Researchers there will study some of the fiercest
disease-causing microorganisms known to mankind.
	   McGinnis offered UTMB's services because of the possibility that
martian rocks contain material unknown to mankind.
	   ``The specimens probably won't be dangerous, but you have to be
careful,'' McGinnis said.
	   The talks anticipate the dlrs 3 billion Mars exploration project
NASA envisions for the next century. If plans are carried out, the
first Mars samples retrieved by unmanned vehicles could touch down
on Earth in 2008.
	   UTMB's Biosafety Level 4 lab will have been open for six years
by then if plans remain on course. Officials now are deciding
exactly where on campus to locate the dlrs 5 million to dlrs 7
million, privately funded facility.
	   UTMB believes the intense security and safety precautions
routinely taken make it a natural first stop for any earthbound
martian soil. Scientists could begin studying the martian matter
once it's deemed safe.
	   ``(The lab) would also prevent the Mars rocks from being
contaminated,'' Ms. Hutchison added.
	   NASA would pay some sort of fee for use of the facility,
McGinnis said. However, Ms. Hutchison also left open the
possibility that NASA could build its own secure environment.

 &UR; Study: Cancers may avoid immune system by producing decoys
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Some cancers may use decoys to avoid being
killed by the body's immune system, a study suggests. If so, drugs
that block that strategy might help fight the disease.
	   Cancers use several tricks to evade the immmune system, and the
new study provides indirect evidence that the newfound decoys are
one of the strategies.
	   Some immune system cells display a protein structure called the
Fas ligand to kill other cells. The ligand fits into a receptor on
the target cell, which makes that cell commit suicide.
	   In the new work, scientists discovered a previously unknown gene
they called DcR3. It lets cells produce a chemical decoy that binds
to the death-dealing ligand and keeps it from working.
	   To look for evidence of a possible role in cancer, researchers
examined 35 lung and colon tumors. About half showed extra copies
of the DcR3 gene, which suggests the gene offers some tumors a
survival advantage.
	   The work is presented in the Dec. 17 issue of the journal Nature
by Avi Ashkenazi and colleagues at Genentech Inc. of South San
Francisco. In a telephone interview, Ashkenazi said a drug that
neutralizes the decoys might prove useful in fighting cancer.

 &UR; Scientists find more evidence that brain hormone affects appetite
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have found new evidence that a brain
hormone stimulates appetite, underlining its potential use as a
target of an anti-obesity drug.
	   Melanin-concentrating hormone, or MCH, is one of at least 17
brain substances known to affect food intake. Scientists showed in
1996 that when MCH was injected into the brains of rats, the
animals ate about twice as many calories as usual.
	   For the new experiment, scientists did the opposite: They
created a strain of mice that lacked MCH. The creatures were leaner
than normal, and they ate less and weighed less than usual. They
also burned calories faster than usual.
	   That shows MCH is a critical regulator of feeding, said the
researchers, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and
Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Drugs that block MCH might work
against obesity, the researchers wrote in the Dec. 17 issue of the
journal Nature.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Researchers probe loud music ``addiction''
	   BOSTON (AP) _ It's a condition you don't want your next-door
neighbor to have.
	   Lending weight to the suspicions of generations of disgruntled
neighbors, roommates and parents, a group of researchers at
Northeastern University have published a study suggesting some
people might have addictions to loud music.
	   ``One of the hallmarks of addictions is continued use, despite
physical harm. These people couldn't stop listening,'' said Mary
Florentine, one of the authors of the study published Dec. 15 in
the journal of the American Auditory Society.
	   Ninety people were recruited for the study, and the researchers
gave them a questionnaire similar to those used to identify
alcoholics.
	   For example, they translated the question, ``Do you feel you are
a normal drinker?'' to ``Do you feel you listen to music at normal
levels?''
	   Other questions asked respondents if they had ever lost housing
or been in trouble with the law because of loud music.
	   The study argues that music, like alcohol, heroin and nicotine,
``has the capacity to induce rapid and potent changes in mood and
level of arousal, the ability to reduce negative states, and the
tendency to elicit the experience of craving.''
	   While the study identified eight people suffering from
``Maladaptive Music Listening,'' Florentine cautioned that the
results do not mean eight of 90 people have the condition; many
participants were recruited at a record store, and some had already
been identified as likely subjects.

Round-the-world balloonists head for Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATING with balloon crossing Japan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British entrepreneur Richard Branson and his
teammates passed Japan and floated over the Pacific on Thursday in
their attempt to circumnavigate the world in a balloon.
	   The trio headed to the United States in what ground control crew
say could be the most hazardous phase of the journey.
	   Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden were moving at about 125 mph (200 kph) at a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet (9,150 meters) early Thursday, ground
control crew said.
	   ``We are quietly confident that this next sector is going to be
OK,'' project director Mike Kendrick told SKY News on Wednesday
evening.
	   ``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate
that far out,'' Kendrick said.
	   He said ground crew are tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific should the balloonists
need help.
	   ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said Kendrick. ``We
are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which will give us a
good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.''
	   On Wednesday, the balloon floated over ancient sites in northern
China, then swept across the Yellow Sea after China bowed to
British appeals to let the balloon pass through prohibited
airspace.
	   Beijing had said the balloonists could cross southern China, but
the balloon drifted further north than planned because the trio
were navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed airspace
over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   After asking the balloonists to land, China later relented.
	   ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese
finally let us through,'' Branson said.
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days
to nearly three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere
in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight,
which will take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific
and the United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

South Africa reaches the top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ South African rugby has risen above the
turmoil of bitter infighting to reach the summit for the first time
since winning the World Cup in 1995, and heads into 1999 as
favorite to defend its title.
	   South African government officials were canvassing international
boycotts of their rugby team at the start of 1998 over a court
battle between the country's president Nelson Mandela and rugby
leader Louis Luyt.
	   Mandela won out, Luyt resigned and boycotts were averted. The
Springboks celebrated the reconciliation by continuing a winning
streak to 17 matches, equalling New Zealand's record before
surprisingly falling to England in the final match of the year.
	   New Zealand, beaten by the South Africans in the 1995 World Cup
final, had been peerless since that defeat, until this year when it
slumped to a worst-ever losing run which it has yet to end.
	   The All Blacks were hit by the retirements of several
experienced stars, most significantly long-serving captain Sean
Fitzpatrick and loose forward Zinzan Brooke.
	   After opening with two shaky victories over a hapless England
touring team, New Zealand lost twice to South Africa and conceded
the Bledisloe Cup series against Australia 3-0 _ the first time
since 1929 that the Wallabies had scored a whitewash in the series.
	   Coach John Hart faced increasing pressure as the All Blacks lost
five straight for the first time in a proud history, but he has
survived to lead the team to the World Cup, hosted by Wales, in
Oct. 1999.
	   England's international season was shaped by its clubs, who were
blamed for keeping star players off the tour to Australia and New
Zealand, which began with a then record 76-0 loss to the Wallabies
in Brisbane and barely improved.
	   England's decision to send a squad missing 13 internationals was
attacked Down Under, with then Australian Rugby Union chairman Dick
McGruther describing the visitors as ``the worst prepared
Englishmen since the First Fleet.''
	   South Africa topped Australia's record scoreline by pasting
Wales 96-13 at Pretoria in June, but the southern hemisphere giants
found the northern hemisphere teams to be more resilient in their
own neighborhood.
	   England's team was back to full strength when Australia visited
in November and fell 12-11 to a penalty by John Eales in the last
few minutes.
	   Wales, with New Zealander Graham Henry taking the helm, led the
Springboks by 14 points in their return match at Wembley Stadium,
and were unlucky to lose 28-20.
	   South Africa also had wins against Scotland and Ireland and
needed one more victory for a grand slam tour of Britain but fell
13-7 to a determined England.
	   Still, considering the tension of March, when politicking cast a
shadow over the entire season, the South Africans were proud of
their achivements.
	   ``Our record speaks for itself,'' said captain Gary Teichmann.
``We won 17 games and the team still has to reach its full
potential. There is no doubt in my mind that the best is yet to
come. We've got a six-month break and we will be back stronger than
ever.''
	   South Africa had a hectic year while the New Zealanders decided
to keep their commitments to a minimum in a bid to avoid burnout
ahead of the World Cup.
	   But Hart, who wanted the light season, admitted he could have
done with more games for a team unsettled by the loss of
established players and the plunging form of some others.
	   Hart described the criticism he received as `like a public
execution.''
	   ``I understand just how committed this country is to the game,
how important the All Blacks are. It's only natural there will be a
lot of debate and conjecture.''
	   In contrast, South African rumblings were about off-field
matters as a political struggle followed Mandela's approval of a
judicial commission to investigate charges of racism, nepotism and
mismanagement within SARFU.
	   Autocratic SARFU president Luyt and the Union sued, claiming
there was insufficient evidence to start a probe, and they won an
appeal in April. The suit resulted in Mandela being ordered into
court to testify, enraging critics.
	   Luyt held on until May when he reluctantly stood down, allowing
the new SARFU leaders to apologize to Mandela, the man who
galvanized the country behind the team by wearing a Springbok
jersey to the 1995 Cup final. In September, SARFU elected unopposed
Silas Nkanunu, a black, as the new president.

Healing continues as League aims at expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rugby league tried to get well again in
1998 after Rupert Murdoch's divisive intervention, but the sport
was still struggling to emerge from the shadow of rival code union.
	   A new world governing body, the Rugby League International
Federation, was launched in August with leadership shifting from
England's Murdoch Super League main man Maurice Lindsay to
Australia's John McDonald.
	   The Super League split brought through Murdoch's breakaway
league in Australia continued to have rumblings as Australian
officials axed two sides.
	   One of those, Adelaide Rams, owed everything, good and bad to
Murdoch.
	   Adelaide existed through money from Murdoch's News Limited,
based in the city, and was formed as a plank of his national
league. But when peace came, Murdoch cut the club's financial
lifeline and it died.
	   While the loss of the Rams and the Gold Coast, plus mergers
moved Australia towards 16 teams from 20, the game was looking for
ways to expand elsewhere.
	   Australian tours to Great Britain will return following the
Super League split while the annual matches between the winning
club sides from Australia's National Rugby League and Great
Britain's Super League competitions will also resume.
	   ``We are trying to rebuild the international calendar and every
country has been enthusiastic in finding the best way to do so,''
McDonald said in August. ``We are looking at a two-year cycle for
the first two World Cups so we can return this level of competition
to both hemispheres as soon as possible.''
	   Great Britain will host the 2000 World Cup and Australia will
host the 2002 tournament before it reverts to every four years.
	   McDonald announced a tri-series tournament involving Australia,
Great Britain and New Zealand to start in October-November 1999.
	   In what was either an arrogant move or an act of concession, the
first tri-series has been put up against the rugby union World Cup
to be hosted throughout Britain at the same time.
	   Rugby Union is played in more countries than the 13-a-side game
and there is a huge disparity between the tri-series competitors
and the next level of countries.
	   The RLIF will begin its world crusade in South Africa, a Union
stronghold, in February when the international 9-a-side competition
is hosted at Johannesburg's Ellis Park.
	   As part of the federation's plans to raise the profile of rugby
league in South Africa, Britain will play a test match against New
Zealand at the same venue on the way home from the tri-nations
series in November.
	   Australia remains the undisputed leader in League having
continued its winning run at international level with a 2-1 series
victory over New Zealand. The Kiwis won the opening match and were
looking for their first series success over their neighbors since
1953.
	   But led by Wayne Bennett, who took over from long-serving Bob
Fulton, Australia rebounded for two strong wins.
	   New Zealand showed itself to be the second-ranked team when it
won two and tied the other in a three-test series against Britain.
	   There was little change in the established order in the world's
two main club competitions either. Brisbane Broncos, led by
evergreen scrum-half Allan Langer, lived up to expectations by
winning the reunified Australian title after claiming the Super
League crown in 1997.
	   A club was successfully launched in AFL-crazy Melbourne, and the
team made the finals. But the season was clouded by a series of
positive drug tests, especially at the 1997 ARL title winners
Newcastle, who had Robbie O'Davis, Adam MacDougall and Wayne
Richards suspended. Melbourne's Rodney Howe and Wests' Ben
MacDougall, brother of Adam, were also punished on drug charges.
	   In England, Wigan made it 15 titles in 15 seasons by
overpowering Leeds in the inaugural British Super League Grand
Final.
	   Since the 1984-85 season, Wigan has dominated the game in
Britain, winning nine first division championships of the former
league, two Super League Premiership titles and nine Challenge
Cups.

Defense calls for playing tape in court to prove conspiracy

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister sought permission Thursday to play a
tape-recording of a conversation they said would point to a
political conspiracy against him.
	   Excerpts of the recording were read Wednesday but Judge
Augustine Paul, who is trying Anwar Ibrahim, barred the press from
reporting the conversation that the defense claimed involved Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the prosecution's star witness.
	   Paul said he would rule later Thursday on whether the transcript
of the conversation was admissible as evidence.
	   When the trial resumed Thursday, defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh
sought permission to play the tape so that he could get Ummi to
agree to making all the statements contained in the recording.
	   The judge asked the defense to prove inconsistencies in Ummi's
testimony so far before he would allow them to play the tape.
	   Ummi, a 31-year-old advertising executive, is the prime mover of
all the charges against Anwar. She wrote a letter to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and distributed copies of it last year. It
contained allegations that Anwar was sleeping with his secretary's
wife.
	   Much of the prosecution case hinges on Ummi's testimony and her
credibility because she also helped Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver in Anwar's household, to write out a declaration that Anwar
repeatedly sodomized him.
	   Anwar's lawyers have accused Ummi of acting out of jealousy
because of her unreciprocated love for the 51-year-old politician.
She denied the she was crazy about Anwar and kept a photograph of
him under her pillow.
	   Singh had read out bits of a conversation that Ummi was alleged
to have had in June with Malaysian businessman Sng Chee Hua. It was
unclear if Ummi knew their conversation had been recorded.
	   Anwar's chief defense attorney, Raja Aziz Addruse, informed the
court that Sng had been summoned to the police headquarters
Wednesday evening for questioning.
	   ``While this case is going on and he is a relevant witness in
this matter, the police cannot do such a thing,'' he told the
court.
	   The defense hoped to use the conversation to prove its theory of
a government conspiracy to destroy Anwar's career. Anwar has denied
all 10 charges of illegal sex and corruption, saying they were
fabricated.

Baseball hits a home run in '98: McGwire, Sosa, Yanks and a lot

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire delivered the message way, way back
in February when he launched a long home run into the Florida sky
in his very first game of spring training.
	   Get ready, baseball fans. This will be a season to remember for
U.S. Major League Baseball.
	   And how!
	   Big Mac racing Slammin' Sammy in the most riveting home run
chase ever, shattering records and stamping a new number into
American lore _ 70.
	   The New York Yankees bidding to become the greatest team ever,
sweeping the World Series and winning the most games in baseball
history _ 125.
	   Cal Ripken ending his streak at 2,632 straight games. Kerry Wood
striking out 20 in only his fifth major league start. David Wells
pitching just the 13th perfect game in the modern era.
	   Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs winning a one-game playoff. Mike
Piazza being traded twice in a week. Bernie Williams beating out Mo
Vaughn for the American League batting title on the final day. Juan
Gonzalez getting 101 RBIs by the All-Star break.
	   There was so much daily drama that baseball once again captured
America's imagination. There was so much history and magic that
deep into December, Roger Clemens was still making big news by
dropping his trade demand, just months after he won his record
fifth Cy Young Award.
	   Other stars of 1998 included Barry Bonds, who became the first
player with 400 homers and 400 stolen bases, and Dennis Eckersley,
who set a record with 1,071 pitching appearances.
	   Also, the decimated Florida Marlins made the biggest drop of any
Series champion. Kevin Brown signed a dlrs 105 million contract.
The American League and National League combined for the
highest-scoring All-Star game _ at Coors Field, naturally.
	   The Milwaukee Brewers played in the NL, with their owner, Bud
Selig, taking ``acting'' off his title and giving the sport its
first commissioner since 1992. Fly balls landed in a swimming pool,
out in Phoenix.
	   Even in an expansion season, when things usually go wild, this
was more than anyone ever expected.
	   Instead, it was more fun to simply sit back and enjoy _ or stand
up and cheer _ the sights and sounds of 1998.
	   McGwire got it going on opening day, hitting a grand slam that
signaled the official beginning of the race for Roger Maris'
37-year-old record of 61 home runs.
	   Sosa joined the pursuit in June, setting a record with 20 home
runs in the month, and by Aug. 31 they were tied at 55.
	   McGwire reached the record first, hitting No. 62 at home in St.
Louis off the Cubs' Steve Trachsel on Sept. 8. The 341-foot
(102-meter) shot down the left-field line was McGwire's shortest of
the season.
	   At home plate, McGwire hoisted high his 10-year-old batboy son,
Matt. Moments later, Sosa ran in from right field to congratulate
his respected rival, and they exchanged their familiar greetings _
McGwire's fake punch to the stomach, Sosa's two-finger salute to
the crowd.
	   Sosa later caught McGwire at 66 home runs. But Sosa did not
connect again while McGwire hit four more, including No. 70 on his
final swing of the season. Sosa made out well, too. He reached the
postseason when the Cubs beat San Francisco in a playoff for the
wild-card spot and wound up topping McGwire for the NL MVP award.
	   When it came to teams, though, the Yankees were unbeatable.
	   Manager Joe Torre took a collection of players that lacked a
true superstar _ none of them were elected to start the All-Star
game _ and defined the team concept.
	   They overcame an 0-3 start and became the first team to clinch a
playoff spot in August. They set an AL record with 114 victories
and breezed to their 24th World Series title.
	   The Yanks won four straight from San Diego, no easy feat because
the Padres were the first team in the majors since 1993 to go
through a whole season without getting swept in a single series.
	   George Steinbrenner's club won its second title in three years,
and added to the debate: Were these Yankees the best team ever,
better than Ruth and Gehrig's '27 Yankees, the '06 Cubs and all
others?
	   ``I think that will probably be talked about forever,'' unlikely
Series MVP Scott Brosius said.
	   A record that may last forever was set by Ripken, who ended his
streak in late September. Telling his manager, ``I think the time
is right,'' the Baltimore third baseman took a day off for the
first time since 1982.
	   The 1997 champion Marlins, meanwhile, seemed to struggle every
day. After losing Brown, Moises Alou, Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield
and others, Florida finished with the worst record in the majors at
54-108.
	   Also in 1998:
	   _ Randy Johnson was traded from Seattle to Houston, then signed
with Arizona as a free agent. Albert Belle signed with Baltimore in
the offseason and Vaughn joined Anaheim.
	   _ Atlanta reached the NLCS for the seventh straight time, but
lost to the Padres. The Braves have won only one World Series in
that span.
	   _ Dennis Martinez set the career record for wins by a Latin
pitcher, breaking Juan Marichal's mark of 243 and finishing the
season with 245.
	   _ Ken Griffey Jr. and Greg Vaughn joined McGwire and Sosa in
giving the majors four 50-homer hitters in a season for the first
time.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Relations with the Palestinians are crumbling
and an agreement not to harm civilians along the Lebanese border is
collapsing _ just as Israel goes to elections over how to shape its
security into the next century.
	   Reflecting widespread security concerns, a bevy of retired
generals are among the candidates for prime minister. And each
seems to have different ideas about bringing peace to the country.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanese guerrillas showered towns on Israel's
northern border with Katyusha rockets, retaliation for an Israeli
air raid a day earlier that killed a woman and six of her seven
children. Israel vowed further retaliation.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Palestinian authorities released
the spiritual leader of Hamas, two months after placing him under
house arrest when a member of the militant Islamic movement
attempted to blow up a schoolbus full of Israeli children.
	   Israel accused its Palestinian partners and Lebanese enemies of
violating agreements.
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinians showed
bad faith by releasing Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   Yasser Arafat's government has ``conducted a high-profile policy
of ostensibly taking actions against Hamas ... but in reality,
quietly acquiescing to Hamas activities,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leaders are frustrated with a slowdown in Israel's
fulfillment of the peace accords reached in Wye River, Maryland, in
October, and have said they no longer feel totally bound by their
own promises.
	   Israel has frozen a number of its Wye commitments, including a
small pullback from the West Bank, accusing the Palestinians of
failing to contain anti-Israel violence.
	   Yassin, frail and confined to a wheelchair, said his release
showed that his movement _ which calls for the destruction of
Israel _ had triumphed over Wye.
	   `Today, after the sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is
inevitable that other voices will be heard,'' Yassin said as
enthralled followers showered him with kisses.
	   In the north, Israel accused the Hezbollah guerrilla movement of
breaking a two-year-old agreement to avoid attacks on civilians.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas countered that Israel had broken the
agreement with the deadly air raid on Tuesday.
	   In Baalbek, Lebanon, hundreds of mourners gathered Wednesday for
the funeral of Nada Othman and her children, aged 2 to 13.
	   ``Murderers must pay the price of their crimes,'' Hezbollah
said.
	   Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz expressed his
regrets and said the attack on the family home was the result of
pilot error. The target had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   He said Hezbollah's retaliatory rocket attack was inexcusable.
	   ``We reserve the right to decide when and where we will
respond,'' Mofaz said.
	   The rockets struck early Wednesday just as Israeli
schoolchildren were emerging from bomb shelters, where families had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack. Sixteen people
suffered light to moderate injuries.
	   The Katyusha attacks and Yassin's release came two days after
Israel's parliament voted to hold elections more than a year ahead
of schedule.
	   The early elections, expected by April, were prompted by
widespread opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Hard-liners in his governing coalition are angry with his Wye
concessions to Palestinians, while the dovish opposition says
Netanyahu is scuttling the agreement with his demands of the
Palestinians.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanon became an election issue as well. Dovish
legislators revived their claim that Israel's occupation in
southern Lebanon _ meant to protect northern villages _ is
counterproductive.
	   ``Staying there is a trap and, unfortunately, a death trap,''
said Labor legislator Yossi Beilin. ``Leaving there gives us a
chance.''
	   No less than three potential candidates toured northern border
towns Wednesday in their capacities as ministers in the outgoing
government _ but looking a lot more like campaigners.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu said, gladhanding
residents of Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react.''
	   Also touring were Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is
likely to challenge Netanyahu within their Likud Party, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who is likely to run for prime
minister as head of a small rightist party.
	   Mordechai and Eitan are former generals _ as are Netanyahu's two
likeliest challengers from the left: Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
and Amnon Shahak, a former military chief who is formally retiring
from the army on Thursday and who is likely to head a centrist
party.
	   The former military men represent the spectrum of Israeli
opinion, but their identical backgrounds reflect the
security-related anxieties among Israelis.
	   They also reflect a troubling attraction by voters to outsiders,
said Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi.
	   ``There is a despair of politics and politicians in Israel,''
Ezrahi told Israel television. ``It's not a symptom of healthy
democracy.''

U.N. accuses Angolan rebels of undermining peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council again accused
Angolan rebel leaders of undermining the peace process and demanded
an immediate end to fighting which has escalated over the past
month.
	   A statement adopted by consensus on Wednesday reaffirmed the
council's firm commitment to preserve Angola's unity and reiterated
that ``only a political settlement ... will bring a lasting peace
to Angola.''
	   Earlier this month, the council adopted a resolution blaming
renewed fighting on UNITA rebels and expressing dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation for most of its nearly quarter-century of
independence.
	   The statement, read by Bahrain's U.N. Ambassador Jassim Mohammed
Buallay, the current council president, reiterated that ``the
primary responsibility for the failure to achieve peace in Angola
clearly lies with the leadership of UNITA.''
	   ``The persistent violation by UNITA, under the leadership of Mr.
Jonas Savimbi, of its obligations ... has seriously undermined the
peace process,'' the council said.
	   A resumption of fighting this month between government forces
and UNITA rebels has sent more than 50,000 people fleeing from
their homes in the central highlands.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. It called for UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola _ to hand
areas under its control to the government. However, lingering
hostility between the two sides has hindered implementation of the
deal.
	   The council statement urged the government and UNITA to
cooperate with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
representative who is trying to revive the stalled peace process.
	   It expressed concern at public statements ``blaming the United
Nations for the recent aggravation of the security situation in the
country.'' It also expressed support for the U.N. Observer Mission,
which is charged with monitoring the 1994 accord.
	   The council expressed ``grave concern'' at reports that aircraft
were shot down over UNITA-controlled territory and demanded
cooperation from UNITA in investigating the incidents, including
the fate of the crews and passengers.
	   The Security Council also expressed deep concern at the
worsening humanitarian situation and emphasized the responsibility
of the government and rebel leaders to facilitate humanitarian
assistance. It urged the government and UNITA's leaders to respect
international laws on human rights, refugees and humanitarian
issues.

U.S. reaffirms that inspectors must play key role in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States reaffirmed to a divided
U.N. Security Council that U.N. weapons inspectors must play the
primary role in Iraq's future disarmament _ not Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   A Russian proposal before the council called for Annan to play a
larger role in dealings with Baghdad after last week's U.S.-British
airstrikes.
	   But the United States tabled amendments Wednesday asserting that
U.N. inspectors must be responsible for any assessments of the
situation on the ground in Iraq and any recommendations on
implementing council resolutions _ not the secretary-general.
	   The bombings fractured the council's unity and members have been
meeting for the past week trying to bridge the gaps, so far without
any success.
	   After Wednesday's meeting, Russia went off to draft a revised
statement, which will probably be discussed at a council meeting on
Monday. Under council rules, a presidential statement must be
adopted by consensus.
	   Council members appeared to agree on one point Wednesday _ that
the council itself must assume responsibility for future dealings
towards Iraq.
	   ``It was made clear by me and by others that the council must
not pass the buck,'' said Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock.
	   Three of the five permanent council members _ Russia, China and
France _ objected to the bombing campaign and have made clear they
want a new inspection mechanism, the lifting of sanctions against
Iraq and the ouster of chief inspector Richard Butler.
	   After the four-day bombing campaign ended, Iraq banned the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, from returning. Under the
cease-fire resolution ending the 1991 Persian Gulf War, UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency must verify that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated before sanctions,
including an oil embargo, can be lifted.
	   The proposed Russian statement didn't mention UNSCOM or the
IAEA. The U.S. amendments mention the inspection agencies
prominently.
	   ``We wanted to make sure that the core responsibilities for
UNSCOM and the IAEA were recognized,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh. ``Those are responsibilities for disarmament.''
	   The Russian draft would have the council encourage the
secretary-general ``to continue to play his part in promoting
humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy.'' The U.S. amendments
encourage him to promote humanitarian relief but eliminate any
reference to ``healing diplomacy.''
	   Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Yuriy V. Fedotov said Annan's
role in the crisis is one of three main pillars of Moscow's
proposal.
	   The presidential statement should assert that the council favors
political solutions to the Iraq crisis, that Annan ``must continue
to play his important and meaningful role in this crisis,'' and
that the council must decide how to implement council resolutions
on Iraq, Fedotov said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British entrepreneur Richard Branson and his
teammates passed Japan and floated over the Pacific on Thursday in
their attempt to circumnavigate the world in a balloon.
	   The trio headed to the United States in what ground control crew
say could be the most hazardous phase of the journey.
	   Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden were moving at about 125 mph (200 kph) at a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet (9,150 meters) early Thursday, ground
control crew said.
	   ``We are quietly confident that this next sector is going to be
OK,'' project director Mike Kendrick told SKY News on Wednesday
evening.
	   ``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate
that far out,'' Kendrick said.
	   He said ground crew are tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific should the balloonists
need help.
	   ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said Kendrick. ``We
are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which will give us a
good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.''
	   On Wednesday, the balloon floated over ancient sites in northern
China, then swept across the Yellow Sea after China bowed to
British appeals to let the balloon pass through prohibited
airspace.
	   Beijing had said the balloonists could cross southern China, but
the balloon drifted further north than planned because the trio
were navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed airspace
over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   After asking the balloonists to land, China later relented.
	   ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese
finally let us through,'' Branson said.
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside
Marrakech on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days
to nearly three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere
in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government forces and UNITA rebels fought
in Angola's central highlands, and aid workers said the army had
taken control of two rebel-held towns.
	   In Huambo province, 300 miles (500 kms) southeast of the capital
Luanda, battles were raging ``all over the place,'' according to
one aid worker who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The government has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of
Caala,'' the aid worker said, referring to two towns 25 miles (40
kms) from the city of Huambo.
	   The resumption of fighting this month has sent more than 50,000
people into Huambo. Stores in the city were empty because the
harvest had been destroyed by the fighting and the roads leading
into the city were unpassable, the aid worker said. The airport was
under military control but closed to commercial flights.
	   The World Food Program is planning to fly about 300 tons of food
into Huambo over the next two weeks.
	   The U.N. Security Council again accused Angolan rebel leaders
Wednesday of undermining the peace process and demanded an
immediate end to fighting which has escalated over the past month.
	   A statement adopted by consensus reaffirmed the council's firm
commitment to preserve Angola's unity and reiterated that ``only a
political settlement ... will bring a lasting peace to Angola.''
	   Another aid worker, speaking from Huambo on condition of
anonymity, said Namibian troops flew into the city two days ago.
The government had denied rebel claims that Zimbabwe and Namibia
have sent troops to support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Meanwhile, UNITA rebels continued their two-week-long siege of
the city of Kuito, capital of neighboring Bie province, 80 miles
(130 kms) east of Huambo. The Red Cross said 160 people were
wounded, some in serious condition.
	   The United Nations brokered a 1994 peace agreement between the
government and UNITA, but festering friction led to renewed clashes
in the diamond and oil-rich country.
	   Angola on Wednesday condemned the U.N. for its ``passivity and
complicity'' in face of UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994
accord.
	   The government said instead of disbanding its rebel forces,
UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _
has built up a 40,000-strong army equipped with ``armored vehicles,
long-range artillery and great firepower.''
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, said he understood the
government's disappointment but that negotiation was still the key
to peace.
	   ``We must think the solution to Angola's problem is compromise,
peace and dialogue,'' he told state radio Wednesday.
	   Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975
following the southwest African nation's independence from
Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in Angola's first elections and
returned to war.

Tokyo shares down after bank sell-off, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stocks, bond and dollar rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell moderately Thursday morning amid
worries about the health of the country's banks. The dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 55.61 points,
or 0.40 percent, to close the morning session at 13,723.84. On
Tuesday, the average closed down 373.50 points, or 2.64 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.64 yen in morning trading, down 1.44 yen
from its level of 117.08 late in Tokyo on Tuesday and below 115.96
yen late in New York on Wednesday.
	   Tokyo markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
	   Investors sold bank shares on fears that a recent drop in bond
prices would hurt profits, analysts said.
	   Bond prices tumbled Tuesday following the Japanese government's
announcement that it would issue new bonds to pay for massive
stimulus spending next fiscal year.
	   Profits from bond trading and investments have been one of the
only bright spots for many of Japan's debt-plagued banks and
traders worry that the fall in bond prices will wipe out many of
those gains.
	   Also, a cut in the ratings of seven Japanese banks Tuesday by
U.S. ratings agency Standard and Poor's was seen hurting share
prices.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 5.78 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,076.68. On
Tuesday the market closed down 16.66 points, or 1.52 percent, to
1,082.46.
	   Stocks fell despite a strong gain overnight on Wall Street.
	   There, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 157.57, or 1.7
percent, to close at 9,202.03, extending its gains to 411 points
over the past five sessions and nearing the Nov. 23 record of
9,374.27.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell from its level in New York
on Wednesday as banks sold the U.S. currency in thin trading.
	   Meanwhile, bond prices continued to slump amid worries the
government will flood the market with new bonds to cover its
growing budget deficit.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.930 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.900 percent,
pushing the price down to 98.95 yen from 99.19 yen.
	   The government has been going deeper into debt as it spends more
to kickstart economic growth.

U.N. concerned at intensified rebel attacks in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council expressed
concern at intensified rebel attacks in Sierra Leone and urged all
countries to abide by an arms embargo against rebel forces and
neighboring Liberia.
	   ``The members of the council expressed how imperative it is that
the rebels put an end to their atrocities,'' the council said
Wednesday in a non-binding press statement read by Bahrain's U.N.
Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay, the current council president.
	   The rebels are believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of rural villagers in a revenge campaign to widen their
influence through fear.
	   Council members condemned the participation of foreign forces on
the rebel side and expressed ``serious concern at the large number
of armaments flowing into the hands of the rebels in an organized
manner.''
	   The council reaffirmed its support for the government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and for the Nigerian-led West African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
	   ECOMOG troops drove Sierra Leone's military junta from power to
clear the way for Kabbah's return to power in March. Kabbah himself
was ousted from power in a May 1997 coup.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its rebel allies since
March.

Big fish in Blair's Cabinet resigns as home loan questioned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS pvs, UPDATING with press reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Peter Mandelson, credited with engineering Prime
Minister Tony Blair's election victory last year, resigned from the
Cabinet Wednesday over money he borrowed from a colleague to buy a
house.
	   His resignation came in the wake of a disclosure Tuesday by The
Guardian newspaper that he had borrowed 373,000 pounds (dlrs
627,000) in 1996 from fellow legislator Geoffrey Robinson.
	   Mandelson had not disclosed the loan, even though his own
department was investigating Robinson's business dealings.
	   One of Blair's closest confidants, he resigned after only 150
days as trade and industry secretary, saying that although he did
not consider he had done anything wrong, it was important that the
government be, and be seen to be, ``whiter than white, absolutely
squeaky clean.''
	   Robinson resigned as paymaster general at the Treasury hours
after Mandelson.
	   British newspapers quickly set about the task of dissecting the
turmoil Thursday.
	   Some said it was the Labor government's darkest day, and
predicted more damaging revelations to come. Others considered it a
more mild setback for Blair's administration and forecasted
Mandelson would return to the political forefront before too long.
	   The Sun, the country's biggest selling newspaper, ran the
headline ``Stuffed'' above a photo illustration of Mandelson's head
emerging from the neck of a Christmas turkey.
	   The Guardian's headline was a more optimistic ``Goodbye ... for
now.''
	   The Daily Telegraph said it was Blair's most shattering blow to
date.
	   ``The immediate shock to Tony Blair's government is severe, but
it must at least be given credit for a prompt resolution,'' added
The Financial Times in an editorial.
	   The Guardian said the resignations will prove that Blair's
government is serious about rooting out suspect behavior, even if
it can no longer claim to be immune from it in the first place.
	   The Express tabloid speculated on which political camp might
have been the source of the Guardian story and said ``the answer
may determine whether the episode is remembered merely as a jolt to
the government or a cataclysmic schism bringing down other major
figures in its wake.''
	   Robinson was controversial because of the way he used his
wealth, and sheltered it from taxes; Mandelson because of his power
and his closeness to Blair.
	   Labor has stumbled before on money matters. After Blair backed
an exemption for Formula One racing from a proposed European ban on
tobacco advertising in sport, it was disclosed that Formula One
boss Bernie Ecclestone gave the party a million pounds (dlrs 1.7
million) before the election. Labor refunded his contribution.
	   Derek Draper, a former sidekick of Mandelson, was fired from a
lobbying firm after journalists caught him boasting that he could
offer his paying clients access to powerful figures in government.
	   Mandelson was born to politics. His grandfather, Herbert
Morrison, was a member of Winston Churchill's war-time Cabinet and
briefly foreign secretary under Labor Prime Minister Clement
Attlee.
	   Mandelson won a seat in the House of Commons in 1992, and was
promoted to the Cabinet earlier this year.

China stores sperm for rare tiger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has set up a sperm bank to help in efforts
to artificially breed the South China tiger, an endangered species.
	   There are just 53 of the tigers left in Chinese zoos and nature
reserves, and only nine females of cub-bearing age, China's
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   So far, the facility has collected sperm from 30 tigers, the
report said. It did not provide further details about the program
or state where the sperm bank is located.
	   China set up a reserve for the tiger in October in the
southeastern province of Fujian and moved five of the animals there
from zoos.
	   A wild animal breeding center in Shanghai has a program to save
the tiger from extinction and is looking at ways to breed it,
Xinhua said in a report Tuesday.

Report: Bangkok residents will be short of tap water next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Half a million residents of Bangkok
will face a shortage of tap water starting in January when the
effects of a prolonged drought hit Thailand's capital, local media
reported Thursday.
	   The Metropolitan Water Authority said water levels at the
Bhumibol and Sirikit dams are expected to fall below levels
adequate to supply the capital's more than 7 million residents, the
Bangkok Post reported.
	   The shortages are expected to last for about six months, the MWA
said.
	   A sharp decrease in rainfall in the north and northeast sections
of country are responsible for the low water levels at the dams, it
said.
	   Farmers have been warned for months about the impending drought,
but until recently it was believed there would be little effect on
Bangkok.

Report: Thai opposition blasts government over riot police drill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Members of Thailand's main opposition
party have blasted the government for staging a riot police drill
on the grounds of Parliament, local media reported on Thursday.
	   Opposition lawmakers say the police exercise was intended to
intimidate peaceful protesters, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Upset with the drill, members of the New Aspiration Party took
turns delivering stinging attacks on the government of Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai during Wednesday's Parliament session, the
paper said.
	   Protesters of all shades and stripes regularly congregate in
front of the gates of the Parliament building in Bangkok. Thailand
is one of the freest nations in Southeast Asia, and its government
usually displays a high level of tolerance for dissent and
demonstrations.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset denied that the police
drill was meant to threaten protesters, the report said.
	   He did say, however, that it might have been staged amid
concerns demonstrators might close the road in front of Parliament,
as protesting sugar planters did last week.

Sabres 2, Lightning 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek
continued his December dominance, recording a 2-0 shutout Wednesday
night over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Brian Holzinger and Miroslav Satan scored for the Sabres, who
extended their unbeaten streak against the Lightning to nine games
(8-0-1), including a five-game winning streak.
	   Hasek made 38 saves, including 16 in the second period and 13 in
the third. Lightning goalie Bill Ranford made 20 saves.
	   Hasek recorded the 39th shutout of his career, and the 15th in
the month of December. He has three shutouts and an 8-1-1 record
this month.
 &UR; Devils 4, Blues 2 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Bobby Holik continued his recent
goal onslaught by scoring three times to lead surging New Jersey.
	   The hat trick was Holik's first in five years and third of his
nine-year career. It gave him 12 goals in the last 11 games and a
team-high 15 for the season.
	   Scott Niedermayer also scored and Martin Brodeur, who played
despite sore ribs, made 23 saves for the Devils, who have only lost
once in 11 games (7-1-3).
	   Pavol Demitra and Todd Gill scored for the Blues, who had a
three-game unbeaten streak snapped (2-0-1).
 &UR; Flyers 2, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, John LeClair scored his 22nd goal and set up Eric
Desjardins' game-winner early in the third period as Philadelphia
extended its unbeaten streak to six games.
	   The Flyers improved to 3-0-3 in their last six and halted
Boston's three-game winning streak.
	   Joe Thornton had a second-period goal for the Bruins.
	   Boston's Byron Dafoe, who entered the game with league's
fourth-best goals against, made 30 stops, including a number of
spectacular saves.
	   John Vanbiesbrouck stopped 28 shots for the Flyers.
 &UR; Capitals 4, Panthers 0 &QC; 
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Brian Bellows and Calle Johansson scored
power-play goals and Olaf Kolzig notched his third shutout for
Washington.
	   The loss deprived Florida of its first three-game winning streak
of the season and the Panthers finished off a season-long six-game
homestand at 3-2-1.
	   Kolzig finished with 29 saves for his 10th career shutout. He
made back-to-back spectacular saves at 12:30 of the second period
when he stopped Dave Gagner and Radek Dvorak.
 &UR; Hurricanes 1, Rangers 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Ray Sheppard scored his 14th goal of the season 38
seconds into the third period, and Arturs Irbe stopped 29 shots to
lead Carolina.
	   New York had just killed a penalty when Sheppard intercepted an
errant clearing pass at the right circle and beat Rangers
goaltender Mike Richter with a wrist shot high to the glove side.
	   Irbe registered his third shutout in the last six games and
fifth of the season, extending his lifetime total to 18.
	   Irbe made several key saves in the last minute of the game,
stopping Petr Nedved on a backhand rebound from point-blank range
with 25 seconds remaining.
 &UR; Stars 5, Maple Leafs 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Mike Modano scored three goals as Dallas snapped
Toronto's Leafs' three-game winning streak and extended its own
unbeaten run to 10 games.
	   Jere Lehtinen had three points, including a goal, while Brett
Hull scored the other goal and added an assist for Dallas, 7-0-3 in
its last 10.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ On a morale-boosting pre-Christmas visit, Defense
Secretary William Cohen brought pizzas, cheesecakes, candy and
entertainment to the U.S. forces who carried out the U.S. attacks
on Iraq.
	   But what the men and women really wanted Wednesday was to learn
more about their pay raise.
	   ``Give me the money!'' shouted a soldier at a raucous USO rally
at Camp Doha, the Army's main base on Iraq's doorstep.
	   Cohen took the opening.
	   ``We're gonna show you the money,'' he replied. And then, to
throaty roars, he described the Clinton administration's proposed
4.4 percent military pay raise with even bigger bonuses for some
officers and senior enlistees. And the tinsel on the tree? A
proposed shift in military pensions that would give those who
retire after 20 years up to half their pay instead of the current
40 percent.
	   Not everyone in the crowd of 2,000 soldiers was satisfied. When
Cohen mentioned 4.4 percent, someone yelled, ``We want 5 percent.''
Another responded, ``Cohen for president.''
	   Cohen and his entourage, which included his wife, lawmakers and
entertainers, made a quick trip to the region to offer thanks to
those who participated in the four-day Operation Desert Fox and in
the ongoing effort to contain Iraq.
	   First stop was Prince Sultan Air Base in the middle of the Saudi
desert. Pilots and mechanics took time out from running deny-flight
missions over southern Iraq to attend a gathering kept deliberately
low-key in light of the solemn Muslim holy month of Ramadan. After
the Saudis objected to a daytime concert during Ramadan, Cohen
agreed to forgo it at the airbase.
	   ``He gave up some of his Christmas to come out here,'' said
Tech. Sgt. Mark Honaker, dispatched here from Dyess Air Force Base,
Texas. ``They don't have to. We'd do the same mission if they
didn't.''
	   Aboard the USS Enterprise, free from the diplomatic
sensitivities of the Mideast, the Pentagon could let its hair down
at a concert given by Carole King, Mary Chapin Carpenter and David
Ball. Janet Langhart Cohen danced with Santa, a general and an
enlistee and dared her husband, the defense secretary, into taking
a spin.
	   ``He's the coolest secretary of defense,'' King said.
	   After a furious week in which the Enterprise played the key role
in the four days of airstrikes on Iraq, this was a welcome break.
The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, trying to get in on the
fun, pulled close alongside the Enterprise, its crew straining to
hear the music.
	   ``In my 20 years in the Navy, I've had two USO shows while I've
been on these carriers,'' said Navy Cmdr. Mike Reed.

Kotonishiki to try for third win in New Year's tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kotonishiki, the first sumo wrestler ever to win
two tournaments while ranked lower than junior champion, will go
for his third victory in the New Year's Grand Sumo Tournament
beginning in January.
	   The 30-year old wrester won the Emperor's Cup with a record of
14-1 in the November tournament, held in Fukuoka, western Japan.
	   Kotonishiki was promoted to the rank of komusubi (junior
champion, second class) from the No. 12 maegashira (senior
wrestler) position, according to rankings for the upcoming
tournament, announced Thursday by the Japan Sumo Association.
	   The 15-day tournament gets under way at Tokyo's Ryogoku Sumo
Arena beginning Jan. 10.
	   ``I didn't realize until I saw today's rankings how high I'd
been promoted. I was really happy,'' Kotonishiki said at a news
conference.
	   ``I always wrestle aiming to go higher,'' he added.
	   Kotonishiki won his only other title in 1991, when he was a
23-year-old No. 5-ranked maegashira.
	   Yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii,
will be back in the ring after sitting out the last tournament with
a back injury, the association said.
	   The first foreign-born wrestler to become a yokozuna, Akebono,
29, will be ranked as the east yokozuna, just below top-ranked
yokozuna Takanohana.
	   Takanohana ended the previous tournament with a 12-3 record.
	   Wakanohana, who was promoted to yokozuna in June and finished
9-6 in Fukuoka, will hold the top position on the west side.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, will retain his
east ozeki (champion) ranking. He finished the last tournament with
11 wins and four losses.
	   Fellow ozeki Takanonami will be ranked as the west side ozeki
after finishing with an 8-7 record.
	   Mongolian wrestler Kyokushuzan, or Batbayar Davaa, was promoted
to No. 8 from No. 12 after finishing with an 8-7 record.
	   The rankings are based on performance in the previous
tournament, with the east positions carrying more prestige than
those of the west.
	   In the 26-member juyo division, just below the makuuchi
division, Mongolian Kyokutenho was demoted to No. 6 from No. 2
after winding up with a 6-9 record. Hoshitango, or Imach Marcelo
Salomon, from Agentina, was promoted to No. 9 from No. 10 after
finishing at 8-7.
	   In the top junior division of makushita, American Kaishinzan, or
Henry Armstrong Miller, fell from No. 8 to No. 14 with a record of
4-3.
	   Hoshiandesu, or Jose Antonio Juarez of Argentina, fell to No. 19
from No. 5 after a record of 2-5 in the previous tourney.
	   Brazilian wrestler Wakaazume, or Yoshinobu Kuroda, fell to the
No. 30 from No. 11 after finishing with a 3-4 record.
	   Fellow Brazilian Azumakaze, or Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, fell
to No. 63 from No. 47, with a 4-3 record.
	   Kyokutenzan, or Enkhbat Batmunkha from Mongolia, rose to No. 34
from No. 56 with a 5-2 record.
	   Ryuko, or Luis Go Ikemori from Brazil, was promoted to No. 54 in
the makushita division after finishing the November tournament at
5-2 in sandanme.
	   In the lowest-ranked division of jonokuchi, South Korean
wrestler Kim Son Tek is making his first appearance in the
rankings.
	   Kuniazuma, or Vader Ramos of Brazil, is ranked No. 18. He did
not participate in the previous tournament.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions only have seven bouts during the
tournament.

	   In Chicago, Doug Gilmour scored twice and Tony Amonte notched
his league-leading 23rd in a four-goal second period for Chicago.
	   The Blackhawks snapped a five-game winless streak and three-game
losing streak in beating the Coyotes, who came into the game with
the second-best record in the NHL.
	   Rookie Todd White also scored for the Blackhawks, who connected
on four of nine second-period shots against Phoenix goaltender
Jimmy Waite to take a 4-2 lead. Chicago then held on thanks to
sharp third-period goaltending by Joceyln Thibault.
	   The Coyotes, who got two power-play goals from former Blackhawk
Jeremy Roenick and another power-play goal from Juha Ylonen,
outshot Chicago 35-17 for the game and 14-2 in the third period.
