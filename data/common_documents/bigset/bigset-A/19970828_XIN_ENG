<HEADLINE> Intel Designing More Powerful Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's leading chip
maker, is reportedly designing with Hewlett-Packard a computer
chip which would mark the most significant shift in the history of
the Intel microprocessor family.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that it is a top-secret
project code-named Merced, which is much more powerful than the
latest product of Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
The Merced, set for release within the next two years,
represents both opportunity and risk for Intel. It would use an
"instruction set" radically different from the one that has
evolved in Intel microprocessors, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The instruction set, etched into the chip's circuitry,
comprises hundreds of basic operations, like adding, subtracting,
multiplying and moving, which all other components and software in
the computer depend upon.
</P>
<P>
That change, it said, on top of the perhaps sevenfold increase
in the number of transistors packed onto the surface of the chip,
portends a greater transformation in the computer industry in the
next five years than in the preceding 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The first Intel personal computer chip in 1979 had 30,000
transistors; the most recent Pentium II has more than 7 million.
When it arrives, the Merced is expected to contain 20 million to
50 million transistors, according to a former member of the Intel
Pentium design team.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the chip will probably have a basic clock speed
of almost 1,000 megahertz -- more than twice the raw performance
of today's fastest chips. Moreover, the Merced will be 64-bit
microprocessor -- compared with the 32-bit limit of the current
Intel Pentium. That means the computer can process twice as much
information at once, promising much faster and complex searches of
data bases and more realistic audio and video multimedia
capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Pledges Strong Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
repeated his pledges that the planned single European currency,
the Euro, must meet the strict stability criteria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a construction project in Berlin today, Kohl
dismissed any suggestion that he would sacrifice the strength of
the Euro for the sake of the total European integration project.
</P>
<P>
"That is a price I will not pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added he would hold on to the Euro stability criteria and
its timetable.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is due to launch the Euro on January 1,
1999. Countries which want to join the club are required, among
other things, to bring their budget deficit and national debt to
less than 3 percent and 60 percent respectively of the gross
domestic product (GDP).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A seminar was held here today to
commemorate the brilliant military record of Su Yu, a former
high-ranking general in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is also chairman of the
Central Military Committee and general secretary of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, wrote an inscription for the
seminar, praising the general for his perfect command of the
military principles of Chairman Mao Zedong and his ability to use
surprise tactics to defeat enemies.
</P>
<P>

Japanese invaders, and later against Kuomintang reactionary
troops. He was promoted to the rank of major general of the PLA
after the founding of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian, and Chi Haotian, vice-chairmen of
the Central Military Committee, were among those attending the

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Ruling Party Rules out Mid-term Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami
(people's) League (AL) today ruled out the possibility of any
mid-term election in the country and said the opposition's talk
about such a poll was "uncalled-for".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a huge rally held here today, General Secretary of
the AL Zillur Rahman said that "We have been elected by the people
to serve them and we will leave office after completion of the
five-year term of our government."
</P>
<P>
Zillur Rahman alleged that the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) was trying to create anarchy and
disturbances in the name of agitation over the price hike of
petroleum products, which is "necessary" in view of the price
increase on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its allies enforced a countrywide general strike on
Sunday, in protest against the fuel price hike earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also chalked out a "tougher" program including a
protest march towards the Parliament on August 31.
</P>
<P>
"The government has proved to be complete failure in running
the state affairs and resolving people's problems in last 14
months," said the BNP chief Khaleda Zia, who also demanded a
mid-term election "at necessary time".
</P>
<P>
The AL took office on June 23 last year, following a triumph
over its arch rival BNP, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
in the general election last year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Finalizes Study on Aluminum Smelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has finalized an
assessment study of the socio-economic implications of a
proposed aluminum smelter project, the fourth to be operating in
the Arab world, Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Institute of Scientific Research charged with the
mission said a detailed study on the project was completed in
coordination with Kuwait Industrial Bank and the state-owned
Kuwait Industries Company which will carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
The project was planned to be built in Kuwait Shuaiba
industrial area. The plant will have a designed annual capacity
of 200,000 tonnes of aluminum at a cost of 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It would be the fourth aluminum smelting plant in the Arab
world following the first in Bahrain with an annual output
capacity of 460,000 tonnes, the second in the United Arab Emirates
with an annual capacity of 245,000 tonnes and the third in Egypt
with an annual output of 170,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Industries Company's vice chairman Nasser Naki said
the finalization of the study was an important achievement for
the "strategic" project which he said would significantly boost
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the project would lead to the establishment of a
series of side industries, promote the added value and the
balance of trade, in addition to its contribution to the
creation of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said it would play an important role in the country's
drive of diversification along with the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the presence of the project in Kuwait would also
help attract foreign investments which would as well help
attract modern technology.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Suggests Joint Search for Missing Saudi Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has suggested a joint
search with Saudi Arabia for a missing Saudi pilot lost in the
1991 Gulf war, an official spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Arabia, which sided with western powers against Iraq
in the war, has doubted Iraq's intentions behind the suggestion,
the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, Baghdad is still waiting for a
reply from Saudi Arabia to the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made at a time when Iraq has been seeking
rapprochement with neighbors, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraqi searchers looking for missing Kuwaitis
and Saudi Arabians lost during the war have spotted the wreckage
of a Saudi warplane. But the pilot was found missing, believed to
have died, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq informed Saudi Arabia immediately through the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and suggested
forming a technical team headed by an ICRC official and including
representatives from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Raps Israeli Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, one of the
heavyweights in the Arab world, today reiterated its strong
condenmation of the Israeli raids against south Lebanon, reports
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense
Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz said the raids were "Israeli crimes
against a peaceful people," according to official Saudi Press
Agency.
</P>
<P>
During its session Monday, which was chaired by King Fahd Bin
Abdel Aziz, the Saudi cabinet condemned the Israeli raids and
described them as "flagrant violation of international laws and
norms."
</P>
<P>
Israel has lately launched a wave of attacks against targets
in south Lebanon and its troops killed three Hezbollah (Party of
God) guerrillas Saturday in fierce clashes that included air raids
and artillery exchange.
</P>
<P>
The violence capped the worst week in south Lebanon's
cross-border violence since a cease-fire understanding between
Israel and Lebanon ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Israeli troops have held a border occupation in a
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985, in
defiance of U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The United States has agreed to grant 21 million
U.S. dollars in loans to help Lebanon combat the cultivation of
drugs and finance agricultural developments in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Daily Star reported Wednesday that the
loans will be mainly used in financing alternative crops in the
country's eastern Bekaa Valley where the drugs are grown.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's second most profitable bank Fransabank is
offering five percent of its shares for sale, the Daily Star
reported.
</P>
<P>
The offering, managed by the Beirut-based financial house,
Lebanon Invest, will add between 19.5 million to 21.6 million
U.S. dollars to Fransabank's unofficial capital of 59 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the offering marks a trend of shoring up capital
in a banking industry which is undergoing pressure to consolidate,
and diversify a funding base disproportionately dependent on high
yielding domestic treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The shares are open to foreign buyers, but it can not be
quickly traded because every transaction has to be approved by the
central bank and takes a relatively long settlement procedure.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The Tunisian government has offered a series of
privileges to foreign investment in Tunisia's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
These privileges include tax exemption of earnings and a
charge-free infrastructure for the piscinas or irrigation
projects, sources of the Tunisian agricultural
ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign firms in the Tunisian agricultural sector number
19.

<HEADLINE> Discrimination Suit Becomes Class Action in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge has
allowed a lawsuit, filed in Florida in March 1996 by minorities
to accuse Motel 6 of discriminating against minorities, to proceed
as a class action.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accuses the motel chain of refusing blacks and
other minorities rooms, giving them less desirable accommodations
and charging them higher rates, according to an Associated Press
report today.
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that as a matter of company policy, Motel 6
systematically discriminates against black guests and other
minorities. But the company said that it has never had a national
policy or practice which condones or tolerates discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the plaintiffs say there could be thousands who
might qualify for inclusion in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
A minority customer, Charles Boxley, said he and his fiancee
were told no rooms were available at a Baytown, Texas, Motel 6 in
March. But they found a white family checked in after them without
reservation.
</P>
<P>
Another customer, LaDonna Williams, said she and her family had
made telephone reservations for three nights at a Motel 6 in
Salinas, California, in July 1996 and been quoted a price of 26.99
dollars a night. When they arrived at the hotel, the clerk
insisted they pay 29.99 dollars in advance for all three nights.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of their stay, their luggage was taken out of
the room and they were told they had to leave because the room had
been rented to someone else.
</P>
<P>
The court battle began when two black sheriff's detectives
charged that in March 1994 they had been denied a room at the
Punta Gorda Motel 6 because of their race, the new agency said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: World Bank to Strengthen Role in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will dispatch
more staff to its resident mission in China and seek an enhanced
role in the country's rapid economic growth, a senior World Bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
The staff assigned by the Washington-based headquarters will
increase to 16 from the present level of 6-7 in two years, while
more local competent people will be hired, Yukon Huang, director
of China Program and chief of the Resident Mission in China, told
Xinhua here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang, an American national educated in Yale University, was
assigned to this new post in July after serving the World Bank for
over 20 years, including three years as director of the Country
Department III. He plans to leave for Beijing in late October.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is empowered to make 80 percent of the relevant
decisions, a privilege his predecessors did not enjoy. The change
came within the framework of the "Strategic Compact" introduced in
the world financial institution last year to improve its work
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will continue to provide assistance for China's
infrastructure, while seeking closer cooperation with the Chinese
on social, poverty and environmental fields, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, The World Bank approved loans totaling
27.973 billion U.S. dollars for 184 projects in China, according
to figures released by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of these projects are performing well as they
(the Chinese) are more careful and more focusing on doing
something," Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the World Bank will pay more attention to
the central and interior parts of China, believed to be less
developed in comparison with the coastal region.
</P>
<P>
He said he had traveled to Hunan Province to "symbolically show
that the bank is going to do more lending in the central and
interior provinces."
</P>
<P>
As the soft loans from the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm, is
phasing out for China, and the Mission in China will concentrate
on fewer, better and more available projects, the new Mission
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country which can afford and should afford more
substantially for doing a lot in the social, poverty and
environmental areas," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is going to discuss with the Chinese authorities on
what the World Bank could do to share their social obligations in
terms of reemployment, housing and training.
</P>
<P>
"We are offering various options for Chinese enterprises,
private and state-run alike, to improve their competitiveness,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He believed China will overcome the difficulties it faces at
this stage and sustain rapid economic growth in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"It will not because what they have right now is perfect. It
will because the confidence or what happened in the last 20 years
show they are also responsive to changes of circumstances," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not see the possibility that the World Bank
programs in China would be affected by ups and downs in the
Sino-U.S. relations.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Anatoly
Karpov of Russia wrapped up his first simultaneous games of the
China tour against six local women players with four wins and two
draws here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Russian was challenged by half a dozen Chinese
top women nationals except Xie Jun, former women world champion,
in the friendly exhibition. The time limit was two hours.
</P>
<P>
The experienced grandmaster underlined his world champion
status by beating the Chinese with ease. He first got better of
Zhu Chen, world youth champion, and then rolled over Wang Ping,
Qin Kanying and Xu Yuhua soon.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Lei and Ning Chunhong posed some opposition to the
world champion and finished their games with draws.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Karpov highly appraised the Chinese girls,
especially Wang Lei and Ning Chunhong, who quickly attacked the
errors he made.
</P>
<P>
Karpov will play against 16 Chinese junior players
simultaneously on August 30.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Conflict Breeds Crime: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Delinquency is associated with
family discord, poor parental supervision and harsh or erratic
discipline, said a report today, calling for support for the
family in order to cut crime.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the National Association for the Care and
Resettlement of Offenders, said that evidence suggests a link
between broken homes and delinquency, but children brought up by
loving lone parents may be less likely to offend than those raised
by feuding couples.
</P>
<P>
The report surveyed more than 5,300 UK children born in 1946
and found that they were much more likely to commit serious
offenses if their parents separated before they were four, and
rates of offending were twice those among children whose parents
stayed together.
</P>
<P>
However, this only applied to children whose parents separated
because of conflict as offending rose only slightly among those
who lost a parent through death or long-term hospitalization, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
"A strategy to target the needs of young families will do far
more to cut crime than tough sentencing, tagging, curfews or more
prisons," said Paul Cavadino, principal officer of the
association.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Protocol Signed to Improve TAZARA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China, Tanzania and Zambia today
signed a new technical cooperation protocol here to improve the
operation of the Tanzania-Zambia railway authorities known as
TAZARA.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangxiang, visiting Assistant Minister of the Chinese Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Ministry, Zambia's Acting
Transport Minister, Mines Minister Christon Tembo and Tanzanian
Transport Minister William Kusila signed the protocol separately
on behalf of their own government.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the protocol they held a tripartite talks on
how to continue the cooperation, improve management and
efficiency and enhance competitiveness of the 1860-kilometre
railway.
</P>
<P>
In the talks Tembo expressed his gratude to China for its
persistent technical and financial assistance to TAZARA and said
that Zambia and Tanzania is committed to improving its management
and operation and ensure its survival and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Kusila said that TAZARA is currently operating in a very
competivie environment which calls for aggressive marketing,
adminstering competitive tariffs and improving efficiency in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister said that one of the problems facing
the TAZARA is poor management, which has led to the poor
operational performance of the railway.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangxiang briefed the participants on the implementation
of the phase-eight technical cooperation, which will expires at
the end of this year, and made suggestions for the next phase
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the low traffic has been a serious handicap on the
railway's way of growth.
</P>
<P>
A change in poitical and economic situation in recent years in
southern Africa and the subsequent battle for market share
among various sources and modes of transportation combined with a
year-on-year decline in Zambian copper production have reduced the
annual traffic of the TAZARA, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun stressed the importance of better management and bringing
the existing equipment into full play.
</P>
<P>
He called for improved rail service and a target-based
manangement responsibility system, the more effective and
vigorous rules and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Halves UK Apple Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Severe spring frosts and summer
hail storms have wiped out about half of Britain's apple crop and
UK apple growers are facing the worst harvest for 63 years, said
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a normal annual crop of English apples is
about 300,000 tons, but this year the harvest is not expected to
exceed 150,000.
</P>
<P>
Output of traditional English apples, such as Cox and Bramley,
which account for the bulk of the crop, is estimated to be down
48 percent and 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of UK apple consumption is supplied by home
production in a good year.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Barlow, chairman of the English Cox Campaign, said the
crop outlook was the worst since 1934, the last time that orchards
were hit by such severe frosts, and many small producers could go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
Apple growers issued an appeal for help to consumers Tuesday
and asked people to stand by the industry and pay extra for the
fruit which has survived.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices are expected to be about 69 pence a pound, 40
percent higher than last year.

<HEADLINE> Solar Energy to Be Used in Zimbabwe to Ease Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has identified more
than 15 projects for funding under the World Solar Program (WSP)
in Paris to ease rural energy problems, a senior Zimbabwean
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore said the Zimbabwe
Solar Program 1996-2005 had prepared the projects with the
assistance of U.N. Development Program (UNDP) which would seek to
resolve energy problems in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he officially opened a one-day
national stakeholders consultation workshop on the Zimbabwe Solar
Program (ZSP).
</P>
<P>
Stakeholders in the ZSP, he said, should work together to
ensure more bankable projects were developed for use in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The program, to which the projects would be submited, was
adopted in June this year by the World Solar Commission chaired
by President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
''The important role that energy plays in the economic
development of any nation cannot be over-emphasised,'' said
Xhikowore, adding, ''There can be no meaningful development
without appropriate energy services.''
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of Zimbabwe's estimated 12.4 million
people living in rural areas depend on firewood and other
traditional fuels for their basic energy needs, resulting in
widespread environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is keen to promote wide scale
development and utilisation of renewable energy technologies to
promote sustainable development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Workshop participants noted that solar energy played a major
role in providing appropriate forms of energy that help to
stimulate economic growth through small-scale industries, thereby
curbing rural-urban drift.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people from the private sector, government
ministries and individuals attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Agrees to Pay Ex-Combatants Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
agreed to award a monthly tax-free pension of 2,000 Zimbabwe
Dollars (173 U.S.Dollars) to every war veteran and a lump sum
gratuity of 50,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (4,300 U.S.Dollars) as
recongnition for the sacrifices ex-combatants made in the fight
for the liberation of the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Leaders of the Zimbabwe Liberation War
 Veterans Association today, President Robert Mugabe told the
leaders of the association
that the cabinet had also agreed to extend free education and
health services to war veterans, their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
At a five-hour meeting Mugabe called to brief the war veterans
of the response from the cabinet to the demands they presented to
him last Thursday, Mugabe, who is patron of the War Veterans
Association, said the government had agreed that ex-combatants
should be given priority in the allocation of houses built by the
government in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the monthly pension and gratuity, Mugabe said
the cabinet agreed with the war veterans on the figure of 2,000
Zimbabwe Dollars per individual, but said it is impossible for
the government to find the money to pay 500,000 Zimbabwe Dollars
gratuity demanded by the ex-combatants for every former freedom
fighter.
</P>
<P>
''We don ot have that kind of money,''he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, Zimbabwe's former freedom figthters held
demonstrations and resorted to picketing ruling ZANU (pf) party
and government offices, including the presidential residence,
demanding the government to pay their pension and gratuity.

<HEADLINE> Togolese President Asked to Mediate in Angola's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
requested Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema to
mediate in the Angolan peace process, the official Angola News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Eyadema, Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos
expressed the hope that the Togolese president would persuade the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) leader
Jonas Savimbi to offer more serious cooperation in the implementation
of the peace agreement, the report revealed.
</P>
<P>
The letter was passed on to Eyadema by Angola's Deputy
Minister of Interior Garcia Miala during his meeting with the
Togolese president in Lome, capital of Togo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Miala told the Angola News Agency that the
Angolan government hoped that President Eyadema would provide
valuable cooperation in resolving the Angolan conflicts because
he is not only rich in mediation experience but
also having maintained good personal relations with UNITA leader
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the Angolan peace process is in a
delicate situation, with some provisions of the Lusaka Peace
Agreement still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Angolan President Dos Santos asked President
Eyadema to meet Savimbi to find out what the UNITA thinks at
present, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
President Eyadema promised to do his best to help Angola
defuse the existing dangers which will rekindle the flame of war,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides Togo, Miala will also visit Cote d'Ivoire, Zimbabwe,
Zambia and the Central Africa Republic to present Dos Santos'
letters to the presidents of these countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Workers Most Productive in Europe: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Nissan's UK car plant has toppled
General Motors' factory at Eisenach in Germany from its place as
Europe's most productive car factory.
</P>
<P>
A study of productivity among European car companies by the
Economist Intelligence Unit confirmed the resurgence of motor
manufacturing in Britain thanks mainly to the Japanese investment.
</P>
<P>
The British car factory worker, once a joke around the world,
is now among the most efficient in the industry, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
The Nissan plant at Sunderland, which began the Japanese
investment 10 years ago, knocked General Motors' off the top of
the European car makers' productivity table last year.
</P>
<P>
Each of Nissan's 4,100 workers on Wearside made an average of
73.2 vehicles per employee last year, easily outstripping the 67.7
for GM's older factory.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's Burnaston factory in Derbyshire, England moved up to
third place from seventh in 1995, with output per employee
climbing from 52.1 vehicles in 1995 to 66.9 last year.
</P>
<P>
Honda's Swindon factory in southern England retained fourth
place.
</P>
<P>
However, the huge gulf in efficiency between Japanese car
plants built over the past decade in the UK and longer established
British car factories shows little sign of diminishing.
</P>
<P>
The study showed Rover's biggest manufacturing plant, at
Longbridge near Birmingham, declining to 19th place near the
bottom of the league table, with the Unit describing productivity
as "generally poor."
</P>
<P>
The average Longbridge employee turned out just 28.2 cars last
year, although the survey admitted that by the end of 1996 the
rate was back up to 35 cars following the introduction of new
models.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the study will provide ammunition for
supporters of Britain as a manufacturing base for foreign
investors, in spite of the sharp rise in the value of sterling.

He is also accused of concocting a pretense for traveling to
Dallas on official business by scheduling a meeting with a local
USDA investigator "for the purpose of justifying his presence" in
that city.
</P>
<P>
Espy also was charged of ordering the employee to delete
references to Tyson, his girlfriend, and the football game when
his travel itinerary for that day was requested by the USDA's
inspector general.

<P>
Espy resigned in December 1994, three months after an
independent counsel began his investigation. A former Mississippi
congressman, Espy has denied any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of all 39 charges and sentenced consecutively, he
could face a jail term of more than 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Ukraine Take Two Gold Each at Universiade Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MESSINA, Sicily, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Ukraine each took
two gold medals on the second day of the swimming tournament at the
University Games on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Igor Snitko of Ukraine claimed the gold medal of the men's 800
meters freestyle at a time of 8:05.13. Luiz Eduardo Lima of Brazil
won his country the first swimming medal at the games as he finished
second at 8:06.26. Marco Formentini of Italy snatched the bronze
medal at 8:06.37.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's second gold of the day came from Denis Silantvev who won
the men's 200 meters butterfly at 1:59.67. Jeffrey E. Julian of the
United States came home second at 2:00.49, followed by Przemyslaw
Pietucha of Canada in the third place at 2:00.66.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion and defending Universiade champion Penelope
Heyns of South Africa put up such a disappointing performance in the
women's 200 meters breaststroke that she finished only fourth in her
speciality.
</P>
<P>
No one would like to believe that Heyns could be so bad. Her time
of 2:32.13 was 5.15 seconds behind the Universiade record she set two
years ago at Fukuoka.
</P>
<P>
The event was won by Masami Tanaka of Japan who was timed at
2:30.24. Svitlana Bondarenko of Ukraine took the silver medal at
2:30.99 and the bronze medal went to Lenka Manhalova of Czech Republic
at 2:31.38.
</P>
<P>
Tatsuya Kinugsa added one gold to Japan's tally by winning the
men's 400 meters individual medley at 4:24.18. He was followed by
Michael Halika of Israel at 4:24.96. Stefano Battistelli of Italy was
third in 4:25.66.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday's competitions witnessed the fall of first
Universiade swimming record when Martina Moravcova of Slovakia clocked
a winning time of 1:59.96 in the women's 200 meters freestyle final.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 2:00.34 was set by Connie van Bentum of the
Netherlands at Kobe, Japan, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Kimberly A. Black of the United States finished behind Moravcova
for the silver medal while Luminita Dobrescu of Romania was third at
2:02.76.
</P>
<P>
The last event of Wednesday's swimming competitions was men's 4X200
meters freestyle relay. The American quartet led all the way to take
home the gold at 7:26.78. France and Germany each won their first
swimming medal by finishing second and third respectively.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Disagrees with Using Force in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said today it would not
give nod to the use of force to reverse the coup in Sierra Leone
that toppled the legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Military action in Sierra Leone would be "a little more
complicated", said Ghana's deputy foreign minister, adding that
"when we get to that stage, we will cross it."
</P>
<P>
However, he said if the United Nations is involved, Ghana will
follow the leadership of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"And we hope that it won't come to that. We do not wish to be
involved in an exercise that will lead to the lose of lives in an
African country," he said, quoted by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
BBC did not say where the Ghanaian deputy foreign minister had
made the remarks, but foreign ministers of the member states of
the Economic Community of West African countries (ECOWAS) are
meeting in Abuja, capital of Nigeria to prepare for the ECOWAS
summit scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
West African countries have been trying to reinstate Sierra
Leone's ousted civilian government with a combination of three
measures -- dialogue, sanctions and the use of force since the
military seized power in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
To date, dialogue and sanctions have failed while the use of
force has not be taken up due to the split among member countries
of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has expressed its support to any measures
that might be taken by ECOWAS to restore the legitimate
government of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ECOWAS member countries will meet at a summit
tomorrow in the Nigerian capital of Abuja to decide what is to be
done to this end.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Development of relations with
China in the political, economic and other fields is Russia's
priority foreign policy, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Vice Chairman of the Central Military
Commission of China Liu Huaqing, Chernomyrdin expressed
satisfaction with the development of Russian-Chinese relations.
"The Russian-Chinese relations in all fields are in good state and
they are better than any time before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted that very good relations have taken shape
between the top leaders of the two countries. "It plays an active
role in promoting Russian-Chinese relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is making serious preparation for the forthcoming visit
of President Boris Yeltsin to Beijing, which will carry the
friendly relations between the two countries to a new stage, the
Russian premier said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, for his part, said the Chinese government and
leadership attach importance to the development of Chinese-Russian
relations of friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian leaders raised the bilateral relations
to a new stage with the creation of the strategic partnership
between the two countries oriented towards the 21st century, Liu
said. The further development of Chinese-Russian relations has a
constructive meaning to peace and stability in the two countries
and to the two peoples, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Liu Huaqing conveyed cordial greetings from
Chairman Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Chernomyrdin
passed cordial greetings through Liu Huaqing to Chairman Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin meanwhile expressed best wishes to the Chinese
leadership on the upcoming convening of the 15th congress of the
Chinese Communist Party. He told Liu, "We wish you greater
successes in developing the economy and raising the people's
living level."
</P>
<P>
Later today, Chinese Ambassador in Moscow Li Fenglin, in the
name of Liu Huaqing, held a return banquet at the Chinese embassy

<HEADLINE> Chirac Renews Demand for Taking Over NATO Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today renewed his demand for the taking over by Europeans of the
Naples-based Southern Command of NATO, which is now commanded by
an American admiral.
</P>
<P>
At a conference of French ambassadors stationed abroad, Chirac
said, "The Southern Command should be, in future, confided to a
European."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that France will not return to the integrated
military structure of NATO unless the Southern Command is handed
over to Europeans by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"It is the function of progress which will be realized in this
direction, and without letting ourselves closed in any timetable,
that France will determine its future relation with NATO," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that the renovation of NATO, which was signed at the
Madrid summit of the trans-Atlantic military alliance in July,
"has cleared a big step toward the affirmation of the European
identity of defense" by NATO.
</P>
<P>
"But this affirmation of European identity should still go
ahead by a better sharing of responsibilities between Europeans
and Americans in the military structure of the organization,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The United States has categorically rejected the French demand
for the handing over of the Southern Command, because the U.S.
Navy's Sixth Fleet makes up part of the NATO regional force.

PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today proposed that France and the United States make a joint
initiative in the Middle East to save the peace process from dying
out completely.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed his hope to improve relations with

engaged in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that the Mediterranean region should be a
place of "peace, stability and development."
</P>
<P>
"France is a Mediterranean power. It should first maintain with
the Magreb countries a model relationship. This is the case with
Morocco and Tunisia. It should be the case -- I hope -- with

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Fresh Fighting between Somali Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Renewed intermittent clashes
between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) at Gurunjis village, 8 km south
of Baidoa Tuesday resulted in the death of at least 13 people.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu today quoted RRA spokesman Mohamud Ali
Aden Qalinle as accusing the forces of Hussein Aidid of provoking
their militiamen at Gurunjis village and attacking their base
with 21 battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle added that the 21 battle wagons of Hussein Aidid's men
have attacked their base from two directions, nine on one
direction and 12 on the other side.
</P>
<P>
The radio which supports Ali Mahdi, leader of north Mogadishu
claimed that the RRA forces have courageously defended their base
and destroyed two of what the spokesman called the enemy battle
wagons.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle admitted that his forces have lost two men while three
others sustained gun wounds during the two days' fighting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also claimed that his forces have confiscated 21
assault rifles from Hussein Aidid's men during the fighting and
maintained control of their base.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet, however, from Hussein Aidid's side over
the fighting. Hussein Aidid is leader of the South Mogadishu
faction pitting his forces against those of Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fresh clashes are reported to have broken out at
Dhiil Village and its surroundings, 32 km north of Huddor town
this morning, with casualties still unknown. According to
Qalinle, his forces have driven Hussein Aidid's men out of the
village, inflicting heavy losses on them.
</P>
<P>
This is the third round of fighting between the opposing sides
in the village located near the mountain land which is strategic
for the defense of Bakol region controlled by Hussein Aidid's men
since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Egyptian delegation led by Marwan Badri,
Assistant Foreign Secretary for the African Affairs, arrived
in Mogadishu today in a bid to mediate the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The four-member delegation will meet Hussein Aidid's faction
to discuss issues concerning reconciliation efforts in Somalia
during its two-day visit and it is also expected to visit north
Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> France Adapts Itself to Changes in Africa: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today that France is "adapting" itself and its defense
agreements with African countries to the big changes going on in
the black continent, but France will stay on in Africa as a
"primary partner."
</P>
<P>
"France plans, more than ever, to be present and active in
Africa, in fidelity, openness and modernity," Chirac told French
ambassadors stationed abroad at a conference in his presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of France has announced a plan to
reduce thousands of French troops stationed in Africa and close
its military bases in the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
This came in the wake of a series of conflicts taking place in
French-speaking African countries this year -- former Zaire, the
Congo Republic and the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
"The recent crises have accelerated a real taking of conscience
of the need for Africans to take into their own hands the solving
of their difficulties," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed France's decision not to interfere in the
internal affairs of African countries through either political or
military means.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Urged to Stop Selling Chocolate-Covered Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The attorneys general in
Minnesota and Connecticut today urged the candy giant Nestle to
stop selling chocolate-covered toys, fearing that the new
product may cause choking or death.
</P>
<P>
"This illegal product literally sugarcoats potential death and
injury -- wrapping in chocolate small toys that may cause choking
or worse," the Associated Press reported, citing what Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III said officials
were asking Nestle to "take all steps necessary to protect our
kids" and pull Nestle Magic from the market, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Last month Nestle began selling a ball of chocolate wrapped
around toy figures of Disney movie characters. Although health
officials have not found any safety problems in the candy, the
government said companies may race out candies that are a threat.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Chicago company had to recall 5,000 chocolate eggs
after the government determined that the eggs pose a serious risk
that young children will choke on toy figures hidden inside.
</P>
<P>
The toys come in pieces that children are supposed to fit
together. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the
pieces were so small that young children could easily choke.
</P>
<P>
The commission on Monday advised parents who have bought the
Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs to take the toys away from children
under three.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Expresses Displeasure Over Dini's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today called his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi to
voice his displeasure over the statements by the country's
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that
Greece had called for the retraction of the statements at the
highest diplomatic level.
</P>
<P>
Dini reportedly said earlier Tuesday after his talks with
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in Rome that there were two
governments in Cyprus, namely the Greek Cypriot government and the
Turkish Cypriot government in the north of the island.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that
Dini's statements had no relation to existing reality, U.N.
resolutions, European Union (EU) decisions and the positions of
all Italian governments to date.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that Athens regarded the Cyprus problem and the
Cyprus-EU accession talks as "crucial issues" for Greece's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the relations between Greece and Italy would go
through "a crisis" if Rome followed a policy that opposed the EU
policy on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which
has only been recognized by Ankara.

MESSINA, Sicily, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China won its second gold
medal at the University Games diving tournament through Zhu Jinhong in
the women's 3-meter springboard on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who took part in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, totalled 507.57
points for the title. Lu Haisong, who won the women's 1-meter
springboard for China on Monday, finished second at 493.47, followed
by veteran Mexican Maria Jo Alcala Izguerra in the third place at
479.40.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jinhong suffered from a slow start in the preliminaries and was
nearly eliminated as she only qualified for the semi-finals as the
17th placed diver.
</P>
<P>
But in the afternoon's semi-finals, Zhu turned to the best diver as
she collected a total of 210.09 points from 5 dives.
</P>
<P>
In the evening's final, Zhu maintained her form well and scored a
match-high of 69.72 points from her fourth dive, a backword two and a
half samersaults at pike position.
</P>
<P>
Lu Haisong, who led after the third dive in the final, faulted with
her fourth dive and got only 52.20 points.
</P>
<P>
Though Zhu Jinhong chose an easier dive with lower degree of
difficulty in the last round, she still managed to get 51.75 points
for a winning total of 507.57.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Bureau of Job
Allocation and the International Labor Organization (ILO)
declared jointly today that an occupational education program for
the disbanded soldiers will be implemented this September.
</P>
<P>
The program is to cater for the demobilized soldiers with
occupational skills for better job choices, according to reports
from the Angola News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Charles Doucet, coordinator of the program, told the agency
that the program is targeted mainly at working out efficient
measures for the demobilized soldiers so as to maintain stability
in society.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen vacational education centers are to be set up
nationwide. Altogether seven majors including auto-mechanic,
carpenter, plumber and tailer are served to former soldiers with
different talent and schooling for a period of five months to 30
months.
</P>
<P>
The program is funded by United Nations Development Program,
with ILO providing the disbanded soldiers with working equipment
after their education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are about 100,000 demobilized army
men or fighters from the warring sides in Angola, most of whom
are poorly educated with few working skills.

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all reversed their recent declining trend and ended in the
positive ground today, ignoring Wall Street's weakness while
boosted by the dollar's rebound.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market closed 20.6 points higher
above the key 4,900-level at 4,906.9 although off the day's highs
and trading volumes were thin as many investors were still deterred
by recent extreme volatility.
</P>
<P>
An upturn in the futures market provided enough lift to push
the FTSE 100 back into positive territory after it slipped earlier
in thin trade.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended higher, within sight of the
4,000-point level after tumbling nearly 2.8 percent on Tuesday,
supported by dollar strength which is good for exporters.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index closed a quiet session with a rise of 36.33
points to stand at 3,995.66.
</P>
<P>
French stocks retreated early in the day along with New York,
and reacted to concerns over interest rates ahead of Thursday's
Franco-German meeting. However, the strengthening of the dollar
made the market rose sharply in late trading.

The market wiped out its morning losses and managed to finish
up 2.44 points at 2,871.7 on the CAC-40 index.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ottawa, Quebec in War of Words over Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unity minister Stephane
Dion has fired off another volley of words at Quebec's separatist
government in an emotional debate over the province's future.
</P>
<P>
In his latest letter to the Quebec government, Canadian
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion warned that
Quebec's unilateral secession from Canada would be not only
illegal, but impossible.
</P>
<P>
"Without the support of the Canadian government, a declaration
of independence would not be recognized by the international
community," Dion wrote in the four-page letter, which was
published today.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1945, no state created by secession has been admitted to
the United Nations without the approval of the government of the
predecessor state," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion "is not
allowed to speak for the international community."
</P>
<P>
"He can speak for himself, maybe for the federal government but
surely not for the world," Bouchard told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The letter was Dion's second within two weeks in an blistering
exchange of words between Ottawa and the French-speaking province,
which has been threatening to form a country of its own.
</P>
<P>
The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard
sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing
to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes.
</P>
<P>
In his first letter to Premier Bouchard, the unity minister
warned that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"Neither you nor I nor anyone else can predict that the borders
of an independent Quebec would be those now guaranteed by the
Canadian Constitution," Dion wrote.
</P>
<P>
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some
English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said
they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from
the country.
</P>
<P>
Dion also asserted that Quebec cannot simply decide
unilaterally to separate from the Canadian federation.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the notion that 50-percent-plus-one majority Yes
vote would be suffice for the province to leave Canada.
</P>
<P>
To this, Quebec deputy premier Bernard Landry shot back with a
letter, denouncing Dion's letter as anti-democratic and an attempt
to "change the rules of the game."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the latest letter-writings by Dion suggest
that Ottawa is warming up for another showdown with Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare
that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful.
The case is scheduled to begin this fall.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Quebec will hold a provincial
election next year. If Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois win, the
election would be very likely to be followed by another referendum
on Quebec's future.
</P>
<P>
"We are heading towards a new referendum, and there's going to
be more heat," predicted Professor Benoit Pelletier of the
University of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
There is already speculation that Ottawa is toughening its
stance on Quebec, focusing less on the so-called "Plan A", which
involves reconciliation, and more on "Plan B", which stresses
"rules of secession."

</P>
<P>
Gama made the statement to the press in Praia today after
concluding his visit to Cape Verde.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Independent Commission of Experts Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The total cost of the Independent
Commission of Experts for the 1997-2001 period has been
reestimated at 22 million Swiss francs (about 14.7 million US
dollars), resulting in a deficit of 17 million Swiss francs (about
11.4 million US dollars), according to a statement issued today in
Bern by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Parliament in December 1996 authorized the commission
a 5-million-franc loan for a five-year duration to carry out its
research. But it has been determined that the actual cost for
1997-2001 will exceed that figure. Therefore the Swiss Federal
Council (government) will have to propose to Parliament to
authorize an additional loan of 17 million Swiss francs with the
1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The the mandate of the commission, created on December 13,
1996, is more comprehensive and complex than originally assumed.
Around 30 researchers will be hired in total. Another dozen work
under mandate contracts for the commission. Since launching its
work last March, the commission has evaluated sources available in
Switzerland and interviewed people who are said to have witnessed
Switzerland's role in World War Two. The commission will also try
to examine relevant information abroad in cooperation with foreign
researchers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ECOWAS Summit to Dwell on S. Leone: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders will begin a
summit to work for the resolution on the Sierra Leonean crisis
and the future of the sub-region, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi said today.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) will be "a historic meeting" which "ushers in peace for
Liberia and will test our ability to fight to restore peace to
Sierra Leone," said Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
Opening an ECOWAS foreign ministers meeting in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, Ikimi said the two-day summit starting Thursday will
be seen mainly addressing the issue of Sierra Leone, which is a
big challenge for the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It will also look into the future of the west African
peace-keeping force in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the meetings which have taken place earlier
among the chiefs of staff of our sub-region will give us the
further insights of how we shall deal with this subject matter as
peace and security are very crucial to our sub-region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers meeting began this morning to make
preparations for the coming summit. Before it, the planning
ministers of ECOWAS member countries have met to discuss the
economic future of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Equally, chiefs of staff have been deliberating on the
restructuring and training of Liberia's security forces as well
as the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
At press time, heads of state have arrived from Liberia,
Burkina Faso, Togo, Mali, Benin, Guinea, the Gambia and Guinea
Bissau. And ousted Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who represents Sierra
Leone, also arrived.
</P>
<P>
While more heads of state are expected to come later tonight,
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings will arrive tomorrow morning,
according to a Nigerian Television Authority report.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a Liberian president of an elected
government attended an ECOWAS summit since 1990 following the
outbreak of the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, the 16-member sub-regional economic bloc, has faced
with political crisis at all its meetings since 1990 and has to
dwell largely on the issue of conflict in one of its member
country.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureate Praises China's Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nobel laureate Merton H. Miller
recently lauded China's highly successly macroeconomic control
policies.
</P>
<P>
"What has impressed me most is that China has effectively
reduced inflation. The great success has been felt by all, even by
people in Chicago, " said Miller, a professor at University of
Chicago."
</P>
<P>
The Nobel laureate, who is attending the Ninth PACAP Finance in
Shanghai, also expressed confidence that China's economy will
continue to grow at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the conference, Professor Miller advanced the
idea of establishing a global clearing house for futures trading
in order to reduce trading costs and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Shanghai is rapidly becoming a
major financial center of China and will soon become both a
regional and international center of finance. Hong Kong and
Shanghai will play their respective roles in China's economic
development, said the professor.
</P>
<P>
"China's financial sector has recorded remarkable progress, but
still has a long way to go. Many things must be accomplished,
especially the establishment of a legal framework," said Miller,
adding that China has a contingent of fine economists and he hopes
to have more opportunities to join them in exchanging ideas.
</P>
<P>
Miller, 82, has visited China six times and has maintained
close link with experts in China's economic community.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Hongjun, president of Shanghai Institute of
International Finance, Miller has accepted an invitation to become
the institute's honorary president.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urged to Draft Framework for Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
has been urged to formulate an international framework convention
on tobacco control by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The framework should focus on tobacco smuggling and
advertising, pricing and taxation, testing and reporting of toxic
constituents in tobacco products, and various other
tobacco-related issues, according to a resolution passed at
today's closing session of the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or
Health.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the aforementioned issues are closely
related to the continuous growth in tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
"Preparatory work for the framework has already started," said
WHO director-general Hiroshi Nakajima. "Hopefully, the support of
member countries will ensure its approval by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
Drafting of the framework convention was a major topic of
discussion during the conference.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the conference said that major tobacco
companies are using intensive sale promotions to increase their
sales volumes amongst women and young people.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for an international call for tobacco
control due to the fact that tobacco advertising is crossing via
satellite television and the Internet," said Dr. Konrad Jamrozik
from the University of Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
Allyn L. Taylor, from the U.S. Columbia University School of
Law, said that nonbinding resolutions and voluntary arrangements
will most likely be probably prove inadequate for controlling the
practices of the tobacco industry practices due to the sector's
intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Expanded Cotton Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
has urged various areas to improve and stabilize state cotton
marketing policies and further expand reform of the cotton
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a National Cotton Conference which concluded
yesterday, the vice-premier said that policies and measures should
be adopted to encourage textile enterprises to use more
domestically-produced cotton and strive to strike balance between
cotton supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference convened by the State Council focused on
analyzing cotton production and this year's supply and demand, in
addition to planning for cotton purchase and supply in 1997 and
cotton production in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, noted
that the contradiction of cotton supply exceeding demand has been
alleviated nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cotton is a strategic commodity which is a major
source of the rural income. Therefore, the state should continue to
control the marketing, management and price of cotton.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged various areas to further expand reform
of the cotton supply system and develop cotton trade markets. He
also called for efforts to readjust layout of cotton plantations.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Deploys Troops to Prevent Serb Police Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) said today that it has deployed troops in
northeastern Bosnia to prevent possible clashes between rival Serb
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR received indications Wednesday night that there could
be a potential confrontation between police loyal to Serb
President Biljana Plavsic and those supporting other Serb leaders,
said SPOR spokesman Major Chris Riley.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the SPOR American-led division based in Tuzla
deployed troops in the areas of their responsibility early this
morning "as a prudent measure in order to have the ability to
respond to violence should they occur," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
The SPOR spokesman refused to confirm reports that American
troops deployed to the Brcko police station came under attack and
were forced to retreat by hundreds of angry Serbs who threw stones
at them.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Brcko was "fluid and continue to develop," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Riley, later interviewed on BBC radio, admitted that one
American soldier was slightly wounded and the troops used tear gas
to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
According to a UN spokesman, the local station of UN
international police monitors in Brcko was attacked early this
morning, with several windows smashed and 15 vehicles damaged. Two
police monitors were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Office of High Representative said that
there was an attempt by police loyal to Plavsic to take over
police stations in the northeastern part of the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
The OHR called both sides of the conflict not to resort to
violence to solve their difference.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Operation Against Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has mounted a
blanket operation against illegal immigration and arrested 82
people, the Government Information Services reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the arrested, 24 were suspected illegal immigrants, and
the others were caught for aiding or abetting overstay. The
operation was jointly launched by the Police, the Immigration
Department and the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman reiterated today that there was no
question of any amnesty for illegal immigrants, who would be
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
"Our latest operation should drive home the point that there
will be no change to this policy. Anyone foolish enough to believe
otherwise is only cheating oneself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from continuous checks throughout the city, police will
maintain a high state of vigilance both at the land and sea
borders, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During the 24-hour operation that ended on Wednesday morning,
the police stopped more than 7,000 persons, 144 vehicles and
nearly 500 vessels for identification checks. Immigration
investigators and labor inspectors visited thousands of
establishments to weed out illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, employers could be fined up to 350,000 HK
dollars (45,000 US dollars) and jailed for three years if they
employ illegal immigrants.

HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An officer of the Hong Kong
Examination Authority (HKEA), who admitted having leaked exam
papers, was sentenced today by a district court to perform 220
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
Mak Cheung-wah, 42, was also ordered by the Eastern Court to
pay 10,000 HK dollars (1,280 US dollars) for court costs.

Education Examination (HKCEE), to have access to exam papers and
marking schemes.
</P>

The matter was discovered by members of the marking panel, who
found that the answers given by Mak's son in the HKCEE were
strikingly similar to those in the marking schemes.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) conducted
an investigation into the case involving leakage of exam papers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-two percent of South
Korea's top 50 conglomerates are in the process of restructuring
or planning to do so to overcome their management difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Trade-Investment Promotion Agency said in a
survey of the 50 conglomerates said that restructuring is focused
on debt reduction, financial structural improvement, subsidiary
realignment, employee layoffs, rational investments, and mergers
and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring is considered by the conglomerates as a
counter-measure to cope with the nationwide economic trouble.
</P>
<P>
At least seven conglomerates including Hanbo, Sammi and Kia
have gone bankrupt or semi-insolvent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts by these conglomerates were also prompted by the
government-initiated policies on structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said that 96 percent of conglomerates admitted
that excessive business expansion is harmful.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Party Congress to Highlight Deng's Legacy (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of major economic reform measures, similar to the
experimental steps in the reform of state businesses and the form
of public ownership, are expected to follow the convening of the
15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Various fields have never been subject to significant reforms
and, therefore, some doubts and difficulties are inevitable.
Disputes on issues such as the use of foreign funds, private
businesses, and the appropriate proportion for the state sector in
the entire national economy, etc.
</P>
<P>
Hence, various contradictions and doubts must be solved and a
common understanding must be reached within the Party concerning
Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chungui, vice-president of the Party School, said: "the
most pressing matter rests with quelling any type of disturbances,
avoid senseless abstract debates and silly manoeuvring."
</P>
<P>
China faces both heated challenge and precious opportunities
both at home and abroad at the turn of the century. "China has all
the favorable conditions necessary for accelerated development,"
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, agreed that China's predicted economic upsurge will
exert great influence across the world.
</P>
<P>
"However, it will not be an easy job," Hu said, adding that "We
should actively respond to all aspects of major challenges. The
only wise and historical option is to proceed in accordance with
China's unique situation, continue to emancipate our minds and
squarely meet all challenges."

SHANGHAI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai in east China leads
the nation with 500,000 mobile phone subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents dramatic growth on the city's 300,000
mobile phone users in 1996 and 100,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has invested more than three billion yuan in the
development of its local mobile communications sector since 1992
when it had a mere 10,000 mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of the local mobile communications
network is expected to increase to one million lines from present
800,000 lines by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local mobile communications networks are now linked to other
similar networks nationwide in 31 provinces, regions and
municipalities. The local "139" network currently offers roaming

<HEADLINE> Australia Says One-China Policy Vital to Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- One-China policy will continue
to be a fundamental element of the relationship between Australia
and China and Australia's economic and trade ties with Taiwan will
be pursued within the framework of the one-China policy, Australia
said today.
</P>
<P>
In its first white paper on foreign affairs and trade released
today, the Australian government said China will remain one of
Australia's key ties in the next 15 years and its approach to
China will be based on shared interests and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Those principles provide the basis for a realistic framework
for the conduct of the relationship, offer the best prospects to
maximize shared economic interests, advance Australia's political
and strategic interests, and manage differences in a sensible and
practical way, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 92-page white paper, released by Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, said Australia and
China have important economic interests in common and that the
Australian government seeks an expanding economic partnership with
a rapidly-growing China.
</P>
<P>
China has been one of the major buyers of Australia's mineral
products, wool and farm products, and Australia has been China's
single largest overseas investment destination.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise trade exports will also continue to grow as China's
economy expands, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has been growing at about 10 percent annually
during the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"China is likely to be among the three or four largest
economies in the world in 15 years, and to be integrated into the
international economy through multilateral and regional mechanisms
such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and APEC," the white
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia continues to support China's accession to the WTO on
appropriate terms," the document said.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth and integration is to be welcomed,
which could enhance the prosperity and stability of the region,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Political and economic relations between the two countries have
been expanding rapidly following Prime Minister John Howard's
China visit earlier this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The small opposition Democratic
Party (DP) of South Korea appointed Seoul Mayor Cho Soon as party
president at its national convention held here today.
</P>
<P>
The appointment came two weeks after the Mayor declared his bid
for presidency in the December elections on DP's ticket.
</P>
<P>
Cho is the fourth contender to join the presidential race
following ruling party Chairman Lee Hoi-chang and two major
opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
"I will make sure my appointment as party president leads to a
victory in the vote, and then I will steer the nation's economy in
the right direction," said Cho.
</P>
<P>
He assured his supporters that he will try his best to campaign
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Cho, a former deputy prime minister for economic affairs under
former president Roh Tae-woo, also promised that he will try hard
to change the tiny DP into a nationally-recognized political force
by admitting new party members from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
According to recent public opinion surveys, Cho is enjoying a
relatively high supporting rate, closely behind the front-runner
Kim Dae-jung from the major opposition National Congress for New
Politics.
</P>
<P>
Cho, who was elected Seoul Mayor in local elections two years
ago, must resign from the post before September 19, the deadline
for presidential candidates to give up their official posts.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Party Congress to Highlight Deng's Legacy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) is just around the corner and
speeches by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, has repeatedly raised the issue of "holding high the
banner".
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical issue that relates to the Party's orientation
and image and has a great bearing on the future and fate of
socialism," Jiang was quoted as saying in a May 29 speech at the
Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The "banner" Jiang referred to is the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics set forth by China's late
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Party, particularly the high-ranking officials,
must unswervingly hold high the banner of Deng's theory with a
high degree of consciousness and firmness, and we must never alter
our position no matter the difficulties and risks which might
arise," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Veteran political analysts in Beijing note that Jiang's speech
concerning the banner issue actually conveys the main concepts of
a keynote political report he will present at the forthcoming
15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
One analyst said: "It is also a political manifesto the
third generation of CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core,
after the death of Deng Xiaoping, is presenting to the
entire world."
</P>
<P>
Another analyst commented that the CPC has always attached
utmost importance to the issue of "banner". The late Chairman Mao
Zedong, one of the founders of the CPC and the People's
Republic of China, once said: "A doctrine is just like the banner
(of a party)."
</P>
<P>
Beginning with its birth in 1921, the CPC adopted Marxism as
its banner, with Mao Zedong thought added to the banner during the
Seventh National Party Congress in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee in
1978 and through the Party's 12th, 13th and 14th national
congresses, the Party has again expanded the banner with Deng
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, Augest 28 (Xinhua) -- The ancient city of Changsha, a
city with a history of over 2,500 years in central China's Hunan
province, has stressed the protection of its traditional features
during its modernization process.
</P>
<P>
The renovation of old districts in many of China's ancient
cities often conflicts with the protection of historical and
cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the city's Mayor Qin Guangrong, Changsha
will exert every effort to coordinate related protection and build
a city with both a modern economy and traditional cultural
features.
</P>
<P>
"History, traditions and culture are like the soul of a city,
and any city would lose its attractiveness with the loss of
traditional features," said Qin.
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted that all the new construction projects in
Changsha will be required to give full consideration to protecting
traditional local features.
</P>
<P>
"Changsha is the only city in China, which has remained in the
same location throughout its history," said Qin, adding that the
histories of numerous cultural heritages have left their imprint
and made Changsha a unique city representing the regional culture
of Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, was amongst the first
group of cities the State Council listed as famous historical and
cultural ancient cities in China.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today announced various measures, including
stopping the lending of securities, to prevent foreign funds from
driving down the local stock market through manipulative
short-selling.
</P>
<P>
The government would take stern action against anyone found
doing anything against the interest of the country, Mahathir told
local editors here.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had evidence that these foreign funds,
including those managed by American financier George Soros, had
shifted their attention from the foreign exchange to the equities
market in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Local institutions and private investors "willing to join the
government" have been asked to buy actively on the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE).
</P>
<P>
There would be "no limit" to the buying-in and billions of
ringgit would be committed in this exercise if necessary, Mahathir
said, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
These actions, coupled with the "delivery before sale" ruling
governing the 100 stocks which make up the market's benchmark
Composite Index (CI) which took effect this morning, are expected
to have a massive impact against the manipulators.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he accepted having open markets and foreign
participation in the markets. "I even accept speculation in the
share market but I will not accept manipulation of the market," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Today, the CI plunged 35.74 points to 812.18 under continued
selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the situation had reached a point where there was
a total dichotomy between the share market and the profitability
of the companies whose shares were listed on the KLSE.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the "delivery before sale" ruling announced
Wednesday might have caused share prices to drop, the same result
would have been seen within two weeks or less if no action had
been taken.
</P>
<P>
While the actions being taken might "make some people unhappy
with us, we are going to see this through," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to allow these people to manipulate our
economy as if they have a right to have a free ride on us," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government's actions were justified because
when something legal was abused, it was the responsibility of the
government to make it illegal. "My view is that this level of
manipulation must be made illegal," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Malaysian investors to enter the market and
revive the stock exchange and said that prices were now so
attractive that local shares would be a good investment, just for
their dividend yield even if capital gains were overlooked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's ringgit took a fresh beating today,
hitting its all-time low of 2.8800 in another volatile and
cautious bout of trading today.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit closed at 2.8850/00 against the U.S. dollar today,
a plunge of 590 points against Wednesday's close of 2.8260/10.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank employees in India's
capital New Delhi today started a two-day strike paralyzing all
the banking activities in the city.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU)
to force the government among other things to withdraw an
"illegal" clause in pension regulations denying the benefit to
employees for "participation in strike".
</P>
<P>
Banking operations across the country came to a standstill
today as nearly 1.5 million employees of the country's banks
stopped work on the first day of the two-day strike in support of
their demands, Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The striking employees took out processions and held
demonstrations in various parts of the country. In a statement in
Calcutta, the UFBU said that the strike was "complete, total and
peaceful".

NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the

</P>
<P>

absence of any support even from domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Calls for Continued Efforts for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 28 (Xinhua) --Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos noted, at a press conference here today, that peace in
Angola can surely be maintained if all parties make their own
efforts for peace.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Angolan government will continue
to work for peace till the Lusaka peace accord is
completely implemented and peace is finally realized in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to today's United Nations Security Council meeting
on Angolan peace, the Angolan president said that the world
community will adopt a harder position toward the Angolan former
rebel UNITA ( the national union for the total indepence of
Angola ) for flouting the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the proposed U.N.sanctions against UNITA, Dos
Santos said the U.N. Security Council decided to impose
sanctions against UNITA to force it to observe the Lusaka accord,
adding that If UNITA can implement the peace accord and fulfill
its obligations, the sanctions will probably never take effect.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council member states agreed informally on
Wednesday to impose an air and travel ban on UNITA for its
failure to live up with the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> New Medicine Helps Smokers Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A new nicotine-free medicine has
proved highly effective in helping smokers quit smoking, according
a British scientist's comments at an ongoing international
conference.
</P>
<P>
Professor Martin Jarvis, representative from the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, said that clinical applications show that
the medicine -- Bupropion -- enhances the efficacy of NRT
(nicotine replacement treatment).
</P>
<P>
Jarvis told participants in the 10th World Conference on
Tobacco or Health that Bupropion's effectiveness appears within
four weeks, a much shorter period than for NRT patches. However,
he noted that a combination of the two will further boost the
efficacy of treatment.
</P>
<P>
NRT's are widely used to ease nicotine dependency. To replace
cigarettes and lessen the discomfort involved in the process of
smoking cessation, NRT's provide a safe level of nicotine in the
form of chewing gum, patches, or nasal spray.
</P>
<P>
Bupropion is also used as an anti-depressant, and was licensed
for smoking cessation treatment this year in the United States,
according to Professor Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
He added the new medicine has high prospects as a new
generation of smoking cessation drug since it effectively eases
discomfort when smokers attempt to drop the habit.
</P>
<P>
However, Jarvis pointed out the effects of drugs are quite
limited in terms of smoking cessation. A person who really wants
to quit smoking must have determination combined with behavioral
intervention and drug therapy.

Theorists from the Party School of the CPC Central Committee
pointed out that Jiang's references to the "issue of banner" are
based on cross-century historic heights which display the keen
acumen of Marxism, as well as the courage, resourcefulness,
boldness and vision of a proletarian statesman.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's speech was a brilliant exposition on China's prospects
and fate," according to Wang Jiaqiu, vice-president of the Party
School. "The speech, which was profound in thought and replete
with deep theoretic deliberations, truly reflects the CPC's new
understanding and development as it explores the law on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Japan's "Yomiuri News" published an article noting that
Jiang's speech points out that further reform and opening-up offer
China promising prospects for development. The article added that
this approach represents an excellent trend for a world yearning
for a stable and developing China.
</P>
<P>
However, emphasizing the "issue of banner" also necessitates
reaching a common understanding. Opinions both at home and abroad
are in unanimous agreement that China's economic situation is on
the verge of a major turning point.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Deploys Troops to Prevent Possible Serb Police Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Stablization Force
(SFOR) said today it has deployed troops in the northeastern part
of Bosnia to prevent possible clashes between rival Serb policemen.
</P>
<P>
SFOR received indications last night that there could be a
potential confrontation between the policemen loyal to Serb
president Biljana Plavsic and those supporting other Serb leaders,
said SFOR spokesman Major Chris Riley.
</P>
<P>
SFOR's American-led division based in Tuzla deployed troops
this morning "as a prudent measure in order to have the ability to
respond to violences should they occur," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR spokesman refused to confirm reports that American
troops deployed to the Brcko police station came under attack and
were forced to retreat when hundreds of angry Serbs threw stones
at them.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Brcko was "fluid and continues to develop," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. spokesman, the U.N. international police
monitors' station in Brcko was attacked early this morning, with
several windows smashed and 15 vehicles damaged. Two police
monitors were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Office of High Representative said that
there was an attempt by the policemen loyal to Plavsic to take
over rival-controlled police stations in the northeastern part of
the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
He urged both sides of the conflict not to resort to violence
in solving their differences.

<HEADLINE> Countries Urged to Stop Using Tobacco Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and all
countries in the world were urged today to stop using tobacco,
according to a resolution adopted at a world conference here today.
</P>
<P>
They should list tobacco as a harmful substance and try to stop
produce and consume it, according to one of the resolutions,
passed at the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health, which
closed in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Another resolution suggested the World Health Organization (WHO)
work out an international framework convention on smoking control
to reduce the global hazards, caused by tobacco, Prof. Niu Rushi,
vice-president of the academic committee of the conference
announced on the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco would become a major threat to people's health along
with HIV/AIDS by the year 2025, if no effective measures were
taken on tobacco control," said Judith Mackay, a senior WHO
official and director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control,
who described the conference as an "enormous success."
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the theme of "Tobacco: the Growing
Epidemic" has attracted about 750 Chinese delegates and more than
950 delegates from overseas countries and regions, which were the
biggest numbers among all the previous conferences.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference discussed the tobacco
epidemiology, tobacco control, cessation, tobacco with youth and
women, tobacco economics, and laws and international conventions
on tobacco control during the five-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference has provided not only a good forum for the
international personnel on smoking control, but also a precious
opportunity for China to gain more insights in this field, said
secretary-general of the conference Prof. Liu Rushan.
</P>
<P>
"The conference, the first of its kind held in a developing
country, has seen a remarkable increase in the numbers of
delegates from the developing countries and of women delegates,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Albert Hirsch, chairman of 9th World Conference on Tobacco
and Health, announced that the next conference will be held in
Chicago in August, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zones Lead South China Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Three of China's five special
economic zones have begun experimenting with the socialist market
economy as the preferential State policies that were exclusively
theirs are being granted to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou in Guangdong
province have been making the leap to economic reforms to try to
maintain their economic development lead.
</P>
<P>
The three had a combined GDP of 146 billion yuan last year,
which had increased more than the national average, and exports of
26.3 billion US dollars, 18 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
They took the lead in introducing a modern enterprise system to
the lumbering state sector. Shenzhen has completely separated
administration from enterprise operations by setting up state
assets management institutions. Assets of state enterprises grew
from 50 billion yuan in 1992 to 132 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai has organized 19 enterprise groups that have more than a
billion yuan in annual sales each in an effort to improve
competition.
</P>
<P>
The three cities have also adopted a wage system for chairmen
and general managers of companies, in which they have full
financial responsibility for losses. Pilot work has begun on a
system in which employees own shares of their own enterprises, and
a reform of the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was China's first special economic zone. It began this
year to allow overseas-funded enterprises to be treated just as
Chinese companies are. It also simplified checking procedures at
ports last year by adopting internationally accepted
practices. After that, the other two zones followed suit.
</P>
<P>
The cities were also the first to set up a social security
system, providing coverage for medical care, retirement benefits,
on-the-job injuries, and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
And they have opened five free-trade zones, one third of the
total for the entire country, to use more overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> New Head of French Secret Police Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The new head of the French secret
police the Direction of Surveillance of Territory (DST),
Jean-Jacques Pascal, will focus his work on the protection of
financial information from foreign espionage and the fight against
terrorism perpetuated by Islamic extremists in France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said today that Pascal, 54, who was
nominated this week by President Jacques Chirac as the new chief
of DST, was no stranger to the world of spies because he was head
of another major French intelligence department, the Renseignement
Generaux (RG), from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since the fall of the Berlin Wall,
economic espionage has become the new major threat to France,
against which French counter-espionage agents are charged to fight.
</P>
<P>
Even the allies of France are relentlessly trying to obtain
information from French enterprises in the sensitive sectors such
as electronics, aeronautics and information, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign companies are trying to obtain financial
information about these enterprises to decide their "hostile
take-over bid," said the report.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the French government has banned some
aeronautics companies from selling their aircraft parts to
foreigners, in order not to let France's aeronautics technologies
fall into the hands of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
In operations against terrorism, the DST is in charge of
collecting information abroad on potential sources of terrorist
attacks against France, while the RG, now headed by Yves Bertrand,
a close friend of Pascal's, is in charge of searching Islamic
extremists' networks in France.
</P>
<P>
The last major operation by the DST abroad was the arrest of
international terrorist Carlos in Sudan by French agents in
mid-August, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian Islamic militant groups, which claimed
responsibility for the bombing of an RER underground train in
Paris last December, are one of the major headaches of French
intelligence services.

German Federal Minister for the Environment Dr. Angela Merkel
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on global environmental protection, and
discussed Sino-German environmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour meeting, Xie briefed Merkel on measures
China has adopted and progress the country has made in
environmental protection. He said that China has strengthened its
legal system and launched a large-scale battle against pollution.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that China will increase funding, rigorously enforce
environmental laws and regulations, and extend the greatest
possible efforts to develop science and technology for
environmental protection during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Xie expressed the hope that Merkel's visit will enhance
understanding between the two sides, and promote cooperation in
environmental protection between the two countries to a higher
plateau. He noted that China and Germany have a vast range of
prospects for cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
Merkel expressed great interest in China's environmental
protection work and spoke highly of the country's efforts to fight
pollution. She said Germany is willing to cooperate fully with
China.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also discussed a unified stand during an
international environmental conference scheduled for December in

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Review Report on Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's economic and social
development gained impetus in the first seven months of the year,
according to members of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing a report on the economic situation so far this year,
NPC Standing Committee members Wu Shuqing and Liu Suinian noted
China has achieved a reasonably fast rate of economic development
and a low inflation rate in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
After a "soft landing" of the economy made possible by effective
macro-control measures taken last year, the national economy has
grown rapidly in 1997, they said.
</P>
<P>
China reported another successful summer grain harvest this
year. The country's economic structure has improved, imports and
exports have increased rapidly, prices are stable and income of
urban and rural residents has also increased, they added.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinhua, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that "it
is inspiring to hear that China's western areas are taking in more
and more investment from the central government and other
localities in the country, with a growth rate of 10.5 percentage
points higher than the areas in the east."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu urged that a flexible, preferential policy be
worked out to promote more investment in the western region.
</P>
<P>
Participants also expressed their worries over the money-losing
state enterprises and unemployment, saying that many of
the issues in China's economy now are closely related to
enterprises, particularly the state businesses.
</P>
<P>
The key to the state enterprises lies in "separating daily
operations from administration," they stressed. Some of the
participants suggested that a share-holding system or a
share-holding cooperation system be introduced.

to 500 million dollars in the second.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises have

money-makers in the first half of the year, according to a report
jointly issued today by the State Statistics Bureau, the State
Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
</P>

TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro

a coming new era.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar in Tokyo, Hashimoto outlined his

</P>
<P>
His speech came just a few days before his planned four-day

</P>
<P>
Referring to China's concern about the Japan-U.S. security
alliance, Hashimoto called for more bilateral talks between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Both Japan and the United States consider it extremely
important that China plays an affirmative and constructive role in
promoting stability and prosperity in the Asia and Pacific region,
and in this regard, we should further deepen cooperation with
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Hashimoto reiterated that the Japanese
government fully understands and respects China's stance that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, a position
clearly described in the 1972 Japan-China joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's position is consistent and we will hold fast to
it in the future as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Hashimoto said his country is ready
to make further contributions toward China's economic development,
especially in the fields of environment, energy, trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also repeated Japan's support for China's bid to
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"China's entry is extremely desirable not only for the country
itself but also for the development of the world economy and
international order," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Foreigners from Running Theatrical Troupes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Culture,
hoping to maintain order in the culture market, announced here
today that at present, China will not allow the establishment of
equity, contractual joint venture or solely overseas-funded
theatrical troupes, performing venues and broking institutions.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the ministry explained that, according to the
newly issued set of regulations on the management of commercial
performances, overseas investment is allowed in renovating and
setting up theaters but those investors can not participate in
operating the performing business and management.
</P>
<P>
If artists from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
Macao, or Taiwan, or from foreign countries want to give
commercial performances, Chinese broking institutions will
undertake to take care of them, she said.
</P>
<P>
This aims at further flourishing cultural undertakings, she
stressed, adding that China will continue to increase cultural
exchanges with foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
She said that commercial performance has become the main form
of China's theatrical shows. And some people worship money so
stage shows cater to mediocre and vulgar tastes, and some actors
and actresses ask for high fees for performances and some avoid
paying taxes, she added.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations are the first attempt to restore order on
the stage in China and they stipulate that all performances should
adhere to the policy of serving the people and socialism. Also
prohibited are shows that might endanger state security and social
stability, promote division among ethnic groups, or spread
pornography, superstition, or violence.
</P>
<P>
China has 57,000 theatrical troupes and 400 broking agencies
providing services and information in the field.

</P>
<P>
The four-day event is designed to help Chinese schools and

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Further Accelerated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's dazzling economic
take-off has turned the country into a more urbanized society, as
the number of cities increased to 666 and the urban population hit
208.22 million in 1996, according to the latest survey results
from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The ongoing urbanization trend has resulted in a 39 percent
increase in the number of cities over the figure in 1991, the SSB
report said.
</P>
<P>
Among those newly-established cities, mid-sized cities
registered the fastest growth, with the number growing to 298 in
1996 from 121 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Such a rapid growth of mid-sized cities reflects the Chinese
government's tight control over the development of big cities, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gap was further widened between the urbanization
level in the east and west, as the number of cities increased by
9.3 percent annually in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's cities together generated a
GDP of 4.7 trillion yuan (about 567.1 billion U.S. dollars) in
1996, accounting for 68.6 percent of the total in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the per capita GDP reached 9,236 yuan (about 1,112
U.S. dollars) in urban areas, which is 3,697 yuan higher than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, about one third of urban residents worked in the
tertiary industry, contributing 37.2 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China in 1992, the infrastructure facilities have been largely
improved in the cities, with the proportion of afforested land
expanded from 2.8 percent in 1991 to the present 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that China's cities will absorb 68 million
migrant workers over the next 10 years, as well as an additional
200 million residents from rural areas, which also will swell city
population totals.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Exchanges Across Taiwan Straits Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cultural exchanges across Taiwan
Straits kept growing in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
There were 108 groups with some 1,300 people altogether from
the two sides that visited each other during the period, staging
performances, giving exhibitions, or holding seminars and
symposiums.
</P>
<P>
307 people on Taiwan visited the mainland, an increase of 73
percent from the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Troupes of performers accounted for a large proportion of the
exchanges, which were warmly received by people from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Cultural training is another major form of exchange. A teaching
program sponsored by the Beijing Drama School and a Taiwan art
school has sent 74 artists from Beijing to Taiwan to teach Peking
Opera in the past four years. It is expected to be extended to
other traditional Chinese folk arts.

<HEADLINE> China Vows More Reforms and Wider Opening in Commerce Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The internal trade sector is
vowing to deepen its reforms and opening so as to better align its
operations with the socialist market economy, a high-ranking
commerce official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Chen Bangzhu, minister of Internal
Trade, said that as internal trade is an important sector in the
national economy closely related to people's life and production,
issues related to the reforms, opening-up, development and
stability of the sector must be carefully handled.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade was founded in 1993 when the
government made moves to streamline, incorporating the three
ministries previously in charge of commerce, grain and material
distribution.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that since China needs to feed a population
of 1.2 billion and more, the prosperity and stability of the grain
market basically guarantee a stable national economy.
</P>
<P>
"One important task is to take advantage of the present stable
market condition to deepen the reform of the grain distribution
sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, a grain market system will be formed to
bring about the opening-up in a unified way and encourage fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, measures will also be taken to establish a market
regulation system for more effective supervision.
</P>
<P>
Also under the plan, the policy-oriented grain distribution
will be separated from purely commercial practices and more
State-owned grain stores will be allowed to operate under market
competition, the minister observed.

</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the Armenian president's visit is aimed at

</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan is expected to meet today with Russian First

<HEADLINE> China Vows More Reform and Open-up in Commerce Sector (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With ample supply and stable prices, the total retail sales of
consumer goods reached 2,461.4 billion yuan (about 296.5 billion US
dollars) in 1996, more than triple the 1991 figure.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a continuously prosperous market which will
constantly meet the growing demand, the market must be vigorously
expanded by increasing the cooperation between the industrial and
commercial departments, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Rural income has grown faster than urban income in recent
years, however, the rural market has become sluggish and special
focus should be placed on reviving it, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
To this end, measures should be taken to increase the supply of
marketable goods, to set up more chain stores and distribution
centers and to establish more commodity service centers in rural
areas, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the development of new distribution forms, Chen said,
the next step is to expand the operation scale and standardize
chain stores and distribution centers. The proposed solutions
include adding more outlets and commodities and speeding up the
formulation of laws and legislations.
</P>
<P>
"In the process, we should try to borrow from advanced foreign
experience, continue to absorb foreign funds, technology and
personnel in a cautious manner, and set up more Sino-overseas
joint ventures," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the achievements of the reform and opening drive,
the minister said that the majority of the commodities previously
under state review are now distributed throughout the market, with
the price of 90 to 95 percent of the commodities being set freely.
</P>
<P>
While in the past, department stores dominated the market,
supermarkets, convenience stores, boutiques and warehouse stores
are now on the scene.
</P>
<P>
In the opening-up drive, the central government has approved 17
large Sino-overseas department store projects and granted
the right to handle imports and exports to 206 state-owned
distribution enterprises. In addition, about 7,000 enterprises
involving overseas investment have been set up.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Moves to Expel Lawmaker from Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A presidential commission of Sri
Lanka has recommended to the cabinet that opposition
parliamentarian Wijeyapala Mendis be expelled from the parliament
after finding him guilty of abuse of power in the former
government.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by cabinet spokesman Mangala Samaraweera at
today's weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera also revealed that the commission, appointed by
President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1995, also recommended that
Wijeyapala Mendis, Chandra Bandara, R. Paskaralingam and Akil
Mohamed be stripped of their civic rights for a period of seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Bandar was a former minister of power and energy in the
former United National Party (UNP) government which ruled the
country for 17 year.
</P>
<P>
Paskaralingam was former secretary to the treasury and Akil
Mohamed, former secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said that as Bandar is now dead, no decision would
be taken on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He added that since it requires a two-third majority in
parliament to pass the commission's recommendations which would
bar the three for holding public office.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the UNP would cooperate with the government.

CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The embassy of the Democratic

Ambassador to Egypt Jang Sun Gil and his elder brother Jang Sung

<P>
"It is very clear and correct that Jang Sung Gil and his
brother had been dismissed from their posts early in last July and
had been ordered to return home for judicial investigation for
embezzlement of a large sum of public funds and degeneration," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the United States hand over Jang Sung Gil and his
brother to DPR of Korea in accordance with the international law
on extradition," the statement, in English, said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Formulate Long-term Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered the formulation of a national development plan for
the 21st century which includes the country's long-term vision,
policy framework, targets and strategies.
</P>
<P>
In a circular to the National Economic Development Authority
(NEDA), Ramos called for the preparation of a success plan for the
period from 1990 to 2004 and a long-term plan up to the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said a long-term development blueprint is necessary "to
ensure economic stability and consistency of government policies
and programs" and sustain the gains the Philippines has achieved
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the NEDA as the central planning agency of
the government to coordinate with other agencies of the executive
branch, the legislative branch and private sector in preparing the
development plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan shall contain the following basic elements --
development goals and objectives; strategy and policy framework to
attain such goals and objectives; and key measurable targets
supportive of broader development objectives, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said all sectors of society, public or private, shall be
consulted to the fullest to obtain their opinions and positions on
related matters.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Deliberating Draft Law on Earthquake Precaution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A draft law on earthquake
precaution, control and reduction is being deliberated at the
ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Committee members held that it is essential to work out and
implement a law governing earthquake precaution, as China is prone
to earthquakes and is experiencing the fifth seismological dynamic
period of this century.
</P>
<P>
Earthquake precaution should focus on monitoring and
forecasting, they noted. The law, therefore, should stipulate in
explicit terms that the government should increase investment in
an effort to update technology and equipment and to enhance
research and forecasting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Many voiced concern over inadequate quality of civic building
projects in China, especially that of the residential
housing. They suggested the law place stricter demands on
quake-proofing requirements for buildings and mete still harsher
punishment on those projects that fail to meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
Some of the members suggested that knowledge of earthquakes be
spread so that damage or loss of human life and property could be
minimized.
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that the draft bill is basically well-written
and could be promulgated as soon as some revisions are made.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Car Damage Insurance Cost Stands High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Car damage claims in Belgium
are the second most costly in western Europe, only behind
neighboring Germany.
</P>
<P>
A study published in today's newspaper La Libre Belgique (The
Free Belgium) said that Belgian insurers have to pay out an
average 1,472 ECU (1,604 U.S. dollars) for each reported damage in
a car accident, while those in Germany pay out 1,796 ECU (1,957
dollars) for each damaged car.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Gesamtverband der Deutschen
Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), a German insurance association,
which attributed the high insurance cost to human cost in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A technician has to be paid for an average 315 ECU (343
dollars) in Germany for a single rescue mission whereas such cost
in Belgium is 66 ECU (71 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Towing away the damaged car from the accident scene costs 671
ECU (731 dollars) in Germany, while the same cost in Belgium is
278 ECU (303 dollars).
</P>
<P>
With an average reimbursement for damage at 1,372 ECU, the
Netherlands has the third highest car insurance cost in western
Europe, followed by France (1,165 ECU), Italy (909 ECU) and
Britain (889 ECU).
</P>
<P>
Spain has the lowest car insurance cost in western Europe with
the average car damage reimbursement standing at 571 ECU.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said today that India's foreign policy based on what
Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru had enunciated has stood the test of time
and the time-honored principles would continue to guide the
country's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Initiating a discussion on India and the world at the Upper
House of Parliament here, Gujral said that India has always sided
with all those who were oppressed although it had to pay a heavy
price for its stand.
</P>
<P>
India had followed a policy of "simulation and defiance". While
simulating new ideas and new languages, India had defied and
refused to get overwhelmed when such a situation arose, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gujral recalled the contributions of the former Soviet Union in
building India's industry and said India's relationship with
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
was "extremely good", and that India's relations with the U.S.
were improving a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that India's relations with China were
improving and that India had chosen to accept Beijing's invitation
for attending the handover ceremony of Hong Kong to China instead
of a similar invitation from Britain for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Gujral called for strengthening economic cooperation with
Pakistan. He said that his government accorded the highest
priority to improving relations with neighbors and India's ties
with Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives and Bangladesh were
very good.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of food poisoning
cases in Hong Kong doubled in the first six months of this year,
compared with the same period last year, sources from the local
health department said.
</P>
<P>
The local health department received a total of 151 reports of
food poisoning, affecting 820 people between January and June this
year.
</P>
<P>
Bacteria was the major cause, accounting for 82 percent of the
cases, mostly as a result of under-cooking and contamination
during processing.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman said the overall trend was similar to the
corresponding period in 1996 and within acceptable levels.

Last year there were a total of 314 food poisoning cases in

HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority is to put another 167 million coins into circulation to
alleviate shortages, a spokesman for the authority said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second batch issued since the handover of Hong
Kong on July 1, which sparked a rush for coins bearing the Queen's

</P>
<P>
From March to June this year, the Monetary Authority put a net
total of 27 million additional 10-cent coins, 22.5 million 20-cent

</P>
<P>
Compared with last year, the number of coins in circulation in
June should have increased 17 percent.

The first batch of new coins, 100 million, was made available
from July 28, but many of them directly went into collectors'
pockets due to their new designs in commemoration of the handover.

<HEADLINE> Claimers Awaits Iraq's Compensation for War Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Public Authority
for the Assessment of Compensations (PAAC) for damages from the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has said it was awaiting money to
compensate the second batch of claimers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Board Chairman and Deputy Director General of PAAC Adel
Assem said in a statement that the money was expected to be
obtained after Iraq starts selling oil under the oil-for-food
formula which allowed it to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil in six-month period for humanitarian purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations set by the U.N. Compensation
Commission, the claims were divided into six categories. The
second batch of claimers fall into categories A and B - category A
concerns people who left Kuwait during the seven-month Iraqi
occupation while category C concerns personal damages up to
maximum 100,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food formula, Iraq provided 600 million
dollars, or 30 percent of its oil sale to the compensation fund
run by the Geneva-based Compensation Commission which in turn paid
to some Kuwaiti and foreign claimers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The second batch groups 224,079 claims submitted by citizens
from over 70 countries, Assem said. The U.N. Compensation
Committee will pay maximum 2,500 dollars for every claim
classified under the second batch and the gross total will be
around 560 million dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
As of the second quarter this year, the commission has approved
more than 277,000 claims with a total amount awarded of about 2.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait alone has filed claims totaling 130 billion dollars
including the costs of extinguishing oil well fires set by
retreating Iraqi troops before they were chased out by a U.S.-led
military coalition.
</P>
<P>
Most payments of compensation for the other categories have
been approved by the PAAC except for the category concerning
losses caused by burning oil wells which are estimated at some
610 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Corporations from around the world are seeking another 80
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary on Partnership with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook today outlined the areas of Britain's partnership with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address on "Southeast Asia and beyond: Britain's
Partners for the 21st Century" here this afternoon at the end of
his two-day visit to Malaysia, Cook spelt out six areas for such a
partnership, which covers economy, security, freedom of the
people, the United Nations, environment and drugs.
</P>
<P>
On economic partnership, Cook said Britain's economic
partnership with the region is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Not only is Britain the leading European investor in Asia, it
is second only to the United States as non-Asian investors in the
region, Cook explained.
</P>
<P>
Security, he said, is another vital area for partnership:
British engagement in Southeast Asian security, in particular
through the Five Power Defense Arrangement, is "unique".
</P>
<P>
"Our security partnership is not restricted to Asia: all
countries with a significant defense capability need to exercise
it responsibly as members of the international community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On freedom of the people, Cook said it is perhaps the most
important because it underpins all the others. "Human rights are a
fundamental of foreign policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the United Nations, Cook said the work of reform, to which
the new secretary general has firmly committed himself, is of the
highest importance.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just for economic reasons. A shrinking world needs
an effective political forum where the international community
can address the long or short term challenges which confront us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan's focus on
Southeast Asia, saying the U.N. leader, more than any of his
predecessors, has demonstrated that he recognizes the crucial
importance of this region.
</P>
<P>
On environment, Cook said it is all too tempting not to tackle
this issue because the problems are not sudden or pressing or
urgent.
</P>
<P>
On drugs, he said drug traffickers do not stop at national
frontiers and international cooperation is vital to combating the
problem. He stressed the need for ASEAN help in bearing down on
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Cook said global cooperation demands better mutual
understanding between cultures. He expressed the hope that his
six-point plan for partnership will contribute to better mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Cook praised ASEAN for showing a valuable capacity to maintain
its diversity while developing a communal solidarity, saying this
success has come about against the background of a historic shift
of global economic focus towards the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign policy and trading patterns of Europe must adjust
to recognize this new balance of economic power," he said. "We
want to see Europe open to Asia in particular."
</P>
<P>
Before the address, Cook called on Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and discussed the enhancement of Malaysia-Britain
ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Cook also held talks with Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah after the talks rebuffed Cook's stand on human rights,
saying Cook was wrong to insist that all countries should respect
the same fundamental set of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told reporters: "I think in human rights, it is very
difficult to have one common yardstick that is universally
applicable. Each country has a unique domestic agenda and should
therefore be allowed to deal with its own problems."
</P>
<P>
Cook later left for Jakarta to continue his four-nation
Southeast Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Exports to Asia Increase Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli exports to Asia
climbed to 1.99 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of
this year from 1.86 billion dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A latest report published by the Israeli Industry and Trade
Ministry said that exports to Asia comprise 20 percent of all of
Israel's sales abroad, while imports from the Far East comprise
11 percent of its total imports.
</P>
<P>
In January-July period of 1997, Israeli imports from Asia
totaled 1.59 billion dollars, a 2.8 percent increase over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to diversify its foreign trade, Israel has in the
past few years launched a vigorous public relations campaign in
the Far East focusing on China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's current visit to Japan and
South Korea is a fresh move in the drive. In Seoul, Netanyahu and
his South Korean counterpart Kim Young Sam Wednesday signed two
agreements, one on telecommunications and the other on technical
cooperation, mainly in agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
Israel's trade with South Korea has increased rapidly and is
expected to surpass 1 billion dollars this year. In 1996, the
figure stood at 720 million dollars compared with 692 million
dollars in 1995, and 430 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries was only 151 million dollars
in 1991, a year before Israel re-opened its embassy in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wins Contract For World's Lightest Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers have
joined forces with one of the world's largest car manufacturers to
develop the world's lightest family car, Australian Science and
Technology Minister Perter McGauran announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Commonwealth Scientific and Industry
Research Organization (CSIRO), the country's national research
academy, and the Cooperative Research Center (CRC) for Alloy and
Solidification Technology (CAST) have won a contract to design and
supply magnesium engine brackets as part of a 148 million U.S.
dollar project by the U.S.-based Ford Motor company.
</P>
<P>
The new car, the P2000, will make extensive use of light
metals, including magnesium, to achieve a vehicle weight nearly 40
percent less than today's comparable vehicles, the minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid vehicle will incorporate an electronic drive as a
newly developed engine which is expected to achieve fuel
consumption of 3 liters per 100 kilometers. A prototype is
expected to be developed this year.
</P>
<P>
McGauran said the development of a light weight family car
would have significant environmental and economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Lighter vehicles cut fossil fuel consumption, pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, magnesium is recyclable,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ford's decision to use Australian design capability
complements its recent decision to participate in the construction
of a pilot magnesium smelter at Gladstone in eastern Australia's
state of Queensland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China on Japanese-US Military Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- "It does not go along with the
trend of the times for Japan and the US to strengthen their
military alliance and expand their military cooperation in the
Asian-Pacific region, because the region is enjoying a
comparatively stable political situation, sustainable economic
growth and active security dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang made the
remarks at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the Japanese-US Defense Cooperation
Guidelines which are being revised by the two countries, Tang said
that the Japanese-US military alliance is a bilateral arrangement
formed in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
If the pact goes beyond its original scope, Japan's neighbors
will be concerned, and the security situation in the region will
become complicated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the guidelines touch upon the details of the Japanese-US
military cooperation, China, as a neighbor of Japan, has to pay
attention to them, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that Japan and the US should adopt a
prudent policy on the problem, and should not do anything that
will worry neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army launched
another raid against car thieves in the region of Baalbek in
eastern Lebanon, shooting dead a member of a Shiite Muslim clan on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
local newspaper the Daily Star reported today that an army
statement said the 23-year-old victim, Mohammed Naouaf Mokddad,
was killed "when he ignored warnings to stop."
</P>
<P>
It was the army's second sweep in two months in this
Shiite-dominated area hunting car thieves, drug-traffickers,
counterfeiters and bandits.
</P>
<P>
As news of Mokddad's death spread, his armed relatives took to
the streets, blocking roads with rocks and burning tires.
</P>
<P>
Car thefts have gone rampant in Lebanon. According to the army,
in one week alone this month in the capital of Beirut, 23 cars
were stolen.
</P>
<P>
The army had arrested two members of the Shiite Muslim clan,
the Daily Star quoted army sources as saying. One has been
sentenced to five years in prison for robbery and the other
accused of counterfeiting money.
</P>
<P>
The two were on a list of hundreds wanted by the Lebanese
authorities, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the army admitted that the suspected gang leader,
Tayfour Moqdad, remained in hiding. He is believed to be running a
network accused of stealing cars from Beirut and storing in
Baalbek.

<HEADLINE> HK Residential Mortgage Records Rapid Growth in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new mortgage
lending rose rapidly in July this year, according to the latest
monthly survey conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
During the month, gross new loans rose by 27.3 percent to 32.5
billion HK dollars (4.17 billion US dollars). The average size of
new loans rose to 1.94 million HK dollars compared with 1.88
million HK dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
Repayment of loans also increased sharply by 20.5 percent in
July but at a slower rate than loan growth. As a result, the
amount of outstanding loans rose by 3.9 percent to 395.4 billion
HK dollars (50.69 billion US dollars) in July, compared to 2.7
percent growth in June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gross loans for the purchase of properties in
China's inland areas increased to 369 million HK dollars (47.31
million US dollars) in July from 181 million HK dollars (23.21
million US dollars) in June. The amount of outstanding loans rose
by 3.42 percent to 6.98 billion HK dollars (894.87 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Authority said the rapid growth of mortgage
lending in the month is a reflection of market conditions as they
were in May and early June.
</P>
<P>
"The property market has since cooled and demand for new loans
seems to have slowed in August. Nevertheless, outstanding loans in
August may continue to grow quite rapidly because of loan
approvals already in the pipeline. In view of this, the recent
move by some banks to increase their mortgage interest rates is
prudent," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, Jiang said, the reform and construction in China
have entered a new, crucial phase, which requires China to pool
efforts in various aspects and work together toward common goals.
</P>
<P>
This calls for the continued strengthening and development of
patriotic united front, which is essential to form the broadest
alliance consisting of all socialist laborers and all patriots who
support socialism and the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Democratic parties and figures without party affiliations are
an important force of the united patriotic front during the new
period, he said. The CPC will unswervingly uphold the policy of
"long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and treating with
each other honestly and sharing trials and tribulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the CPC will give support to democratic
parties and non-Party figures in their participation and
discussion of government and political affairs. The CPC also will
respect and give full play to their active roles in political
consultations, democratic supervision, and management of state and
social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will further develop a close cooperative relationship
with democratic parties and non-Party figures, in which all sides
will treat each other on an equal footing, unite and move forward
together, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, democratic parties and non-Party figures should
consciously accept the leadership of the CPC and, in accordance
with their own characteristics and advantages, carry out their
work actively and contribute still more to the great cause of
advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the
great cause of reunification of the motherland, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Excels Coffee as Major Exporter in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The flower industry ranks
third among the fastest-growing export sectors in Tanzania, only
behind minerals and tourism, overtaking coffee as Tanzania's main
agricultural foreign exchange earner soon.
</P>
<P>
Within the next five years, flower exports are expected to
generate around 100.8 million US dollars, which is about 13
percent of the current overall export proceeds, the local press
today quoted industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The success will be achieved if the current growth rates are
maintained, sources said, adding that the flower industry's
present growth rate of 100 percent is projected to continue or
even increase six times by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania earned five million US dollars from flower
exports, a figure which exceeded the amount earned between 1987
and 1995 when flower export business started in large scale in
the country.
</P>
<P>
A flower businessman Heikki Niskala has said that if
floriculture in Tanzania continues to grow at its current rate,
it can, within the next five years, become the second after
Kenya, even the first biggest flower producer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Coffee currently accounts for about 17 percent of the
country's export earnings. Two years ago, it brought in 133.5
million US Dollars, a figure the Tanzania Coffee Board predicted
to go down by about 35 percent last season because of reduced
output and unpredictable world market prices.

PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French researchers Dominique Goux and Eric Maurin said in a
study published today that the wealth of parents is no longer the
source of success for schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
They said despite the openness of public schools to all
children, inequality in education among schoolchildren continue to
exist. Inequality in cultural background and the capability of
parents to help their children pass the exams and choose their
orientation are the main reasons for the persistence of inequality
among children in education.
</P>
<P>
-- According to American doctor Philip Reilly, the author of
"History of Involuntary Sterilization in the United States", more
than 60,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized from 1907 to 1960
under a policy to eliminate the "undesirable", including mentally
handicapped, alcoholics, violent criminals, sexual delinquents or
simply members of ethnic groups considered a threat to the
supremacy of the white race.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today will meet French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin who will be on his first visit to Germany
since taking office.
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Jospin will focus their talks on Europan issues,
including the Franco-German summit in Weimar on September 19 and
the European job conference to be held in Luxembourg in November.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac told about 200 French
ambassadors stationed abroad on Wednesday that France, which is
occupying "an eminent but fragile position" in the world, does not
"have the right to err" in the face of the challenge from
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that France cannot achieve its economic and social
progress without an adaptation to the globalization, and that
Europe should become a major pole of power in the world.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lifts Internal Blockade of Bethlehem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- To ease the rising tension,
Israel today lifted the month-old internal closure of the West
Bank city of Bethlehem imposed following the July 30 twin
suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
From four O'clock this afternoon, residents of Bethlehem were
allowed to travel to other cities in the West Bank. But they are
still barred from entering Israel because the total closure on
the Palestinian territories remains in force.
</P>
<P>
Israeli citizens are also still banned from travelling to
Bethlehem, but several buses of Christian pilgrims were allowed
to enter the city to visit the traditional site of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
Following two days of clashes between Palestinian protesters
and Israeli soldiers, in which about 10 Palestinians were
wounded, the situation in Bethlehem remained relatively quiet
today. But in the morning, Israeli security forces arrested 15
Palestinians suspected of participating in hostile activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided to lift the blockade of Bethlehem apparently
out of the rising tension and political pressures from the
European Union and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Until this afternoon, Bethlehem was the last West Bank city
that was still under the suffocating internal closure imposed
since the July 30 bombings which killed 16 people and wounded 170
others.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul of South Korea, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said that Israel extended the internal closure of
Bethlehem because it suspected that the masterminds of the
Jerusalem bombings were hiding in the city and attempting to
carry out more terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
The militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed
responsibility for the twin bombings. And Palestinian police
uncovered a Hamas bomb factory not long before the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu charged that Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat was still not keeping his words to crack
down on terrorism and attempting to create an atmosphere of
crisis ahead of the pending visit by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the region early next month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechaik, speaking during a
tour to the Golan Heights, also kept on pressuring the PNA to
combat terrorism. He said that Israel was trying to ease the
pressure within the Palestinian territories, because an
explosion of the situation would not benefit anyone.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the continuation of the peace process,
which has been frozen since Israel began in March building the
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem, was conditional on the
PNA's campaign against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, attending a meeting of lawmakers
in the northern border town Kiryat Shimona, said he was in favor
of lifting the total closure of the Palestinian areas. But he,
too, stressed that the PNA should first step up security
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip today, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
police conducted for the first time a successful joint rescue
exercise in case of bombing attacks and accidents.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli security officials still complained that the
PNA's willingness to conduct the exercise was aimed only at
showing the United States that it was conducting security
cooperation with Israel, although in fact the drill did not
include any anti-terrorism contents.

<HEADLINE> Iran Postpones Visit by US Women Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities have
blocked a trip to Iran by a U.S. women delegation which was
scheduled to arrive here tonight, a senior U.N. official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Xinhua
that the U.N. office in the capital of Tehran has been officially
informed of that the trip by the U.S. delegation has been
postponed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian side gave no explanation of the
decision to postpone the trip.
</P>
<P>
Observers here analyzed that Tehran's postponement decision was
due to strong opposition from Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
who insisted that Iran would have normal relations with all
countries except the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
This may imply that the newly formed government of relatively
moderate President Mohammad Khatami was left with little leeway in
formulating its foreign policy, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
A group of five women - four Americans and a Canadian - set to
make the first seven-day trip to Iran in 17 years as the guests of
former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's daughter
Fatemeh Hashemi, who heads the Iranian Women's Solidarity
Association and the Women and International Social Affairs
Department of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran has responded to a new U.S. call for direct talks between
the two arch enemies by saying Washington must show in practice
that it wants to end its hostility toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries broke off diplomatic ties April 7, 1980 in
the wake of the U.S. hostage crisis in which the Iranian
leadership was accused of masterminding the abduction of
U.S. embassy staff in Tehran following victory of the 1979 Islamic
revolution.

<HEADLINE> CPC Solicits Non-Communists' Opinions on Party Congress Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) recently convened a forum in
Beijing to solicit opinions from non-Communist figures on the
draft version of a keynote report to be presented to the upcoming
15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
presided over the August 1 forum, which was held at Zhongnanhai,
the central government compound. Leaders of China's non-Communist
parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and
figures without any party affiliation were invited to the forum.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan and Hu Jintao, both Standing Committee members of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and other
senior Party officials including Wen Jiabao and Wang Zhaoguo
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the forum, Jiang briefly introduced the
report's drafting process and explained its main contents. He
asked all non-Communist figures present to freely express their
opinions on further revisions.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the forum include Lei Jieqiong, chairwoman of the
Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting
Democracy, Lu Jiaxi, chairman of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Cheng Siyuan,
representative of figures without any party affiliation, He Luli,
chairwoman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee
of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Ding Shisun, chairman of the
Central Committee of the China Democratic League.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic National Construction Association, Cai Zimin, chairman
of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Jing Shuping,
chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,
Yang Jike, executive vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
China Zhi Gong Party, and Xu Caidong, executive vice-chairman of
the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, also addressed the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
All the speakers agreed that the report is a programmatic
document that reflects the determination of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core to hold high the banner of
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and lead the entire Chinese people to greater
success in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They described the report as "a solemn announcement by the
third generation of collective leadership of the CPC", "a great
strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee", and "a powerful
ideological weapon for unifying the Chinese people's thinking and
actions".
</P>
<P>
They praised the report for taking a lofty stand, considering
the overall situation, having a prominent theme and distinct
viewpoints, and presenting thorough and convincing analyses.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their full agreement and hearty support for the
draft report, which they said has defined China's path of future
development and reflected the common aspirations of the whole
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also made some suggestions for further revision
of the report, which include further highlighting the historical
status and guiding role of the late leader Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, improving the
Party style of work, building a clean government and intensifying the
anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the report attach more importance to
education on patriotism, science and technology, education,
aid-the-poor programs and work in environmental protection.

<P>
General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered a speech after hearing
views from the non-Communist participants on the report, in which
he thanked them for offering a lot of pertinent remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said their statements took into account the overall
situation of the nation and the people's interests while focusing
on China's grand goal of modernization.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that they were free to air their views and offer
proposals for solving knotty problems and controversial issues
that have arisen in China's social and economic development,
adding that all their opinions will contribute greatly to the
revision of the report.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee will study each proposal and give
serious consideration to all of them, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to note that the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation constitutes one of China's
fundamental political systems, which bears Chinese characteristics
and is an important form of the country's socialist democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
During the long process of revolution and construction, he
added, China reached an important political consensus, which was
profoundly summarized by Deng Xiaoping: There will be no socialism
or socialist modernization to speak of without democracy.
</P>
<P>
Many years of practice has proved that during the drafting of
major principles and policies concerning the state and social
development, soliciting opinions from the democratic party figures
and non-party personnel, engaging in comprehensive political
consultations and letting the non-Communists exercise democratic
supervision are of great importance for making policy decisions in
a scientific and democratic way, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee will continue its practice, he
said, and the greater, better and more effective efforts will be
made in this regard, so as to give scope to China's this political
advantage.

<HEADLINE> Preserving Tibetan Culture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, the Tibetan government established a cultural heritage
preservation group that, in the following decade, traveled
every corner of Tibet gathering a large amount of data on the
region's art and culture.
</P>
<P>
"I dare say, we've not neglected a single piece of these
treasured items," Dandzim Cering says.
</P>
<P>
An urgent task is to publish all the information. Ten books are
scheduled for publication before the year 2000, covering Tibetan
drama, folk dance, folk music, musical instruments, and other
topics. The book Tibetan Drama, alone, has 860,000 characters and
over 300 pictures.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has over 160 groups of performers who are on tour
constantly. "And all modern art forms have influenced works and
artists here, making Tibet a much more vigorous area," says an
official in the Culture Department of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, Tibetan artists are not satisfied with their findings
and are trying to develop them further for modern society. Dandzim
Cering and his colleagues have collected and collated materials on a
dance called 'Xianwu', which is said to have a history of more
than 3000 years. When it was put on stage in Beijing and Hong Kong
in 1994 in its original form, 'Xianwu' became a hit.
</P>
<P>
"We've revived this `fossilized' dance," Dandzim Cering says,
smiling.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Grows 5.9 Pct in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' economy slowed
down to 5.9 percent in the first half of this year compared with
7.5 percent recorded in the same period last year, statistics
released today by the National Economic Development Authority
showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippines' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) -- the
total value of goods produced in a country -- grew by 5.3 percent,
also slower than last year's 5.6 percent, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in the first six months of the year was
helped by an increase of 12.2 percent in investments and a solid
push coming from the domestic production sectors led by
construction, manufacturing and financial service.
</P>
<P>
The services sector outpaced other sectors, registering a
strong growth of 6.3 percent and contributing 51.1 percent to the
total growth of the domestic production.
</P>
<P>
Industry followed with a 5.4 percent rise and a share of 35.3
percent to the GDP. The combined agriculture, fishery and forestry
sector completed the picture with a 3.4 percent growth rate and a
13.6 percent share to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports went up by 22 percent in the first six
months. However, the poor performance of the non-merchandise
exports, which showed negative growth, plunged the total exports
in the first half of this year to 7.1 percent compared with last
year's 25.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the full-year economic growth of seven percent
planned by the government, an 8.1 percent growth is required for
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, economic analysts doubted the projection, recommending
that the government reassess the growth prospects for the whole
year, especially after the currency of peso has been devaluating
since early July.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Earnings from Minerals up Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe last year produced
metals and minerals valued at over six billion Zimbabwean
dollars, about 800 million more than the previous year, the daily
The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. dollar equals to 11.5 Zimbabwean dollars.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the ministry of mines, environment and
tourism show that 24,699 kg of gold valued at about three billion
Zimbabwea dollars was produced last year. But gold earnings are
expected to plummet this year owing to the low price.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zimbabwe produced 9,694 tonnes of nickel worth over
700 million, a decrease in both quantity and value from that
produced in 1995. The country produced 10,864 tonnes of nickel
in 1995 valued at more than 730 million Zimbabwe dollars.
</P>
<P>
Asbestos production declined last year but the value rose due
mainly to more aggressive marketing strategies. Zimbabwe
produced 165,494 tonnes of asbestos fibre worth some 715 million
Zimbabwean dollars last year against the previous year's high
production of 169,487 tonnes valued at just under 590 million
Zimbabwean dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coal production last year was about 5.1 million tonnes, down
from the previous year's 5.5 million tonnes. Of last year's
production some 4.7 million tonnes were sold raising in excess of
640 million Zimbabwean dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chromite is another mineral currently facing problems. Last
year 658,416 tonnes were produced valued at about 190 million
Zimbabwea dollars. This was a decrease from the previous year's
production of 707,433 tonnes worth about 200 million Zimbabwean
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of the country's diamonds rose from about 42 million
Zimbabwean dollars in 1995 to over 86 million Zimbabwean dollars.
Production also doubled from 204,416 carats to 437,266 carats.

<HEADLINE> Preserving Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tibet, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The pigeon dance almost sank into
complete oblivion eight years ago when Lodan, a folk artist living
in the seclusion of the densely forested Linzhi District of Tibet,
died.
</P>
<P>
Lodan was the only master of the exotic dance and could mimic
the moves of a pigeon to the music, flapping his hands,
moving with small steps, stretching his neck out and drawing it
back, and swirling about.
</P>
<P>
Experts on Tibetan cultural heritage visited him numerous times
over a period of several years, but Lodan refused to utter a
single word about the dance. Finally, they encouraged him
to talk in 1989. However, a year later, he died.
</P>
<P>
"This was one of our numerous attempts to preserve Tibetan
cultural treasures," says Dandzim Cering, 53, Director of the
Tibetan National Art Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1959, Tibetan
artists were so poor that, only by performing for the privileged
class, could they get food and money," he recalls.
</P>
<P>
After Tibet was liberated, many Tibetan young people were sent
to colleges in other parts of China for further study of
art. Dandzim Cering himself went to the Central Institute of
Nationalities to study dance.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama, who rebelled in 1959, is utterly wrong when he
says that the Tibetan culture has been ruined," says Dandzim
Cering. "He has lived in exile for nearly 40 years, and is
unfamiliar with the current situation."

<HEADLINE> Australia Unveils 15-year Foreign Affairs Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia today released its
first ever foreign affairs and trade blueprint for the next 15
years, including a commitment to forging closer relationships with
the United States, Japan, China and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The 92 page-white paper on foreign and trade policy, entitled
"In the National Interest", set out the principles and priorities
of the country's foreign affairs and trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, jointly issued by Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer and Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer,
examined the key international challenges facing Australia over
the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the Asia-Pacific, and particularly East
Asia, as the government's highest foreign and trade policy
priority, and identified globalization and the continuing economic
rise of East Asia as the two most profound influences on
Australian foreign and trade policy over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"The (Australian) government's judgment is that economic growth
in industrializing East Asia will continue at relatively high
levels over the next 15 years," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper devoted much of its analysis to bilateral
relations between Australia and the United States, Japan, China,
Indonesia, and some other countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Australia's alliance with the United States is
an asset both redefined and strengthened by the end of Cold War,
adding the success of key Australian security and economic
objectives is greatly influenced by the economic strength and
political influence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
It said the depth and quality of Australia's relationship with
Japan are vital to advancing the broad range of Australia's
security and economic objectives, and Australia is forging a
partnership of the highest quality with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said China's economic growth, "with attendant
confidence and enhanced influence, will be the most important
strategic development of the next 15 years."
</P>
<P>
"China will remain one of Australia's key relationships...and
the Australian government's approach to China will be based on
shared interests and mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
The one-China policy will continue to be a fundamental element
of the bilateral relationship and Australia's "important economic
and trade relationships with Taiwan ...will be pursued within the
framework of the one-China policy," the white paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also includes a segment on national values
which said the rejection of racism was fundamental to Australia's
acceptance with the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"Racial discrimination is not only morally repugnant, it
repudiates Australia's best interests."
</P>
<P>
On human rights policy, the paper said Australia's objective
should be to make a practical difference, not posture.
</P>
<P>
Australia's priority is practical efforts that can directly
improve the human rights situation on the ground, which include
development cooperation programs, it said.

KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian-Russian Military
Reconnaissance Cooperative Treaty signed Tuesday does not mention
that the two countries will jointly conduct military
reconnaissance on a third country, said Ukrainian Minister of
Defense Oleksandr Kuzmuk.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk made the remarks during a press conference jointly held
with his Russian counterpart Ignor Sergeyev here today after their
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia share secrets on military technology,
weaponry and so on, which makes the signing of the treaty
particularly important. The two countries are closely knitted with
it, the Ukrainian minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sergeyev's visit to Ukraine, Kuzmuk said the talks
went on in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and both sides
wanted to include their cooperative relationship in the
fundamental treaties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Ukraine's entry into the collective defense
system of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Kuzmuk
said that this is an issue to be deliberated within the range of
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is a neutral and non-aligned country, Kuzmuk
reiterated. If it joined the Tashkent Collective Security Treaty,
it would change its stand as a non-aligned country.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense held that Ukraine and Russia
should make joint efforts to upgrade their cooperation in military
industry.
</P>
<P>
He added that the closer the cooperation, the more benefits
both sides will share.
</P>
<P>
What Russia is most concerned is how to finish building supply
ships as soon as possible, Sergeyev said, noting this type of
ships will be used to transport submarine reactors.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Minister of Defense said that both sides had
exchanged views on a wide range of issues concerning military
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Wild Horses In China's Northwest To Return To Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife experts in western
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have decided to let some
rare wild horses (Equus Przewalskii Poliakov) that have been
fenced to a semi-wild environment and then return them to the wild.
</P>
<P>
According to the three-to-five-year strategy, the wild horses
will be sent to the wilderness of the Jungar Basin so that they
can learn to live on their own in natural conditions, as feeding
is gradually reduced and they are monitored less.
</P>
<P>
These wild horses originated in what is now Xinjiang and are
considered a rare species. In 1886, Russian traveller Przewalskii
Poliakov captured some of the animals during a visit to the region
and took them to Europe. The animal had become extinct in China by
the 1980s, but there were about a hundred in some European zoos
and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the help of world wildlife organizations, China bought 18
of the horses from Germany, Great Britain and the United States in
1985 and set up a breeding center in the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild horses had grown to 70 by the end of last
year and the center had gained a great deal of experience and data
on care for the animals, adequate preparation for returning the
species to the wild. It will soon put them through a training
program to improve their adaptability before completely letting
them go.

<HEADLINE> Two-head Baby Born in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A baby girl with two heads was
born recently in a village of Bara district in central Nepal,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Regarding her as Goddess Laxmi or Goddess of Money, people
flocked to see the baby girl, and have donated as much as 30,000
rupees (about 526 U.S. dollars), reports said.
</P>
<P>
As the economic condition of the family is not good, its first
child came as Goddess of Laxmi, visitors claimed.
</P>
<P>
But a local doctor noted that such children, born due to
congenital abnormalities, do not live long in general.
</P>
<P>
The two-head baby girl has survived so long because the main
parts of her body are functioning, he added.

<HEADLINE> SDP Wants Taiwan Excluded From Defense Guideline Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party
(SDP), a non-cabinet ally of the Ruling Democratic Party (LDP),
will seek the exclusion of Taiwan from areas subject to the
proposed new Japan-United States defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News reported that the SDP will make its case in
negotiations with the LDP and New Party Sakigake, another
non-cabinet ally of the LDP.
</P>
<P>
They will map out a common view on the replacement for the 1978
guidelines, Kyodo quoted SDP sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three parties failed to reach a consensus of the review of
the guidelines in previous negotiations as their view on the areas
covered by the new guidelines differed.
</P>
<P>
A LDP proposal, advanced by Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the
ruling party's Policy Affairs Research Council, said an emergency
under the new guidelines is closely linked to the concept of the
"Far East" stated in the 1960 Japan-U.S. security treaty.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggested Taiwan would be in the area to be
covered by the new guidelines as the Japanese government had
defined the Far East under the security treaty as the area from
the Philippines northwards, including Japan and surrounding area,
Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The SDP says in its proposal that Taiwan should not be included.
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate to assume that Taiwan should not be included
in areas to be covered (under the new guidelines) after the
restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China in
September 1972", the SDP proposal says.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. will hold a ministerial meeting September 24
in New York to complete a final report on the new guideline, which
would pave the way for Japan to provide a broad range of logistic
and noncombatant support to the U.S. military in case of
emergencies in as-yet-undefined "areas surrounding Japan."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stocks Plummet to Another Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine share prices today
plunged to another two-year record low on concerns over the
slowdown of the country's economy and the further devaluation of
the currency of peso.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index, a basket of some
30 companies, plummeted 213.77 points, or 9 percent, to 2,070.26
points.
</P>
<P>
It is also the biggest decline in a single day this year,
bringing the all shares index to tumble 56.38 points to close at
684.71 points. Since the beginning of the year, the composite
index has fallen by 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.430 billion shares worth some 88 million U.S.
dollars was traded. Losers outnumbered gainers 161:9, with 15
shares remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and industrial shares led the decline, going down
235.64 points to 2,960.01 points. They are followed by property
and mining sectors, which declined 190.58 and 136.13 points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of factors contributing to the plunge of the
stock market, one of them is the Gross National Product (GNP)
coming out for the first half of the year is lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Economic Development Authority said
today that during the first six months, the GNP grew by 5.7
percent and the Gross Domestic Product by 5.3 percent, indicating
a slowdown in the country's economy, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the overall economic picture, it seems that
everything is negative. All the negative news is out there, " the
analysts said, adding the economic miracle supported by lower
interest rates, stable currency and good growth in the Philippines
has all gone.
</P>
<P>
To rescue the peso which has been under speculative attacks
since early July, the country's Central Bank had to raise its key
interest rates and liquidity reserves for commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the bank raised the liquidity reserves for
commercial banks from the previous five percent to eight percent
while the peso hit a record low of 30.2340 against one U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Charter change movement in the country also
fueled the decline of the stock market. President Fidel Ramos
recently stood out to voice his support for the Charter change
campaigns seeking to extend the term of elective officials
including him.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said foreign brokers dumped their shares amid fears
that the country would have political unrest if Ramos should
remain in power.

ALMA ATA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will never accept
any unilateral oil exploration and exploitation in the disputed
Caspian areas, Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Kemelevich Tokayev
said today.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev said at a press conference Kazakhstan advocates
dividing the Caspian Sea thoroughly by the central line, while
Russia prefers partial demarcation, leaving the central area for
administration and development by the five bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev called on the Russian government to reexamine the oil
exploitation project in areas that fall within Kazakh territory,
and stop any activity that may provoke international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The five countries bordering the Caspian Sea are Russia,
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said Kazakhstan doesn't recognize the Taliban
government in Afghanistan. He called for an end in armed
conflicts, progress in the peace process for national
conciliation and the formation of a government on the basis of
negotiations acceptable to all sides.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's initiative in
hosting talks for peace on Papua New Guinea's Bougainville Island
has won widespread praise in PNG where Foreign Minister Don
MaKinnon is paying a visit.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the New Zealand Press Association
today, PNG Foreign Minister Kilroy Genia said after meeting with
MaKinnon that his country is delighted by New Zealand's move.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity has always been there. It was just a matter of
timing and I think New Zealand came in at the right time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Bougainvilleans feel particularly comfortable with New
Zealand acting as host, anticipating MaKinnon would be received
with open arms when he visits the island Friday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand brokered the peace talks last month, bringing
together the warring factions on the island torn by a civil war in
the last ten years. The talks ended with the signing of the
Burnham Declaration in which all factions pledged their commitment
to peace.
</P>
<P>
Apart from visiting Bougainville, MaKinnon will also hold the
formal annual meeting with Genia in an effort to further cement
the relationship between the two countries, NZPA said.

<P>
KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia reached an
agreement here today on strengthening the work of the Military
Technological Subcommission.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was achieved when Ukrainain Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko talked today with the visiting Russian Minister of
Defense, Ignor Sergeyev, who arrived Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The subcommission comes under the Ukrainian-Russia Joint
Commission.
</P>

During the talk, Sergeyev stressed that both sides should make
great efforts to boost the integration of the Defense Complex
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian shipbuilding factories were working at top tempo to
fulfil contracts to build ships for the Russian fleet, said

</P>
<P>
However, a money shortage was affecting the modernization of
the Russian fleet code-named "Russia", and the building of other

Ukraine and Russia should jointly build cruisers and build
ships for a third country, Pustovoitenko suggested.

Both sides agreed to speed up the signing of agreements on such
issues as the provision of hydrographic service to pilot ships,
and the use of radio transmission frequencies and space.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Optimistic About Indo-Pak Talks </HEADLINE>

NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indo-Pak talks are on the
right track and are in no danger of being derailed due to recent
heavy exchange of firing by Indo-Pak troops in disputed Kashmir
along the two countries' actual control of line, diplomats said
here today.
</P>
<P>
India is reported to have proposed certain dates in
mid-September to Pakistan for the next round of foreign
secretary-level talks scheduled to be held here.
</P>
<P>
The dates for the third round of foreign secretary-level talks
have been conveyed to Pakistan through the diplomatic channel and
Islamabad's response is awaited, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that New Delhi and Islamabad are sticking to
their declared intention to continue to talk to each other, with a
conscious effort to minimize hostile propaganda," said a South
Asian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"South Asia is probably more interested in a successful outcome
of the Indo-Pak talks than any other region by virtue of its
geography and, more importantly, regional politics and
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats have also expressed similar optimism about
the prospects of the talks, emphasizing that prime ministers Inder
Kumar Gujral and Nawaz Sharif of India and Pakistan are proving to
be steadfast in their stewardship of the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, India and Pakistan have held two rounds of
foreign secretary-level dialogue to ease their ties. Foreign
ministers and prime ministers of the two countries also met in
April-May this year for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Strong China Good for World: Russian Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A strong China is good for the
rest of the world, says Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the
International Affairs Committee of Russia's State Duma (lower
house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
"The rise of China doesn't leave an impression of chauvinism
and hegemonism," Lukin told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The active participation of China in international
organizations is conducive to world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the next century, China would become an
influential member of the international community. China will get
strong but it will not seek aggression or expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, meanwhile, will overcome its crisis and rise as a
strong power in Eurasia. In five to eight years, Russia may
embrace an economic miracle, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia will play more important roles in the
future multipolar world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the coming 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The congress was of great significance, he said. "We are
looking forward with joy to the opening of the congress."
</P>
<P>
China saw rapid development after the 14th national congress of
the party in 1992, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national congress is the first since the passing away of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who was a statesman with the
greatest constructive contributions in the 20th century. His role
in China's modernization drive was unmeasurable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to China showed the rise of China's
international status and will enhance China's all-round national
strength.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Taiwan will be eventually reunified with the
motherland in a peaceful way.

<HEADLINE> Mayors from Central America Condemn Anti-Cuba Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mayors from the capitals of
Central American countries meeting in Managua condemned an
anti-Cuba action taken by Alex Panelas, Mayor of Dade County of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Panelas, a Cuban-American, participated in the meeting. He
urged the meeting to adopt a final document condemning the Cuban
government but failed.
</P>
<P>
He said he had come to Managua to try to "open a political
gateway but not a cooperation one, because this can be
accomplished by Central American mayors."
</P>
<P>
San Salvador Major Hector Silva Arguello told reporters that
Panelas`s view was "ridiculous" and that the mayors meeting was
not an appropriate forum to make political statements against
other countries' sovereignty and people's self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Silva Arguello said Central American officials are respectful
of political pluralism and believe that the people have the right
to choose their own government.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Berger Perdomo, the mayor of Guatemala City, also said
that condemnation against Cuba was "out of place."
</P>
<P>
The mayors adopted a "Declaration of Managua" Tuesday and ended
their meeting Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Central Bank Acts to Protect Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Nepal has
sold 14.1 million U.S. dollars at the rate of 56.75 rupees in an
effort to prop up the currency and prevent its further decline
against the U.S. dollar, The Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The intervention on Wednesday was prompted by the shortage of
the dollar in the market due to speculation, said Satyendra Pyara
Shrestha, Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).
</P>
<P>
The bank has refixed the buying and selling rates of the dollar
for Thursday at Rs 57.50 and Rs 58.05 respectively, which were
set at Rs 57.25 and Rs 57.80 for Wednesday and at Rs 56.75 and Rs
57.30 for Tuesday respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the rate of the Nepali currency against the dollar
has more to do with the recent devaluation of the Indian currency
against the greenback, because the Nepali rupee is pegged to the
Indian rupee, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves held by the NRB has reached 46.332 billion
rupees (about 809 million dollars) by mid-July, said a press
communique of the NRB.

<HEADLINE> More Juveniles Turn to Crime in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9,450 criminal cases
involving 13,072 children and youths were brought to the courts in
Thailand during the first six months of this year, according to
the Central Juvenile and Family Court.
</P>
<P>
The number of juvenile delinquency cases increased sharply this
year with thefts ranking first with 4,451 cases, followed by
amphetamine abuse with 2,793 cases, Wicha Mahakul, deputy chief
justice of the court, was quoted today by the local press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 8,399 criminal cases involving juveniles
during the corresponding period, Wicha said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the increase in the number of child crimes on rising
economic hardship and a rise in the number of broken families.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Denies Hand in Alleged Logo Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Soccer
Federation (FIFA) said Wednesday that it has nothing to do with
piracy and mismanagement concerning the mascot of the under-17
FIFA World Championship, slated in Egypt on September 4 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over a logo named Tut started when Mohammed
Taab, a graphic artist and lecturer at Cairo University's faculty
of fine arts, told the Egyptian press last week that his Tut
design had been stolen and threatened to sue anyone who uses it.
</P>
<P>
Taab said that he has the documents to prove the advertising
company he worked for has sold his design to FIFA without his
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Hisham Azmy, member of committee for FIFA Youth Competitions,
said at a press conference Wednesday that FIFA's operation has
been "lawful and legal" throughout its dealing with the logo.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has been lawful from the beginning and has absolutely no
part in piracy. Besides, we have never dealt with the logo in a
commercial," said Azmy, who is also general coordinator of the
Under-17 FIFA World Championship.
</P>
<P>
He said Mohammed Taab never contacted FIFA, which signed a
contract with the Egyptian Soccer Federation and Shereen Youssri,
head of Phoenix Advertising Company on August 8. The Egyptian
company has won the deal with the innocent-looking Tut.
</P>
<P>
Azmy, who first named the logo "Tut's Foot," said that FIFA has
supported Taab and sent its representative to investigate the case
in July. He said FIFA is working with Egypt in the file.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has the responsibility to bring the controversy to an
end," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA official also promised not to contract either Mohammed
Taab or Shereen Youssri pending a court decision.
</P>
<P>
As the World Championship approaches, Taab had begun a compaign
to expose a deal he made with Shereen's company which supposedly
promised him 50,000 Egyptian pounds (14,706 U.S. dollars) if FIFA
accepted his design and later refused to credit his authorship.

MONTEVIDEO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Fabian
Alarcon said today that his country would support all necessary
efforts essential to reaching permanent, definitive and dignified
peace with Peru.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that war means victory for no one," Alarcon said,
adding that a war always leaves in its wake human casualties and
tremendous economic, social, political and moral consequences.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today before ending his two-day
visit to Uruguay, The Ecuadoran president said his country hopes
Ecuador and Peru can find a definitive solution to their political

homelessness.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Ecuador and Peru have been tense since the
two countries became enmeshed in a large-scale border conflict in
January 1995. Ceasefire was achieved 50 days later through the
mediation of the Rio De Janeiro Protocol countries, and the two
countries have since held two rounds of talks to try and solve the
conflict so far.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Japan to Enhance parliamentary Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Japan will work to
enhance inter-parliamentary contacts between the two nations, a
senior Ukranian official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Speaker of the Japanese Diet's (parliament) House
of Councillors Juro Saito, First Vice-Chairman of the Ukrainian
Supreme Soviet Alexandr Tkachenko voiced interest in setting up a
joint Ukrainian-Japanese Center to study the aftermath of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
''Japan's experience in coping with the consequences of a
nuclear disaster could be applied in Ukraine in a bid to overcome
the Chernobyl problems,''said Tkachenko.
</P>
<P>
Saito, who arrived in Kiev Tuesday, said that to set up the
proposed center, approval will be required from the Japanese
government and parliament as well.
</P>
<P>
Saito was supposed to meet Ukraine's Parliamentary Speaker
Alexandr Moroz, but he was recently hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese House Speaker said Ukraine's evolution toward
democracy and market economy is a major factor in European and
global stability.
</P>
<P>
Saito also reaffirmed Japan's interests in helping Ukraine's
shaky economy.
</P>
<P>
''The two nations' prospects for furthering economic
cooperation appear quite bright with the potential for creating
joint ventures and establishing economic contacts,'' said
Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, who met Saito on
the same day.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said Japanese-Ukrainian economic relations may
prove most efficient in areas including the extraction of oil and
natural gas, upgrading Ukraine's oil refineries, building
Ukraine's highway network and producing electronics, construction
machinery and materials.
</P>
<P>
Saito expressed support for Pustovoitenko's idea of fostering
Japanese-Ukrainian joint ventures in Ukraine, but added that this
would require legislative efforts and adequate infrastructure on
the part of the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Saito said the Japanese parliament will continue to
support Ukraine, particularly by rendering humanitarian and
financial aid and technical assistance to tackle the long-term
consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Reiterates UN Line on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today reaffirmed to his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis that
solutions to problems of the divided island of Cyprus must be
based on resolutions approved by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking via telephone, the two leaders agreed that both
countries should work together to make the talks between Cyprus
and the European Union proceed in a way that is in line with the
U.N.'s position regarding Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Prodi's office said the prime ministers
had "a friendly telephone conversation" and reaffirmed their
mutual desire for co-operation.
</P>
<P>
It also stated: "the two parties will strive so that the
European Union can proceed on these principles with a view to
negotiations for the island to join the EU."
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas warned after the
telephone conversation of a "crisis" in relations between the two
countries, unless Italy withdrew comments attributed to Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Greece was outraged after Dini was reported in the Greek media
on Tuesday as telling Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem that "it was
recognized that there were two republics, two governments and two
presences on Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Reppas claimed relations would be "heading towards a
crisis" if Prodi stood by the remarks attributed to his foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is not possible that they (the comments) represent
the policy of a member country of the European Union, and of a
friendly country."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were "entirely contrary to the policy adopted by
the European Union with the complete agreement and the support of
Italy," Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
Reppas called for the EU to keep to its decision regarding
Cyprus in negotiations scheduled for the start of 1998 on the
issue of Cyprus joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
Discussions over the future of Cyprus reached a dead-end
earlier this month after opposition from Ankara and the
Turkish-Cypriots over when to begin negotiations for Cyprus to
join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974. The Turkish mainland army
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in response
to a coup in Nicosia, which was aimed at joining the island with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was declared in 1983
but it is recognized only by Ankara, which maintains up to 35,000
troops there.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots and Ankara strenuously oppose the Cypriot
government's bid to join the European Union, and have threatened
to integrate the breakaway north with Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Authorize Public Bank Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government will
set a deadline for the Assembly to authorize the privatization of
the Banco de Costa Rica, the second largest bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
The public offer to bid for state-owned banks is intended to
raise money to reduce the country`s taxation deficit. But the plan
is opposed by various social groups.
</P>
<P>
The banking system, nationalized in 1948, has been the
foundation for the economic model in Costa Rica for nearly 50
years. Two days ago, the state's monopoly on banks and banking
changed drastically when banks were allowed to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
During President Jose Maria Figueres administration, Banco
Anglocostarricense, the oldest bank of Costa Rica, was closed due
to bankruptcy of overseas operations. Now only three public banks
and an international branch still operate.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government is trying to pass a law to sell the
Banco de Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Development Bank has approved a loan for
Costa Rica to promote public biddings for its banks worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah weakened
further Wednesday, dropping 100 points against the U.S. dollar
amid eased liquidity, while local share prices continued to gain
ground, analysts and dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said rupiah supply was adequate following the maturing
of central bank papers totaling 976 billion rupiah (348.5 million
U.S. dollars) Wednesday and 800 billion rupiah (285.7 million U.S.
dollars) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This forced the rupiah to weaken as people started buying
dollars again. Confidence in the rupiah has not yet returned as
the strengthening of the rupiah so far seems to be artificial,
supported by high interest rates," one local foreign exchange bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,780/2,800 against the U.S.
dollar, fell in a thin market to close at 2,875/2,890 on the back
of eased liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices rose slightly with the Jakarta stock
exchange composite index up 0.2 percent, or 1.224 points, to close
at 555.462 points, with a total turnover of 415.1 million shares
changing hands at 170.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market is waiting for the central bank's next
move following the slight easing of liquidity since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating minister for economy and finance Saleh Afiff
reiterated Wednesday the government would maintain the current
tight monetary policy until the rupiah stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to a historic low of 3,045 against the
greenback after the central bank floated the rupiah on August 14
in the wake of sustained speculative attacks on regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The currency started recovering following the central bank's
increase of interest rates on August 19.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Albania Seek Repatriation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Albanian and Italian officials held
a meeting here today to discuss the date and method for returning
an estimated 10,000 Albanian refugees living in Italy.
</P>
<P>
During the all-day meeting, a joint technical committee studied
the process by which groups of refugees could be returned to
specific regions of Albania, an Interior Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tirana is committed to "concrete cooperation" with Rome to
ensure "the ordered and dignified implementation of the
repatriation operation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has decided to extend the August 31
deadline for repatriation for another two months at the request of
the Albanian government. Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Wednesday that a final decision would be made at Friday's
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government, inaugurated in July after the
internationally monitored general elections in June, is asking for
a longer extension of the deadline, saying two months is not
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said today in Tirana that
it would be unacceptable if Albanians in Italian refugee camps are
returned to their homeland only to find shelter in refugee camps
there.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian government faces growing pressure from the
opposition, which has accused it of giving in to Albania and is
urging firmer action against immigrants without permits. Public
complaints are also mounting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of the Albanian immigrants do not want to
return, saying they would prefer to find work here and stay
in Italy indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
About 17,000 Albanians have fled to neighboring Italy since
spring, when a financial scandal triggered nationwide anarchy and
plunged the Balkan nation into a political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
A reported 7,000 have returned to their own country so far.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Sparks Robust Growth in East China Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that overseas
investment has greatly bolstered the economy of Quanzhou port city
in east China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The city was home to 6,321 overseas-funded businesses by the
end of July. The industrial output value of these businesses
accounted for 34.93 percent of the city's total in July. The
proportion of their export volume to the city's total also rose
from 9.96 percent in 1985 to 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou, which approved its first foreign-funded business in
1981, continues to invest heavily in the construction of
expressways, power plants and other infrastructural facilities
to expand the port's accommodating capacity.

ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano will meet his French counterpart, Jean Pierre
Chevenement, here Thursday to prepare for the Franco-Italian
summit scheduled for October 2-3.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will discuss border control, immigration and
the fight against organized crime, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Italy is expected to remove its border control on October 26
when the Schengen accords take effect in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Germany and Austria last month, the
borders of Italy will be totally free to the Schengen signatory
countries on April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen accords, which allow free movement across borders
for signatory countries, group all European Union countries but
Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been firm on its rejection to open borders.
</P>
<P>
The issue of illegal immigration has also become a headache of
the Italian government. Illegal immigration was suspected to have
links with violence and criminal activities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Becomes "Mountain Goddess" Through Hard Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A 54-year-old woman in south
China's Guangdong province is well respected in her hometown and
referred to as a "mountain goddess" because she got rich by
cultivating barren hillsides.
</P>
<P>
On 46 ha of hillsides in Dingbao Township, Xinyi city, clusters
of litchis and longan hang heavy in the trees, while chickens
scratch about below them, and a pigpen overlooks a fishing pond at
the foot of the hills. And the owner of this "mountain ranch", Liu
Yanxian, earns more than 300,000 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago however, none of the villagers believed that her
adventure would bear any fruit, when she turned to cultivating 20
ha of hillside waste.
</P>
<P>
She moved her 10-member family to the hills and started by
improving the hillsides and planting trees. It took three or four
years before the trees bore fruit, so she raised chickens, bees
and pigs, and grew grass beneath the trees to cover the shortage
of funds.
</P>
<P>
These short-term projects not only provided her livelihood, but
also provided extra capital to open up even more barren hills. In
1992, a mountain ranch began to take shape and she was able to
sign a contract for cultivating another 26 ha of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
She has spent nearly 500,000 yuan on 11,000 fruit trees, 15,000
chickens, 100 colonies of bees, 160 pigs, and a two-ha fish pond.
</P>
<P>
"The woman did make a fortune out of the desolate hills, she is
really a mountain goddess," said a local farmer, admiringly.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributes her success to good policy. The township
government granted a 20,000 yuan interest-free loan and a 50-year
lease on the land.
</P>
<P>
One consequence of all of this was that she was elected to the
provincial people's congress, and has presented five proposals,
one of which, for road improvements, resulted in an allocation of
150,000 yuan from higher up, to the surprise of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Her family still lives in the mountains, and the ambitious
woman plans to build a road round-the-maintain to improve the
environment and her mountain villa.

<HEADLINE> Pension Insurance for More Shandong Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong province has
opened special individual bank accounts to provide pension
insurance for local workers and the number has now reached 4.8
million, according to an official with the province's social
insurance bureau.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's market economic system has sparked
an urgent need for the establishment of a social security system
protecting the working force throughout the nation. Shandong leads
the nation in the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong provincial government introduced a social security
system for all contracted workers in the province in early
1986. The system has been gradually expanded to cover employees of
state-owned, private and foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Contributions to the pension insurance fund come from three
major sources -- the government, enterprises and employees
themselves. Employees are required to contribute 2.5 percent of
their salaries to fund pensions.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong government also considered unexpected factors
which might affect the actual income of pensioners and, in 1994,
introduced adjustment mechanisms to the system in order to
guarantee the basic living standards of retirees.
</P>
<P>
With the mechanism the amount of pensions is adjusted in
accordance with the level of inflation on July 1 each year.
</P>
<P>
"Shandong retirees now enjoy the fruits of social development
and are free of worry about future living conditions," according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, some one million Shandong retirees received an average
monthly pension of 417.8 yuan (50 US dollars).

<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian scientists have been shocked by evidence of a
developing EL Nino effect that threatens Australia with a
catastrophic drought and perhaps the world's worst global climate
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- A Pakistani shopping list including Anzac frigates and other
Australian defense equipment has created scope for a diplomatic
rift with India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani diplomatic sources said yesterday that Air Marshal
Abbas Khattak, Chief of Pakistan's Air Force, would raise defense
purchases during a visit to Australia from September 16.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australia plans to use its first white paper on foreign
affairs and trade to promote Australia as a free nation and to
combat perceptions in Asia that it is racist.
</P>
<P>
The 80-page paper, to be released today, emphasizes that
Australia has "a predominantly European intellectual and cultural
heritage" but as a nation finds racial discrimination "morally
repugnant".
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Japan has officially confirmed its economy is in worse shape
than previously thought, yesterday sending long-term interest
rates plunging to a historic low and slashing 2 percent off the
value of the Tokyo stock market.
</P>
<P>
-- Australia should tread carefully before following the
aggressive strategies of such countries as Ireland, Singapore and
Malaysia, using tax breaks and other concessions, to attract
foreign investment in information technology industries,
Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston said yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Muster, Majoli Bid Farewell to U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Muster and Iva Majoli
became the first seed victims of top five by losing their first
and second-rounder respectively at the U.S. Open tennis
championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Muster of Austria, the 1995 French Open champion,
was toppled in the first-rounder by Briton Tim Henman 6-3, 7-6
(7-3), 4-6, 6-4, while fourth-seeded Majoli of Romania went to her
doom against Sandrine Testud of France in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Henman, who charged to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon this
summer, said "I did serve very well throughout the match, and the
result doesn't really surprise me at all."
</P>
<P>
"He has great potential and he has a very stylish game,"
admitted Muster who has won 44 career singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Henman's win was immediately followed Testud's triumph at
Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Testud beat French Open champion Majoli of Romania 6-4, 2-6,
6-1, the second time in five days after her victory in last
Friday's semifinals of the U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Sergi Bruguera of Spain stumbled on the brink of
loss before he rallied from two sets down to beat 167th-ranked
Australian Michael Tebbutt 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, twice French Open champion, remained the only bright
spot for Spain in the tournament. And he was still not ready to
celebrate the win, saying that "it wasn't my fault that I lost the
first two sets, because he was playing unreal tennis."
</P>
<P>
South African Wayne Ferreira suffered a similar torture of
losing first two sets before winning his first rounder against
Alberto Berasategui of Spain 6-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The first rounders witnessed a string of falls for Spain on
Wednesday as Juan Antonio Marin, Emilio Alvarez and Galo Blanco
all lost their matches.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Spaniards who had five berths in the men's 16
seeds, lost two of their top players when eighth seed Carlos Moya
and 16th-seeded Albert Costa lost their first-round matches.
</P>
<P>
None of the other seeded players in the men's and women's
fields were threatened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tenth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile and 13th-seeded Australian
Patrick Rafter advanced in straight sets over Australian Luke
Smith and Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, second-seeded Monica Seles, eighth seed
Anke Huber of Germany and ninth seed Mary Pierce of France all
advanced easily.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Admits 2,400 Studies, Experiments on People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Defense said in a report today that it had sponsored some 2,400
studies and experiments on people, including radiation treatments
on airmen and submarine crews, between 1944 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some 500 projects were conducted between
1944 and 1974 and about 1,900 between 1975 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said, hundreds of Navy submarine crewmen and
then-Army Air Force personnel underwent radiation treatment for
ear and nasal problems and could develop further health problems
as a result.
</P>
<P>
The 625-page report was sent to Congress in the latest chapter
of a controversy over secret and other U.S. government projects
involving humans which began in 1944, many to determine the
effects of fallout from a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
The report, ordered by President Bill Clinton, included studies
ranging from long-term effects of industrial use of radioactive
materials to asthma-related heart problems in children.
</P>
<P>
The report said hundreds of submariners and airmen were
diagnosed with ear problems from depth and altitude in the 1940s
and later and were treated with nasal applicators containing 50
milligrams of radium.
</P>
<P>
In a 1940s study, the Navy used it on at least 732 men by
researchers at the Submarine Medical Research laboratory in New
London, Conn. Hundreds of airmen in the Army Air Force underwent
similar treatments.
</P>
<P>
What problems might arise from the treatments was not stated in
the report, but such radiation therapy has been subsequently shown
to cause thyroid and other problems.
</P>
<P>
According to a presidential study panel in 1995, the Energy
Department and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission,
conducted Cold War experiments from the 1940s into the 1970s
including on persons in hospitals and thousands of uranium miners
to explore the effects of radiation exposure. Some of those atomic
energy studies included plutonium injections.

<HEADLINE> NASA Loses Contact with Earth-Observation Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) has lost contact with a 64.8
million U.S. dollars Earth-observation satellite since Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, which was named as Lewis and positioned in orbit
320 km high just four days ago, was spinning out of control at
about two revolutions per minute and cut off contact with ground
controllers.
</P>
<P>
The problem persisted today, said Sally Koris, spokeswoman for
the satellite's builder, TRW Space and Electronics Group.
</P>
<P>
The spin, which disrupted the sattellite's ability to generate
solar power, may have been caused by excessive firing of a
thruster on one side of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The problem raised the potential for "loss of the mission," a
statement issued by NASA Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
"The solar arrays on Lewis were unable to generate full power
due to the spinning motion, and the batteries were discharged
below operational levels. Four subsequent attempts to contact the
spacecraft were unsuccessful," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Carrying instruments that could help monitor farm yields and
oil spills and assist with relief efforts during natural
disasters, the satellite was launched Friday from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, weighing some 450 kg, will have lost so much
velocity from atmospheric drag that it will plummet toward Earth
after three weeks if the problem persists.

<HEADLINE> Move Toward Single Currency Irreversible: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The European economic, monetary
and financial commissioner today described as irreversible the
move toward single currency and economic union.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum at Alpbach, Austria, Yves-Thibault de Silguy
said: "In fact, the euro will become a reality within 492 days and
the process is now irreversible."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner cited as positive proof for the move the
lowering of price, inflation and budget deficit and stabilizing of
interest rate in the 15-nation union, according to a copy of his
speech available here.
</P>
<P>
Silguy said that in the early 1980s most EU countries suffered
from double-digit inflation whereas inflation is expected to
remain within 2.2 percent in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
He told forum participants that in the past five years average
interest rates within the EU has been declining and now with
long-term interest rates stabilize around 6 percent and short-term
rates at 4.6 percent, a result the commissioner described as
commitment by EU member states to the Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Another positive factor the commissioner cited at the forum was
the economic development. He said that the growth is expected to
reach 2.4 percent as compared with 1.6 percent last year among EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner predicted that most EU countries will have a
declined budget deficit to around or within 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Silguy envisaged a future scenario for the single currency, the
euro, after January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the euro," the commissioner said, "will in the
first place be an international currency for international
transactions."
</P>
<P>
He said that the euro will be used, apart from EU countries,
primarily in three geographical zones -- the central and eastern
Europe, Africa and around the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner pointed to the exacting preparation for
the materialization of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
He said all parties concerned should take into full
consideration the difficulties to result from the creation of the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
He cited as potential problems compatibility, financial
mechanism and information network.
</P>
<P>
There even exists a risk, at least in theory, according to
Silguy. And that is the possible political and economic difference
between EU states and the International Monetary Fund as well as
between EU states and the Group-of-Seven industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will list out the countries to be in the
first wave of joining the single currency in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
But up till now, only Luxembourg has met both requirements
regulated by the Maastricht Treaty, that is, a country's budget
deficit cannot exceed 3 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) while its debt cannot exceed 60 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands are closing the gaps
toward meeting the requirements while Belgium, Luxembourg,
Ireland, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands have worked out
detailed plans concerning the transition toward the euro.
