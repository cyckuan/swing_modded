<HEADLINE> U.S., Japanese Defense Chiefs Hold Talks on Security Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Japanese Defense Agency Director General Hosei Norota
exchanged views Wednesday on bilateral and regional security
issues.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Cohen asked Japan to prepare a set of bills
for implementing updated Japan-U.S. defense guidelines in the
upcoming ordinary Diet (parliament) session, which convenes
January 19.
</P>
<P>
Norota vowed "maximum efforts" to enact the legislation,
Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States updated the 1978 defense
guidelines in 1997 to facilitate cooperation in the event of
emergencies in unspecified "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), Cohen and Norota agreed to continue cooperation between
the United States, Japan and South Korea in dealing with the
DPRK, while reaffirming their commitments to Pyongyang through a
1994 U.S.- DPRK nuclear accord as well as through four-party
Korean peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the Cohen-Norota talks also focused on
the planned return of some U.S. military bases in Okinawa and
other outstanding bilateral defense issues.
</P>
<P>
The two defense chiefs reaffirmed the bilateral agreement last
year to begin joint technical research toward developing a
theater missile defense system (TMD).
</P>
<P>
Norota explained that Japan has drawn up a budget to begin the
TMD research in fiscal April 1999, and Cohen noted that
Washington plans to earmark more money to speed up its own
development of the sophisticated anti-missile system by two to
three years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here on Monday for a four-day visit on the first
leg of a week-long Asian trip that will also take him to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he is expected to meet Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura and pay a courtesy call on Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi before leaving for Seoul in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Continue Peace Efforts in Afghanistan:Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Saddique Khan Kanju Wednesday said that Pakistan has been
making strenuous efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan ever since
the former Soviet Union's withdrawal from that country in 1989.
</P>
<P>
During the question hour at the National Assembly, Kanju
dispelled all impressions that the Pakistani government was
interfering the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the ouster of Najibullah's government in
Afghanistan, Pakistan has tried its best to bring peace to that
country and to unite all Afghan factions for a peaceful solution
of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of peace in Afghanistan was also in the larger
interests of Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
If needed the prime minister will visit the Central Asian
republics to discuss ways and means for restoring peace in
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he himself has visited the Central Asian
republics in August and September and return visits were paid by
the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Tajikstan.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded and a
second device was defused by police experts at a railway exchange,
east of Johannesburg Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured, but the damage caused by the explosion has
been estimated at 50,000 Rand (8,300 U.S. Dollars), South African
Press Association quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Police forensic experts are still combing the scene for
possible clues to the identity of the bomber," police spokesman
Jan Roodt was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The second bomb was discovered by sniffer dogs not far from the
scene of the first explosion, and was defused without incident.
</P>
<P>
Roodt said commuters would not be affected by the bombing as
the explosion did not damage any part of the railway line.
</P>
<P>
Police had no idea at this stage about who could have been
behind the bombing, said Roodt.
</P>
<P>
The explosion followed a blast at Cape Town's premier tourist
attraction, the waterfront, on New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> 5 UNITA MPs Arrested in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan police said
Wednesday that they have arrested five UNITA members of parliament
because they "are accomplices of Jonas Savimbi in attacking the
unarmed civilians in the central part" of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the Angolan National Police
Command said the criminal investigation police Wednesday arrested
Carlos Candanda, Vicente Vihemba and Manuel Saviemba, all MPs, as
"preventive measures" against any more crimes.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the police arrested other two MPs of
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
Daniel Jose Domingos "Maluka" and Carlos Alberto "Calitas",
Saturday according to the 28th Article of the criminal law.
</P>
<P>
The article says that any citizens or MPs would lose their
impunity if they commit serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
The police said that what the five MPs had done "shows clearly
that they are accomplices of Savimbi's military group in launching
attacks against the unarmed civilians in Kuito, Huambo and
Malanje."
</P>
<P>
Kuito, Huambo and Malanje are the respective provincial
capitals of Bie, Huambo and Malanje.

<HEADLINE> EU Assesses Stability Program of Ireland, Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
announced its assessment on Irish and Austrian Stability Programs
here Wednesday with a passing mark, while noting the two
countries still need to enhance their efforts to adjust
macro-economic controls.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, concluded in
the assessment that Ireland's budgetary policy presented in its
program is in line with the requirement of the Stability and
Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines agreed on at
the Cardiff European Council last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission holds that the Irish program gives realistic
projections of a budget surplus and therefore fulfills the
requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, adopted by the
Amsterdam European Council in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The decline of the debt ratio below 60 percent in 1998 and
the continued expected decline to 43 percent of GDP by the year
2001 is a particularly welcome achievement," the commission said
referring to the Irish program, which covers the period from 1999
to 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission pointed out that the economic
situation in Ireland is not without risk, in particular from
rising wages and inflationary pressures. "A tighter fiscal policy
would help to contain these pressures and, in addition, be more
in keeping with Council Recommendations on the Broad Economic
Policy Guidelines of the member states for 1998," the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusion on the Austrian program, the commission said
the program envisages a reduction in the general government
deficit ratio to 1.4 percent of GDP and in the gross debt ratio
to 60 percent of GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary consolidation will be achieved by a reduction in the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio which will be only partially offset by
an expected decrease in the revenue-to-GDP ratio, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The program provides the required margin to prevent the
government deficit from exceeding the 3 percent of GDP reference
value under normal cyclical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The commission also pointed out that Austria's envisaged
medium-target represents "only a minimum position which is
risk-proof and does not insure against unforeseen developments in
economic activity and in public finances."
</P>
<P>
To widen the safety margin, more ambitious targets would have
been appropriate. For this reason, the commission suggests, the
Austrian government should make every effort to surpass the
budgetary targets set in the stability program.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced on Wednesday
that March 10 would be the target date for the devolution of a
range of home rule powers to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Belfast, Political Development Minister
Paul Murphy said that it was the date "by which we are aiming to
get all the necessary legislative preparatory work done."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam, who attended
the press conference, said: "We will do everything possible to be
ready to act in March when the outstanding differences have been
resolved between the parties."
</P>
<P>
The pro-British unionists have rejected to sit in a coalition
government with Sinn Fein until its guerrilla military wing, the
Irish Republican Army, hand over arms.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, which became the fourth biggest party in a new
assembly in elections after the peace deal was signed, says the
rules of the accord entitle it to seats in the cabinet with no
prior disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement reached in last April set no starting date
for decommissioning but stipulated it should be completed by May
2000 and tied signatories to using all their influence to disarm
all paramilitary groups in the province.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges Workers to Go Abroad Legally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday appealed to the overseas Filipino workers to abide by
laws in going abroad as it works with the Japanese government in
investigating the deaths of two Filipino workers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Regalado, administrator of the Philippine Overseas
Employment Administration, asked the overseas workers to follow
legal procedures so the government can provide them with ample
protection.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview that the Department of Foreign Affairs
and other concerned government agencies are ready to assist in the
investigation of the deaths of the two Filipino women.
</P>
<P>
The two were found dead in their apartments in Osaka, Japan,
last month.
</P>
<P>
He said initial investigation showed one of the two used a
tourist visa in leaving for Japan, while the other left in 1996 as
a legitimate worker but her contract had already expired.
</P>
<P>
While the government extends aid to illegal overseas workers,
it would be harder to do so if the workers do not have legal
documents to help the government keep track of them, he added.

plane.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Slow in Utilizing Foreign Aid: Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has been slow in
utilizing foreign aid and in implementing foreign-funded projects,
a competent source told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country had received foreign aid commitment of 975.5
million U.S. dollars as of November 1998 during the current
1998-99 fiscal year, the sources said, quoting a letter written by
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria to other ministers on January
6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the commitment, 647 million dollars was in the form of
project aid, 237.2 million dollars as goods aid, and 91.3 million
dollars as food aid.
</P>
<P>
The committed aid was 41 percent higher than that of the same
period of the previous financial year ending on June 30, 1998,
which stood at 692 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only 295.3 million dollars of the aid had been spent by
September 1998, the source said, which was 24.4 percent up from
that of the corresponding period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the country's Annual Development Program
had been rather slow, the source quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the projects were not implemented at a higher speed, there
would be less aid from the country's donors in the future, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged other ministers to take measures to
accelerate the pace of utilizing foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh experienced the most severe floods in a century last
year, which lasted from July to September and hit two-thirds of
the country with more than 30 million people seriously affected,
causing heavy losses in human lives and property.
</P>
<P>
During and after the flood, the government appealed to donor
countries and international agencies for a huge amount of
assistance in flood relief and post-flood rehabilitation.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen foreigners have been
detained for drug trafficking in Nampula city, capital of the
northern Nampula Province, according to the Mozambican police.
</P>
<P>
The provincial police chief, Basilio Monteiro, said at a press
 conference in Nampula Tuesday that the 18 foreigners include 11
Tanzanians and one Malian but he did not disclose the exact date
when the foreigners were detained.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Information Agency Wednesday quoted Monteiro as
saying that in 1998, the police seized a lot of drugs including 25
kilograms of cannabis and eight packages of hashish.
</P>
<P>
He noted these drugs had been seized mainly from foreigners, in
 particular the Tanzanians, citing that one Tanzanian called
Jacqueline had been arrested for the third times because of his
involvement in drug smuggling and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Monteiro also said that some 30 foreigners were arrested last
November for illegal residency and their involvement in various
crimes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the detained foreigners would be repatriated
soon.
</P>
<P>
The television station in Nampula showed the scene of drug
seizing in the evening news Tuesday, demonstrating the proof of
foreigners' involvement in the smuggling and dealing of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Nampula Province Rosario Mualeia said recently
that measures will be taken to prevent foreigners from swarming
into the province. But he did not offer the details for the sake
of the police work.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Attend Congo Talks in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A South African delegation
led by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo is expected to travel to
Zambian capital Lusaka Thursday for another round of talks aimed
at ending the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), local
media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Southern African foreign ministers and defense ministers will
meet for two days, reporting back on the tasks they were given
during last year's meeting in Lusaka on the DRC peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with the responsibility for charting a way
for talks to take place between the warring parties in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
This meeting will be followed by a summit of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
According to a Zambian government spokesman, rebels fighting
Congolese President Laurent Kabila have been invited to attend the
meeting and would take part in all deliberations to present their
side of the story.
</P>
<P>
The following summit would discuss the signing of a cease-fire,
the withdrawal of foreign troops and the exchange of prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean, Namibian, Angolan and Chadian troops are fighting
along with Kabila, while Uganda and Rwanda are allegedly behind
the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Reform Citizenship Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The German government was due
Wednesday to unveil historic changes to the nation's 1913
bloodlines citizenship law in order to allow automatic citizenship
to foreign children born in Germany and permit dual-citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Under current law German nationality is determined by blood and
not by place of birth. This means ethnic Germans in Eastern
Europe, who speak little German, become automatic citizens while
Turks born in Berlin have to go through a complex and expensive
process to get a German passport.
</P>
<P>
The new citizenship law would allow babies born to foreigners
in Germany to become automatic German citizens if one parent had
also been born in Germany or if they had come to Germany before
the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
Other foreigners in Germany will be eligible to apply for
citizenship after eight years residence, instead of the current
15-year minimum waiting period. The current three-year waiting
period for foreigners who marry German nationals will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has to be approved by both houses of
parliament, was due to be presented by Interior Minister Otto
Schily later Wednesday. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's centre-left
government has a majority in both chambers and the law is expected
to gain approval by this summer.
</P>
<P>
Bloodlines citizenship, based on the current law passed under
Kaiser Wilhelm II during the German Reich in 1913, will not be
eliminated by the new law.
</P>
<P>
There are about 7.4 million foreigners in Germany out of a
total population of 82 million. The biggest group of foreigners
are Turkish nationals who number over two million.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Trade Value Increases By 22 Percent in l998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 13 (Xinhua) - The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded in 1998 by value 220bn
pounds on average per day amounting to 55,705 bn pounds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE announced Wednesday the daily average value traded
increased overall by 22 percent during 1998. The exchange traded
194 million futures and options contracts down 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The large growth in the value traded made 1998 the busiest year
ever for LIFFE - driven by the sharp 38 percent overall increase
in the value traded in the Exchange's Short Term Interest Rate
(STIR) contracts.
</P>
<P>
The STIR average daily volume (ADV) traded in 1998 was 504,809
contracts, representing a 37 percent overall increase in ADV over
1997, LIFFE said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that 1999 is going to be a most
important and innovative year in the history of LIFFE at a time
when the Exchange is being driven hard by customer needs.
</P>
<P>
Brian Williamson, LIFFE's Chairman, said: "The Exchange's
customers want cheaper trading and integrated clearing facilities,
as well as closer links between exchanges and other institutions."
</P>
<P>
"It is LIFFE's clear intention to deliver on these objectives
and thereby to secure the Exchange a strong future," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Figures Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 13 (Xinhua) - British unemployment numbers fell
by 14,000 in December while both overall employment and job
vacancies reached record levels since 1980.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the jobless total stood at 1.3m, or 4.6
percent of the workforce, according to the Office of National
Statistics (ONS) measure of the number of benefit claimants.
</P>
<P>
The ONS employment report said there continued to be
improvement in the labor market, with total employment rising to a
record 27.3m.
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised economic analysts who had predicted a
rise in jobless numbers of around 10,000 as economic growth
falters.
</P>
<P>
"UK economic pessimism has been overdone...these figures will
serve as a warning that the shape of the economy is not so bad,"
said Marian Bell, an economist in the City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Labor Organisation (ILO) figure,
which includes people not eligible for benefit, dropped by 26,000
between September and November, despite predictions from analysts
that unemployment would rise.
</P>
<P>
Education and Employment Secretary David Blunkett welcomed the
fall in unemployment and said he was optimistic government policy
to widen the pool of skilled labor would ease Bank of England
fears about a tight jobs market.
</P>
<P>
Enemployment in Britain now stands at around half the level of
key European partners such as Germany and France, thanks to its
flexible hire-and-fire labor market.

<HEADLINE> Pak Working With Neighboring States for Afghan Peace: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Wednesday that Pakistan has been coordinating
closely with Iran and the Central Asian republics to put an end to
the long-running Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly, Aziz said Pakistan and Iran
launched a joint mission to promote an Afghan peace process in
June-July 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries share the objective of the return of
sustainable peace in Afghanistan and have decided to work together
towards this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Through these efforts it has been possible to make good
progress in the Afghan peace process and also to engage the
neighboring states, the U.N. and the Organization of Islamic
Conference in this endeavor, Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
He said that since last summer when the Taliban took over most
of Afghanistan, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry also intensified
consultations with all neighboring countries, including the
Central Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been making strenuous efforts to bring peace to
war-town Afghanistan ever since the troops of the former Soviet
Union left the country in 1989, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1997, the Pakistani government initiated
intense Afghan-related activities. Contacts were established with
all the Afghan parties in order to get them to the negotiating
table as well as with all the neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts have yielded results," said Aziz, adding that
the Afghan warring factions met in a Steering Committee in
Islamabad in April-May 1998 to work out the modalities of the
convening an Ulema (religious scholars) commission to resolve the
Afghan problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Patrolling Planes Return Safely from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday
denied an Iraqi report that one Coalition plane was hit by its
missile, saying the report was not correct.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday
that several formations of U.S. and British planes entered Iraqi
air space at 0651 GMT. Iraqi air defenses "opened fire on one of
those enemy formations and our border observation post saw one of
the enemy planes hit," said the statement, which was given to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
But a Pentagon spokesman said all of its warplanes had returned
safely to their bases in Turkey after a military confrontation in
northern no-fly zone in Iraq and none of the planes had been hit.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that this report (from Iraq) is
correct," Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell. "All of our
planes returned safely to base," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wendesday's incident was the third such clash between the
United States and Iraq this week, and the seventh since bombing
raids against Iraqi targets by U.S. and British missiles in
Mid-December.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force F-15 and F-16 patrolling the no-fly zone over
northern Iraq encourtered Iraqi radar at five or more air defense
sites at about 0800 GMT. They fired high-speed, anti-radiation
missiles and AGM-130 precision-guided bombs in response. Early
indications show that two AGM-130s scored direct hits, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Army Col. Richard Bridges, another Pentagon spokesman, said
there also were two Iraqi incursions into the no-fly zone over
southern Iraq on Wednesday. He said no U.S. planes were in the
area at the time.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman David Leavy said Iraq's challenge
to the no-fly zones, imposed by the United States and Britain
after the 1991 Gulf War, which Iraq proclaimed violation of its
sovereignty, would not go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
"As the president has made clear, we will take appropriate
actions to enforce the no-fly zones and to protect the safety of
our air crews," Leavy said. "Today's incident is consistent with
both."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had
nearly doubled the number of surface-to-air batteries in both
no-fly zones, which would increase frequency to threaten U.S and
British pilots.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of 2nd U.N. Downed Plane Found in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) told the United
Nations on Tuesday that it had located the wreckage of a
U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed on January 2 with nine
people aboard, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A UNITA official told Benon Sevan, the U.N.
under-secretary-general in charge of security, in Paris that his
group had located the site of the second U.N. aircraft crash, and
UNITA would take a U.N. search team to the site, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, he did not give Mr. Sevan the exact location,"
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it remains unknown whether there are any survivors
in the second plane crash.
</P>
<P>
Sevan is in Paris on his way back from Angola, where he had
been pressing the warring parties for cooperations in the U.N.
search and rescue efforts. He is expected to be back in New York
on Wednesday afternoon, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The January 2 crash was the second U.N. aircraft that had been
shot down in Angola's central highlands province of Huambo since
December 26.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the
shoot-down of two U.N.-chartered planes over the UNITA-held
territory and blamed rebel leader Jonas Savimbi for failing to
cooperate with the U.N. search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. search team last Friday paid a brief visit to the first
crash site, some 30 kilometers east of Huambo, capital of Huambo
Province, where they found charred wreckage but were unable to con
duct an investigation simply because of the on-going fierce
fighting in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and UNITA blamed each other for the
clashes of the two U.N. planes, which had been delivering
humanitarian aid to the government-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were locked in a civil war in early December,
leading to the breakdown of a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Israeli Settlement Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Wednesday
denounced Israeli demolition of Palestinians' houses and
construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
"These Israeli practices complicate matters in the Middle East
and hinder the regional and international efforts aiming at
realizing just and comprehensive peace," a statement issued by the
league said.
</P>
<P>
The league voiced deep concern over the Israeli policies which
coincide with tightening measures against building new Palestinian
houses.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli arbitrary measures, including denying permits for
Palestinians to build houses and fabricating pretexts to demolish
their existing units, "go beyond what the Nazi did in the 1940s,"
the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The inhuman policies have left more than 10,000 Palestinians
homeless, the statement said, urging the international community
to press Israel to abide by the international resolutions and the
agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreements signed between the Palestinians and
Israel, including the 1993 Oslo accords, prohibit the Jewish state
from taking unilateral actions relating to Jewish settlements, an
issue which should be solved in the final-status talks between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli hard-line Likud coalition government has been
continuing settlement activities in defiance of the signed
agreement since it came to power in 1996. The Israeli move has
been a major hurdle to the peace talks with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Blames Eritrea for Trying to Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry Wednesday said Tuesday's statement by the Eritrean
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a desperate attempt by Asmara to
shift international attention from "its aggression against
Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted a statement issued by
the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry as saying that Eritrea is trying
"to encourage a shift in emphasis from the demand for its
withdrawal from Ethiopian territory to talks about what Eritrea
hopes would be a permanent cessation of hostilities which would
consecrate its occupation of Ethiopian territory" .
</P>
<P>
The Eritrea's statement claimed that "Ethiopia is prepared to
launch an attack against Eritrea," the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
charged.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said, "the ostensible objective of the statement is
obviously to underline how Eritrea is committed to avoiding
recourse to war and to the cessation of hostilities and, in
general, to peace."
</P>
<P>
"Today, when all attention is focused on when the
implementation of the peace proposal of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), which is still held hostage by Eritrean
intransigence, would commence, the Eritrean authorities create yet
another diversion," the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
It said this latest Eritrean allegation "could be a smokescreen
behind which Eritrea would launch a wider aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea would be better off choosing the path of peace, in
which case what would be expected of it is to cooperate with the
OAU and accept its peace proposal," it said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Central Organ has recently endorsed the peace proposal
which calls for, among others, Eritrean withdrawal from occupied
Ethiopian territories and the restoration of Ethiopian civilian
administration there, the statement said, adding that Ethiopia has
accepted the peace plan while Eritrea rejected it.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Expects Euro to Boost Its Trade with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The euro, the unified currency
started among 11 countries of the European Union (EU) since the
new year, is expected to increase Turkey's foreign trade, a
Turkish official report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat said
that competition will increase in Europe due to the new currency
system and it will be beneficial for Turkish firms to search for
partners among European firms.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that about 50 percent of Turkey's foreign trade is
realized with the EU, the report said that the euro is important
for Turkey as it is the only country which signed customs deal
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million Turkish citizens live in EU countries and they
have savings worth of 21 billion German marks (about 12.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in Turkey's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the possibility of an increase in
Turkey's foreign trade with Europe will be high as long as the
euro is accepted by Turkish markets.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish importers and exporters will have the chance to
sign contracts with EU countries in euro rather than in national
currencies, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Turkey should further improve commercial relations with the EU
to increase its competition power, said the report, adding that
Turkey should also create a convenient macro-economic atmosphere,
to enable industrialists and exporters to make long-term plans.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Firm to Monitor Goods Entering Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss company
Cotecna Inspection S.A. will replace the British Lloyds Register
as United Nations monitors for goods entering Iraq, a U.N.
official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John Mills, spokesman for the U.N. "oil-for-food"program in
Iraq, said the switch will occur on February 1, 1999 after the
expiration of the contract with Lloyds.
</P>
<P>
"The Lloyds contract was ending, we put it out for tender and
another company has been awarded to contract," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
The border monitors in Iraq inspect supplies at four posts,
which are bought with Iraq's oil revenues. They have to certify
the goods entered the country before suppliers can be paid.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell up to 5.256
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months in order to buy
food, medicine and other goods for Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The oil revenues go to a U.N. escrow account, which then pays
suppliers, after certification from the monitors that the goods
have arrived.
</P>
<P>
Mills said the switch to the Swiss company was routine and
because the contract with Lloyds had expired.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Lambasts U.S. Sanctions on Russian Institutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Moscow said Wednesday that U.S.
sanctions against three Russian institutes may "complicate"
bilateral ties and will "not go unanswered."
</P>
<P>
This came after Washington's announcement Tuesday that Russia'
Research Institute of Energy Technology, the Moscow Aviation
Institute and the Mendeleyev Chemical Technology University would
face U.S. sanctions for allegedly providing weapons technologies
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.S.
charges were "far-fetching" and the imposition of sanction was "a
pretext for prohibiting U.S. organizations to give official aid to
Russian institutes, to deal with them or to carry out export and
import operations with them."
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed similar sanctions against seven other
Russian institutions in July.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the latest moves by the United States will not go
unanswered," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the local U.S. embassy to the Russian
Foreign Ministry to be notified of Moscow's reaction to the
sanctions, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said Russia would "raise this
issue at the highest political level during Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's upcoming visit to Moscow."
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to come to Moscow January 25-27.
</P>
<P>
"The language of sanctions and pressure is absolutely
inadmissible in dealings with Russia," the statement said,
stressing that Russian investigatory agencies had revealed that
the charges against the three institutes of assisting Iran in
implementing missile and nuclear programs "are unfounded."
</P>
<P>
"The work of these legal entities is in full accordance with
Russia's laws and international commitments in the area of missile
and nuclear nonproliferation," it said.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Becomes Story of Past: Ramadan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said on Wednesday evening that the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) has become a
story of the past.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Ramadan accused the UNSCOM of spying on
Iraq for the United States in the past eight years, indicating
Iraq would not allow it back.
</P>
<P>
It is a waste of time to talk about the future of UNSCOM,
whether to beautify the commission, or to replace one of its
spies, or to change the roles and positions of these spies in it,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling UNSCOM "a black page of the past," Ramadan said that it
was supposed to investigate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
but for eight years it made thousands of inspections, only to find
what Iraq had declared.
</P>
<P>
It started to create problems and pretexts for more
restrictions and dominations and U.S. tyranny, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, aggressors themselves alleged that they have, in
their latest aggression on December 16-17, destroyed everything
concerning weapons of mass destruction. In fact, they destroyed
things not related to that, but other things including hospitals
and grain storehouse," said Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that UNSCOM did not have any other mission than
spying in the past eight years, and its latest report only
provided pretexts for the U.S. and Britain to launch attacks on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is not willing to accept any new UNSCOM, or a new Butler
or (U.S. Secretary of State Madeline) Albright's proposal to
study new methods for UNSCOM's work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of trying to find a new method for
espionage by proposing new methods for UNSCOM's work after all the
previous ones have failed.

<HEADLINE> Five-Way Arab Consultations Underway in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of five Arab
countries were consulting on key issues facing the Arab world
Wednesday evening in Cairo, well-informed political sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, joined by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman,
Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen, was a continuation of discussions
at their last gathering on January 2 in Egypt's Red Sea resort of
Hurghada, 400 kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
As part of the preparatory work for an Arab foreign ministers
meeting due January 24, the meeting dealt mainly with the Iraqi
crisis, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the ministers to resume their consultations
was made by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi crisis has become a hot issue in the Arab world after
the United States and Britain launched a four-day missile attack
on the country in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Following the strikes, Arab countries decided to hold a foreign
ministers meeting on December 30 to discuss a Yemeni call for an
Arab summit aimed at forging a unified Arab stance on the Iraqi
problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting was put off to January 24 at the request
of some Gulf Arab states for what they called "better
consultations and coordination."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was especially angered by the postponement, and it lashed
out at Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, who proposed the delay, for
collaborating with the U.S. and Britain in attacking Iraq, and
called for the overthrow of their governments.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing five-way meeting is aimed at reaching an agreement
among Arab countries on issues to be raised at the upcoming
foreign ministers meeting, the sources said.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Krasnoyarsk territory Governor
Alexander Lebed, former secretary of the Russian Security Council,
warned Wednesday that Russia's North Caucasus is facing a new
serious conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is standing on the brink of a serious conflict in the
North Caucasus where blood will be shed," Interfax quoted Lebed as
saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, a retired army general, currently leads a public
Peacekeeping Mission Council in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's leadership has just a few weeks or maybe even days to
take urgent extraordinary measures," Lebed said. "Russia's
leadership no longer has strategic interests in the North
Caucasus."
</P>
<P>
"Such interests are being cherished by the United States,
Turkey, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but not by Russia," he
lamented.
</P>
<P>
"After two years of peace which has been fragile but has been
in place nonetheless, after the election of a not totally
compromising but nonetheless a balanced and honest Chechen
president who cares about his nation, Russia has somehow lost all
its advantages, every lever it might use to influence talks (with
Chechnya)," Lebed said.
</P>
<P>
He said the explosive situation in the North Caucasus cries for
"urgent solutions and preemptive actions."

<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said Wednesday that his country is concerned about the
conflicts in Africa and hopes peace can resume soon.
</P>
<P>
When meeting visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tan Jiaxuan at
the State House, Chiluba said that Zambia is worried over the
escalating war in Angola and wants to see an end to the war so
that the Angolan people can have sufficient time to build their
country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also expressed his hope that the peace talks on the
five-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
rescheduled here for this weekend can be a success, which will be
conducive to peace and stability in the region and to the
fundamental interests of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
On the Zambia-China relations, the Zambian leader reiterated
his country' s one-China policy, saying Zambia will pursue this
policy "firmly" .

<P>
Chiluba also noted that the two countries have made
breakthrough in economic cooperation and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Tang Jiaxuan, who arrived here Tuesday
for a three- day visit, said he really appreciates the more and
more important role Zambia plays in the regional affairs and spoke
highly of the continuous efforts made by Chiluba to mediate in the
DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that as a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, China maintains that the world body should pay more
attention to and discuss the problems of peace and development in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.N. to take more "practical and effective"
measures to find peaceful solutions to the existing conflicts in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The international community should adopt a more active attitude
to support African countries in resolving the wars and conflicts
in the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Spend little Time as Possible on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that he intends "to spend as little time thinking
about" his impeachment as possible and focus instead on issues
facing Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks on the eve of opening arguments in the
Senate trial, which started on January 7, on four impeachment
articles passed by the House of Representatives in December last
year. The two articles of impeachment allege Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice trying to hide his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Senate has to deal with that. We filed our brief
today. It makes our case. The important thing for me is to spend
as little time thinking about that as possible and as much time
working on the issues we are here to discuss," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"They have their job to do in the Senate and I have mine and I
intend to do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated he has no plans to address the impeachment
matter in his State of the Union speech on January 19. "I think
the American people have heard about that quite extensively and my
understanding is that I should do their business," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the
Senate is required to convict Clinton and remove him from office,
which most still consider to be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Malawi Pledge to Enhance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Malawi, in a
joint communique issued here Wednesday, expressed wishes to boost
bilateral trade and mutual investments.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, issued before Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi ended his four-day state visit to Tanzania, said the two
neighboring countries will take measures to improve cross-border
trade, services in Lake Nyasa and construct the Mtwara Development
Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The two countries want to develop the corridor by building a
highway linking the Mtwara Port on the southeastern Tanzanian
coast and the Mbamba Bay on Lake Nyasa in southern Ruvuma Region,
as a shortcut for the transportation of goods for Malawi,
Tanzanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Simeon Ileta told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the highway, however, is facing shortage of
funds, he said, adding that the Tanzanian government is seeking
foreign financial assistance for the project.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the land-locked Malawi is using Dar es Salaam Port
for imports and exports. The Malawian president also visited the
Mtwara Port Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the two presidents have commended the
decision made by the Tanzania/Malawi Joint Permanent Commission on
Co-operation (JPCC) to put in place agreements on trade, avoidance
of double taxation, promotion and protection of investments,
tourism and cultural, scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the two heads of state reaffirmed their commitment
to strengthen social, political, economic, and people-to-people
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued by Tanzanian Foreign Ministry
Wednesday said the central banks of the two countries have agreed
to meet and consider the adoption of a single payment system so as
to encourage bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The second session of JPCC held on January 8-10 in Dar es
Salaam decided to put in place agreements on avoidance of double
taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on
income, and on promotion and protection of investment. The two
important agreements are scheduled to be signed in three months,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that the relevant authorities in both
 countries should sensitize the private sector to provide vessel
services in the lake. On disaster management they agreed to
closely cooperate and coordinate the search and rescue operations
in the lake.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects All Initiatives to Ease Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq rejects all the Arab and
foreign initiatives to ease sanctions imposed on Iraq, said Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"If we accept these initiatives, the embargo will be a
permanent one," said Ramadan at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives aim to put restrictions on Iraq's imports
and exports under continuous monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Instead Iraq demands the total lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on the country for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which
touched off the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan urged the U.N. Security Council to lift the sanctions,
saying that "by doing that, Iraq will have a new basis for new
relations with the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The vice president also condemned the mid-December U.S.-British
aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is a tool in the hands of U.S. and
British schemers," said Ramadan, adding that the council had lost
its credibility completely after the mid-December U.S.-British
raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We all remember in the night of U.S.-British aggression
(against Iraq), the Security Council was meeting at 11:30
p.m. Baghdad time, and while the meeting was underway, the
aggression was launched and the meeting ended with no result," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president reiterated Iraq's rejection of the no-fly
zones imposed by the U.S. and Britain, saying they have no
connection with U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Since late last month, Iraqi air-defense forces and U.S. and
British jets exchanged fire several times in the no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War to protect the minority Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south from what they called "Baghdad
oppression."

<HEADLINE> Armenia Against Azeri-Turkish Military Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanian on Wednesday expressed Yerevan's opposition to a proposed
military treaty between neighboring Azerbaijan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the pact, suggested by Azeri foreign policy councillor
Vafa Guluzade, may polarize countries of the region, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he defended his country's defense cooperation with
Russia, saying it was not directed against any third country but
meant only to strengthen the security of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
He said Azerbaijan's determination to resist this cooperation
was dangerous and may undermine stability in the region and have
an adverse effect on the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia has been at odds for more than a decade
over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave populated mainly by ethnic
Armenians inside Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
After Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh demanded independence in
1988, violence erupted and war claimed about 15,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh declared itself independent from Azerbaijan in
1991, but no country has granted formal recognition to this
"republic."

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Rebels Driven out From Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has driven Sierra Leonean rebels from Freetown into
hills surrounding the capital, ECOMOG commander Timothy Shelpidi
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Timothy Shelpidi, the
Nigerian general told a news briefing in Freetown that the mop-up
operation is " almost complete."
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean rebels launched their attack on Freetown on
January 6 and eventually succeeded in capturing the eastern and
central parts of the capital, including the State House in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG started their counter-offensive last Monday and
recovered the State House and the Freetown Port on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said there were a few rebels hiding in the shanty
towns around the Kissy Area in the east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels had caused "colossal" damange to parts of
Freetown and he expressed the hope that electricity and phone
services would be restored by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said ECOMOG suffered only light casualties but declined to
say how many. The rebel casualties numbered over 1,000, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said the Nigerian-led ECOMOG could have done better
with more international support in military hardware.
</P>
<P>
He accused Liberian President Charles Taylor of being behind
the Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
"He is funding the rebels in exchange for diamond," Shelpidi
said, adding that rebel commander Sam Bockarie is a frequent guest
of Taylor in Liberian capital Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Spend little Time as Possible on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that he intends "to spend as little time thinking
about" his impeachment as possible and focus instead on issues
facing Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks on the eve of opening arguments in the
Senate trial, which started on January 7, on four impeachment
articles passed by the House of Representatives in December last
year. The two articles of impeachment allege Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice trying to hide his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Senate has to deal with that. We filed our brief
today. It makes our case. The important thing for me is to spend
as little time thinking about that as possible and as much time
working on the issues we are here to discuss," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated he has no plans to address the impeachment
matter in his State of the Union speech on January 19. "I think
the American people have heard about that quite extensively and my
understanding is that I should do their business," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyers told senators in a legal brief
Wednesday that they had an "obligation to turn away an unwise and
unwarranted" House impeachment that threatens the American
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The vote the American people rendered... is hanging in the
balance," the presidential lawyers said in their trial brief,
arguing that there are no legal, constitutional or factual grounds
for removal of the president.
</P>
<P>
"There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal
scholars and historians that the substance of the articles does
not amount to impeachable offenses," the attorneys wrote. They
said the allegations "do not begin to satisfy the stringent
showing required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected
president from office, either as a matter of fact or law."
</P>
<P>
The 130-page White House brief offered a preview of the case
that Clinton's attorneys will present in defending him against
perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the House also filed papers to the Senate,
contesting the White House's legal assertions but did not make any
expansive arguments. The papers contended the articles of
impeachment "properly state impeachable offenses," warrant
Clinton's removal from office and disqualification from further
office and are not "unconstitutionally vague" as presidential
lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the
Senate is required to convict Clinton and remove him from office,
which most still consider to be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims to Have Downed "Enemy Plane" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
said that Iraqi air-defense forces downed one of the enemy planes
that violated Iraqi air space on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted the spokesman as saying that
enemy planes violated Iraqi air space in the northern and southern
no-fly zones in Iraq and launched missiles at civilian
installations.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air-defense force fired surface-to-air missiles at the
planes and downed one of them, he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time that Iraq claimed to have shot down
enemy planes without further proof. In the previous two times, the
United States and Britain denied the Iraqi claims, saying that all
their planes returned to bases safely.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain imposed no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to protect the minority
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad
regime.
</P>
<P>
Iraq considered the no-fly zones illegal and vowed to fire at
U.S. and British jets patrolling the zones after the mid-December
U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last month, Iraqi air-defense force and
U.S.-British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones have exchanged
fire several times. Five Iraqis were reported killed and nine
injuried in the confrontations.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Privatize Agro-Industrial Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkmen President Saparmurad
Niyazov has approved a program for the phased privatization of the
country's agro-industrial complex, Interfax reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-phase program, which covers the 1999-2005 period, is
designed to enhance the Central Asian republic's efforts to shake
off dependence on food imports.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen agro-industrial complex comprises more than 600 big
agricultural and more than 100 processing enterprises, which
account for nearly one-third of the country's gross national
product.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will involve setting up public stock companies
on the basis of eight associations of enterprises, the Agriculture
Ministry said. The ministry will be the companies' formal founder.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, the state will be gradually diminishing
its stakes in the public stock companies and will finally sell
them off completely, Interfax reported.

BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook Wednesday called on Libya to hand over the two men who
have been suspected of leading to the Lockerbie bombing for trial
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the call when he visited The Hague where the trial of
the two Libyans accused of the 1988 Pan AM flight bombing will be
expected to open under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take the opportunity of this visit to the trial site

secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said Britain wants to bring out in open court what it

said.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1988, Pan AM flight 103 exploded in the sky
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> France Unveils Proposed New U.N. Policy Towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- France, one of the five
permanent members of the Untied Nations Security Council,
Wednesday unveiled its proposed new U.N. policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The French proposal includes lifting the oil embargo in
conjunction with a new arms control mechanism, and replacing the
existing United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The proposal says that the embargo of oil could be lifted as
long as Iraq is not allowed to direct money from oil sales to
rebuild its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The plan says the U.S.-led bombing on Iraq last December
created a new situation "which renders further investigations on
the past programs almost impossible."
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for strengthening controls over imports of
so-called "dual-use" items, which can have both commercial and
military uses.
</P>
<P>
The plan allows for the renewed commission to carry out
"efficient surprise inspections," though it dose not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The France proposal says that the remaining sanctions on Iraq
could be lifted if Iraq complies with all its obligations under
U.N. resolutions and the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
France also warned that the Security Council could impose new
sanctions if Iraq does not comply.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees "Positive Elements" in French Iraq Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that a French proposal for handling the Iraq crisis
contains some positive elements, but still insisted sanctions
against Iraq would not be lifted until its weapons of mass
destruction are fully under control.
</P>
<P>
"There are some positive elements...that deal with the
essential task of ensuring that Iraq does not rearm and is
disarmed," State Department spokesman James Rubin said. But he
stressed Washington had "a number of questions and concerns" about
the plan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday French diplomats presented the other four
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain,
China, Russia and the United States -- with proposals aimed at
reestablishing links with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes lifting the oil embargo in conjunction with
a new arms control mechanism, and replacing the existing UNSCOM,
which would not hunt for evidence of existing biological,
chemical or nuclear weapons but ensure no fresh programs were
developed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is intended to resume the U.N. oversight of
Iraq's weapons programs that was halted after the U.S. and
British bombing raids against Iraq in mid-December with weapons
inspectors pulling out of Iraq just before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington would discuss new proposals but only in
the context that Iraq comply with U.N. resolutions, including
that it "disarm and that it must do so by fully disclosing
weapons of mass destruction programs."
</P>
<P>
"The burden is on Iraq to disclose its weapons of mass
destruction if Iraq wants to get out from under the sanctions
regime the Security Council imposed at the end of the Gulf War,"
Rubin told reporters.

communities of Turkish origin abroad.
</P>
<P>
The two boards are the Economic Coordination Board and the
Social and Cultural Coordination Board.
</P>
<P>
The two boards will convene once a month under the
chairmanship of the foreign minister.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Urgent International Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Wednesday
urged the international community to provide "urgent humanitarian
and other assistance" to Sierra Leone, and adequate support to the
west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG to complete its mission in
that country.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Nigerian Foreign Ministry in capital
Abuja said the people of Sierra Leone are "in dire need of"
assistance following the wanton destruction which the rebels have
wreaked on their country.
</P>
<P>
It is equally important that the international community should
provide adequate support to the ECOMOG force to enable it complete
its task early, effectively and definitively, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
As Sierra Leone is at the cross road, the efforts of all
countries should be aimed at "halting the atrocities of the
rebels, stabilizing the military situation and addressing the
serious humanitarian problems facing the country," the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is seriously concerned with the
military and security situation in Sierra Leone following the
renewed rebel activities, especially recent attacks on capital
Freetown since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the rebels of Sierra Leone were
receiving support from a number of countries, some of which are
members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
In this regard, it noted, the Nigerian government views with
grave concern the "nefarious role being played by Liberia and some
other countries in and outside the sub-region."
</P>
<P>
In response to Nigeria's call for assistance, the Commonwealth
Secretary- General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said Wednesday in Abuja
that his office "will now contact member states for more direct
support to the efforts toward bringing peace to Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who is on a working holiday in Nigeria, noted that the
53- member Commonwealth had been consistent in its condemnation of
the eight- year insurgency in Sierra Leone while exploring avenues
for peace in the west African country.

BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary

<P>
During his one-day visit to the Netherlands Wednesday, Cook also
visited the International Criminal Tribunal for the former

</P>
<P>
So far, Britain has repeated assurances to Libya that the
United Nations sanctions against it will be lifted if the two men,
Lameen Fhaima and Abdel-Basit Al-Megarhi, are handed over.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the main question is where the pair, if convicted,
would serve their sentences since Libya has been demanding that if
the two Libyans are found guilty, they should serve their
sentences in the Netherlands, not in Scotland as Britain and the
United States insist.
</P>
<P>
According to news from the Middle East, Libya said Wednesday
that talks with South African and Saudi envoys had allowed
progress to be made toward solving the Lockerbie issue while
consultations are continuing to overcome remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, South African President Nelson Mandela told
British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he would help secure
Libya's agreement to the trial of the Lockerbie suspects.
</P>
<P>
On December 21 last year, just the 10th anniversary of the
bombing, both Britain and the United States warded Libya that they
could take extra steps if it failed to hand over the two suspects
by February 1999 in the case for trial.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Foreign Policy Serves National Economy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said the primary aim of Egypt's foreign policy is to
support the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark here Tuesday night at an international
economic conference on "the economic dimension of the Egyptian
diplomacy," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's foreign policy will engage in seeking
more foreign investments to Egypt and to promote Egypt's exports.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports volume rose by 8 percent to 5.3 billion
U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
However, the country also has a trade deficit of 11.2 billion
dollars due to a 12 percent rise in imports volume that hit 16.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We should not allow such imbalances to continue," Moussa
stressed, saying that diplomacy, among other efforts, should
contribute to opening new markets and attracting investments.
</P>
<P>
A further objective of the foreign policy is to integrate the
country's economy into the global economy through regional and
international economic and trade cooperation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently been negotiating with a number of Arab
countries for free trade agreements to boost trade volume.
</P>
<P>
It is also holding talks with the European Union on
comprehensive economic and trade deals.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off economic reforms in the early 1990s to
restructure its national economy and pave the way for further
economic growth, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
International business and financial communities have responded
positively to the reforms, taking advantage of the new
environment with its incentives and opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed confidence that his country, with its
lucrative market, is standing a good chance for attracting "a
reasonable portion" of foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Vehicle Sales Decline Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's motor
industry had its worst year in a decade in 1998, with new vehicle
sales declining 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 314,406 new vehicles were sold last year, showed
figures released on Wednesday by the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA).
</P>
<P>
The decline was due to high interest rates and the depressed
economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sales of passenger cars plummeted 15 percent to 203,817 units,
while light commercial vehicles fell 13.4 percent to 99,078 units.
</P>
<P>
Sales of medium commercial vehicles and heavy trucks declined
9.6 percent and 9.9 percent respectively to 5,092 and 6,419 units.
</P>
<P>
NAAMSA said the exceptionally difficult conditions in the
domestic market had been partly offset by exports of locally
produced vehicles which had boomed to 19,696 units compared with
17,300 units in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the industry will improve by approximately
three percent in 1999, depending on interest rate cuts and the
recovery of the economy.

<HEADLINE> 4 More Lebanese Senior Civil Servants Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government
Wednesday removed four senior civil servants as part of the
country's largest administrative shake-up of reform aimed at
uprooting corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Anwar Khalil said following the cabinet
session presided by President Emile Lahoud that the cabinet
accepted the resignations of directors-general of the Information,
Education and Culture ministries as well as the director of Beirut
Port.
</P>
<P>
Khalil told a news conference that the cabinet had decided to
leave the four civil servants at the disposal of Prime Minister
Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
At the session, the cabinet also appointed 15 officials to
replace those fired last week, Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government removed a batch of 19 senior civil
servants from their posts, triggering a war of words between
former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, whose government appointed the bulk of those fired
officials, accused the current government of seeking political
revenge, while Hoss insisted the move was carried out according to
reports of inspection bodies and aimed at eliminating corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Lahoud said the government's measures are the first
and an important step within the framework of an overall
administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, former army commander, came to power last November. He
promised in his swearing-in speech to launch a comprehensive
administrative and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, a veteran economist and politician, was nominated a week
later by the president as prime minister to succeed his long-time
rival Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Queen's Gallery to be Enlarged for More people to See </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Buckingham Palace on Thursday
announced plans to redevelop Queen's Gallery worth 15 million
pound (24 million U.S. dollars) by providing a better and more
accessible showcase.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, the current Queen's Gallery will be enlarged
to make people more accessible to the 9,000 strong royal
collection of pictures, furniture, jewellery and porcelain.
</P>
<P>
"The aim has always been to increase the accessibility of the
royal collection. We hope the new gallery will offer a new
dimension to the cultural life of the nation," said Hugh Roberts,
director of the collection.
</P>
<P>
Royal officials said Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles had
taken a keen interest in the classically-designed extension which
will be funded entirely from the proceeds of opening Buckingham
Palace and Windsor Castle to the public.
</P>
<P>
The royal collection, one of the largest of its kind in the
world, dates back 300 years and ranges from masterpieces by 16th
century old master Van Dyck and drawings by Leonardo da Vinci to
jewels by Faberge.
</P>
<P>
Many of the works are already on display in the current Queen's
Gallery, or in various castles and royal residences around
Britain, or have been loaned to major exhibitions at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Work on the redevelopment is expected to start at the end of
1999 and completion is expected early in 2002 -- when the queen
expects to celebrate 50 years on the throne.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Parliamentary Union
(APU) on Thursday warned against Iraq's possible violation of the
integrity of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The APU expressed in a statement its worry about the recent
recommendations by the Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) that
the country's leadership rescind earlier recognition of the State
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The APU warned that "such agitation implies a violation of the
security and integrity of Kuwait, whose borders are acknowledged
by the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also claimed on Thursday
that Kuwait is "part of Iraq since ancient time," showing an
about-face on Iraq's 1994 recognition of the current Iraqi-Kuwaiti
border.
</P>
<P>
The union called on the Iraqi leadership to deal "in a positive
way" with the international legitimacy in an effort to ease the
sufferings of the Iraqi people, caused by the crippling
international economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping trade
embargo on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

HANOI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has

<HEADLINE> Saddam Urges for End of Double-Standard Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Thursday urged that the practice of double-standard should be
repudiated in dealing with issues concerning his country.
</P>
<P>
"Any prelude to resolve a question pertaining to Iraq and to
other parties should be away from double-standard policy," he was
quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as telling senior Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was reviewing new developments following the
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December, together
with those senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day air campaign against
Iraq to retaliate what they called Iraqi non-cooperation in
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it had fully complied with all the relevant
U.N. resolutions and demanded a lifting of the crippling economic
sanctions imposed more than eight years ago after its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that the procedures applied to Iraq should also be
applied to Israel, especially regarding its deprivation of Arab
rights in Palestine and occupation of Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has often lasted out at Western double-standard and
hypocrisy in dealing with the Iraqi issue and problems concerning
Israel, as a way of rally Arab support for its effort to get the
sanctions removed.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Calls for Ruling out Extremism in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Thursday called for ruling out extremism, saying that
all legal means should be used to prevent political extremism,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Political extremism "rocks society. It's anti-democratic,
anti-civilized and should be eliminated from political life,"
Primakov said at a cabinet meeting where a draft bill on
combating political extremism was approved.
</P>
<P>
"All nationalistic statements and remarks must be ruled out,"
he said, "We have heard statements which breach the law, and
which should be discussed not only by the public but also from
the legal point of view.
</P>
<P>
"Political extremism includes actions aimed at replacing the
current order by non-constitutional methods," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is not aimed at any particular groups or
parties, it "limits activity which falls under the rubric of
political extremism," Krasheninnikov, the justice minister said.
</P>
<P>
The actions of public or political organizations, as well as
private citizens, that are aimed at toppling the regime, fueling
racial and national disputes, or even calls for these activities
are identified as political extremism in the draft.
</P>
<P>
The draft envisions criminal and administrative responsibility
for such actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that inter-ethnic extremism is a serious
problem in Russia, especially in the North Caucasus.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Coalition Government Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Thursday reshuffled his six-month-old cabinet to
launch a coalition government between his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Liberal Party (LP).
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, speaking at a press conference after the cabinet
reshuffle, said he launched the coalition government to overcome
economic and social problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
"I decided that to overcome the current national crisis, it is
essential for the LDP and the LP to join the administration in
order to govern in a responsible manner," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
LP Secretary General Takeshi Nolda, the only LP member to join
the cabinet, was named as home affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi established the coalition to create a stronger power
base for the ruling party in the House of Councilors (upper
house), where the LDP lacks a majority.
</P>
<P>
The LDP enjoys a majority in the House of Representatives, the
more powerful lower house of the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
At Obuchi's request, three cabinet members submitted their
resignations earlier in the day to pave the way for the
establishment of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The three were Home Affairs Minister Mamoru Nishida, National
Land Agency Chief Kichio Inoue, who also serves as head of the
Hokkaido and Okinawa development agencies, and Science and
Technology Agency Chief Yutaka Takeyama.
</P>
<P>
In the new cabinet, Construction Minister Katsutsugu Sekiya
concurrently serves as the national land agency chief, while
Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki concurrently serves as Hokkaido
development agency chief, and Nonaka concurrently serves as head
of the Okinawa development agency.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Akito Arima took on the additional post of
science and technology agency chief.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the LDP and LP cleared the final hurdle blocking
the launch of the coalition after reaching an agreement on
controversial security issues.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have been negotiating policy issues since
Obuchi and Ozawa agreed last November to form the coalition
before the next regular Diet session, which convenes January 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos ordered Thursday the removal of Ruben Sicato from his
office as Minister of Health.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to the requirement of "UNITA
Renovation Committee", a breakaway organization of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The president did not give reason for the removal, neither did
he tell who will take Sicato's place.
</P>
<P>
But observers here said Sicato's removal has something to do
with his words and deeds over the recent conflicts between the
government troops and the military forces of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The national police admitted Wednesday that they have held up
five UNITA parliament members since last Saturday, on charges that
they had played as collaborators of Jonas Savimbi (UNITA leader)
group.
</P>
<P>
Sicato became health minister on April 11, 1997. According to
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, some UNITA members entered the
national unity and reconciliation government as ministers and vice
ministers.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Leader Denies Undermining President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A major Iranian conservative
leader Thursday denied the reports that he is trying to undermine
President Mohammad Khatami following revelation of involvement of
some intelligence agents in political killings.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, secretary of the Guardians Council,
dismissed the foreign media reports as "false and unfounded."
</P>
<P>
The reports said Jannati visited Qom recently to obtain
permission of senior clerics to present a bill to the Majlis
(parliament) to declare Khatami incompetent to administer the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jannati said he has not made any visit to Qom these days at all
to raise such an issue.
</P>
<P>
Jannati expressed "deep regret" over the reports, saying these
"mischievous" reports only aims to weaken the moderate president
and his administration, thus add to the problems of the country,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Another aim of the reports is to weaken the morale of the
people of Iran in the wake of the recent developments in the
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry admitted last week that some of
its agents have been involved in the killings of an opposition
leader, his wife and three dissident writers in Tehran late last
year.
</P>
<P>
The reports on Jannati's efforts to undermine Khatami came
after a conservative official accused Khatami's supporters of
being behind the mysterious murders.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting
(IRIB) on Monday, Rowhollah Husseinian, head of the Islamic
Revolution Documents Center and former Deputy Intelligence
Minister, said the killers are Khatami's supporters who attempt to
seize the intelligence ministry.
</P>
<P>
The interview broadcast by the the IRIB is considered as an
attempt by the conservatives to insult and undermine Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran times reported Thursday that the
presidential office has decided to lodge a complaint against the
IRIB.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another daily Khordad reported Thursday that the
cabinet Wednesday night decided to deprive the IRIB Chairman Ali
Larijani of his right to attend cabinet meetings.

<HEADLINE> India Increases Sugar Import Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union government
Thursday decided to increase customs duty on sugar to 20 percent
to curb cheap imports of the commodity, said a senior Finance
Ministry official here.
</P>
<P>
Previously the customs duty on sugar import stood at 5 percent.
Farmers and sugar industry in the country have time and again
demanded for increases in customs duty on sugar import so as to
protect their interests. At the beginning the government did not
agree to hike customs duty on sugar import as it was afraid that
sugar price might rise due to shortage of sugar supply in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a countervailing duty of 850 rupees (20.43 U.S.
dollars) per ton, imposed in April this year, would continue, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Guaranteeing Minimum Standard Of Living For China's Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today
asked governments at all levels to take steps to guarantee a
minimum living standard for people who have been laid off by
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The central government has policies on reforming state-owned
enterprises and as long as the enterprises implement these
policies, avoid duplicate production, cut the number of workers,
and increase efficiency, the goal of gettting large and
medium-sized state enterprises out of difficulties for a more
modern enterprise system will be realized, Zhu told a national
conference on the minimum living standard for the laidoff workers
from state enterprises held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Employing laidoff workers and guaranteeing a minimum standard
of living has a direct bearing on the smooth development of
China's reforms and the modernization, he said. He asked Party
committees and government at all levels to put this on their
agenda. The basic living costs for the laidsoff and the pensions
for retired workers will be distributed on time each month and
local governments should mark a certain part of their budget for
special funds for unemployed workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the lunar new year approaches, he said, local government
officials should go to grassroots units to help the ordinary
solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo told the conference that the laidsoff
from state-owned enterprises must register at re-employment
service centers and sign re-employment contracts. They must
terminate relations with their original enterprises. Those who
fail to be employed after three years in the reemployment service
centers can receive unemployment funds from social security
offices. If they receive unemployment funds for two years and
still have no jobs, they will be referred to civil affairs
departments and be given a minimum living.
</P>
<P>
The old-age insurance system also needs to be expanded to all
enterprises, including foreign-funded and self-employed firms, he
said.

<HEADLINE> India's Patent System Needs Revamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indian official said
Thursday that the country's intellectual property rights (IPR)
system needed to be completely revamped and it must be made a
compulsory subject in law courses.
</P>
<P>
Weak physical infrastructure, inadequate intellectual
infrastructure, poor public awareness and delays in implementing
government policies are hurting India with the result that the
country was behind the world in patents, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, Director General of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) R. A. Mashelkar said here.
</P>
<P>
"In today's world of knowledge-based competition, IPR will
emerge as a key strategic tool...but India is way behind the rest
of the world and continuing illiteracy in IPR will hurt us badly,"
he said while delivering a lecture here.
</P>
<P>
"We need innovation in the intellectual property system itself.
This includes provisions for shorter duration patents for
electronics industry and smaller innovations as well as long-term
protection for pharmaceutical products," he said.
</P>
<P>
India's ability to read and write patents was very poor. IPR
must be made a compulsory subject in law courses and the country
should set up several patent training institutes, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak Thursday reached a compromise with the
senior members of the party over the primary elections scheduled
to be completed in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
According to the compromise, Barak can not decide by himself
whose name can be added to the Labor list of the candidates for
the next Knesset (parliament) without approval of the primary
elections. But he can choose several people for the list and bring
it to the Labor central committee for approval.
</P>
<P>
Barak had planned to reserve several spots in the list
for important figures from other parties, who might join the
Labor party in the early elections of May.
</P>
<P>
These figures can include former Foreign Minister David
Levy and the sitting Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
However, some Labor members are opposed to his plan,
fearing that the new comers will compete with them for the
positions in the next Knesset, which will be elected on May.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was finally worked out by the party member
Yossi Beilin after his separate talks with Barak and other
senior Labor members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a convention of the Labor party Thursday granted
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres the second spot in the
party's list and approved the leadership of Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak has repeatedly expressed confidence that he will defeat
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the ruling Likud
party, in the early elections and lead the Labor to victory.

<HEADLINE> Health Canada Rejects Hormone for Milk Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed announcement on the bovine growth hormone, which
was to be made on Friday, is the latest development in a
controversy that dates back almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The hormone, manufactured by Monsanto Corp., has been approved
in the United States since 1993 and has been under review in
Canada for more than eight years. It has been criticized by
public interest groups and some scientists who warn it could
result in more udder infections in cows and lead to the increased
use of antibiotics, which could end up in the milk.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has given Health Canada grounds not to
approve the drug, was prepared by six animal health experts
appointed by the Canadian Veterinary Medicine Association at the
government's request.
</P>
<P>
The panel concludes that there are legitimate animal welfare
concerns associated with the use of the hormone. The panel found
that the hormone increases the frequency of udder infections by
about 25 percent in animals treated. It also concluded that there
is about a 50-percent increase in the risk of lameness in cows
given the drug.
</P>
<P>
The report "will be enough for the government not to approve
the hormone under the Food and Drug Act if that is what they want
to do," the newspaper quoted one source familiar with the
document.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed at
8,675/8,725 to the U.S. dollar here Thursday, weakening 175 points
compared to Wednesday's close at 8,500/8,600 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
"The fall was mainly due to regional weakness as the U.S.
dollar flexed its muscles against the region's currencies. The
dollar gained on massive buying by hedge funds, triggered in turn
by Brazil's deteriorating financial condition," a dealer with a
foreign bank said.
</P>
<P>
Citing other negative factors, the dealer said the soaring swap
cost across the board, the central bank's new ruling on net open
position as well as political instability also contributed to the
decline.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia director Subarjo Joyosumarto Tuesday said the
central bank had lowered banks' maximum net open foreign exchange
to 20 percent of capital, from the previous 25 percent, to reduce
the risks of exposure on foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The rupiah is at a very critical level now, but I think the
government will try to defend it," the dealer added.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that several state banks, which in the past few
days were buying U.S. dollars to settle their overseas
obligations, stepped in to prop up the currency by unloading their
dollar holdings.
</P>
<P>
"But this unfortunately failed to shore up the rupiah because
the volume of the intervention was much smaller than the dollar
bids by offshore speculators," the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Bank Indonesia Sjahril Sabirin said on

<P>
Two million people in Yan'an in Shaanxi Province have
benefited from the program, according to Yan Zongzhi, vice
director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Electricity
Management Bureau. And Yan'an's economy, thanks to an abundance
of petroleum, coal, and natural gas, has expanded rapidly since
1990.
</P>
<P>
However, electricity was still not available to 10 of Yan'an's
townships with a combined population of 490,000 at the end of
1994 and outmoded facilities restricted the region's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1995, the provincial government decided to make
electricity available in all villages in Yan'an and in the rest
of the province by the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Electricity Management
Bureau, which is responsible for providing electricity to 80
percent of the province, plays a vital role in the program. It
has helped 3 million people in 119 townships get electricity over
the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Govt Troops Bring Situation in C. Angola Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government troops
have brought under control the situation in central Angola's Bie
Province after takingTuesday Catabola, a city of strategic
importance about 50 km east of Kuito, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Antonio de Menezes, commander-in-chief of Bie Province
announced Thursday that Catabola City was re-captured under the
cooperation of the national police and the troops of the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) fled the
city without much resistance, leaving behind a large number of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his forces have, since December last year
when they launched their counter-attacks, re-claimed such key
cities as Chinguar, Cunhinga and Chipeta so that UNITA's
encirclement of Quito in the past one month and more was lifted,
the Angolan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All the towns around Kuito are now under the control of the
government, he said, adding that Kuito used to be a city where the
fierce battles were fought, when the UNITA forces used tanks,
missiles and long-range artillery in a bid to seize it.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the government forces have, through a
series of counter-attacks, enlarged their front by dozens of
kilometers around Huambo, capital of another central province.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still raging on in other parts of the country, with
most of the northern Malanje Province falling into the hands of
UNITA forces, and the UNITA forces have reportedly hemmed in on
Mbanza-Congo, capital of Zaire Province bordering the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and thus posing a serious threat to Soyo, an
important oil harbor for the government's strategic material
exports.

Zhou Penggen down from the roof of the five-story building where
the laborers live, the Beijing-based newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who had worked in the factory for only three days,
fought violently with the killers over trivial matters before he
was forced to the roof at midnight, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Zhou for dead, the three absconded to avoid
punishment, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the factory is not registered with the
local industrial and commercial administration, and has illegally
employed workers since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was the fourth laborer in Shenzhen to die from assault or
excessive work loads in 1998, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou Industrial Park in
east China's Jiangsu Province enjoyed rapid growth in 1998 in
spite of the continuing adverse impact of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The park, a joint development project between the governments
of China and Singapore launched in 1994, recorded a 1998 gross
domestic product of 5.03 billion yuan, with exports ending the
year at 1.3 billion yuan, according senior park official Xie
Jiabin.
</P>
<P>
Contractual overseas investments ended the year at 950 million
US dollars, with foreign funds actually used standing at 1.2
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The park has approved 136 overseas-funded firms, according to
Xie.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the zone's improved infrastructure, with
220-kv and 120-kv substations completed during the year and
construction of a 600,000-kw thermal power plant proceeding
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
A project to link the park's highway system with the
Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway was also completed in 1998, according
to Xie.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for contracted foreign investments to grow by
800 million US dollars and actual investments by between 700 and
800 million US dollars in 1999, with the park's GDP expected to
hit seven billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Willing to Donate 500,000 Tons of Fertilizer to Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Thursday said it is willing to donate 500,000 tons of fertilizer
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) if the DPRK
makes a formal request.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 500,000 tons of fertilizer will cost
South Korean 100 million U.S. dollars, said South Korean Minister
of Unification Kang In-duk on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If without formal request, the South Korean government will
consider sending fertilizer through a U.N. agency but the amount
of fertilizer would be greatly reduced, said Kang,
</P>
<P>
"Our government would have to pay for delivery and other
additional costs if we were to send it through a U.N. agency. It
would be better for North Korea to make a formal request that
South Korea provide fertilizer for humanitarian purposes, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has recently decided not to attach conditions to its
provision of fertilizer and farming machinery and rice to
Pyongyang, which reportedly produced an estimated 4 million tons
of grain last year, some 1.5 million tons less than it expected.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, South Korean Vice Unification Minister Jeong
Se-hyun said Pyongyang has asked for fertilizer via Korea
National Red Cross in the South and he urged Pyongyang to resume
the inter-government-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Official inter-Korean talks held in Beijing last April for the
first time in nearly four years to discuss Seoul's fertilizer
assistance to Pyongyang broke down as Seoul put the reunion of
separated families as condition for assistance. No official
contact has been made since then.
</P>
<P>
"As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, we will send them
rice and fertilizer without attaching conditions," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister pointed out that government officials
from both sides should meet either in secret or public.
</P>
<P>
South Korean private organizations now find it difficult to
finance the supply of assistance due to the economic troubles
which have gripped the whole nation since November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Election Coalition Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's tri-partite
government formed in late December to conduct fresh polls Thursday
won the vote of confidence in the Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and thirty-six lawmakers voted for the motion of
confidence in the government while 40 voted against. Both factions
of the National Democratic Party (RPP) which have 18 seats
abstained.
</P>
<P>
The victory is expected as the ruling Nepali Congress (NC), the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and
the Nepal Sadbhavana Party enjoy a majority of 139 seats in the
205-member house.
</P>
<P>
Under the kingdom's constitution, a new government must obtain
the vote of confidence in the house within 30 days of its
formation.
</P>
<P>
Following the collapse of the coalition between the NC and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) on December
10, 1998, the new coalition was formed under the agreement between
the NC and the CPN-UML to conduct free, fair and impartial
elections by March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will decide the exact date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the house session Thursday, Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said that "we should hold the elections in a free,
fair and impartial manner for the development of the country in
the days ahead and forget our prejudices of the past."
</P>
<P>
He said that as it is to hold the elections, the present
government will not take any other major decisions.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had been holding dialogs with other political
parties and calling for their participation in the government, and
he was still confident that more parties would join the
government.
</P>
<P>
The faction of RPP led by former prime minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand has expressed its willingness to enter while the
other faction led by former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa and
the main opposition CPN-ML had said no.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that the ongoing 15th session of parliament is
concluding in eventful political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that after winning the confidence vote, Koirala
would ask King Birendra to dissolve parliament for fresh polls.

LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) - British oil worker John Brooke
returned to Britain on Thursday after being held hostage for five
days by Yemeni tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the airport, John Brooke, 46,

reportedly seeking the release of an imprisoned fellow tribesman.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful end followed last month's operation by Yemeni
forces to free a group of western tourists kidnapped in the
Western Asian country, which ended in the death of three Britons

<HEADLINE> China Fells Fewer Trees to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved initial
but very positive progress in the implementation of a national
program to protect natural forests and the environment, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The provinces and regions where China's major natural forests
are located have all decided to significantly reduce their annual
logging, officials at a national meeting said.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Liaoning Province, an outright ban on the
felling of forests has been imposed in seven leading forest
zones, along with a partial ban in the remaining 11 large forests.
</P>
<P>
The logging ceiling within these 18 zones was reduced to 3.45
million cubic meters last year from an average 4.05 million cubic
meters that had been planned for the 1996-2000 period. The limit
will be cut back further, to 2.9 million cubic meters, this year,
and to 2.17 million cubic meters next year.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province, home to China's largest expanse of
forests, has set its annual logging volume at 6.17 million cubic
meters this year, down 521,000 cubic meters from 1998. The volume
limit for 2000 has been set at 4.19 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In central Hubei Province, which was gravely affected by the
worst flooding of the Yangtze River in more than four decades
last summer, the yearly logging volume has been reduced
eight-million cubic meters down to seven-million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Group said
that the flooding of the Nenjiang River in northeast China last
summer and autumn, and the desertification of the Hulun Buir
Prairie, one of the most important in China, have sounded the
death knell for forest resources in the Dahinggan Ling area.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend and protect the forests, Inner Mongolia
has readjusted its annual timber production down to a targeted
2.29 million cubic meters by the year 2000, 1.51 million cubic
meters less than for 1997, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The floods in the Yangtze River valley and in northeast China
have made us realize that a full-scale ban on logging coupled
with greater afforestation efforts are fundamental for the
effective flood control," said a State Forestry Bureau official.
</P>
<P>
Last year's flooding claimed more than 3,000 lives and
resulted in direct economic losses put at more than 150 billions
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of timber production is only one measure the
Chinese government has taken to protect its forests, said Zhang
Peichang, director of the State Natural Forest Protection and
Management Center.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is better planning and increased
afforestation efforts, which are of great significance for
sustained economic and social progress, Zhang noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Euro-Coin Related Copyright, Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
executive branch, the European Commission, cleared regulation
proposals Wednesday over the copyright on the design of euro
coins and a ban on the issue of euro collector coins, medals and
tokens until 2002, in a bid to protect euro coins.
</P>
<P>
The euro countries are responsible for issuing euro coins
subject to the approval of the volume by the European Central
Bank. And euro countries, represented by the commission, hold the
copyright of the designs which will appear on the common side of
euro coins.
</P>
<P>
But the opposite side of euro coins will show different
characteristics of participating countries.
</P>
<P>
The regulation proposals outline the regime applicable to the
reproduction of these designs: it lays down common reproduction
rules guaranteeing that the same approach is followed by the
commission and euro countries, and requires decentralized
enforcement of the copyright by member states according to their
national laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of this provision will involve the
commission assigning the copyright to each participating member
state through individual agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ban on the issue of collector coins within
EU-wide countries covers the transition period between January
1,1999 and January 1,2002. During this period, all coins, medals
and tokens are prohibited because those objects might be a source
of confusion or potential fraud.
</P>
<P>
This ban applies explicitly to those objects issued either by
official authorities or by private issuers within the EU member
states or outside, according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The ban also covers sale, issue, production or distribution
for commercial purposes of euro-inspired medals and tokens. But
the issue of medals and tokens for educational or testing
purposes will not be affected by this ban.

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Devolution for Modernizing Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Thursday made a passionate defense of his devolution
program, saying his plans would not spark an outbreak of English
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Blair
said people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland want a
changed relationship between their countries and the U.K.
</P>
<P>
"In today's world, it has to be a partnership, not simply an
old-style centralized UK with everything run out of Westminster (p
arliament) and Whitehall (the civil service) because that won't
work any more," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed comments by critics describing his devolution
plans as incoherent. "The driving force behind the idea of
constitutional change is to strengthen the country and make it
fit for the 21st century by modernizing its institutions", he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed suggestions that his ambitious devolution
plans would set off an ugly wave of English nationalism.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that you can't change the relationship between
England and Scotland for the 21st century without unleashing
unacceptable forces is absurd," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who said devolution was a central plank of his
political philosophy, also expressed his support for Britain's
big cities to directly elect their own mayors.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people live in the inner city. They often live
with poor schooling, high crime, low quality transportation and
an environment that doesn't encourage people to stay and raise
families," he said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea and U.S. to Establish Psychological Operations Task Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States Thursday agreed to establish a Combined Psychological
Operations Task Force against the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) in case of warfare.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Kim Jin-ho, chairman of the South
Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff and his U.S. counterpart Henry H.
Shelton at the 20th Military Committee Meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the task force will perform its mission
for DPRK people in the "Defcon 3" stage, when signs of a North
Korean invasion are detected. Now the defense condition level for
South Korean and U.S. troops here is four.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be headed by a South Korean general and be
put under the command of the South Korean-U.S. Combined Forces C
ommand.
</P>
<P>
The combined task force will organize the South Korean
military's psychological warfare capability and the U.S. forces'
state-of-the-art equipment, such as EC-130 "CommandoSolo"
aircraft, which is often called a "flying radio and television
station," which could be a useful tool for psychological
operations during a war.
</P>
<P>
Kim and Shelton will report the results of their talks to
Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here on Thursday after a four-day visit to Japan
to attend the annual South Korean-U.S. Security Consultative
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Cohen are expected to discuss the DPRK's development
of long-range missiles and suspected nuclear sites.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Welcomes Senate Move on Marcos Wealth Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada welcomed Thursday an offer by the senate to help Imelda
Marcos recover her family's wealth in exchange for identifying the
cronies of her late husband Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Thursday afternoon, Estrada said the
public would be duly informed of developments as soon as official
talks between his administration and the Marcoses begin regarding
recovery and disposition of the family's alleged ill-gotten
wealth.
</P>
<P>
Imelda said earlier that Marcos had entrusted to his cronies
500 billion pesos (12.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of assets in
the country's blue chip corporations.
</P>
<P>
"Well, the Senate and the Executive can help each other
convince Mrs. Marcos. So it will be a joint effort, I welcome
them," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Senators probing the wealth of the former first family said
they are ready to help Imelda recover their property but only
after she identifies the trustees of her late husband.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said that he met with Imelda's' son, Ilocos
Norte Governor Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., and they are about
to wrap up their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said he has also conducted "direct negotiations" with some
relatives of the Marcoses, like Marcos son-in-law Gregorio
"Greggy" Araneta.
</P>
<P>
Estrada promised to make sure that any deal forged will be
favorable to the people.

<HEADLINE> China Mass Produces DWDM Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Domestically manufactured
high-speed optical transmission equipment is expected to
effectively compete with similar foreign telecommunication
products in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The 8x2.5Gb/s Dense Wave Division Multiplexer (DWDM) System
developed by the Wuhan Research Institute of Posts and
Telecommunications passed official appraisal by the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Song Zhiyuan, director of MII's Telecommunications Science and
Technology Committee, said the system is up to the advanced
international technological levels in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The DWDM system is being used in a national fiber-optic trunk
cable linking Jinan and Qingdao in east China's Shandong
Province, the first and fastest fully operational
telecommunications line of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
China introduced DWDM technology in 1998 as part of an effort
to increase the transmission capacity of 13 fiber-optic trunk
cables across the country. Related cable systems currently
stretch over 20,000 kilometers. Current estimates indicate that
130 sets of DWDM equipment and 16 sets of auxiliary equipment
will be needed to complete the nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
A limited number of foreign companies, including U.S.-based
Lucent Technologies, formally supplied DWDM equipment to the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of mature network management software has
delayed completion of a Lucent DWDM project to upgrade a trunk
telecommunications link between Xi'an in northwest China and
Wuhan in central China.
</P>
<P>
MII experts pointed out that management software for the DWDM
equipment developed by the Wuhan Research Institute offers a
number of features far superior to most foreign equipment.
</P>
<P>
An official from the institute said that domestically manufac
tured equipment will sell for 50-75 less than related foreign
equipment, with network management software selling for a mere
five percent of the price for similar foreign products.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the institute will sell six sets of DWDM
equipment during 1999, with the total sales volume expected to
hit 110 million yuan (about 13 million U.S. dollars). The
institute plans to market 20 sets of equipment in the year 2000,
with the sales volume tripling to 370 million yuan.

<P>
China is in the process of developing the world's largest
fiber-optic cable network. DWDM technology offers a quick and
inexpensive method for increasing the capacity of the existing
network by 8 32 times. The use of DWDM systems will be the trend
for the future development of optical transmission technology
worldwide.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's tri-partite
government formed in late December to conduct fresh elections by
March/April 1999 Thursday won the vote of confidence in the Lower
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the 205-seat house, 136 lawmakers voted for the motion of
confidence in government while 40 voted against. Both factions of
the National Democratic Party (RPP) which have 18 seats abstained.
</P>
<P>
The victory is expected as the ruling Nepali Congress, the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and
the Nepal Sadbhavana Party enjoy a comfortable majority of 139
seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, a new government must obtain
the vote of confidence in the house within 30 days of its

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Nature Reserve to Be Established, Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- After walking through the
world's largest river canyon in southwest China, several
scientists called on state authorities to establish the area as a
nature reserve, the Worker's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yaluzangbu Daxiagu, the grand canyon astride the Yarlung
Zangbo River that winds through the Tibet Autonomous Region and
Yunnan Province, is abundant in plants and rare wild animals, the
Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yichou, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), and his colleagues spent four days going on foot
into the remote canyon.
</P>
<P>
The few and scattered local residents do their farming in a
primitive way and built their houses by cutting down the trees,
Yang said. A house there usually requires more than 100 trees, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Some expedition members had the rare sight of witnessing a
hunter kill seven bears in a single day. Many antelopes, which
are strictly protected by state law, were also randomly
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Yang and the three other scientists suggested
establishing a large national nature reserve for environmental
and biological protection.
</P>
<P>
The local government also should help residents there develop
a tourism-related economy, they said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf beat her injury
and opponent Venus Williams of the United States on Thursday,
booking her semifinal berth in the Sydney International tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Graf, suffering from stomach pains, rallied from a first set
deficit and a break in the third set to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4,
setting a semifinal showdown against world number one Lindsay
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tight situation and I guess I probably had a better
attitude towards it," said Graf, "I didn't feel nervous at all
but I felt she was getting a little nervous."
</P>
<P>
The German, tuning up for next week's Australian Open,
appeared to be heading out of the tournament after she fell 4-2
behind in the third set against one of the modern game's most
determined figures.
</P>
<P>
But Graf called on her vast reserves of experience to win the
next four games, saying "when I get in close situations I seem to
know the right things. I don't feel under pressure."
</P>
<P>
Davenport kept her grip on the top ranking with a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Switzerland's Patty Schynder.
</P>
<P>
The American was in danger of surrendering the number one slot
to Martina Hingis if she failed to reach the last four and her
Swiss rival took the Sydney title.
</P>
<P>
Hingis powered past Belgium's Dominique Van Roost 6-2, 6-0 and
said of her ranking duel with Davenport: "It means a lot to me, I
definitely want to get it back and I'm getting closer and closer
with every match."
</P>
<P>
Hingis play Barbara Schett in Friday's semifinals after the
Austrian won 12 of the last 13 games in an upset 1-6, 6-1, 6-0
victory over holder Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain.

<HEADLINE> Housing Sector Promotes Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's housing sector has
spurred economic development and is rapidly becoming a major
focus of consumer spending, according to Construction Minister Yu
Zhengsheng.
</P>
<P>
Yu attended today's closing session of a national construction
conference and told participants that China made remarkable
progress during 1998 by completing housing space covering 350
million sq.m., up 10 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country witnessed a 56 percent increase in housing space
sold during the January-November period last year, with a record
62 percent increase in housing sales.
</P>
<P>
Yu stressed that the booming housing sector has revived the
sluggish real estate market. He pointed out that individual
buyers have accounted for some 70 percent of total housing sales.
</P>
<P>
The per capita living space for urban residents has grown from
8.8 to nine sq.m., according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
He said that China maintained rational and stable real estate
development and investment growth in 1998. Housing construction
and sales continue to expand along with the revival of the real
estate market, said Yu, adding the priority has been placed on
the construction of ordinary housing.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the implementation of the housing reform, including
housing sales rather than government allocations, has played an
important role in developing the housing market.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate individual housing spending, commercial banks
recently introduced mortgages to stimulate housing purchases, and
a fund-raising system targeted at helping potential buyers has
been introduced nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Exports More Cocoa in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded a steady
increase in its cocoa export in 1998, thanks to high output and
weak local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times Thursday reported that the total export of the
commodity increased to 51,367 tons between January and November
1998, as against 34,288 tons in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the newspaper shows that there is also a slight
rise in the price, with a ton of graded cocoa beans being sold for
110,000 Naira (about 1,279 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exporters have attributed the high output to the favorable
weather conditions in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa was once a major farm product in Nigeria, with an annual
output of 400,000 tons in the 1950s. But its production dropped
rapidly in the late 1970s with the discovery and development of
oil in the large west African country.

the town of Qingyundian in Daxing County, and after three years
of production were able to develop bivalent trans-genic
virus-resistant hot pepper and tomato seeds, as well as the seeds
of trans-genic tomatoes which can be preserved for three months
at temperatures between 28 and 31 degrees centigrade.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Coalition Government Formed Between LDP, LP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Thursday formed a coalition government between his
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Liberal
Party (LP) by absorbing LP General Secretary Takeshi Noda.
</P>
<P>
Noda, who was named as Home Affairs Minister, was the only LP
member in the cabinet, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu
Nonaka at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The coalition's formation would bring the ruling bloc a
11-seat majority in the House of Councilors (upper house), where
the LDP fails to get a majority.
</P>
<P>
The LDP enjoys a majority in the House of Representatives, the
more powerful lower house of the Diet (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
At Obuchi's request, three original cabinet members submitted
their resignations earlier in the day to pave the way for the new
government while other 17 retained their posts.
</P>
<P>
The three were Home Affairs Minister Mamoru Nishida, National
Land Agency chief Kichio Inoue, who also serves as head of the
Hokkaido and Okinawa development agencies, and Science and
Technology Agency chief Yutaka Takeyama.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also reduced the number of ministers in the new cabinet
to 18 from 20, as agreed with LP leader Ichiro Ozawa to reform
the country's administrative and political system.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the LDP and LP cleared the final hurdle blocking
the launch of the coalition after reaching an agreement on the
controversial security issues.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have been negotiating policy issues since
Obuchi and LP leader Ichiro Ozawa agreed last November to form
the coalition before the next regular Diet session, which
convenes January 19.

<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices jumped in Tokyo
Thursday as the U.S. dollar's rapid rise against the yen overrode
negative factors such as the devaluation of the Brazilian
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 335.26 points, or 2.50
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 13,738.86.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering
all First Section issues, rose 12.86 points or 1.22 percent to
1,069.94.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 393.96
million shares, up from Wednesday's 375.54 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Trust and Banking was Thursday's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
The economic turmoil in Brazil rendered New York stock prices
lower Wednesday, but the fall on Wall Street was smaller, than
expected, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The stability on Wall Street, combined with the dollar's surge
against the yen, urged investors in Tokyo to buy back stocks
after the declines over the past few weeks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the dollar's strength, exporters, such as
high-tech blue chips and automakers, attracted buying orders,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers surpassed
losers 734 to 399, with 163 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Exports of Technology-Intensive Products Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's exports of capital-
and technology-intensive industrial products grew considerably in
1998 in spite of the overall decline in export growth, according
to Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures released earlier this week show that the value
of related export goods, mainly mechanical and electronic
products, rose by 12.2 percent on 1997 to 66.54 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of related products to overall exports climbed
from 32 percent to 36.2 percent. Overall exports for 1998 grew by
0.5 percent to 183.76 billion US dollars. Exports of primary
goods fell 14 percent to 20.6 billion US dollars, with declining
exports of labor-intensive products such as garments and
accessories, footwear, yarn and knitwear, as well as travel bags
and related products.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the decline in exports of primary goods due
to the sluggish international economy and the fact that supply
has exceeded demand.
</P>
<P>
They also point to the fact that rising exports of capital-
and technology-intensive products indicates improvements in
China's export structure, and rising quality levels which enhance
the competitiveness of related products on the international
market.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi said at today's press conference that China has been
informed of France's suggestions on the settlement of the Iraqi
issue, and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will hold discussions
with the French side during his coming official visit to France.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning China's closure of an
international trust and investment company of Guangdong Province,
Sun said this move demonstrated the Chinese government's
determination to reduce domestic financial risks. While
protecting the interest of local and overseas legal creditors,
the move will also help reinforce supervision over financial
bodies, prevent and dissolve financial problems, and increase the
transparency of China's financial operations.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on the theater missile defense system
(TMDS) Sun said the building of such a system is harmful to both
regional and global strategic balance and stability. It will do
no good to nuclear disarmament, and can only cause a new arms
race. China is deeply concerned with the issue, and has made its
position clear on many separate occasions, Sun said, expressing
the hope relevant countries would adopt a cautious attitude and
settle the issue through dialogue and consultation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Down Off Its Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed down Thursday but off its lows after unemployment fell to
an eight-year low as the long bond prices weakened, indicating the
economy was in "reasonably good shape," analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened sharply lower after foreign equities markets
plunged overnight on news of the devaluation of the Brazilian
currency, the real, and the resignation of the country's central
bank chief Gustavo Franco.
</P>
<P>
"The market started off weak because of the overseas weakness,"
funds manager Ausbil Partners equities director Paul Xiradis said.
</P>
<P>
"It improved during the day because of some positive Australian
statistics and improvement in the long bond rate over the last
couple of days, and that confirms that the Australian economy is
in a reasonably good state."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Thursday that
employment in December rose 53,600, seasonally adjusted, with an
eight-year low in the unemployment rate of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 17.2 points, or 0.61 percent,
lower at 2804.8, off a low of 2793.7.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 371.76 million shares valued at 1.074
billion Australian dollars (676.6 million U.S. dollars), with 665
falls easily outnumbering 453 rises and 419 steady stocks.
</P>
<P>
News Corp, National Australia Bank and Lend Lease Corp limited
the industrial sector losses, with the all industrials index
losing 12.6 points to 5031.3, off a low of 4999.3.
</P>
<P>
BHP, which plunged 56.8 or 4.44 percent, and weaker commodity
prices led the resources sector down, with all resources index
shedding 25.7 points to 986.1.
</P>
<P>
News Corp gained 25.2 cents, National Australia Bank gained
15.9 and Lend Lease Corp gained 38.7.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 21.6 cents, ANZ Banking
Group lost 21 cents and Westpac Banking Corp dropped 15 cents.

In the resources sector, WMC dropped 22 cents, or 4.10 percent,
Rio Tinto fell 20 cents and Woodside Petroleum dipped two.
</P>
<P>
Australian National Industries gained five cents, or 4.07
percent, after the Smorgon Steel Group took management control of
the heavy engineering group and announced interim changes to the
company's board.
</P>

A 2.30 U.S. dollars fall in gold bullion's price in New York
led the gold index 16.2 points, or 1.43 percent, lower to 1130.3.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Continues Mop-up Operations in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG is now involved in mop-up operations in Sierra
Leone's capital of Freetown and has begun simultaneous offensive
throughout the country, according to a Nigerian Defense
Headquarters spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Defense Information Lieut. Col. Adeoye Tella
noted Wednesday that the ECOMOG troops are now in full control of
the capital city and the rebels have now gone into hiding, media
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman explained how the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and its allied forces infiltrated Freetown last
week, saying that the rebels carrying luggage looked like
refugees, making it difficult to differentiate between them and
true refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels and their allies don't have a uniform and this
makes them to move freely with people," Tella said, adding that
"what they do is to come out of the village, enter people's homes
to kill or maim and thereafter retreat to the bush."
</P>
<P>
Although the defense spokesman confirmed that some casualties
were recorded on the ECOMOG side during the recent rebels'
invasion of Freetown, he was not specific on the actual number of
lives the invasion claimed among the Nigerian soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Declines as Brazilian Real Devalues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
languished Thursday closing weaker after a dramatic night of
Brazilian-inspired losses.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's eighth largest economy, on Wednesday night
devalued its real currency by almost nine percent and had its
central bank president resign.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar initially sold off at the news, falling
to a low of 62.87 U.S. cents from its close of 63.53 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The domestic unit gained a little on the opening of trade
Thursday before drifting off again to spend most of the day in a
tight range and close trading at 63.11 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was also buying 0.5429 euro
from 0.5495 Wednesday, while the euro was buying 1.1626 U.S.
dollars from 1.1563.
</P>
<P>
BNP senior strategist, group treasury, Clifford Bennett said
the overnight fall in the Australian dollar was due mainly to the
action in Brazil, which had slowed global demand for commodities
and pushed prices down over recent days.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie is responding to those commodity price movements of
the last two days which has all been largely Brazil driven,"
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
"It has become patently clear again to global markets that
commodity exporting currencies are going to be under pressure in a
sustained way."
</P>
<P>
HSBC Markets chief dealer Mike Hollows said while sentiment in
the market was bearish the momentum to push it lower was lacking.
</P>
<P>
"That's mainly due to uncertainty over what's going to happen
over the next day or so."
</P>
<P>
Hollows said the strong employment growth reported Thursday by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics was a slight stimulus for the
local currency.
</P>
<P>
Hollows said given current uncertainty it was tricky to
forecast the short-term movements in the domestic currency, but he
expected it would be capped at 63.35 U.S. cents and would not fall
below 62.50.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade, Australian dollar was at 71.43 Japanese
yen from 71.42.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Bus Leaves Lahore for New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A 26-seat bus carrying
Pakistani officials left Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city,
Thursday for New Delhi on a trial run of the proposed Lahore-Delhi
bus service.
</P>
<P>
The bus began its journey from Lahore at 6:30 a.m. and is
scheduled to reach the Indian capital in the evening after
completing 500-kilometer journey in almost 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Pakistan Tourism Department, Interior,
Communication and Foreign Ministries were on the bus to New Delhi
and will hold talks with their counterparts to give final touch of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first ever Indian bus arrived in Lahore on January 8 on
trial run to establish road link between the two south Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
Commercial bus service between the two countries is expected to
start earlier next month though the two governments have yet to
announce the date.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a bus service has been introduced
between India and Pakistan since they were formed in 1947. The two
neighbors have gone to war three times since then.
</P>
<P>
The move to establish the road link follows talks between
officials of India and Pakistan after the leaders of the two
countries met last September. The step is part of
confidence-building measures started last year between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
People from both countries, divided by partition more than 50
years ago, had been visiting each other either by air or through a
rail link, which operates once a week.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India signed agreement on the introduction of the
Lahore-Delhi bus service in Islamabad on December 3 last year. The
two sides have chalked out details on the timing, fare structure,
periodicity and halts of the bus that would be the first between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in his meeting with his Indian
counterpart Atal Behari Vajayee in New York in September last
year, had shown interest in the project on humanitarian grounds to
facilitate members of the divided families to easily visit their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a Pakistani bus will drop passengers at
New Delhi with three halts on the Indian site. The bus will cross
the international boarder at Wahga about 22 kilometers of Lahore
city.

NEW YORK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Three lawsuits were filed
Wednesday against American companies which allegedly lure
thousands of Asians to make clothing in the U.S. territory of
Saipan in cramped, rat-infested quarters, Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Saipan, a tropical isle in Central Pacific, was described by
one lawyer as "America's worst sweatshop" where more than 50,000
Asians have been recruited to make clothing tagged "Made in the
USA."
</P>
<P>
The three lawsuits, filed by the human rights groups, Asian
law caucus and other organizations, seek more than 1 billion U.S.
dollars in damages for conditions that have persisted for more
than 10 years in Saipan.
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuits, some 32 Saipan factories forced
people to work up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and
threatened them with beatings and verbal abuse if they refused
unpaid overtime to meet quotas set by factory managers.
</P>
<P>
Workers' passports were confiscated upon arrival. They were
not allowed to leave the factory and their social activities were
strictly monitored.

companies accountable for alleged mistreatment of workers.

<HEADLINE> China Produces New Deer Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A new species of red deer that
is easy to breed has been developed in China after 15 years
research, thanks to special biotechnology expertise.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Zhao Yufang, a
scientist at the Harbin Special Local Product Research Institute
in northeast China's Heilongjiang province, who spent his time
studying artificial and cross-fertilization.
</P>
<P>
The antlers of red deer are considered very valuable for
medicines but the animals have a low survival rate of only 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's hugely successful breeding results have increased that
survival rate to as high as 90 percent, thus making the animal
easier to breed.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that a buck from his new herd, which is already 250
strong, can impregnate 500 to 1,000 hinds every year, twenty
times the previous figure.

</P>
<P>
Xie Zhiqiang and Qing Lianbin, associate professors with the
Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, conducted
the survey of prefectural-level officials attending training
courses at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Only 5.8 percent of respondents listed education and the
ongoing publicity campaign which eulogizes model workers from
different walks of life as an effective means for improving
public morale.
</P>
<P>
The results differed sharply from a 1997 survey which showed
that 22.3 percent of respondents cited the merits of education
and the publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
Xie and Qing concluded that Party and government officials
have concurred that instituting effective anti-corruption
mechanisms within the Party and the government are more
effective, and indeed crucial for winning public confidence.

<HEADLINE> 2 in 5 Children Suffer From Asthma in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia is one of the top
three "wheezy" countries in the world, with two in five children
suffering from asthma, a report on child health has found.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Children - Their Health and Well-being, was
released Thursday, the first national report to focus on the
health of Australian kids from birth to age 15.
</P>
<P>
A national health survey in 1995, conducted as part of the
report, found that 25 percent of Australian primary school
children reported "wheezing" in the past 12 months, and 40 percent
of school kids had "wheezed" at some stage during their lives.
</P>
<P>
The report said 10 percent of primary school children
questioned had reported having asthma as a recent illness.
</P>
<P>
"A wheezy chest after physical exertion was most common among
10 to 14-year-olds," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Almost one-quarter of children had a wheezy/whistly chest and
19 percent of children were reported to wake up due to coughing."
</P>
<P>
The report said the prevalence of asthma in primary school
children had increased over the past decade and asthma had become
one of the most common causes of school children ending up in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Estimated rates of doctor-diagnosed asthma in this age group
(school-age) are now approximately 35 percent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996/97, the rate of hospitalization with a principal
diagnosis of asthma was 796 per 100,000 children.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said deaths due to asthma were uncommon and
appeared to have declined since 1987, although no consistent trend
was found.
</P>
<P>
"Recent international comparison studies, using the same
questionnaires, place asthma prevalence rates in Australian
children in the top two or three countries in the world," the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Economist Predicts More Exports to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to Japan may
rise this year after a sharp drop in 1998, according to
prediction of a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jian, associate researcher with the World Economic and
Political Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
said that although China's exports to Japan decreased by a wide
margin last year due to Japan's economic recession and the drop
in the Japanese yen, the situation will improve as China
implements a series of measures to encourage exports this year.
</P>
<P>
"The drop in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen stopped
recently and there is an indication that it will rise," Zhou
said, adding that this will be conducive to Japan's import from
China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that Japan is still China's most important
trading partner, and China is Japan's second biggest importer
after the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Japan consist mainly of fiber products,
machinery, food, metal products and mineral fuel.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Travelers to Vietnam Down 6.3 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- 1.6 million foreigners traveled
to Vietnam in 1998, marking a 6.3 percent decrease compared with
1997, Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Tourism Administration attributed the drop to the
financial crisis in Asia, as the majority of foreign tourists to
Vietnam come from Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of domestic travelers increased by 11.7
percent to  reach nearly 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's tourism sector has 80 businesses
involved in international travel and 230 others in domestic
travel.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,000 hotels operating in Vietnam at
present with about 56,000 rooms. Of them, 336 hotels with 15,000
rooms have been rated at international standard, including three
five-star, five four-star and 50 three-star hotels.
</P>
<P>
The sector licensed six more foreign investment projects
capitalized at more than 810 million U.S. dollars in 1998,
bringing the number of the foreign-direct-investment projects in
the sector to 282.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Tourism Administration has mapped out a national
program of tourism with the aim of receiving two million foreign
tourists and 11 million domestic travelers by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Falls to 8-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate
crashed to its lowest level in more than eight years in December
following a surge in the number of people finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in its report
issued Thursday that the unemployment rate fell to a
seasonally-adjusted 7.5 percent in December, down half a
percentage point from 8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest unemployment rate since September 1990.
</P>
<P>
The fall was fueled by 53,600 new jobs, including 31,700 new
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the number of unemployed people fell by 44,300 to
706,500 seasonally adjusted in December.
</P>
<P>
The result was better than financial market expectations, which
centered on a slight fall in the unemployment rate to about 7.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the results were mixed across the states.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment fell in New South Wales to 6.7 percent from 7.8
percent the previous month, Victoria to 7.4 percent from 7.8
percent in November and South Australia to 9.2 percent from 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
But unemployment rose marginally in other states, climbing to
8.5 percent in Queensland from 8.2 percent in November, to 7.3
percent in Western Australia from 7.1 percent, and up to 10.3
percent in Tasmania from 9.8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Acting federal Treasurer and Employment Minister Robert Hill
said the figures were encouraging but also revealed monthly
volatility.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics, while encouraging, reveal the volatile
nature of the monthly figures," Hill said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is clear that the coalition's management of the
economy is contributing to the platform for jobs growth."

CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Financial
Times International (FTSE) have agreed to introduce a new index
tracking the performance of locally listed companies, the Financial
Mirror reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new index, to be called FTSE/CySE, is expected to make its
debut by the end of this spring. It will be designed by FTSE
international and calculated by the CSE.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- A sharp jump in December credit card sales helped
boost the total card sales for 1998 to 285.1 million Cyprus pounds
(570.2 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 36 percent from 1997,
the Financial Mirror reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by JCC Payment Systems Ltd.,
local card sales rose 28 percent in December to 25.1 million
pounds (50.2 million dollars), compared with the same period the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign credit card transactions climbed 10 percent
in December to 4.8 million pounds (9.6 million dollars) compared
with 4.35 million pounds (8.7 million dollars) in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the whole 1998, foreign credit card sales reached 104
million pounds (208 million dollars), representing a 22 percent
increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Trans-Mediterranean Airlines, Lebanon's national
cargo carrier, plans to replace its fleet with new aircraft in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as part of an expansion plan aimed at moving
the company to profitability by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Fadi Saab, the chairman of airline, said the carrier will phase
out its current five Boeing 707-320Cs and replace them with new
aircraft by 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking long-range planes with a cargo capacity of
around 60 tonnes instead of the current 40 tonnes," he added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Flemings, an international financial analyst body,
has said that Lebanon's national currency was overvalued by 45
percent, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said in its report that the Lebanese pound is apparently
extremely overvalued, the current account deficit is large and the
overall balance has turned negative in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate between the dollar and Lebanese pound
is 1:1508.
</P>
<P>
The report said the rapid inflation in Lebanon has seen the
currency become increasingly overvalued since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Since mid-1996, the Lebanese currency has been over 40
percent overvalued, although the rate of real exchange rate
appreciation has slowed along with inflation," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese government is planning to borrow 500 million
dollars to finance a number of projects, the Arabic newspaper An
Nahar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the construction of a vocational school in
the south, the outfitting of Beirut government hospital and the
treatment of waste water in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
"The loans will carry a 2 to 3 percent interest rate on a
period of 20 to 25 years," the Finance Minister George Korom
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Islamic Development Bank, the Kuwaiti Fund
for Development and the government of Italy are among the
lenders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the new
Japanese government will make active efforts for the resurgence
of the Japanese economy and the vitalization of the Asian
economy, and continue to take the road of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remark
here this afternoon at the routine press conference in response
to a question concerning the new Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a state
visit to Japan last November, and thanks to the joint efforts of
the two sides, important results have been achieved during the
visit in terms of reviewing the past and looking into the future,
which is conducive to the development of the Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed that they will bring a sound, steady
and lasting Sino-Japanese relationship into the 21st century,
which accords with the fundamental interests of the people of the
two countries and will exert positive influence on peace and
development in the Asian-Pacific region and the world as a whole,
added Sun.
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of learning from the history and facing the
future, he said, the two sides announced to establish a friendly
and cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development, whic
h is the direction of advancing the bilateral ties and marks a
new phase of development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the two countries should make concerted
efforts to realize the goal, stressed Sun.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Shed 0.88 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks prices
continued to
drop Thursday but closed firm above the 10,000-point support level
after
Brazil devalued its currency and sparked an overnight fall in
stock
markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index dipped 90.64 points, or 0.88
percent, to
end the day at 10,183.13. Following Wednesday's slump of more than
400
points, the market opened sharply lower Thursday and tumbled to
the
day's low of 9,907 points in the morning session, but recovered
part of
the lost ground before afternoon close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the devaluation of Brazilian currency
Wednesday
added concerns to the market, which had already been weakened by
debt
problems of China-related firms. The widespread fall on Wall
Street and
other overseas markets also produced a negative impact on Hong
Kong stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Donald
Tsang said here Thursday that the contagion from Brazil, the
world's
eighth largest economy, may not be too great though its impact on
other
markets was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the situation can be stabilized in one to two days. I
think we
should not be too alarmed," said Tsang, who added that currency
devaluation in Brazil should have little direct impact on Hong
Kong
considering the small volume of direct trade between the two
places.
</P>
<P>
But he warned: "We are in a global economy, so every region and
every
financial center may be affected to a certain extent."
</P>
<P>
China plays continued to slip, but at a mild pace Thursday. The
red-
chip Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporation Index lost 1.19
percent; the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares rose by 0.76 percent, but utility, property,
commercial
and industrial stocks all fell.
</P>
<P>
Turnover grew to 7.693 billion HK dollars (986 million US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Kenya Posts 1.6 Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya posted gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 1.6 percent from October 1997 to October
1998, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said in its latest monthly
economic review.
</P>
<P>
"The slow growth in economic activity continued into october
1998," the CBK said in the January issue available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on output from selected economic activities, real GDP is
 estimated to have grown by 1.6 percent in the 12 months to
October 1998 compared with 2.3 percent in calendar 1997 and 1.5
percent in the 12 months to June 1998," according to the review.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed the poor growth on a decline in the production
of cash crops, trade, manufacturing, transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Weakened infrastructure, particularly roads and
telecommunication services, reduced foreign aid in the last two
years. Increased insecurity are also among main factors leading to
a depressed economy, the bank noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Export Body Urges Members to Buy Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Export
Confederation Inc. (Philexport) Thursday urged its members to buy
more dollars in the market to cushion the impact of an impending
currency crunch resulting from the devaluation of the Brazilian
real.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, Philexport President Sergio-Ortiz
Luis said that this is the right time to do it in light of the
plan of the Central Bank of the Philippines to beef up the dollar
reserves to about 30 billion U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It is much cheaper to do it now because the foreign exchange
rate is pegged between 38-39 pesos to a dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Luis said that the government is making every effort to see to
it that the peso value will not depreciate to a level that is
detrimental to the interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis will not affect much the local export
industry even if the value of the Brazilian currency slid further.
</P>
<P>
Brazil effectively devalued the real by 8.3 percent by removing
a tight trading band Wednesday, as a battle of political will
between the national and state governments threatened to undermine
the prospects of an economic bailout by the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Luis said that the Philippines still enjoys an advantage over
its neighbors as far as export destinations are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The United States absorbs more than 30 percent of Philippine
exports, while Europe, which used to import 12 percent of the
Philippine products, is now buying roughly 30 percent of the
country's exports and overtaking Japan as the number two export
destination, Luis said.
</P>
<P>
The simplification of the method of trade transactions, using
the Euro currency, will even encourage local exporters to expand
their operations, he said.

The Post Express:

</P>
<P>
This Day:

-- Following the poor performance of the People's Democratic
Party in the six southwest states in last Saturday's gubernatorial

<HEADLINE> Korda Starts Legal Challenge over ITF Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Open champion Petr
Korda has lodged a legal challenge to the International Tennis
Federation's (ITF) planned appeal against the leniency of his
penalty for testing positive to steroids.
</P>
<P>
Korda's lawyers have begun proceedings in the High Court in
England in a bid to stop the ITF appealing its independent
panel's decision not to impose a one-year ban on him in the Court
of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
"It's completely in the hands of my lawyers," Korda said today
at the Colonial Classic Tourney in Melbourne, Australia, a
warm-up event for his Australian Open title defense starting next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the court if the ITF can appeal its own
decision."
</P>
<P>
Korda said he'd been instructed not to discuss the appeal and
he couldn't speculate on its chances of success.
</P>
<P>
"I want to play tennis at this time, I am not concentrating on
what's happening over there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You never know your chances in your life, you can't predict
it.
</P>
<P>
"When we go on court we can't say for sure we are going to win.
</P>
<P>
"It's in the hands of my lawyers and I will follow them. If I
had the right I would talk about it."
</P>
<P>
The ITF independent appeals board ruled originally that
because of "exceptional circumstances" it would not impose a
12-month ban on the Czech.
</P>
<P>
Instead he was fined his Wimbledon prize money of around
90,000 U.S. dollars and the computer points earned from the event.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Korda will have to defend his Australian Open title
without the benefit of a seeding.
</P>
<P>
As is customary, the Australian Open organizers went according
to the world rankings when they allotted the 16 seedings for the
men's field.
</P>
<P>
Korda's ranking fell to 21st on Monday after he was beaten in
the opening round in the year's first tournament in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Korda said he wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
"It's the same anyway, I don't mind to be not seeded. The only
advantage is you're not facing one of the first 16 guys. If I
draw one, I'll have the same attitude. I'll come to the court try
and fight as hard as I can and play the best tennis that I can,"
he said.

ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's new Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit Wednesday issued
a circular on strengthening ties with Central Asian countries and
the ethnic Turkish communities abroad.
</P>
<P>
The circular came just three days after Ecevit became prime
minister and ended a 45-day-long government crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said "we can not
find a third country to send Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). There is the possibility
that the PKK leader can be judged in Italy."
</P>
<P>
"In the last two weeks, Italian Secret Service failed in an
attempt to find a third country to send the PKK chief," said
D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The euro is expected to increase Turkey's foreign trade and
is beneficial for Turkey to search for partners among European
firms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an increase in Turkey's foreign trade with
Europe will be high as long as the euro is accepted by Turkish
markets, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Health experts have proved
that drinking one cup of soybean milk each day offers effective
treatment for anemic and underweight rural Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate for anemia suffered by male students who
used soybean milk for 18 months dropped from 22 percent to 14
percent, with the rate for female students falling from 26
percent to 18 percent, according to a report in today's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of underweight children, a common symptom of
insufficient protein levels, also decreased by six percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The increased consumption of soybean products has been
emphasized since the State Council's approval of the national
Soybean Action Plan in 1996. A number of rural schools were
selected to pioneer the project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Agriculture, Health and Education ministries
joined the State Administration of Light Industry in launching a
balanced diet plan. The goal of the plan is to provide
inexpensive high quality soybean products which are rich in
protein, including soybean powder for nutritious drinks.
</P>
<P>
Twelve manufacturers of high quality soybean products have
been selected as demonstration enterprises, according to the
report.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A 10,000-year-old stone
age site has been discovered in Midrand, which is between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, the Midrand Metropolitan Local Council
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery near the Juskei Valley was made with the help of
Professor Revil Mason, retired head of the archaeology research
unit at the Johannesburg-based Witwatersrand University.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time ever that a constructed stone age
shelter has been discovered south of Egypt," said Mason.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 stone knives and axes were found inside the
shelter.
</P>
<P>
"The interesting point about the discovery is that it shows
that stone age people who lived in Midrand and other parts in
Africa at that time were not far behind their counterparts living
in Europe and Asia, who were the earliest people to build their
own homes," said the professor.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries coincide with an international archaeological
summit in Cape Town where archaeologists will discuss among other
things the recent excavation in South Africa which suggest humans
originated in Africa about five million years ago.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The peace summit on the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scheduled for January 16-17 has
been rescheduled to a later date to allow for the completion of
discussions by officials from the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Public Relations and
Press aide Richard Sakala as saying Wednesday that foreign affairs
and defense ministers from Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Libya,
and representatives of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations had arrived here for a preliminary meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ministers from other SADC states have started
jetting into the country for the long-awaited summit on the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the ministerial meeting would form the basis of
the agenda for the summit when it convenes at a date to be

<P>
Sakala said that the delegates who had arrived had already
started preliminary talks ahead of the summit which has been

of the meeting of ministers of defense and foreign affairs and
officials from the OAU, the UN and SADC," he said.

preliminary meetings which would make it difficult to set a
specific date for it now.

<HEADLINE> Official Detained for Southwest China Bridge Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A deputy Party secretary of
Qijiang County in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality has
been detained for his role in a local bridge collapse on January
4 which claimed 40 lives and injured 14 others, local authorities
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shiyuan, 38, is being held by local police on suspicion of
taking bribes, dereliction of duty and trying to destroy criminal
evidence, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations found that while in charge of the Rainbow
 Bridge project, Lin accepted more than 100,000 yuan (about
12,000 U.S. dollars) in bribes from the contractor, who was not
qualified to build the bridge.
</P>
<P>
A local source revealed that Lin and the contractor were
former classmates at a school of architecture.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, local authorities found out that the Rainbow
Bridge collapsed as a result of serious quality problems, and
quickly detained the contractor and three other persons believed
to be responsible for the collapse. Two local officials, incl
uding Lin, were also suspended from their duties and became
subject to investigation.
</P>
<P>
An official in Qijiang said that by Thursday, the bodies of
most of the victims, including 22 civilians and 18 soldiers of
the armed police force, had been cremated, and local authorities
are still waiting for the relatives of three soldiers from Henan
and Yunnan Provinces to arrive to bid a final farewell.
</P>
<P>
Among the 14 injured, two have completely recovered and have
left the hospital, while one seriously injured has been
transferred to the Chongqing Emergency Aid Center for further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the government of Qijiang County has
begun a comprehensive examination of the engineering quality of
all local structures built in recent years, and has uncovered a
number of new problems and hidden dangers.
</P>
<P>
Local structures of sub-standard construction include a bridge
being built by the same contractor who built the collapsed
Rainbow Bridge, a square in front of the county government
building with a two-story underground market underneath, a bridge
built in 1995 and now in use, and a number of roads and
residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
The local government has forbidden any further construction or
use of these structures, a local source said.

<HEADLINE> Korda Takes Legal Action Against ITF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Czech tennis star Petr Korda
on Thursday launched legal action against the International
Tennis Federation (ITF), who are appealing against an independent
panel's lenient punishment on him after his failure in a drug tes
t.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player said his lawyers had begun proceedings in the
English High Court in a bid to stop the ITF from going to the
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Korda tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at last
year's Wimbledon but an ITF independent panel only cut his
Wimbledon prize money and computer ranking points instead of a
customary one-year ban, provoking a storm of player outrage.
</P>
<P>
Korda's lawyers will argue that the ITF is not entitled to
appeal against the independent panel's decision.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear-Detecting Station to Be Set Up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A station for detecting nuclear
 explosions is to be set up in Uganda this year to ensure that no
nuclear tests are done in the region.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, to be installed in the southwestern district of
Mbarara, is part of a worldwide network for monitoring nuclear
explosions, Thursday's New Vision newspaper quoted a nuclear
evaluation officer as saying here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Dindi, a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization officer, told a regional seismology conference at
Makerere University that over 300 stations scattered around the
globe will detect nuclear explosions and transmit the data to a
central station in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was adopted in 1996 and Uganda is a signatory to it.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the station is Uganda's contribution to the
international efforts to stop the carrying out of nuclear tests,
the officer said, adding that 20 other African countries will
receive such facilities.
</P>
<P>
Fred Tugume, an official of the Geology Department of the
university, said that the station, most likely to be built in
Kyahi forest between February and April 1999, will also be used
for monitoring local earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> India's GDP Growth in 1998-99 to Reach 4.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Center for Monitoring
Indian Economy has estimated that the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow by 4.5 percent this fiscal year
and the rate is likely to continue during fiscal 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The center has revised downward the industrial production
growth for the corporate sector showing lower sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
After three years of 7-percent growth, the Indian economy grew
by less than 5 percent and the center believes that it would not
be more than 4.5 percent this fiscal year (April 1, 1998-March 31,
1999).
</P>
<P>
Growth in agricultural production has been estimated at 1.5
percent, industrial production at around 4 percent and services
marginally higher than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Projections for industrial output were revised downward from
4.5 percent to 4 percent," the center said in its monthly review
of the Indian economy.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for 1999-2000 are not encouraging either, with
agriculture projected to grow by only 2 to 3 percent depending on
the distribution of rains in the next season.
</P>
<P>
Investment proposals have also been declining and there are no
indications of a reversal of this status in the coming months.
Competition from cheap imports would continue to plague the
domestic industry and the industrial sector is not likely to grow
by more than 5 percent in the coming year, the center said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav People Angry at U.S. Subversive Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- People of various circles in
the Yugoslav Federation held rallies on Wednesday to protest
against the subversive attempt by the United States to overturn
the current authorities of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the association of senior soldiers in Loznica
expressed their indignation at the U.S. attempt, saying that the
U.S. has interfered in the internal affairs of a sovereign
country and violates the international law and the charter of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic union of Belgrade also urged those so-called
"democrats" who receive funding from abroad to stop immediately
their cooperation with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
and not to do anything harmful to Yugoslavia's interests.
</P>
<P>
According to a CIA confidential document fully published by
the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency on Tuesday, the U.S. government
has been planning to support the anti-government groups in
Yugoslavia as a way to overturn the authority of the country.
</P>
<P>
The document distributed by the CIA last December urged the
U.S. administration to increase this year's funding to the
"democrats" in Yugoslavia from 15 million U.S. dollars to 35
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The money should be focused on "training leaders of a new
generation who respect pluralism in politics and market reform,
and are devoted to establish a country ruled by law," said the
document.
</P>
<P>
It also specified the amount of the money for different
anti-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the document, Serbian Vice Prime Minister Ratko
Markovic told a news conference on Tuesday that the U.S. is wrong
to think that it can buy anything with dollars. The dignity of
Yugoslavia will never be bought by money, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Introduce Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Telegraph and
Telephone Board (BTTB) will introduce Internet service soon,
according to Post and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim.
</P>
<P>
After the introduction of the Internet service, a competitive
atmosphere would be created in the field of Internet services
between public and private sectors and greater facilities would be
ensured for the subscribers in the country, The Independent daily
newspaper quoted Nasim quoted as saying here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 18 private organizations are providing
Internet connections, linking Bangladesh with the world of modern
information technology, and all of them are doing so through
"V-Sat."
</P>
<P>
But now, the Canada-based Tele-Globe organization will provide
services to the subscribers with its link to the world Internet
connection through direct satellite circuit, according to BTTB
sources.
</P>
<P>
As a result, BTTB will be able to ensure a stronger system than
the "V-Sat" as rendered by the private organizations, they added.
</P>
<P>
The satellite circuit of the BTTB Internet service will be a
able to include 32 telephone lines at a time in its server to get
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
The BTTB has fixed 2,000 taka (about 41.24 U.S. dollars) for
each Internet connection and the Internet user is to pay only one
taka (about 0.02 dollars) per minute between 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The BTTB will start providing Internet service through
advertising within a few days.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Bans Dual Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has ruled out dual
citizenship and said a stateless person has no right to live or
travel in Myanmar and has to be held in a place designated by the
state.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a section of the country's Citizenship Law, the
official New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Thursday that Myanmar
cannot allow dual citizenship because it takes seriously the value
of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted another part of the Myanmar Citizenship
Law promulgated in 1982 as saying a person ceases to be a citizen
from the day he or she leaves the country permanently or acquires
the citizenship of another country or takes a passport of another
country.
</P>
<P>
A person, who ceases to be a Myanmar citizen, no longer has the
right to live in Myanmar as a citizen originally does but is to be
sent to a country which can accept him or her, the paper said. It
added that if no country accepts him or her, the person will
become stateless and has no right to live or travel in Myanmar as
a citizen or a foreigner but has to be held in a place designated
by the state.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the new Citizenship Law in 1982, abolishing
the 1948 Union Citizenship Act and the Union Citizenship
(Election) Acts.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Incurs More Debt in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
inching toward an internal debt trap and may get caught in one
unless the fiscal deficit is checked in time, a latest report
warned.
</P>
<P>
The fortnightly official report entitled "Markets Outlook" said
an interesting feature of the current borrowings vis-a-vis last
year has been the sharply higher repayment obligations. Repayments
in the 1998-99 fiscal year (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999) have
been 60 percent higher than last year, consuming nearly one-third
of the gross amount raised.
</P>
<P>
"A gradual depreciation of the rupee (local currency) would be
more desirable than its continued stability in the spot and
forward markets as it could act as a source of future volatility,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The gross market borrowing of the government is likely to
exceed the budgeted amount. The Reserve Bank of India has already
completed the central government's gross borrowing requirements of
784.61 billion rupees (18.86 billion U.S. dollars)," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"With another quarter to go and the Finance Ministry voicing
concern on the fiscal front, the final gross borrowing could
exceed the budget estimates by at least 100 billion rupees (2.4
billion dollars)," the report added.

KUNMING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The area of tropical forest in
the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve has expanded to 243,000 hectares
from 198,000 hectares in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate is now 95.7 percent of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1959, the reserve was one of the first in China and
is also recognized as one of the international biosphere reserves
of the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
Over the last ten years, the reserve's administration has been
focusing its efforts on preventing forest fires and as a result
in two of the five regions making up the area there have been no
fires for 14 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Other major activities include projects to prevent damage to
trees and cracking down on the illegal poaching of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has also improved its technological exchanges and
cooperation with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the influence of detrimental human
activities on the reserve, the administration has relocated 335
families and as a result a number of rare plant species have
revived.

<P>
Hiromu Nonaka, the top government spokesman, will announce the

of the assets and debts of the insolvent Guangdong International
Trust and Investment Corporation (GITIC) and agreed with GITIC's d
ecision to apply for bankruptcy, according to a report in China
Business Times.
</P>
<P>
GITIC was closed by the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, in October 1998 due to its failure in repaying due
debts.
</P>
<P>
After three months of work, the liquidation committee
concluded at a meeting with creditors on January 10 that GITIC
has assets of 21.47 billion yuan against debts of 36.15 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiesi, head of the liquidation committee, said that the
decision made by the board of directors of GITIC to apply for
bankruptcy for GITIC and its subsidiaries is prudent and conforms
with the company's actual condition.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the bankrupt application is also
beneficial for protecting creditors' interests, and the
liquidation committee fully respects GITIC's decision.
</P>
<P>
Wu also explained the handling of GITIC's securities and fund
business and the deposits illegally absorbed from individuals.
</P>
<P>
He said that, with approval from the central bank and the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, the securities department
and the investment fund of GITIC were purchased respectively by
two securities companies in Guangdong Province on January 6
before the bankruptcy of GITIC to avoid turmoil on the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Individual creditors will be repaid by the Bank of China with
funds provided by the provincial government of Guangdong, but the
repayment will not include any interest.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China will receive compensation from the breakup
of bankrupt's estates as an ordinary creditor and return the
money to the Guangdong provincial government after the bankruptcy
case is accepted by the court, he said.

<HEADLINE> Man's 5,000-KM Journey to Mark Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A middle-aged man from Xi'an in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province has begun a bicycle journey of
more than 5,000 kilometers, from the city of Hanzhong in Shaanxi
to Macao, to mark the return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight-year-old Xu Zhiqiang, who works at the Xi'an
branch of China International Travel Service, also hopes to
promote environmental protection and China Eco-tour 1999 along
the way. He said that bike riding causes no pollution, unlike
automobiles and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Xu will pass through 22 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions and Hong Kong, and reach Macao about
mid-December, travel time of nearly one year. Most of his
destinations will be state-level natural resorts and densely
populated cites, and he will give talks on environmental
protection at these stops.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi's Hanzhong was the birthplace of Zhang Qian, a famous
diplomat and explorer of ancient China, and Xu said that starting
from Hanzhong gives him a sense of pride and inspiration for his
upcoming odyssey.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party committee secretary and mayor of Hanzhong
saw Xu off at a ceremony earlier this month, presented him with a
long cloth scroll for people to sign during his trip, and asked
him to extend the regards of the people of Hanzhong to the people
of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Enjoy Better Bathing Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- For generations many
Beijingers used public washrooms to take baths but as living
standards have improved in recent years the number of locations
has fallen by more than half, and today an increasing number of
families are installing showers in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Many factories and state-owned enterprises also built communal
bathrooms for their employees from the start of the reform and
open-up drive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
But as relatives could also use them they did become rather
crowded and regulations were issued which allocated the first
half of the week for men and the latter half for women.
</P>
<P>
In more recent years there was a surge in demand for
high-class massage and steam baths and other facilities such as
karaoke, instead of taking bath only.
</P>
<P>
But like the decline in the traditional public washrooms --
there are now only 40 open in the capital -- their high cost and
improved living conditions in Beijing have affected them, too.
</P>
<P>
Although people can enjoy a range of bathing facilities in the
estimated 300 venues, which are also essentially entertainment
centers, the fees have risen from two yuan to six and the number
of customers has been decreasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The manager of one in central Beijing disclosed that the
number of customers using a middle-priced facility had fallen
from 2,000 a day to just 300.
</P>
<P>
An example of the great changes in the bathing habits of
Beijingers is demonstrated by Song Debao, a fifty-plus city
resident, whose family have installed an electric shower unit.
</P>
<P>
He recalls the old days when it was very inconvenient to have
a bath. "It would cost 20 fen in the winter and then in summer we
only had a normal tap with a shower-head attached in those hot
summers in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I don't have to crowd in with other people for a bath
and I can enjoy a hot shower anytime in my own home." added Song
excitedly.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Three stores and markets in
Beijing's Fengtai District have been forced to shut down and
yesterday each was fined 100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars) for

<HEADLINE> VAT Evokes Criticism From Cambodian Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A 10-percent VAT, introduced
by the Cambodian government on New Year's Day to boost dwindling
government revenues and help secure international financial aid,
has been criticized by garment manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Many warned however that the new value-added tax (VAT) could
discourage new investors and even force some garment factories to
close.
</P>
<P>
Garment makers will have to pay the 10-percent tax on imported
raw materials before claiming credit from the government. But
manufacturers fear that getting their money back will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
But some expressed support for the VAT, saying every country in
the world does this, but they preferred the tax starting at 3 or 4
percent, before going up to 10 percent. They also hope that the
government would exempt the garment industry from the tax.
</P>
<P>
The Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia said the
garment industry was one of the pioneer investors in Cambodia with
its annual export value of 500 million U.S. dollars and employed
more than 120,000 Cambodians in directly related jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian Investment Board approved 141 projects last year,
more than half of which were garment factories.
</P>
<P>
The main attraction for overseas manufactures has been
Cambodia's special trade privileges granted by the United States
and the European Union and the United States in 1996 and 1997
under the Most Favored Nation status and Generalized System of
Preferences.
</P>
<P>
Since then, garment exports to the United States have doubled
and were expected to hit 241 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
While industry sources said the number of factories could
double again this year, they warned that growth may slow down if
government policies do not remain favorable.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Help Tapioca Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
setting up a 3.5-billion-baht (97.2 million U.S. dollars) fund to
ease the serious drop in the price of tapioca, Deputy Prime
Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said.
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Assistance Measurement and Policy Committee and the
government budget will fund intervention measures, the Bangkok
Post Thursday quoted Supachai as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3.5 billion baht fund, 1.5 billion baht (41.6 million
dollars) will be used for stocking 200,000 tons of tapioca flour,
1.45 billion baht (40.2 million dollars) for buying 500,000 tons
of tapioca chips and the rest for maintenance and transportation
expenses. The stock will be exported in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The price intervention aims to increase the local price of
cassava root to 1 baht (0.027 dollars) per kilogram. The price has
been declining since late last year from an average 1.5 baht (0.04
dollars) per kilogram to 80-90 satang (0.022-0.025 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Cooperation Ministry has reported that the
output of cassava root this year will reach 17.25 million tons, of
which 15.14 million tons will go toward domestic consumption. The
oversupply of 2.11 million tons together with a lower export
demand have prompted the drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exports 3.2 million to 3.5 million tons of tapioca
annually to the European Union market.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
predicted that the earth will be one degree centigrade warmer by
the year 2050 than today as the green house effect continues.
</P>
<P>
That means the global temperature will rise 0.3 degree
centigrade every ten years in the future, according to scientists
engaged in a national key research program on climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 scientists from the prestigious Chinese Academy of
Sciences and other institutes also said that the warm winter the
earth is now experiencing will remain in the first half of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the global temperature has already risen
0.5 degree centigrade from the beginning of this century, because
of human activities and environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, the winter temperature in north
China will rise one to 1.5 degree centigrade by 2030, and the
summer temperature will rise 0.5 to 0.8 degree centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The effects of these changes are being studied.

<HEADLINE> China Probes Better Treatment of Urban Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials and Experts from
regional urban construction administrations gathered in Guanghan
City of southwest China's Sichuan Province to probe advanced
garbage treatment and utilization technology.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Han Deqian, Vice-Minister of
Science and technology, as saying Wednesday that some areas could
introduce safe burning methods and use heat to help fuel power
plants or heating systems.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening of a national conference on
the treatment and utilization of urban garbage.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that awareness should be promoted to shift simple
trash treatment into positive utilization.
</P>
<P>
In most Chinese cities, urban garbage could generally be
treated through environmentally sound burying techniques and
compound fertilizers could be produced from organic waste.
</P>
<P>
Garbage treatment in China faces problems such as lack of
funds, poor management and backward techniques.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister urged departments concerned to encourage
enterprises to development trash-treatment technology and
facilities by offering preferential policies and funds.
</P>
<P>
A total of 666 cities were registered in China in 1997. The
per capita garbage production in these cities is 440 kilograms
each year.
</P>
<P>
Random disposal of garbage takes up large areas of land and
seriously pollutes air, rivers, lakes and ground water.
</P>
<P>
The central government has been attaching great importance to
garbage disposal and utilization. It allocated an additional 2
billion yuan (241 million U.S. dollars ) last year for garbage
treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A survey has found that
household trifling issues and not extramarital affairs are posing
the biggest threat to marriages in China.
</P>
<P>
About 44 percent of divorced couples say it was disputes about
household affairs which ruined their marriages, compared with
10.8 percent of divorces caused by couples having personality
clashes or wanting different life-styles.
</P>
<P>
Only 9.8 percent of marriages ended due to extramarital
affairs, which was often erroneously blamed as the "marriage
killer" in China, said a report in the Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on the verdicts of 305 divorce cases heard
by the Huangpu District Court in east China's Shanghai City,
found that lots of couples quarreled and fought over daily hous
ehold chores, children's education, or caring for older relatives.
</P>
<P>
Couples who divorced because of a clash of personalities
showed that the Chinese are paying more and more attention to the
quality of marriage, the newspaper report said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Labor Market Situation Stable: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's labor market
situation in 1998 was stable with relatively low unemployment and
retrenchment rates, according to an official labor market report
for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment exercise in 1998 involved only 1 percent of
the total workforce as only 83,865 workers were laid off
throughout the year against an estimated total workforce of 8.3
million, the report released by the Human Resources Ministry
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment level in the country was also low, standing at
2.9 percent in the first quarter of 1998 and increasing to 3.2
percent and 3.3 percent in the second and third quarters
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, pay cut seemed to be the most popular
measure taken by employers as an alternative to retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that based on the reports of employers
to the Manpower Department, there were 74,610 reported vacancies,
a figure the ministry said was only part of the actual vacancies
existing in the labor market as it is not compulsory for employers
to report the vacancies to the department.
</P>
<P>
The report said local workers can still find jobs offered in
the employment market provided they are not too choosy.
</P>
<P>
The labor market situation in the country looks positive in
1999 following the country's forecast of 1-percent gross domestic
product growth for the year, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prague, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The jobless rate in the Czech
Republic kept climbing in the past several months and hit a
record high of 7.5 percent as of the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst unemployment figure recorded in nearly five
decades, an official from the Czech Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the number of registered job
seekers approached 400,000, an increase of 120,000 from a year
earlier and that one-third of the jobless were under the age of
25.
</P>
<P>
The official warned of an even worse unemployment situation in
the next couple of years, predicting that the unemployment rate
might hit two-digit.
</P>
<P>
Of the east European countries, the Czech Republic was once
considered a great success in the economic transition with low
unemployment as well as constant development. Unemployment rate
stood at only 2.9 percent in 1995 and 3.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent economic slide pushed the rate up, with
unemployment reaching 5.2 percent in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said on Wednesday that the change of the Central
Bank president will not affect the country's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the nation, Cardoso said that Francisco Lopez,
a respected economist, has replaced former Central Bank head
Gustavo Franco, who resigned unexpectedly earlier Wednesday,
citing personal reasons and policy differences.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso described the replacement as a slight technical change
"to boost the prospects of our fiscal, monetary and exchange
policies with clear rules."
</P>
<P>
Cardoso thanked foreign banks and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for supporting the measures adopted by Brazil, which
Wednesday devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil once more shows its responsibility and its solidarity,
assuming decisions in a conscious, serene and firm way, with
technical competence and with a firm will to continue until the
re-establishment of our credibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Pedro Malan said he was sure the
international community understood the changes in Brazil, which
he described as only a slight adjustment of policy.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday in a special session, the Brazilian National
Congress and the Senate approved a presidential decree raising
corporate income taxes, which is expected to bring in 3.8 billion
U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Another measure aiming at reducing long-term interest rates to
12 percent a year from 19 percent was also approved.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Revokes Natural Gas Fee to Reduce Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will completely
revoke the fee charged to natural gas users to improve its air
quality, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city will increase fees for discharging sulfur
dioxide, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"With these two measures, we see hopes of greater demand for
natural gas, the ideal clean energy source for this city, and low
sulfur high-quality coal," the paper quoted Zhao Yixin, director
of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sulfur content of low-sulfur high-quality coal is only 0.5
percent, half of that of normal coal.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts widely believe adopting natural gas and low
sulfur high-quality coal in place of the normal coal widely used
today will greatly diminish the sulfur dioxide content in
Beijing's air, which is already twice the amount recognized by
the state as acceptable.
</P>
<P>
According to some new policies, which stemmed from a special
report on Beijing approved by the central government departments,
the city's discharge fee for sulfur dioxide will be increased
from 3.2 yuan (0.39 US dollars) per ton of normal coal to 20 yuan
(2.41 US dollars) per ton, using the standard of 0.2 yuan (0.02
US dollars) per kilogram of sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
And natural gas users will not have to pay an extra fee, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Prices were the reason Beijing's promotions of natural gas and
the new kind of coal were not very successful during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Many residents refused to use natural gas because it was more
expensive than coal and came with a rather large added fee.
</P>
<P>
The same thing also happened with low-sulfur high-quality
coal, which costs a higher wholesale price than normal coal
because of the longer transportation times required from those
mines.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Has 10 Percent Elderly Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of the elderly in
Vietnam has increased from 4.6 million or 7.2 percent of the
country's population in 1989 to 7.8 million in 1998, which is 10
percent of the population in some provinces.
</P>
<P>
The figures were announced at a two-day conference held here
Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss issues concerning the elderly and
make recommendations for policies concerning these people, Vietnam
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The social and economic consequences of an aging population
were the focus of the first-ever national conference organized by
the National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Participants were informed that by next year, the world's
elderly people will increase to 416 million or around 7 percent of
the global population.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, there will be 1.4 billion elderly people in the world,
or 15 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government provides free health care and a very
modest pension for 25-30 percent of the elderly people, but over
70 percent of them live in rural areas and have to depend on their
children or work to earn a living, said a Vietnamese official.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen reports were presented at the conference on the
elderly people in Vietnam, Vietnam's policies and laws for the
elderly, health care for the elderly, activities of the
Association of the Elderly and experiences of member countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in making policies for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The conference aimed to help Vietnamese law makers build a more
appropriate system of laws and policies for the elderly in
Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The State of South Australia
is expected to establish a representative office in Beijing,
which will be its fourth one in China, premier of the state John
Olsen announced here Wednesday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The office is to work in conjunction with the Embassy of
Australia for commercial vintage and particularly, promote
specific interest of South Australia, as in trade of goods or
service sector from the enterprises or government agencies within
the state, said Olsen, who is visiting Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and Beijing
Mayor Jia Qinglin earlier, Olsen has indicated this plan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government said it welcomes the idea.
</P>
<P>
South Australia is the first Australian state to establish an
office in China. It has three offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai and
Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of those trade offices has secured very
significant investment and exports in South Australia, said the
premier, added that the arrangement will benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing office is expected to be established within the
next four weeks, he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are the selected
comments on Michael Jordaon's retirement today:
</P>
<P>
"When I lay my head down on the pillow at night, I'll know
there was one guy I never had a chance to beat. It doesn't look
like I'll get another chance. That bothers me." -- Miami Heat
coach Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America
take a day or two to ooh and ahh, and hold their breath again,
and be glad again." -- President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"He is the most famous and best-loved sportsman on the
planet. The best-paid as well. An entire generation identified
with him." -- the Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve.
</P>
<P>
"He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play
basketball. I've seen too many athletes not go out at the right
time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the dignity they
are entitled to." -- former Bulls assistant coach Johnny Bach.
</P>
<P>
"We have all been fortunate to have been a part of one of the
most magical rides in sports history. Now, with the NBA and the
other television partners, we have to reintroduce the new
generation of stars in the NBA" -- NBC sports chairman Dick
Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
"This is a day that I hoped would never come. It has to be the
toughest day in the history of the Chicago Bulls. It's a tough
day for Chicago, it's a tough day for the NBA, it's a tough day
for basketball fans all over the world and for Michael Jordan
fans all over the world." -- Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for gracing our court for 13 seasons, and I
disagree with Jerry. This is not a sad day. This is a great day,
because the greatest basketball player in the history of the game
is getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that
described his play." -- NBA commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few names that even come close to being
associated with Michael Jordan in the sport world: Babe Ruth and
Muhammad Ali. And as great as those two names were, Michael
Jordan competed in a world that was much more wired." -- Phil
Knight,founder and CEO of Nike, Inc.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls For More Int'l Moves on Brazilian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Trade Minister
Piero Fassino Wednesday called for more international and
European Union measures to reduce the effects of the Brazilian
financial crisis which came to a head the same day.
</P>
<P>
"Now we hope Brazil will move to reduce the effects of the
crisis, and would also like to see measures from the
international community and the European Union," the minister
said, adding that the economic turmoil was in contradiction with
the stabilization policies chosen by the IMF (International
Monetary Fund) and the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
The effective devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real,
threw world markets into turmoil Wednesday and raised the specter
of conditions created last year by the string of financial crises
which hit in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation and the resignation of the Brazilian central
bank governor, Gustavo Franco, dragged the U.S. dollar down
against the euro, the yen and the pound and Swiss franc in world
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The crisis heightened after Minas Gerais, the second-largest
state of Brazil, declared a moratorium on its debts.
</P>
<P>
Fassino warned that the effects could be very dangerous for
Brazil, Latin America's largest country, and the international
markets, and hoped that other mistakes could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
"We knew Brazil was in an exposed position," said Fassino.
"The IMF was focusing its support for Latin America there. This
made it possible to contain the situation."

<HEADLINE> Seven Million Pay-out Ends Boxing Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- British promoter Frank Warren
ended his heavyweight legal battle on Wednesday with flamboyant
US counterpart Don King, by agreeing to hand over 7.2 million
pounds to end their partnership.
</P>
<P>
Both men were in the High Court as their acrimonious conflict
came to an end with an agreed settlement before Mr Justice
Lightman.
</P>
<P>
King said after the short hearing that he did not regard the
result as a victory and was "still very fond" of Warren.
</P>
<P>
The pair shook hands outside the court and swapped jokes about
their differences.
</P>
<P>
"I'm free," declared Warren, before trying to persuade King to
buy him a meal.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad this is all behind us, but it looks as if I shall
be eating soup in a basket tonight," he quipped.
</P>
<P>
King, in typically voluble fashion, said: "I have fought long
and hard in the English courts to vindicate my reputation and my
rights in the partnership which I made with Frank Warren and from
which both he and English boxing derived great benefit.
</P>
<P>
"On every occasion when the court was required to give a
ruling about my rights in this dispute, I have been 100%
successful, and the Court of Appeal upheld those rights in
December.
</P>
<P>
"By Frank Warren's withdrawal of his allegations and his
agreement to pay me in accordance with my entitlement, my
reputation has been upheld.
</P>
<P>
"I am therefore very happy at the outcome of this case. I am
glad that I can now put this unhappy episode behind me," King
said.
</P>
<P>
The problems between the pair arose when Warren argued that
King had failed to produce TV opportunities for his most
marketable figher, Naseem Hamed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Former England coach Terry
Venables is locked in talks with Crystal Palace owner Mark
Goldberg, amid reports he is about to leave his post as manager
of the south London side.
</P>
<P>
Venables, one of the most colourful characters in British
football, took over at Selhurst Park in June but has failed to
deliver a push for promotion back to the Premiership following
last year's relegation.
</P>
<P>
They currently languish in the bottom half of the First
Division and are poised to sell star striker Matt Jansen to ease
mounting financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Venables was appointed by Goldberg in one of the owner's first
acts after taking control of the club.
</P>
<P>
The Mirror newspaper reports that Goldberg has offered
Venables another role at the club as a 'consultant'.
</P>
<P>
Venables is thought to be unhappy with the Jansen's imminent
departure, as well as the recent sale of Paul Warhurst to Bolton.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Incurs Larger Deficit in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Incurred 52.7 billion pesos (1.35 billion U.S. dollars) of deficit
in 1998, 3.7 billion pesos (90 million dollars) more than the
ceiling set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The higher budgetary deficit was due to the unprogramed 12
billion peso (300 million dollars) disbursement of the Department
of Budget and Management (DBM) to pay for the government's account
payables, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the money disbursed by the DBM went to pay for
the outstanding payables of the government to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
As of November last year, the government's accounts payable
amounted to 108 billion pesos (2.76 billion dollars), said the
secretary.
</P>
<P>
"We exceeded the (IMF) ceiling because we settled our payables
beginning August (last year)," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Espiritu said the larger deficit will not hinder the
release of the fourth tranche of the 1.4 billion dollar IMF
standby facility next month.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has an existing two-year precautionary
arrangement with the IMF forged last summer. The fourth tranche
involves 30 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Ban on Issue of Euro Collector Coins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
executive branch, the European commission, cleared its policy
proposals Wednesday over copyright on the common face design of
Euro coins and a ban on the issue of euro collector coins, medals
and tokens until 2002, in a bid to protect the euro coins.
</P>
<P>
The policy proposals outline the regime applicable to the
reproduction of these designs: it lays down common reproduction
rules guaranteeing that the same approach is followed by the
commission and EU member states, and require decentralized
enforcement of the copyright by member states according to their
national law.
</P>
<P>
The ban on issue of collector coins within EU-wide countries
covers the transition period between January 1, 1999 and January
1, 2002. During this period, all such objects including coins,
medals and tokens are prohibited because those might be a source
of confusion or potential fraud.
</P>
<P>
This ban applies explicitly to those objects issued either by
official authorities or by private issuers within the EU member
states or outside, sources said.

<HEADLINE> New Cancer Imaging Device May End Need For Biopsies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A new imaging device invented by
a U.S. scientist could end the need for painful biopsies to
determine whether a patient has cancer, the New Scientist magazine
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-dimensional imaging technique, called Hall Effect
Imaging (HEI), uses electronic emissions to spot differences
between healthy and diseased tissue.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm hoping to have is something as sensitive and specific
as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) but with the speed of
ultrasound," the inventor, Han Wen, told the New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Dr Wen, of the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, the
United States, said: "Some published results suggest that breast
tumors trigger large changes in tissue electrical parameters."
</P>
<P>
He said the technique should also work with other cancers as
the change occurs in all other tumors.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer tumors give off a different electrical signal to
healthy tissue. The new imaging technique uses ultrasonic
emissions to highlight those differences.
</P>
<P>
Dr Aaron Fenster, director of imaging at the Robarts Research
Institute at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, told the
New Scientist that HEI had an advantage over existing techniques
because it could rule out false positive tests.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the only way to make totally sure was a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr Fenster warned that the project was still at an
early stage and it would be years before it replaced mammography.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle: Gazza still Has Future with England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
insisted that Paul Gascoigne can still have a future with the
England team.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle stunned the football world by dropping Gascoigne from
his squad for the World Cup in France last summer and it was
feared the 31-year-old Middlesbrough midfielder had played his
last game for his country.
</P>
<P>
The pair have had a famously strained relationship since
Gascoigne was axed and it had been assumed the rifts ran too deep
for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
After Hoddle revealed details in his World Cup diary about
Gascoigne's furious reaction to being dropped for France 98, it
was thought the maverick star had burned his bridges with the
England coach.
</P>
<P>
But Hoddle said if Gascoigne could prove he had fully recove
red following his highly publicised battle with alcohol and
stress, there could be a place for him in the England set-up.
</P>
<P>
"There's still some fitness levels and form to come back and
if he can achieve that, if he can get himself back to fitness and
his very top form, then Paul Gascoigne is very much in our
minds," said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"But it's up to Paul whether he can achieve that and he needs
a bit of time to do that, and if it's not this time - if Paul's
coming back - it's not going to be for one game.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be a realistic run at qualifying and hopefully
going on to the tournament in the year 2000. It's all about time
really," he said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, the
greatest basketball player in history, announced his retirement
officially today in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old retired from the Chicago Bulls after 13
seasons, six championships and countless brilliant dunks.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge,"
Jordan said at a news conference at the United Center.
"Physically, I feel great.
</P>
<P>
"This is a perfect time for me to walk away from the game. I'm
at peace with that." He also added he was 99.9 percent sure he
would never return and he was very secure in his decision.
</P>
<P>
Jordan created a series of brilliant marks including five MVP
awards, 10 scoring titles, 12 All-Star appearances and many magic
moments.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to be the best basketball player I could be. I've had
a great time."
</P>
<P>
Jordan made his first retirement in 1993, when he pursued a
professional baseball career before returning to play basketball
in 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
"Well, we do this again, a second time," Jordan said. His
wife, Juanita, Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA
commissioner David Stern joined the conference.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had lost his desire to play, he said:"The desire
is always going to be there, but I want to make sure the desire
is there not one-fourth of the time I step onto the court, but
every time."
</P>
<P>
Jordan said:"I'm just going to enjoy life and do things I've
never done before. My life will take a change." He revealed he
will tend to his many business interests. He makes an estimated
45 million US dollars a year from endorsements.
</P>
<P>
Reinsdorf, Bulls' owner, said today is "a tough day for
basketball fans all over the world. This is a day I hoped would
never come."
</P>
<P>
Stern disagreed the remark, adding:"This is a great day. The
greatest basketball player in the history of the game is getting
the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his play."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton praised Jordan had "a remarkable set of
qualifies of mind, body and spirit who always expected to do
whatever it was he tried to do."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America
take a day or two to 'ooh and ahh' and hold their breath again
and be glad again."
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he hoped the Bulls would re-sign teammate Scottie
Pippen but added that was only his opinion.
</P>
<P>
Jordan goes out as he always wanted -- on top. "There is a way
to go out as an athlete, and that's the way to go out," said
Charlotte player B.J. Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
"He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could
ever ask as an athlete, he's done. He had a chance to leave and
this was the chance," Armstrong said.

</P>

Clinton praised the Chicago Bulls star as a man of superior
athletic prowess who "had a body that would do things no one
else's would do".
</P>
<P>
"In my life, I don't know if I ever saw another athlete with
such a remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit,"

<HEADLINE> Juninho Rules out Villa Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian maestro Juninho
announced on Wednesday that he would not join English Premier
League club Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, the former Middlesbrough star had
been linked with a 12 million pound return to England, with Villa
boss John Gregory assured the cash by his chairman to complete
the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Juninho was said to be unsettled at Spanish club Atletico
Madrid after being left on the sidelines since breaking his leg
last spring.
</P>
<P>
But the pint-sized midfielder has scotched talk of an
immediate move to Villa - insisting he would rather win a
first-string place in the Madrid club.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult when you are not in the team," said
Juninho.
</P>
<P>
"But I would prefer to fight and work and get back into the
team and be a success in Spain rather than look for a move
elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
His future with Atletico would appear limited, however, as he
bids to resurrect his Brazil career.
</P>
<P>
But it is believed he would rather stay in Spain, because this
would improve his chances of forcing himself into the plans of
new national coach Wanderlay Luxembourgo due to the fact that
there is no television coverage of the Premiership in Brazil.

BRUSSELS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The current European
commission's term does not expire until January 6, next year, but
rumors about possible replacement already spread, according to a

</P>
<P>
The alleged rumors at least refer to four famous politicians:
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, former Italian Prime
Minister Romamno Prodi, France's Minister of Culture and Mayor of
Strasbourg Catherine Trautmann, and President of Belgian
francophone Socialist Party Philippe Busquin.
</P>
<P>
In respond to suggestions that Kohl might be a candidate for
the president of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, the
current commission president, told a new briefing in Bonn on
Monday that this was quite possible.
</P>
<P>
But he added that as acting president he has no right to
propose a successor and indeed has no intention of getting
involved in a debate which he believes is starting much too soon.
He also said that he had responded in a similar way to a question
about Prodi, another strongly potential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The report implies that the other rumors include commissioner
Edith Cresson's replacement by Trautmann and commissioner Karel
Van Miert's replacement by Busquin.

However, as the European Union's executive arm, the Commission
is to face a motion of censure on Thursday by the European

<HEADLINE> New Device Enables People to Think on Computer Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Device which measures the
brain waves through the skull has taught paralyzed people to type
on a computer screen, the New Scientist magazine reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Using the new device, researchers from the University of
Alabama, the United States, and the University of Tubingen,
Germany, have trained the three patients to harness their brain
power.
</P>
<P>
The device has two electrodes, the size of contact lenses, to
pick up signals from near the motor cortex.
</P>
<P>
The patients had to learn to make their cortical potentials
more negative or positive to move a cursor up and down a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
At each successive session the researchers made the task more
difficult, requiring the patients to generate bigger and bigger
changes in their cortical potentials.
</P>
<P>
When the patients could control the cursor well, they began to
write. They selected each letter by whittling down the alphabet.
First they choose one half of the alphabet, then half of that half
and so on.
</P>
<P>
It took the patients an average of 80 seconds to pick a letter,
meaning a short sentence could be written in about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Last year two patients were able to write messages on a
computer via electrodes implanted in their brains. But the new
method does not require risky surgery, simply placing electrodes
on the top of the head, the New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Find New Method of Freezing Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A new freezing method might
significantly improve the chances of a successful pregnancy using
stored human eggs, U.S. scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Women about to undergo chemotherapy or other medical treatments
that damage the ovaries often have their eggs frozen for use at a
later stage when they want to have children.
</P>
<P>
Human eggs do not freeze well using current technique, and
worldwide the process has only resulted in eight births.
</P>
<P>
Eggs must be surrounded by a concentrated solution during
freezing. This draws the water out of the egg cells by osmosis and
reduces the risk of harmful ice crystals forming. The process
usually uses a saline solution that mimics human fluids.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr James Stachecki, of the Institute for Reproductive
Medicine and Science in New Jersey, has produced a study that
suggests the saline may be to blame for the current low success
rates.
</P>
<P>
Instead, his research team used a solution containing choline
ions, which do not readily cross cell membranes.
</P>
<P>
The researchers used the process on hundreds of mouse eggs and
they reported in the New Scientist magazine that 90 percent of
them survived the new technique and 60 percent of those developed
into early embryos.
</P>
<P>
This compares to 50 percent surviving with a conventional
solution and 10 percent of those progressing to embryonic
development.
</P>
<P>
Dr Stachecki said the next stage of the research is to look at
how well process works with human eggs.
</P>
<P>
Several women have already volunteered to donate their eggs for
the research.

<HEADLINE> Home Networking A New Technology Area in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Home networking products
will be among the hottest technology areas this year in the United
States, according to a new study released this week by the
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Vendors are set to announce an array of new products designed
to meet the increasing need to connect PCs in the home, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
The growth in home offices is a key factor behind vendors'
interest in home networking solutions. There are 37.3 million home
office households in the United States, of which 7.8 million have
more than two PCs. The number of home office households will reach
40 million this year and 49.6 million in 2002, according to IDC
predictions. Multiple PC home office households will reach 8.5
million this year and 12 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
IDC defines home office households as those where work is
performed as part of an in-home business, telecommuting, or
corporate after hours work.
</P>
<P>
"As more and more households buy additional PCs to meet their
in-home business, recreation and education needs," IDC said,
"there will also be a growing desire to connect these PCs in order
to share peripherals such as printers and scanners and to share
access to the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are approximately 910,000 home office
households with local networks, representing 71 percent of the 1.3
million total U.S. households with local networks. By 2002, the
number of home office households with local networks is expected
to skyrocket to more than 8 million, IDC said.

URUMQI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The capital of China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region is improving its air condition by using
natural gas for its buses.
</P>

The city has already had 400 of these converted buses in

The emissions and noise pollution from natural gas-fueled

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes Economic Crisis in Brazil Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that he had consulted with allies about the
economic crisis in Brazil and hoped the crisis will be resolved in
a "satisfactory way."
</P>
<P>
Briefed by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on the developments
in Brazil and on world markets early on Wednesday, Clinton urged
the country to persist in a painful program of reforms designed
to put its economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that Latin America was the fastest-growing market
for American goods and services and that Brazil was the largest
country in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials have consulted with key officials in
Brazil, the G-7 organization of wealthy industrial nations, other
countries and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In the statement aimed at calming economic anxieties, Clinton
said: "We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we
have worked on so many important things around the world, carry
forward with its economic reform plan and succeed. And we
certainly hope that they will."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had worked hard to keep the financial
crisis in Asia from spreading to Brazil, noting the high stakes
for the U.S. economy in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we hope that the situation will be resolved in a
satisfactory way not only for the people of Brazil but for all of
the people in the Americas that want to continue to enjoy the good
progress that all of us have enjoyed in the last several years,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"And we're working to that end and we'll continue to do so," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Rubin indicated that he viewed
Brazil's decision to effectively devalue its currency as an effort
to "enhance the flexibility of its exchange rate system."
</P>
<P>
He said it was important that "Brazil carry forward the
implementation of a strong, credible economic program."
</P>
<P>
Washington has a vital interest in saving Brazil, Latin
America's biggest economy, from collapse. The U.S. Treasury last
November pulled the strings in a 41.5 billion U.S. dollars rescue
deal for Brazil, officially led by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).

<HEADLINE> UK Unveils Further Plans to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
unveiled further plans to improve air quality, claiming that it
will further cut pollutants from industry, power stations and
traffic.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, launching the review of
the national air quality strategy, said improving air quality
would be put on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
The UK was tightening its objectives for reducing pollution
from five out of the eight key pollutants identified in a national
air quality strategy published two years ago, Prescott told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
They are lead, benzene, carbon monoxide, butadiene and nitrogen
dioxide, which will all have tougher targets set for early in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
Although moves to cut dangerous pollutants are on track in the
UK, car emissions are not coming down much, which the government
said partly lies beyond its control.
</P>
<P>
Airborne particles are pollutants which respect no
international boundaries, the British government said, urging the
problems to be tackled at a European level.

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian financial
trouble triggered a big selling at the New York Stock Exchange
earlier Wednesday but a later statement by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the crisis put a curb on the selling.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold their stocks after Brazil announced its
currency devaluation this morning. In the first hour, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down as much as 261.58 at 9,213.10,
but rebounded 169.41 at 9,382.51 at noon, due to Clinton's
statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hoped the financial crisis in Brazil would
be resolved in "a satisfactory way." Brazil is an important
market for U.S. exporters and a number of U.S. firms have
financial operations in the Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed at 9,349.56, down 125.12 from 9,474.68 in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks also cut the losses for other major stock
indexes. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite down 3.94 at
2,316.81 in the closing session, cutting a loss of 114.56 at
noon. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index closed at 1,234.40, down
5.11.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index was down 3.87 at 590.72, and the
American Stock Exchange Index fell 0.26 to 699.39.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Tumble as Crisis in Brazil Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets slumped
Wednesday as investors took a more sober view of the economic
crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Gustavo Franco, president of Brazil's
central bank, sent European stock markets into a downward spiral
during the whole session.
</P>
<P>
London, Frankfurt and Paris tumbled between 3 and 4 percent,
with Madrid diving nearly 7 percent because of worries over
exposure to Brazilian debt.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 dropped 183.5 or 3.1 percent to 5,850.1 in a
market turnover of 1.1bn shares.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt the Xetra Dax dropped over 4 percent, 214 points,
to close at 4,982.12. In Paris the CAC 40 slid 3.5 percent, 142
points, to end a volatile session at 3,958.72.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the concerns about Brazil are causing a
loss of confidence, and at the moment people are more inclined to
sell than to buy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Rise in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S.producer price index
rose 0.4 percent in December, the sharpest one-month increase in
more than a year, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the figure was inflated by a 30.7 percent increase in
tobacco prices. The prices for nontobacco goods actually plunged
0.4 percent over November. That was the biggest monthly drop in
prices since January of last year.
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Department said, a sharp plunge in energy
prices was the major factor in keeping inflation in check. Total
energy prices fell 2.3 percent in December, while food prices also
fell by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1998, producer prices fell 0.1 percent, following a
steeper 1.2 percent drop in 1997. Excluding food and energy,
wholesale prices rose 2.4 percent for the year, following no
change in 1997. Excluding tobacco, the core whole inflation rate
rose a more modest 0.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The monthly producer price index was originally scheduled to be
released Wednesday, but the Department accidentally put data out
early on the Internet, forcing a rushed disclosure of the report
late Tuesday. Bureau of Labor Statistics officials blamed the
release on a computer-programming error.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens More Sanctions Against Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
threatened to cut back or even eliminate Russian launches of
American-made satellites as punishment for allegedly aiding Iran's
missile and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will make the decision when Russia's
quota for launches is reviewed at the end of the year, said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into account very seriously progress, if any,
that we have made in getting Russia to stop its entities from
supporting Iran's missile program," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 16 launches of satellites had been
authorized, but "If we don't get progress on the missile
proliferation problem, we are not going to be able to support
increasing that quota."
</P>
<P>
And that, Rubin said, involves hundreds of millions of dollars
in revenue for Russia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the administration imposed economic penalties on a
Russian university and two scientific research institutes after
concluding they had assisted Iraq in developing ballistic missiles
and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
In response, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Wednesday sharply criticized the Clinton administration. "Using
force and exerting sanctions against our organizations is
counterproductive for Russian-American relations, which we
consider very important."
</P>
<P>
The White House, in a statement Tuesday, said the
administration intended to keep working with Russia to strengthen
controls on exports.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, in past years, "We saw a significant amount of
success" in export control regulations and other measures to stop
the flow of technology to Iran, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"And the Russian government took active steps to stop problems
and fix problems that we had identified," he said. "That movement
in the right direction has stopped and there has been a steady
deterioration in this area."
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Russian government of ignoring for months
information provided by the United States, Rubin said "any
suggestion on their part of surprise or diplomatic precedent being
somehow affected is simply untrue."
</P>
<P>
The sanctions announced Tuesday barred the D. Mendeleyev
University of Chemical Technology, the Scientific Research and
Design Institute of Power Technology and the Moscow Aviation
Institute from purchasing U.S.-made goods, exporting products to
the United States or selling to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
In all, 12 Russian corporations and institutions have been
penalized for selling materials and equipment to Iran.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's ruling National
Congress Party (NCP) is seeking to lift air embargo on Libya,
Abdullah Sulaiman Al-Awadh, secretary of the NCP's People's
Department of International Relations said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department will adopt in the coming days an initiative for
grouping the representatives of the Arab countries on a flight
from Khartoum to Tripoli, Libya.
</P>
<P>
Al-Awadh said the flight is an attempt to break the United
Nations air embargo imposed on Libya since 1993 for its refusal to
hand over two suspects of blowing up an American flight in 1988
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing a total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
A Sudanese delegation visited Libya and met with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi last Wednesday by air in defiance of the embargo,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The mission included representatives of the Sudanese National
Assembly (parliament), the People's International Friendship
Council, the Farmers' Federation, and the Civil Defense as well as
university professors and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan General Association of Farmers and Raisers and the
Sudanese Farmers' Federation issued a joint statement on the
occasion of breaching the embargo on Libya, calling all the farmer
associations in the Arab world to stand against embargo.

CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will inaugurate in 2001 the biggest suspending
bridge in the world, linking the east and west banks of the Suez
Canal, the Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, the foundation stone of which was laid a few
days ago, will be as high as 70 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
It will facilitate daily movement of pedestrians and goods from
Port Said, Ismailia and Suez to Sinai and the west bank.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Egyptian and European construction companies are
engaged in the project. Japan is contributing about 60 percent
of the construction cost.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government is planning to borrow 500
million U.S. dollars to finance a number of projects, the
Arabic-language newspaper An Nahar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The projects to be financed include the construction of a
vocational school in the south, updating government hospitals in
Beirut and waste water treatment system in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The loans will carry a 2 to 3 percent interest rate over a
period of 20 to 25 years, Finance Minister George Korom said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Islamic Development Bank, the Kuwaiti Fund
for Development and Italy are among the donators.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Revenues of the seven largest foodstuff companies in
Egypt over the past year amounted to 2.2 billion Egyptian pounds
(647 million U.S. dollars), up 20 percent over the previous year,
reported the Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The United States has agreed to provide Jordan 100
million dollars to help the country cope with its current economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The money will be delivered to Jordan over two years, reported
the Arab daily "Al Hayat" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance program will be submitted to the U.S. Congress
for approval.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Trans Mediterranean Airlines (TMA), Lebanon's national
cargo carrier, plans to update its fleet with new aircraft in the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as part of an expansion plan aimed at
moving the company to profitability by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The TWA will phase out its current five Boeing 707-320Cs and
replace them with new aircraft by 2002, said Fadi Saab, chairman of
the TMA.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking long-range planes with a cargo capacity of
around 60 tonnes instead of the current 40 tonnes," he added.

ease sanctions imposed on Iraq, said Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"If we accept these initiatives, the embargo will be a
permanent one," said Ramadan at a press conference.

These initiatives aim to put restrictions on Iraq's imports and
exports under continuous monitoring.

Instead Iraq demands the total lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on the country for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which
touched off the 1991 Gulf War. (BC-Iraq-Sanctions-Initiatives)
