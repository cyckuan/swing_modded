<HEADLINE> Rights Group Settles Spying Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Anti-Defamation League has settled a  
class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $25,000 to a community 
relations fund and promising not to spy on other civil rights 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, approved by a federal judge Monday, resolves a  
suit filed in 1993 that accused the Jewish civil rights group of 
spying on Arab-American, pro-Palestinian and anti-apartheid groups 
and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADL, which admitted no wrongdoing, agreed to place $25,000  
in a fund to be used to repair its relationships with the other 
groups and to provide proof to plaintiffs' attorneys over the next 
four years that no such spying is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Anti-Defamation League is pleased to finally resolve the  
litigation which will now allow us to devote all our resources to 
our work,'' the organization said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case arose out of a 1992 seizure by San Francisco police of  
more than 17,000 files from the ADL, which was monitoring 
pro-Palestinian and anti-apartheid activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADL later paid $75,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the city  
accusing it of illegally obtaining confidential documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of Monday's settlement, the ADL agreed not to gather  
information from any state or municipal employee in California when 
the ADL knows or should know that the person is providing it 
illegally. The organization may still collect information for 
legitimate journalistic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also agreed to review its files and remove information  
allegedly obtained illegally.

<HEADLINE>  X-ray Ring Found in Crab Nebula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A never-before-seen ring of X-rays has been  
discovered surrounding the heart of the massive crab nebula in 
space, NASA announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring was revealed by the 2-month-old Chandra X-ray  
observatory. The finding, combined with other observations, may 
provide clues as to how a powerful neutron star provides energy to 
the nebula, NASA researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crab nebula, located about 6,000 light-years from Earth in  
the constellation Taurus, is the remnant of a star that was 
observed to explode in the year 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inner ring is unique,'' said Jeff Hester of Arizona State  
University. ``It has never been seen before, and it should tell us 
a lot about how the energy from the pulsar gets into the nebula. 
It's like finding the transmission lines between the power plant 
and the light bulb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Weisskopf, Chandra Project Scientist at NASA's Marshall  
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the pulsar inside the 
nebula ``is accelerating particles up to the speed of light and 
flinging them out into interstellar space at an incredible rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Hubble Space Telescope images have shown moving  
knots and wisps around the neutron star and X-ray images have shown 
the outer parts of the jet and hinted at the ring structure. With 
Chandra's new observations the ring pattern clearly appears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulsar within the Crab nebula, discovered by radio  
astronomers in 1968, is a neutron star rotating 30 times per 
second. Neutron stars are formed when gravity crushes the central 
core of the star to densities 50 trillion times that of lead and a 
diameter of only 12 miles. They are highly magnetic and rotate 
rapidly, creating a powerful generator.

<HEADLINE> Report: Philip Morris Backed Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tobacco giant Philip Morris gave $30,000 to a  
nonprofit group that financed Gov. George Pataki's trips to 
Hungary, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had never given to the group, the Hungarian-American  
Chamber of Commerce of New York and New Jersey, until shortly 
before Pataki's first trip in 1995, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the company was lobbying the state to repeal  
smoking restrictions in New York City and other localities. Less 
restrictive statewide measures generally had the support of Pataki, 
a Republican, and Republican lawmakers. Democrats blocked the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris gave the organization $10,000 a week before  
Pataki's first trip, then contributed the same amount before his 
second visit in 1996, according to the Times. In 1997, it gave 
another $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, a Philip Morris senior executive who oversaw  
lobbying in New York and other states attended a dinner for Pataki 
in Budapest, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor and his aides  
were not aware of the donations and had not asked the chamber about 
its backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said his visits to Hungary were aimed at promoting trade  
and tracing his roots in the homeland of his paternal grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the trips has never been made public. The chamber  
would not discuss its finances or the cost of the trips, the Times 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris did not make the donations to the chamber in order  
to underwrite Pataki's trips, said Tara Carraro, a company 
spokeswoman. She told the Times the company routinely contributes 
to such trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki had dismissed criticism about accepting the gift of  
travel funding, saying the chamber had no business before the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	A state ethics panel, working with information from the  
governor, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics rules prohibit administration officials from accepting  
gifts of $75 or more from companies with business before the state. 
The rules also bar officials from directing a nonprofit group to 
receive a gift that they cannot legally accept. A separate state 
law requires companies to disclose all lobbying spending on state 
officials, including funds funneled through third parties. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the ethics panel, Robert E. Eggenschiller, a  
Republican on the board from 1992 to 1997, was troubled by the 
report of Philip Morris contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ethics Commission should at least go back and see if,  
having known that, they would have voted differently,'' he told the 
Times. ``Why was there this sudden infusion of cash? What was the 
purpose? Were they just being generous? Or was there some ulterior 
purpose? Were they, in a sense, lobbying?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal memorandum written shortly after the 1995 trip,  
Philip Morris described Pataki as ``pro-business and openly 
solicitous of PM and appreciative'' of the company's ``contribution 
to the state.'' The memo was among documents disclosed in 
antismoking lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> 'SNL' Special Draws Big Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC was more than ready for prime time.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 22.4 million people watched the network's 25th  
anniversary show for ``Saturday Night Live'' on Sunday night, the 
highest-rated entertainment special since the Academy Awards in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour show also had the best numbers for any NBC  
special since 1993 among the 18-to-49-year-old audience demographic 
the network craves, Nielsen Media Research said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show opened with Bill Murray, in his lounge singer guise,  
belting out Bruce Springsteen's ``Badlands,'' among other songs. 
Billy Crystal later resurrected his Fernando talk-show character 
with the famous line, ``You look mahvelous,'' while comedian Chris 
Rock poked fun at all the bad movies former cast members have made. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also paid tribute to ``SNL'' cast members who have  
died: Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman, Chris Farley and John Belushi, of 
the Not Ready for Prime Time Players from the show's premiere year, 
1975, until 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	After the show, the star-studded cast and guests took elevators  
to the Rainbow Room, where a makeshift Blues Brothers band with Dan 
Aykroyd, John Goodman and Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Steven Tyler 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a couple of well-known no-shows. Eddie Murphy and  
Dana Carvey both didn't attend, and an NBC spokesman didn't have an 
explanation for their absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was a big night for network television in general. With  
season premieres of ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``The Practice'' and 
the new escapist drama, ``Snoops,'' more people watched TV Sunday 
than on any night since May 23, said Alan Wurtzel, NBC's chief 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Network executives are heartened by ratings during the  
one-week-old TV season, particularly for one-hour dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have programming, audiences show up,'' Wurtzel said.

<HEADLINE> Italians Trace Russian Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian prosecutors said today they uncovered a  
money-laundering scheme in Italy involving Russian crime gangs and 
the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Paolo Giovanioli said an investigation begun in 1997  
turned up evidence that Russian criminals had funneled millions of 
dollars to the Bank of New York through the accounts of the Benex 
Corp., registered in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was then transferred back to Italy and showed up in  
the bank accounts of Russian gangsters, including Ukrainian Yossif 
Roizis, Giovanioli told the Associated Press by telephone from his 
office in Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
	Roizis was arrested in February and is in jail awaiting trial on  
charges of extortion, kidnapping and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the FBI has opened its own investigation. No one  
has been charged, and U.S. law enforcement agencies have refused to 
discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Giacalone, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to  
comment today on the statements from the Italian prosecutor. The 
bank, the 15th largest bank in the United States, has said it is 
cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss prosecutors also have been working with Russia on  
investigations into alleged bribery and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanioli said an Italian prosecutor traveled to New York this  
summer to discuss the case with the FBI and to request documents. 
Italy has not been able to complete the inquiry, though, as the 
documents have not yet arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's office in Rimini, on Italy's Adriatic coast,  
opened the investigation after a Russian businessman told police 
that other Russians had harassed him, kept him captive and extorted 
money from him, Giovanioli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry found that Russian gangsters systematically  
threatened fellow traders, forcing them to turn over a part of the 
profits they made from exporting consumer goods to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal organizations then funneled the illicit funds to  
New York for laundering, Giovanioli said.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Pushes on With Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An internal review into possible  
academic fraud and coverup at Tennessee might not be completed 
quickly because it will be thorough, an official involved in the 
review said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like it over in a day. But that is not realistic, is  
it?'' Carl Asp, Tennessee's faculty athletics representative, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe could take weeks. ``It just depends,'' he said. ``You  
know it is complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is reviewing reports that athletic department tutors  
did school work for athletes, in possible violation of school honor 
codes and NCAA rules, as far back as 1995, and that administrators 
were not informed. 
</P>
<P>
	If proven, the violations would bring a harsh penalty from the  
NCAA, but the school would not have to forfeit its 1998 national 
football title, a former NCAA official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Academic fraud is one of the more serious violations because  
it really goes to the whole heart of the student-athlete and the 
athletic program,'' said David Swank, immediate past chairman of 
the NCAA's Committee on Infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, obviously you have different degrees of fraud,'' said  
Swank, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico State, Michigan State, Texas Tech, Miami and  
Minnesota have all been hurt by claims of academic violations in 
recent years. Penalties have included NCAA probation and loss of 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the NCAA has withdrawn championships from schools that  
violate rules -- such as the UCLA women's softball championship in 
1995 -- Swank noted the national football title is created by the 
schools and bowl games and ``is not an NCAA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Tennessee's 1998 football crown would not be affected,  
``regardless of what would happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is aware of the situation at Tennessee, but is taking  
no action until the school makes its own findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Bill Snyder said his concerns go beyond sports.  
</P>
<P>
	``Academic dishonesty and plagiarism, if that is verified, we  
take a very strong position on that,'' he said. ``Regardless of who 
is involved ... whether student-athletes or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported Sunday that internal memos show high-level  
administrators in UT's athletic department were told four tutors 
might have done schoolwork for at least five unidentified football 
players, a baseball player and a female athlete. Three of the 
football players have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this information was passed on to campus authorities  
charged with investigating possible rules infractions, university 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN quoted a 1997 memo from Linda Bensel-Meyers, director for  
composition in the English department, to the Faculty Senate 
claiming problems in 1995 with freshmen athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote that ``several of these athletes submitted papers that  
were either co-written or entirely written by tutors'' hired by the 
athletics department. These athletes ``claimed they had been told 
by their tutors that this sort of intervention was acceptable,'' 
she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acts of plagiarism appeared to be institutionally mandated  
by the athletic department,'' wrote Bensel-Meyers, who failed to 
return calls for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN also reported that religious studies professor Dan  
Deffenbaugh suspected in 1995 that about one-third of the papers 
turned in by football players were plagiarized in some form. 
</P>
<P>
	Deffenbaugh, who now teaches at Lyon College in Arkansas, said  
this week he was satisfied with the athletic department's efforts 
to address the problem, which included more frequent purges of the 
hard drives of computers in academic services areas.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rebounded Tuesday on  
the back of a recovery overnight on Wall Street and on the stronger 
U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
504.64 points, or 3.00 percent, to 17,325.70 Tuesday. On Monday, 
the average closed down 50.67 points, or 0.30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were encouraged by the dollar's gains  
against the Japanese yen to buy up export-oriented blue-chip shares 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's message  
overnight from Washington urging Japan to develop more vibrant 
stock and bond markets also gave Japanese investors an impetus to 
buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight gains in U.S. stocks also eased fears of a possible  
downturn on Wall Street, which could prompt foreign investors to 
take profits on Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.06  
points to 10,303.29. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.52 yen, up  
2.38 yen from late Monday. The dollar gained in part on 
expectations that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 84.47 points,  
or 0.66 percent, to close at 12,844.93. On Monday, the index had 
slumped 271.61 points, or 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said bargain-hunters stepped into the Hong Kong  
following overnight gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia shares closed sharply higher on a last-minute surge of  
blue-chip buying by mainly foreign trading houses and a regional 
lift from stronger major markets across Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 14.154 points,  
or 2.8 percent, to 529.221. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Taipei exchange, where share prices  
tumbled for a second straight day amid concerns that high-tech 
companies will suffer big revenue losses as they scramble to reopen 
plants shut down by a devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 182.08,  
or 2.3 percent, to close at 7,577.85, adding to its losses of 
almost 2.7 percent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher on a technical rebound  
following improved regional sentiment. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 34.06 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,024.44. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower  
because of concerns over the rate of New Zealand's economic 
recovery. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index closed 7.49 points, 
or 0.3 percent, to 2,015.04. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Higher gold prices and Wall Street's overnight gains  
fueled a technical rebound in Philippine shares, with mining stocks 
leading the way. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected 
companies rose 13.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,070.43. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, but brokers  
said the real focus remained on the gold sector where there was a 
second day of exceptional gains. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 
2920.6, up 9.5 points, or 0.3. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly lower. The Korea Composite  
Stock Price Index fell 3.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 900.73. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed generally mixed. The  
key Composite Index slipped 0.38 point to close at 679.14. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed slightly higher in a technical  
rebound from sharp losses last week. The Stock Exchange of Thailand 
index rose 3.09 points, or 0.8 percent, to 385.23.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Rise on Wet Harvest / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher on  
the Chicago Board of Trade Tuesday as rain in the Midwest slowed 
the harvest throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	With rain moving through much of the Midwest Tuesday, a wet 6-  
to 10-day forecast helped bump up soybeans prices since the harvest 
is already slightly behind analysts' expectations. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture said Monday that soybeans were 15 percent 
harvested, down from 18 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and wheat also got a boost from weather. However, analysts  
said a surge in gold prices was spurring talk of inflation, helping 
to buoy some commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 6 cents to $2.85 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.13 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.15 1/4 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to 
$4.90 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures prices were lower on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .35 cent to 66.95 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 79.80 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .08 cent to 48.42 cents a pound; and February frozen 
pork bellies fell 1.85 cents to 63.57 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Offensive Woes Plague Cardinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- As if Arizona didn't have enough problems on  
offense, the Cardinals will be without big-play wide receiver Rob 
Moore for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be out for a significant amount of time,'' coach  
Vince Tobin said Tuesday. ``How long I don't know, but certainly he 
won't play this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore aggravated a pulled hamstring early in Monday night's  
24-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. His absence opened the way 
for Andy McCullough, the most valuable player in the World Bowl 
game for the NFL Europe title last summer. 
</P>

	``He did all right,'' Tobin said. ``I think he needs to play  
better. He needs to block a lot better than he did. He's going to 
have to stop up now that Rob can't go and play more like a veteran 
than a rookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver David Boston bruised his shoulder in the game, and  
his status won't be known until later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	As his team fell to 1-2, Tobin was most upset with the  
Cardinals' ongoing turnover problems. Arizona's Jake Plummer was 
intercepted twice and the Cardinals fumbled the ball away twice 
against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston muffed a punt to set up the 49ers' first touchdown, and  
Plummer's first interception set up the second less than a minute 
later. After Arizona's first sustained drive of the game, Frank 
Sanders fumbled on the goal line and the 49ers recovered for a 
touchback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had four turnovers in every game we've played,'' Tobin  
said. ``You just can't consistently win games doing that. When we 
get them on defense, we can't do anything with them. When they get 
turnovers, they're scoring touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at statistics and the team that has the most  
turnovers usually is the team that loses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer has thrown nine interceptions compared with just one  
touchdown in three games, a rocky start for the third-year 
quarterback who signed a four-year, $25 million contract last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tobin said he thought Plummer played well in the second half  
in rallying Arizona from a 17-0 deficit to cut the lead to 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had two good scoring drives in the third quarter and had us  
in a position to win the game,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Plummer's biggest problem has been a lack of practice  
time because of a sprained thumb. That injury kept him out of 
almost all of the preseason and severely limited his practice time 
the first two weeks of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's able to practice,'' Tobin said. ``I think he's going  
to get healthier and healthier and play better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer could have used some stronger play from the offensive  
line. He was under pressure almost every time he went back to pass. 
Arizona's struggling ground game resurrected briefly in the 
third-quarter touchdown drive, but otherwise there weren't many 
holes for the backs to run through. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offensive line didn't play very well, as most aspects of  
our team didn't,'' Tobin said. ``Jake took some hits that he 
shouldn't have to take.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An Indiana bank that conducts transactions  
via the World Wide Web has dismissed its president. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCreary, president of First Internet Bank of Indiana, was  
terminated Sept. 17 from the Indianapolis-based institution, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank chairman David Becker refused to explain the reason for the  
firing, but McCreary's attorney cited other opportunities as a 
reason for the departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking industry observer Rick Nisbeth said McCreary's  
traditional banking background may have conflicted with the 
high-tech approaches used by First Internet, founded in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Before launching First Internet Bank, McCreary was a vice  
president with Fifth Third Bank in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank opened seven months ago and has amassed about $80  
million in deposits. It has 3,100 accounts from customers across 
the nation, with average account balances above $25,000. 
</P>

	Until a permanent replacement is found, Becker will serve as  
interim president.

<HEADLINE> House Approves StopGap Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fiscal 2000 dawning Friday, Congress  
approved a resolution Tuesday to keep federal agencies open for 
three weeks as Republicans and the White House grapple over 
schools, public housing and other issues that have delayed spending 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have said President Clinton would sign the  
bill. That would avert for now the possibility of a federal 
shutdown, which neither party -- especially the Republicans -- wants 
at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-week grace period would give Republicans time to  
smoothe internal disputes over agriculture and other issues and to 
pass as many of the remaining spending bills as they can. It also 
would let both sides sharpen their political messages for what 
looms as an eventual showdown over spending priorities and 
protecting Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Not spending Social Security money ``becomes the hard wall on  
which you play every one of these separate bills,'' House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining that point, the House voted 417-2 for a nonbinding,  
GOP-written measure urging lawmakers not to spend Social Security 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they voted for it, Democrats mocked the measure. They  
cited estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that 
GOP spending plans already erode part of next year's Social 
Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This resolution is the equivalent of saying we're going to  
quit smoking while we are lighting a cigarette,'' said Democratic 
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 421-2 and the Senate 98-1 for the three-week  
stopgap bill, margins that belied the partisan finger-pointing 
raging over who is to blame for Congress being delinquent on most 
of its spending work. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, lawmakers sent Clinton only the fifth of the 13  
annual bills for the imminent fiscal year when the Senate gave 
final approval to a compromise $21 billion measure financing energy 
and water programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top Democrat on the House  
Appropriations Committee, said the spending bills had been 
``hijacked by a militant element in the Republican Party caucus 
which says, `My way or no way.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.,  
said he invited Clinton early this year to join Republicans in 
finding ways to deal with tight spending limits. Those limits, part 
of the 1997 budget-balancing deal, have haunted the GOP all year as 
it has hunted gimmicks that would let it avoid appearing to condone 
higher government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made requests to the president: get engaged,'' Young said.  
``It was his decision not to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missing the Oct. 1 deadline is practically a congressional  
tradition. Since the current budget process began in fiscal 1977, 
all 13 bills have been passed on schedule only four times, most 
recently for fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The stopgap bill will let agencies whose spending bills have not  
been enacted by Friday to function at this year's spending levels 
through Oct. 21. So far, those agencies include the departments of 
Health and Human Services, Defense, Interior and NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains unclear how the two sides ultimately will resolve  
their spending disputes. Complicating their work is the GOP effort 
to find ways to claim it is not spending Social Security surpluses, 
which has become one of the party's paramount pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Armey said Republicans would propose slowing  
payment of tax credits to millions of low-income Americans for a 
savings of $8 billion. The earned income credit would be paid in 
monthly installments instead of the lump sum most of the 20 million 
recipients currently receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans dismissed the idea as too harsh when it was  
floated two weeks ago. But Armey called it ``a commonsense 
approach'' that would mainly affect recipients who pay no income 
taxes, adding, ``I would say it is denying them the lump sum 
acceptance of my money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate gave final legislative approval to the energy and  
water measure by 96-3. A veto threat against it, one of seven the 
administration has issued, was dropped after Republicans retreated 
from language that would have made it easier for developers to file 
legal appeals when the government stops them from building on 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	That measure also provides more than $160 million in local water  
projects that the administration did not request, while providing 
less than half the nearly $110 million increase Clinton sought for 
the Energy Department's nuclear weapons facilities.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Short-Term Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eyeing Friday's start of fiscal 2000, the  
House today moved toward passing a stopgap measure that will keep 
federal agencies functioning for three weeks as President Clinton 
and Republicans sort through spending disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats blamed unyielding Republican demands for Congress'  
failure to complete most of the 13 spending bills on time, a 
failure to meet the schedule that in fact is nearly an annual 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing seven White House veto threats, he said Republicans  
``turned seven bipartisan bills into seven partisan war zones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Bill  
Young, R-Fla., said he invited Clinton months ago to join 
Republicans in working through their spending differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his decision not to do so,'' Young said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to approve the bill as early as today.  
White House officials said Clinton would sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by the new fiscal year, GOP leaders planned to push a 
compromise $21 billion energy and water projects measure through 
the Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, which would be the fifth to be sent to Clinton, was  
likely to get his signature after Republicans dropped a provision 
that would have helped developers and local governments file 
quicker legal appeals when the government blocks them from building 
on wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure Monday by 327-87.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee planned to vote  
today on a $324 billion social spending bill for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Friday. The measure, approved Monday by a subcommittee, 
would outspend Clinton on education by $500 million, but provide 
less than he wants for hiring teachers, after-school centers and 
some of his other favorite initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step, House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise  
$12.6 billion foreign aid measure for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators dropped language barring aid to groups that  
lobby to ease overseas abortion restrictions, a defeat for 
anti-abortion conservatives. But the bill contained $2 billion less 
than Clinton wanted, cuts that prompted an administration veto 
threat when they were proposed in earlier versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already threatened to veto the House's version  
of the education-health-labor bill, citing its cuts in his plans 
for job training for teen-agers, hiring teachers, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill eased many of the reductions, but not all. But  
its numbers pushed it far closer to what an eventual compromise 
between the White House and Congress was likely to look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better  
than what the House did,'' said the subcommittee's top Democrat, 
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000. It is the most 
controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual spending bills to 
begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $35.2 billion for education, $500 million  
more than Clinton; $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200 million 
less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and human 
services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Asked To Fly 737s Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The nation's largest airline has become the  
second to ask pilots of Boeing 737s to speed up during takeoffs and 
landings to avoid the type of rudder malfunction believed to have 
caused a deadly 1994 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board ruled this year that a  
rudder reversal most likely caused a US Airways flight to plunge to 
the ground on Sept. 8, 1994, killing all 132 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, US Airways and United have ordered 737 pilots to speed up  
by about 23 mph to give themselves more time to correct problems 
that cannot be fixed at slower speeds, according to a United 
spokesman and documents obtained by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 
The newspaper reported the United change today and the US Airways 
change Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 is the only commercial jet with a rudder controlled by a  
single hydraulic valve. Other jets have multiple valves that can 
compensate if one jams, as the single valve has been known to do, 
according to the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	An NTSB report released in July lists 112 such ``rudder events''  
in the past two decades, malfunctions ``that could be 
catastrophic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are 3,111 Boeing 737s in use worldwide -- and as  
many as 800 in the air at any given time -- redesigning the rudder 
could cause severe airline disruptions, not to mention the hundreds 
of millions of dollars it would cost Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials also are reportedly investigating whether a  
United 737 incident this month was rudder-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 15 problem was with United Flight 1253, which took off  
from Atlanta and was landing at Denver with 94 people aboard, 
United spokesman Kurt Evenhoch said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It rolled and yawed,'' said Evenhoch, who likened the movement  
to a car tipping to one side and ``fishtailing.'' ``The airplane 
landed normally and the landing was uneventful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evenhoch said United Airlines believes wake turbulence -- wind  
forces caused by another airplane -- caused Flight 1253 to roll in 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB has no preliminary cause and is reviewing data from the  
plane's flight data recorder, said Ben Berman, an NTSB spokesman.

<HEADLINE> CNN Airs, Then Edits Videotape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN aired a video Tuesday of a captured Russian  
soldier being shot in the head, then edited the report in 
subsequent viewings to stop the action before the trigger was 
pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	The graphic video, apparently taken by fighters in the breakaway  
republic of Chechnya three years ago, was contained in a report 
about how the footage is being used to muster Russian political 
support for the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	One person called to complain to CNN when the report was  
initially aired shortly after noon, spokesman Earl Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, the decision had already been made to edit the  
video, Casey said. It was shown again at 2:45 p.m. and was also 
being aired on CNN Headline News and on CNN's international 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to eliminate the overt acts of violence in the  
video,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's Jeanne Meserve warned viewers before the report that it  
contains ``some very violent images that you may find disturbing.'' 
Reporter Mike Hanna said the video, obtained by Russian security, 
was apparently shown to Russian politicians and, to some extent, on 
Russian television. 
</P>
<P>
	During its initial CNN airing, it depicted a man with a gun to  
his head, but the image stopped before he was shot. A gun was fired 
against a second man, his fatal injuries obscured by a puff of 
smoke and the video's grainy quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Another snippet of film shows a man begging for his life. He is  
then blindfolded and his head placed on a tree stump. The video 
shows an executioner raising an ax above the man's head and 
swinging it, with the image stopping before the ax hits its mark. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN has run graphic footage during past reports on conflicts,  
Casey noted. During the Kosovo war, the network showed a series of 
bloody corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the network did not edit out the depiction of a man  
being shot before the video was shown the first time, Casey said it 
was routine in news organizations to make changes on deadline. He 
didn't say who ordered the change.

	Consumer Confidence Slips in Sept.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence weakened in September for  
the third consecutive month, suggesting that Federal Reserve moves 
to raise interest rates are cooling off the economy. Still, 
analysts looking at the Conference Board's survey results on today 
said they expect retail sales to remain strong as the holiday 
season approaches. The Conference Board said today that its index 
of consumer confidence, which is a measure of consumers' 
willingness to spend, dipped to 134.2 in September, down 1.8 
percentage points from a revised 136 in August. Analysts had 
forecast that September's reading would be 135.4. Economists noted 
that the latest level still was not far below the June reading of 
139, which was the strongest in more than 30 years.

	Fed Warns Banks on Easing Standards  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today advised its bank  
examiners to watch for signs that banks may be relaxing their 
lending requirements, creating an increase in shaky loans that 
could threaten the strength of the banking system. The central 
bank's action came a day after Fed Gov. Laurence Meyer warned that 
some banks may be counting too much on continuation of the economic 
boom. Other government officials have issued similar warnings 
recently.

	World Bank, IMF Heads Stress Aid

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Governments and international financial  
institutions must create new coalitions to help developing 
countries escape from poverty, the heads of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund said today. James Wolfensohn of the 
World Bank and Michel Camdessus of the IMF said a plan to cancel as 
much as $27 billion of the debt owed by the world's poorest 
countries is only a beginning of the effort. President Clinton will 
focus on how debt relief can ease these countries' poverty burden 
when he addresses the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF 
tomorrow, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

	Russia Denounces Bank of N.Y. Case  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior aide to President Boris Yeltsin said  
Tuesday that allegations of massive Russian money-laundering 
through a New York bank were invented by the West and government 
opponents at home to tarnish Russia. Russia has been reluctant to 
open a major investigation into media reports that Russians may 
have funneled as much as $10 billion through the Bank of New York. 
Deputy chief of staff Igor Shabdurasulov added his name to the list 
of Russian officials who have denounced the whole case as an 
anti-Russian plot. Shabdurasulov dismissed media reports on the 
case and allegations of bribe-taking by Kremlin officials.

	Y2K Will Add to Russia's Woes

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Past fears of an errant Russian missile launch  
can probably be put to rest, but Y2K computer problems still 
threaten serious disruptions to the U.S.-Russia crisis hotlines, a 
Pentagon official said today. Assistant Defense Secretary Edward 
Warner, testifying before the special Senate panel on Y2K, said 
Y2K-related software problems could affect full operation of six of 
the seven direct communications links between the two countries. 
But he also voiced cofidence that the fixes will be installed and 
tested by December, before the world confronts the Y2K problem on 
Jan. 1.

	Internet Management Case Settled

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cash-strapped group assuming management of  
much of the Internet agreed today to allow a Virginia company to 
continue for at least four years as keeper of the master list of 
World Wide Web addresses in exchange for a $1.25 million payment. 
The complex settlement aims to resolve the most contentious 
arguments surrounding transition of control over the Web from the 
federal government to the California-based Internet Corporation for 
Assigned Names and Numbers. The impact of the agreement on typical 
Internet consumers is slight. The agreement involvews largely 
behind-the-scenes management of technical issues and standards.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amazon.com and the Postal Service are  
launching a joint advertising campaign. The idea is to establish 
Amazon.com as the ultimate gift-giving destination in the United 
States and the U.S. Postal Service and Priority Mail as the 
preferred shipper of leading e-commerce companies, according to 
postal spokeswoman Judy deTorok. Postmaster General William 
Henderson said the project was initiated during a meeting of the 
postal governing board in Seattle, when officials visited Internet 
book seller Amazon.com's headquarters to discuss common interests.

<HEADLINE> Albright Renews Bill Veto Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright renewed a  
veto threat Tuesday against a foreign aid bill that fails to pay 
for the Middle East peace process and deeply slashes international 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``At these levels, we would have no flexibility to deal with  
emerging threats or respond to urgent crises,'' she told an 
audience of leaders of Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate negotiators completed work late Monday night on a  
$12.6 billion foreign aid spending bill for the fiscal year that 
begins Friday. It now awaits final House and Senate votes, with 
further amendments prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount in the bill is $2 billion below that requested by  
President Clinton, Albright complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also said that while the Clinton administration hopes  
to get Israeli-Syrian peace talks back on track, it opposes any 
formula that would link progress in those talks to other 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks were suspended in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here is whether we can find the way to restart  
negotiations that will match the will that all sides profess to 
feel,'' Albright told the Conference of Presidents of Major 
American Jewish Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told  
Albright that Israel cannot accept an Egyptian proposal that would 
link progress in Syrian-Israeli talks to wider peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	During a private portion of Tuesday's meeting with Jewish  
leaders, Albright was questioned about the Egyptian position and 
told the audience she did not agree with it, a senior 
administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign aid bill, Albright indicated she and other senior  
advisers still plan to recommend a veto, even though an 
anti-abortion provision strongly opposed by the administration was 
jettisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation failed to provide money for implementing Middle  
East peace accords that the Israelis and Palestinians reached last 
year in negotiations at Wye River, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has Congress ignored the administration's request for  
at least $500 million for Israel and the Palestinians to carry out 
the accords in the fiscal year beginning Friday, foreign aid 
negotiators also cut $100 million promised to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wye River money is contained in a separate spending bill  
that Clinton has sent Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, the Palestinians urged the Clinton  
administration and Congress to ease U.S. restrictions that might 
make it hard for them to get their share of the peace-process 
money. Some date back to the 1980s when the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization was viewed by the United States as a terrorist 
organization, said Hassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO representative in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish the Congress to give us this money and that President  
Clinton will do all he can to get us this money,'' Rahman said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said the White House ``would  
be consulting closely with Congress in the future'' about ways of 
broadening the U.S.-Palestinian relationship, including possibly 
lifting no-longer-suitable restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions could deny U.S. assistance to the Palestinians  
unless they met a variety of free-immigration and human rights 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In her speech, Albright urged the Jewish leaders to help lobby  
for the separate spending measure and to support Clinton's 
prospective veto of the foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diplomacy is America's first line of defense,'' Albright said.  
``It should be treated as a budget priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I have eliminated the words `foreign aid' from our  
vocabulary. These two words don't seem to excite a lot of people.''

<HEADLINE> Young, 49ers Deal With Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's latest concussion after  
a frightening hit sent him to a neurologist on Tuesday and left the 
San Francisco 49ers wondering about the future of their star 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said during a news conference that Young  
underwent an MRI and was going over the results with the 
neurologist. The outcome of the examination wasn't available. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said that he spoke with Young earlier in the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to be OK. He seemed to be fine. We're hopeful that  
he'll be able to go this week,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the coach didn't rule out the possibility of holding him out  
against Tennessee on Sunday as a precaution, even if he's cleared 
medically to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if something shows up on the MRI, the decision will  
be easy,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci also raised the possibility that Young, who has a  
history of concussions, might consider retirement if advised to do 
so by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know that that's on his mind just yet,''  
Mariucci said. ``But he may be in a situation right now where he 
would be more receptive to that. Obviously, the main consideration 
is Steve's health. That's the A No. 1 consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young lost consciousness for several seconds after the  
head-snapping hit in Monday night's 24-10 victory at Arizona. He 
left the game with just seconds remaining in the second quarter and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to dodge pressure, Young instead caught the full force of  
a hit from blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams. The violent blow 
knocked Young backward, and as he fell, his head hit tackle Dave 
Fiore's leg before smashing against the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless on the field with his eyes shut, and tackle  
Derrick Deese tugged at his jersey to try to help him up. When 
there was no immediate response, Deese waved to the sideline for 
help and team trainers and doctors ran onto the field, along with 
Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Young came to after a few minutes and walked off the field under  
his own power. At one point, he even tried to talk Mariucci into 
letting him re-enter the game, but Mariucci ruled it out. Young 
then donned a cap and watched from the sideline as backup Jeff 
Garcia finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion punctuated what has been a trying season thus far  
for the 37-year-old Young. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection has been spotty and he has been battered by the  
opposition weekly. In last week's 28-21 victory over New Orleans, 
Young was hit 21 times, including five sacks, in what was one of 
the most sustained poundings he's endured in a 15-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The protection appeared slightly improved Monday night until the  
fateful breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-game interview, Young appeared lucid and told  
reporters he does take the issue of repeated concussions seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am much more sober about it than anyone,'' Young said.  
``I'll deal with it as realistically as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion is at least the fourth for Young since 1996. The  
previous three occurred over a 10-month span, two during the 1996 
season and another in the 1997 opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The three previous concussions in relatively quick succession  
raised fears about the possible impact on Young's long-term health 
if he continued playing. Some friends and relatives urged him to 
consider retiring, and there was concern that one more serious hit 
could force him out of football. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was cleared to play and he's missed only two games  
due to injury over the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Chiquita Source Sues Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former lawyer for Chiquita Brands  
International Inc. has sued The Cincinnati Enquirer, accusing the 
newspaper of breaking a promise by identifying him as a source for 
its expose of the banana company. 
</P>
<P>
	George Ventura claims former Enquirer reporters Michael  
Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter promised him confidentiality -- with 
management's knowledge -- in exchange for inside information about 
Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the reporters violated the promise by secretly  
taping conversations with him and later identifying him to Chiquita 
and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory  
damages. His federal lawsuit accuses the Enquirer and its parent, 
the Gannett Co., of breach of contract, fraud and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer and Gannett denied identifying confidential  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer in May 1998 published a series of stories  
suggesting that Cincinnati-based Chiquita engaged in improper 
business practices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The next month, the newspaper fired Gallagher, saying he had  
employed unethical means of getting information, and renounced the 
stories in a front-page apology. The newspaper also paid Chiquita 
more than $10 million to settle any legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher later admitted stealing Chiquita executives' voice  
mail for the series and was sentenced to five years of probation. 
He also cooperated in the prosecution of Ventura, who was 
identified in court as a source for the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Ventura pleaded no contest to supplying the secret  
codes Gallagher used to get into the voice-mail boxes. Ventura got 
two years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, 38, said the disclosure that he was a source for the  
Enquirer stories cost him his job at a Salt Lake City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence K. Beaupre, then editor of the Enquirer and now a news  
executive at Gannett, denied the allegations in Ventura's lawsuit. 
``The Enquirer and Gannett have never identified any confidential 
sources,'' Beaupre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's lawyer, Patrick Hanley, said: ``We don't believe  
that Mike Gallagher broke any promises to Mr. Ventura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter is now a reporter for The Detroit News, another  
Gannett newspaper. His lawyer also said McWhirter did not identify 
sources for the Chiquita story. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment does  
not protect news organizations from being sued when they publish 
the names of sources promised confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in the case of Dan Cohen, a public-relations  
executive who worked for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in 
Minnesota in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune and St.  
Paul Pioneer Press that the Democratic candidate for lieutenant 
governor once had been charged with shoplifting $6 worth of sewing 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters promised Cohen confidentiality, but their editors  
said his name should be used to make it clear that the information 
came from a rival campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded Cohen $700,000, but that was knocked down to  
$200,000 on appeal.

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Rise Above $300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold prices surged past the $300-an-ounce mark to a 17-month  
high Tuesday in a powerful two-day rally sustained by news that a 
group of central banks would limit their combined sales of bullion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybean and grain futures rose, while most  
energy futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices began shooting higher after 15 European central  
banks announced Sunday that they would limit their combined sales 
of bullion to 400 tons per year for a total of five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's had enormous ramifications on the market,'' said Matthew  
Ford, a metals analyst with U.S. Global Investors Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day December gold prices flirted with the $330  
per-troy-ounce mark before settling at $310 an ounce on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, up from $283.80 on Monday, when prices 
also rose sharply. The current contract, for September delivery, 
closed at $308 an ounce, a gain of $26.20. Exchange officials said 
the last time gold finished at this level was on April 28, 1998, 
when gold settled at $308.30. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, gold closed at $301.50 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$279.90 on Monday and the highest level since Oct. 2, 1998, when it 
also finished the day at $301.50. In Zurich the bid price was 
$301.02 an ounce, up from $280.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, harvest-slowing rain and predictions for more wet  
weather in the Midwest sent grain and soybean futures prices higher 
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the soybean harvest is already slightly behind  
schedule and will likely be further delayed if the 6- to 10-day 
forecast for rain pans out. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 
Monday that soybeans were 15 percent harvested, down from 18 
percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and wheat also got a boost from weather. Analysts said the  
surge in gold prices was spurring talk of inflation, helping to 
boost some commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, wheat for December delivery rose 6 cents to  
$2.85 3/4 a bushel; December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.13 3/4 a bushel; 
December oats rose 1 1/4 cents to $1.15 1/4 a bushel; and November 
soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to $4.90 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, energy futures settled mostly lower on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, confirming analysts predictions that Monday's 
surge in gasoline prices would be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude oil for November delivery fell 28 cents to  
$24.33 a barrel; October heating oil fell .44 cent to 61.68 cents a 
gallon; October unleaded gas rose .09 cent to 72.75 cents a gallon; 
and natural gas fell .72 cent to $2.560 cents per million British 
thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for November delivery fell 31  
cents to $23.76 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Court To Examine HMO Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use an  
Illinois case to decide whether health-maintenance organizations 
can sometimes be sued for offering doctors financial bonuses to 
keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear a health plan's bid to stop an  
Illinois woman, who blamed her ruptured appendix on inadequate 
care, from suing her HMO on a claim that it violated its management 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Herdrich of Bloomington, Ill., sued the Carle Clinic  
Association in 1992, saying her appendix ruptured and peritonitis 
set in because her doctor delayed diagnostic tests for eight days 
so the tests could be performed at a facility owned by the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Herdrich was awarded $35,000 in damages under state law, but she  
also sued under a federal law, the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act, which governs employee benefits and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Herdrich contended the HMO violated its management duty to its  
patients by depriving them of proper medical care and keeping the 
cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge dismissed that claim, but the 7th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals said the issue could go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the complaint, Carle doctors stood to gain  
financially when they were able to limit treatments and 
referrals,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said such incentives do not automatically mean a plan  
has violated its duty to its patients, but that a breach of duty 
can arise ``where physicians delay providing necessary treatment 
to, withhold administering proper care to, plan beneficiaries for 
the sole purpose of increasing their bonuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the health plan's lawyers said  
that if Herdrich could sue, ``then many, if not most, HMOs are 
unlawful.'' They said the case ``has far-reaching implications for 
all managed care plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herdrich's lawyers said the 7th Circuit court's ruling was more  
narrowly tailored to the facts of her case. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pegram vs. Herdrich, 98-1949.

<HEADLINE> Girl Says She Is 'Columbine Martyr' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Cassie Bernall, the young woman held up  
as a martyr after the Columbine High bloodbath, may not have been 
the student who said yes when asked by one of the gunmen if she 
believed in God. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Schnurr, 18, said in Tuesday's Denver Post that it was she  
who uttered that response after a shotgun blast knocked her out 
from under a library table where she had been hiding during the 
attack in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr said that as she bled from her wounds, she pleaded,  
``Oh my God, oh my God, don't let me die.'' That, she said, was 
when one of the student shooters asked her if she believed in God 
and she said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr said she crawled away as the gunman reloaded. She  
suffered nearly three dozen shotgun wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Townsend, a friend hiding with her, was killed, along  
with Miss Bernall, 10 other students and a teacher. The two 
teen-age gunmen killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a student who helped authorities retrace the events  
in the library got sick when he realized it was Miss Schnurr's 
table, not Miss Bernall's, that he was pointing out in describing 
the exchange between gunman and victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said determining who said yes is  
not a priority for investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have conflicting witness statements from several kids who  
were in the library,'' he said. ``But this is not something we're 
out to prove or disprove. It's not really a part of the 
investigation we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bernall's story was repeated around the world. The exchange  
turned her into a martyr who had found God after falling in with 
the wrong crowd, dabbling in the occult and experimenting with 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Misty Bernall, wrote a book -- ``She Said Yes: The  
Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall,'' and she has been honored at 
youth rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr, who now attends college, said she has no idea  
whether Miss Bernall was asked the same question in her final 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be famous or deemed anything,'' she said. ``I  
said I believed in God out of respect for myself and respect for 
God. That's it.''

<HEADLINE> Drifter Ruled Sane During Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A jury on Tuesday rejected a drifter's  
claim that hallucinogenic drugs had made him insane when he killed 
9-year-old boy in a beach restroom last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wilson, 21, admitted killing the boy but had pleaded  
innocent by reason of insanity. The jury next will hear testimony 
on whether he should be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said Wilson is a delusional manic-depressive who  
believed God chose him as ``an agent for destruction of mankind.'' 
Wilson testified that LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms led him to 
that belief. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution pointed to Wilson's videotaped confession two  
days after the slaying, in which he made no mention of hearing God 
but said he killed for the thrill of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a settlement payment of about $17,000 from an auto  
accident, Wilson left his home in St. Croix, Wis., and traveled for 
nearly two years through the West, ending up at Anza-Borrego Desert 
State Park in eastern San Diego County last November. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a few hits of LSD, ``I realized there was a part of  
myself that was evil, that God had put it there and he had put it 
there for a reason,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then traveled 100 miles to Oceanside, north of San Diego,  
checked into a motel and searched for a victim. He spotted Matthew 
Cecchi, who was visiting the beach while attending a family 
reunion, and followed him into the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson slit the boy's throat with a knife and left him to bleed  
to death while his aunt waited for him outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was captured in Hollywood the next day after stabbing a  
woman on the street. She survived.

<HEADLINE> NEC To Sell Building, Cut Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics maker NEC Corp. plans to sell  
its headquarters building, reduce its 37-member board by half and 
cut its debt over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The company disclosed the plans Tuesday as it slashed its  
earnings forecast for the year, citing lower sales of memory chips 
and communications devices. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects to earn a group net profit of 10 billion yen, or $94  
million, in the fiscal year ending March 2000. It had previously 
forecast earnings of 25 billion yen.

<P>
	NEC said that although domestic sales of cellular phones and  
personal computers have been solid, sales of memory chips and 
overseas sales of communications devices have fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the company said sales are expected to be 50  
billion yen, or $472 million, below initial expectations of 5 
trillion yen, or $47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new sales forecast still would represent a 5 percent  
increase from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC plans to reduce its debt by $5.66 billion over three years.  
A cpmpany spokesman declined to say how much debt NEC had overall.

<HEADLINE> Harvest Rain Boosts Grain, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher in  
trading early today on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain in the 
Midwest slowed harvest progress throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden rise in gold prices also was stirring enthusiasm in  
the commodities market. 
</P>
<P>
	A forecast for wet weather over the next six to 10 days helped  
bump up soybean prices, with the harvest progress to date a little 
behind what analysts had expected. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture said Monday that soybeans were 15 percent harvested, 
down from 18 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also got a boost from weather and gold. Investors said  
buyers who have no interest in corn are jumping into the market 
because of the rise in the price of gold and the new speculative 
money it is attracting to commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in gold also was spurring talk of inflation, helping  
to underpin commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened higher, extending Monday's rally.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.82 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1/2 cent to $1.14 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 3/4 cents to 
$4.87 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .35 cent to 66.95 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 79.95 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .35 cent to 48.85 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies fell 2.32 cents to 63.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Freelance Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new court ruling is raising questions about  
compensation for freelance writers whose work appeared in 
electronic databases without their permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Copyright law ``does not permit the publishers to license  
individually copyrighted works for inclusion in the electronic 
databases,'' according to the unanimous ruling issued Friday by a 
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals' Second Circuit in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1993 by six writers and the National  
Writers' Union, which represents 5,000 freelance writers. The suit 
was filed against The New York Times Co., Newsday, Time Inc. 
Magazine Co., Mead Data Central Corp., and University Microfilms 
International and The Atlantic Monthly Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors had claimed, according to the ruling, ``that the  
copyright each owns in his or her individual articles was infringed 
when the publishers provided them to the electronic databases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since the lawsuit was filed, most large publishers  
have made the purchase of electronic rights, which include use of 
stories on the Web, a standard part of contracts with freelance 
writers. Typically they do not provide extra compensation for the 
electronic rights, although a big-name author might be able to 
negotiate additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear what, if any, recourse might be available to  
writers whose work was purchased for publication only in a print 
format and was then later archived in an electronic format without 
express permission -- for example, in Nexis, which is comprised of 
stories from hundreds of periodicals over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute applies mainly to electronic news databases such as  
Nexis, and predates the widespread use of the World Wide Web as a 
publishing medium by several years. Nexis had been owned by Mead 
Data at the time the suit was filed but is now owned by Reed 
Elsevier PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to two dozen major media companies, Jonathan Tasini,  
president of the National Writers' Union, warned that the ruling 
``potentially puts your company at great financial and legal 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of writers are now positioned to hit the industry  
with thousands of new claims,'' Tasini said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the defendants will respond. ``We just got  
the decision Friday,'' said Carolyn Schurr, general counsel for 
Newsday. ``We are reviewing it and looking into our options. We 
have not decided how to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One option would be to appeal the ruling, requesting that the  
decision by the three-judge panel be evaluated by the entire Second 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling is not appealed, it will be up to a lower court  
judge to decide what the plaintiffs' obligations are. The original 
lawsuit did not specify any monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a real open question,'' said George Freeman, general  
counsel for The New York Times. ``There's no significant money 
involved with the articles'' that were written by the individual 
authors who filed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``From The New York Times' point of view, when we  
looked at whatever evidence there is, we found the monetary value 
to be insignificant. Millions more people read the piece in The New 
York Times the day it's printed than ever read it on line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he believed researchers using electronic databases  
were more likely to want articles by staff writers than Op-Ed 
pieces or magazine articles written by freelancers, and that it 
would be very difficult for freelancers to prove that publishers 
profited from the electronic use of their material. 
</P>
<P>
	Tasini has proposed resolving the electronic rights issue  
through a collective licensing system, called the Publication 
Rights Clearinghouse, similar to the system governing royalties for 
the use of copyrighted music. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a writer you license your work to the PRC and then we make  
it available for anyone to buy it and use it legally for a fee,'' 
Tasini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he wasn't sure publishers would be interested. ``I  
don't know that the model really works for this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-year statute of limitations pertains to copyright  
infringements. But Tasini believes there is a legal basis for 
claims going back more than three years because if they are 
available electronically, ``there is a notion of continuous 
infringement'' from the time the item was archived.

<HEADLINE> Buchberger Named Thrashers Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kelly Buchberger, who spent the last four years  
as captain of the Edmonton Oilers, will be the first captain for 
the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team named Buchberger captain on Tuesday, a move widely  
expected since the 32-year-old right wing was acquired from 
Edmonton in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Thrashers assigned goaltender Corey Schwab to Orlando  
of the IHL. Atlanta will have to cut six more players before 
Saturday night's opener against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger spent 13 seasons with the Oilers, playing on three  
Stanley Cup teams and taking over as captain in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab, who played 40 games last season for Tampa Bay, provides  
minor-league insurance for the Thrashers. The top two goalies are 
Damian Rhodes and Norm Maracle.

<HEADLINE> Ralston Sells Battery Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ralston Purina Co. is selling its line of  
Energizer rechargeable batteries, used in cellular phones, power 
tools and laptop computers, to Moltech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced Tuesday to Tucson, Ariz.-based Moltech allows  
Ralston to focus on its Energizer brand batteries, which face tough 
competition from arch-rival Duracell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston had been seeking a buyer since April for the business --  
the Energizer Power Systems Original Equipment Manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ralston said its  
Eveready Battery Co. Inc. would retain a minority interest in the 
combined business. The deal was expected to be completed by late 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Ralston announced in June that it would separate  
its Eveready Battery subsidiary in a spinoff. The spinoff, which 
still needs government approval, was expected to be completed next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Moltech, it's a good fit,'' said Juli Niemann, an analyst  
with Huntleigh Securities in St. Louis. ``The big question is, how 
much are they selling it for -- and of course, they aren't saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston stock slipped 50 cents Tuesday on the New York Stock  
Exchange to close at $28.37 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Energizer Power Systems reported $98 million in sales in the  
first nine months of the current fiscal year, down from $117 
million in the same period a year earlier. It has struggled because 
of softness in the world economy. Makers of rechargeable devices 
switched to batteries made in Asia as weakening currencies made 
their products cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Energizer Power Systems is based in Gainesville, Fla. It  
employes 2,100 workers worldwide with operations in Gainesville; 
Juarez, Mexico; the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Moltech has focused primarily on developing and commercializing  
a revolutionary new chemistry and cell design for a new class of 
rechargeable batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moltech and EPS are very complementary with Moltech's  
expertise in research and development and EPS's strength in 
production, marketing and sales,'' said Dr. Terje Skotheim, 
chairman and CEO of Moltech. ``Together, they will be a formidable 
competitor in the global rechargeable battery industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moltech, a private corporation, is funded by a number of U.S.  
and European investors. It was founded in 1988 as a spin-off from 
Brookhaven National Laboratory. In addition to its own scientists, 
Moltech has collaborative agreements with a number of top research 
organizations around the world.

<HEADLINE> Heat Vexes Calif. Wildfire Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters toiled in unseasonably hot  
temperatures Tuesday as they battled wildfires that have scorched 
125,000 acres of California wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires destroyed at least 49 homes in Happy Valley in far  
Northern California and threatened others in the coastal mountains 
of Big Sur on Tuesday. One fire crewman died late Monday night 
after suffering a heart attack while being evacuated in the Trinity 
Alps Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures soared past 90 degrees on Tuesday in Monterey  
County, where 3,300 firefighters were battling two large wildfires 
that had consumed 48,608 acres in the Los Padres National Forest on 
the scenic central California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents have been evacuated from the area, where up to a dozen  
homes and numerous other buildings are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem was the Hare Fire, which had burned 20,158  
acres as of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That fire is very active,'' fire information officer Juanita  
Freel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fire in the region had burned 28,450 acres and was 45  
percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the higher temperatures, the higher winds and the low  
humidity, you do have more active fires,'' Freel said. ``But that's 
not the main difficulty in fighting these fires. It's the terrain. 
It's steep and rugged.''

<HEADLINE> Spending Bills Not Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes over everything from family planning  
to NASA have dashed any hope Congress' Republican leaders had of 
keeping their pledge to complete spending bills before Friday's 
start of fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Already planning to violate a second promise to honor 2-year-old  
spending limits, Republicans are using accounting gimmicks to claim 
they are holding to a third promise: that they will not use Social 
Security surpluses to pay for federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Though most Americans pay little attention to the government's  
fiscal calendar or spending limits, polls show they are attuned to 
both parties' pledges to protect Social Security's huge trust 
funds. Violating these promises can be particularly harmful to the 
GOP because its core conservative supporters care deeply about 
their party's efforts for fiscal austerity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Republicans have most to worry about is losing their  
credibility on fiscal responsibility,'' said Marshall Wittmann, the 
conservative Heritage Foundation's director of congressional 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders insist they will not spend Social Security funds.  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said on television Sunday 
that that is the GOP's ``intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make that claim, Republicans are relying on gimmicks such as  
postponing billions in spending into 2001 and beyond, and changing 
the official spending estimates used by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But moderate Republicans eager to protect some programs and for  
Congress to turn its attention to other issues want party leaders 
to cut a spending deal with President Clinton, even if it means 
eating into Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have to sit at a table and talk to one another,''  
said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. ``Both sides are going to have to 
share the blame for that, if and when it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by Friday, the House voted 327-87 Monday to approve a 
final version of a $21 billion measure financing energy and water 
projects. Senate approval -- expected Tuesday -- would make it the 
fifth spending measure for 2000 that lawmakers have shipped to the 
White House. Clinton is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill's completion demonstrated the GOP's eagerness to  
complete whatever work they can. To finish, Republicans agreed to 
drop language from the measure that would have let developers or 
local governments file earlier court appeals when the Army Corps of 
Engineers blocks them from building on wetlands. The White House 
opposed the provision on environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee also  
approved a $324 billion measure for health, education and labor 
programs for the coming year. The Senate measure would add $500 
million to Clinton's $34.7 billion request for education, but it 
reduces his proposals for hiring new teachers, adult education and 
several other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already threatened to veto a more austere House  
version of that bill because it provides less than he wants for 
after school, worker safety and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to blame the kids and it's wrong not to give the  
schools a chance,'' Clinton said in New Orleans on Monday, 
referring to GOP cuts in his education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced that he now expects the surplus for  
fiscal 1999 -- which ends Thursday night -- will be at least $115 
billion, $16 billion more than the last White House projection. But 
that will have little effect on the fight over next year's bills, 
unless the surplus projection for 2000 rises when it is updated in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slow pace of work and the seven veto threats the  
administration has issued, no federal shutdown is imminent. 
Congress plans to send Clinton legislation as early as Tuesday 
keeping agencies functioning through Oct. 21 while work on 
remaining bills continues. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew said Monday that Clinton  
would sign the stopgap measure, but warned that Republicans should 
be under ``no illusion'' that he would sign numerous short-term 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight unfinished spending bills, many are mired in  
disputes among Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These include battles over the Cuba trade embargo and regional  
milk prices that have slowed the $68 billion agriculture bill; over 
the Air Force's planned purchases of F-22 stealth fighters, which 
has delayed the near $270 billion defense bill; and over federal 
aid to groups that lobby foreign governments to ease their abortion 
restrictions, which has hampered the $13 billion foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A $97 billion measure cuts Clinton's plans for NASA, environment  
and housing while boosting health-care programs for veterans. The 
$14 billion bill financing the Interior Department contains 
provisions affecting oil and mining companies that use federal 
lands that the White House opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 billion transportation bill is hindered by an internal  
GOP fight over whether surplus federal gas taxes should be used for 
road projects or distributed to the states. And fights persist 
between Congress and the administration over hiring police 
officers, legal aid for the poor and other issues in a $38 billion 
measure financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State.

<HEADLINE> US Expands Intelligence in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRNS, Australia (AP) -- The United States is beefing up its  
intelligence support for the Australian-led peacekeeping contingent 
in East Timor this week but is unlikely to offer significant 
additional troops, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived tonight in this resort  
city off the Great Coral Reef for a series of meetings with 
Australian officials, including Defense Minister John Moore. They 
were to discuss the progress so far in restoring order in East 
Timor and ways in which the United States can increase its support, 
Cohen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials traveling with Cohen told reporters en route to  
Cairns today that the Pentagon sent seven more intelligence 
officials to Darwin, the jumping off point for the peacekeepers in 
East Timor, to assist Australian intelligence. Also, Australia is 
now getting support from the U.S. Joint Intelligence Center in 
Hawaii, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 27 Americans are being dispatched, apparently to Darwin,  
``in support of special intelligence requirements,'' the Pentagon 
said without elaborating. Furthermore, a six-man special 
communications team from Hawaii is heading to the area to provide 
secure communications and unspecified ``specialized intelligence 
capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping effort on the ground in East  
Timor is comprised several thousand forces mainly from Australia 
and Southeast Asian nations. Washington has said it has no plans to 
offer combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the additional contributions Cohen is considering:  
increased use of U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-141 transport aircraft 
for flights into Darwin or Bauccau, which is an air field in East 
Timor east of the capital Dili. Eventually the Pentagon intends to 
send a nine-member airlift control squad to Baccau for aircraft 
loading and unloading operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met in New York  
with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to discuss the 
peacekeeping operation in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They discussed how we continue to need to have close  
coordination with the Australians and with all interested 
parties,'' said a senior administration who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. They agreed ``there was a long way to go'' before 
peace is restored, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said Downer did not say that more troops were  
needed for the Australian-led force. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday there were about 260 Americans in Darwin, including  
a handful in East Timor, Cohen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview aboard his plane headed from Washington on  
Monday, Cohen said Indonesia must swiftly investigate its army's 
involvement in the atrocities committed in East Timor as a first 
step toward regaining normal military ties to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Indonesia's democratic aspirations demand that it  
hold the military responsible for any misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should make an inquiry. They should do it as quickly as  
possible, as thoroughly as possible,'' Cohen said, adding that he 
would not prejudge the outcome. ``It's apparent that there were 
activities that were taking place in East Timor that are simply 
unacceptable,'' he said, and the Indonesian army ``is going to have 
to be accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Commission voted Monday for an  
international inquiry into atrocities in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Cohen will visit Jakarta to meet with Gen. Wiranto,  
the Indonesian defense chief who some foreign diplomats say has 
become the principal power broker in the country. Cohen also will 
meet with President B.J. Habibie and Megawati Sukarnoputri, 
daughter of Indonesia's founding president and widely expected to 
be the next head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States broke off military relations with Indonesia in  
early September in response to the violence in East Timor, which 
was triggered by an Aug. 30 referendum vote in favor of 
independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that before the United States will restore relations,  
the Indonesians must show they have established civilian control of 
the army, some elements of which supported and reportedly 
participated in militia violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian government must ``find out who participated in  
what activities,'' Cohen said. When asked whether he believed that 
those officers found responsible should be purged from the 
military, he replied, ``If individuals engaged in activities that 
are a clear violation of human rights then there should be some 
consequences, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week Cohen intends to discuss East Timor and other  
topics -- including the state of efforts to repair U.S.-Chinese 
relations -- during stops in Thailand, Singapore and the 
Philippines. Thailand is the second-biggest contributor of troops 
to the East Timor operation, behind Australia, and has a 
long-standing military relationship with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Delta, Singapore Sell Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines are  
selling their financial stakes in each other as the two carriers 
formally end a 10-year business relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta disclosed Tuesday it sold its 35.2 million shares of  
Singapore Airlines stock, about 3 percent, and realizing a 
before-tax gain of $140 million. Delta also is repurchasing 5 
million shares of Delta stock held by Singapore. Singapore said it 
will receive the equivalent of a total $309 million from the Delta 
stock sale as well as from the sale of stock in Swissair. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Swissair pulled out of the three-way alliance with  
Delta and Singapore and sold its 8 million shares of Singapore 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta still owns a minority stake in Swissair, which it also  
plans to sell. The company would not say when. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also disclosed that it sold 1.8 million shares of stock in  
Priceline.com last month, realizing before-tax proceeds of about 
$115 million. Priceline.com is an Internet company that lets buyers 
set their own prices for everything from groceries to air travel.

Chinese and English-language content designed for local Hong Kong 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chief Executive Steve Case said his company hoped to expand  
from Hong Kong into mainland China, playing down recent remarks by 
China's information minister, Wu Jichuan, on enforcing a ban on 
foreign investment in Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a matter of time before the markets there open up  
and Internet companies of all sorts are able to provide their 
services,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Case said he would have a better idea of the opportunities for  
investing in China after talking with Wu and other Chinese leaders 
on his next stop in Shanghai where he's also planning to meet Hong 
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that foreign companies are going ahead with  
investments despite Wu's threat, Yahoo! Inc. of the U.S. launched a 
China-based Internet site on Friday with a local partner. 
</P>
<P>
	China has banned foreign ownership of telecommunications and  
Internet companies for several years, but largely ignored the 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule two years ago and is  
largely autonomous, is exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Yip, of China.com, which was recently listed on the Nasdaq  
index in the United States, said the partnership hopes to work with 
the Hong Kong government in its goal to become ``the information 
gateway'' to mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory has been trying to revamp itself as a  
high-technology hub in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com's affiliate China Internet Corp. and StarEastNet.com,  
a Hong Kong-based self-styled ``web of the stars,'' also teamed up 
with AOL for its new venture. Film star Jackie Chan, a director of 
Star East, was set to participate in a live chat on AOL Hong Kong 
later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL owns an 8 percent stake of China.com. Other key shareholders  
are China's state news agency, Xinhua, with a 10.9 percent, and 
Hong Kong-based New World Infrastructure, with 18.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a spotty track record, China.com, with its perfect name  
playing on the hype of both China and the Internet, attracted a 
hoard of investors when it went public in mid-July. The Hong 
Kong-based company was the first Chinese-language Internet company 
to list in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new Hong Kong venture, AOL offers services in 14  
countries in six languages.

<HEADLINE> Dole Praises Female Accomplishments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
Elizabeth Dole praised women's accomplishments Tuesday and plugged 
the American Red Cross' role in helping Hurricane Floyd's victims. 
</P>
<P>
	While president of the relief organization for eight years, Dole  
said she had seen many disasters ``that will haunt me for the rest 
of my life all around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is especially difficult to see the effects of Hurricane  
Floyd right in my own home state,'' the Salisbury native told about 
500 people at a women's business conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief interview after the speech, Dole urged people to make  
donations to the Red Cross to help buy relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been devastating for North Carolina, and it just  
breaks your heart,'' she said. ``My thoughts and prayers are 
certainly with the families. I think that if we can just give to 
that effort, it will make a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casting herself as a woman who battled the male establishment  
before and during the women's liberation movement, Dole said women 
now are a dominant force in the nation's economy, especially as the 
owners of independent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, most men and women lived in a different  
America altogether,'' and women were expected to get married and 
limit business aspirations to teaching or clerical jobs, Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, 63, received a bachelor's degree from Duke University in  
1958, and master's and law degrees from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	``While great progress has been made, there's still much work to  
be done, I'm sure you all agree, before all the barriers are down, 
before the glass ceiling meets the same fate as the Berlin Wall,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released earlier Tuesday, Dole said Scott  
Malyerck, Dan Quayle's top South Carolina organizer, had signed on 
to her campaign. Quayle abandoned his White House bid Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is now a two-person race, and Elizabeth Dole has the  
highest favorability rating. She can beat any Democrat in any 
scenario,'' said Malyerck.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fines 68 People, Cos. for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton was  
among 68 people and companies accused by federal regulators of 
accounting fraud in the first nationwide ``sweep'' against 
inflating earnings and other alleged misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkenton, the former head of a computer software company,  
agreed to settle by paying a $100,000 fine without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC called the series of civil fraud actions its first  
``coordinated assault on financial reporting misdeeds.'' Arthur 
Levitt, chairman of the market watchdog agency, has been pushing 
publicly traded companies to improve their financial reporting and 
avoid manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The new enforcement actions include a total of $630,000 in fines  
which defendants have agreed to pay in settlements with the SEC. 
The agency also is seeking a total of some $9 million in 
restitution and wants to bar 10 of the individuals involved from 
serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the cases involved a ``cookbook of recipes'' for  
fraudulent accounting, including reporting income from shipments 
that never were made, shipping products without customers wanting 
them, creating phony invoices and inflating the value of 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarkenton's case, he and 10 other former executives of his  
computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were 
accused by the SEC of fraudulently inflating by millions of dollars 
the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 
30, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $100,000 fine, the former Minnesota Vikings  
quarterback also agreed in his settlement to pay $54,187 in 
restitution. The money will go to a federal court, and shareholders 
of the company might make claims to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based KnowledgeWare merged with another software company  
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tarkenton is pleased to have this matter resolved,'' his  
attorney, Robert Thornton, said in a statement. ``The events in 
question took place about five or six years ago ... He has long 
since moved on with his life to other business ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the SEC took action against 15 companies whose stock is  
publicly traded, some of whom are in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Current or former chief executive officers of 11 of the 15 
companies are among the individuals named by the SEC in the fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SEC will vigorously protect the bedrock of our securities  
markets: full, fair and accurate financial reporting,'' SEC 
Enforcement Director Richard Walker said in a statement. ``We will 
prosecute the most senior officials of companies that fail to live 
up to that standard, because they are the ones who set the tone and 
create the culture for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also agreeing to settlements were three executives of Pepsi-Cola  
Puerto Rico Bottling Co., based in San Juan: Jose Carlos Villares, 
vice president and general manager, Jose E. Rivera, director of 
finance, and Guillermo Quinones, controller. The bottling franchise 
company had previously agreed to a settlement with the SEC, in May 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Villares, Rivera and Quinones, who neither admitted nor denied  
wrongdoing, agreed to refrain from future violations of securities 
laws. Rivera also agreed to pay a $10,000 fine and to be barred 
from practicing as an accountant for a publicly traded company, 
with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years.

<HEADLINE> Australia Set To Boost Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Drug testing for Australian athletes  
leading up to and during the Sydney Olympics will increase by 25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Sports Drug Agency chief executive Natalie Howson  
said Tuesday the agency will administer more than 6,000 tests 
during the 1999-00 financial year, along with 1,500 tests in the 
weeks before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government-funded program will be the largest ever  
conducted with nearly 50 percent more tests than in the leadup to 
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,'' Howson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing will involve Australian athletes training in the  
country and abroad, as well as foreigners competing in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already negotiated a number of arrangements with  
Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom that will facilitate reciprocal testing,'' Howson 
said. ``That is a good start and there is more to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latest figures from ASDA on testing results indicate Australian  
athletes are doing well. Despite an increase of 12 percent in the 
number of tests to 4,801 for the one-year period that ended in June 
1999, there were only 43 positive tests -- one more than the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests Australian sport is in fairly good condition,  
taking into account it must be appreciated that EPO and human 
growth hormone are non-detectable at this point,'' said ASDA 
spokeswoman Vicky Kapernick.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 56.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today as the  
markets were unable to sustain Monday's timid rally. Technology and 
Internet stocks were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 56.67 at 10,246.72. 
</P>
<P>
	yesterday, the Dow rose 24.06 to 10,303.39, halting a four-day  
retreat as bargain-hunters entered the market. But the blue chip 
index finished well below its highs of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 8.44 at 1,274.87, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
off 23.65 at 2,738.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a research group, today said consumer  
confidence dipped in September for a third consecutive month, 
although forecasters expected a moderate increase. The report may 
indicate consumer spending may be slowing, and thus, reduce the 
need for the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates to cool of the 
economy. The Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee meets next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer confidence report did little to move the  
markets, probably because most analysts expect the Fed to leave 
interest rates alone for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, whose recent weakness was a factor in the market's  
big decline last week, has held steady against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, off 1 1/16 to 77 1/8, and Microsoft, off 7/8 to 90 9/16,  
helped depress technology issues today. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 105.28 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 1.63 at 420.23.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.0 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.85 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.93 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Players Attend Watson Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Pat Watson, the Georgia assistant football  
coach who died of a heart attack Saturday night, was lauded for a 
life of hard work and love of family during an hour-long memorial 
service on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the most unbelievable perfectionist you have ever  
seen,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan told the crowd of 500 packed into 
the Prince Avenue Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave of himself unselfishly for others'' and didn't seek  
recognition for what he did,'' Donnan said. ``He was just 
interested in the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson's 22-year-old son, Cal, also spoke, saying it was the  
hardest thing he ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd tell me to suck it up and do it, and that's what I'm  
going to do,'' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we could have asked for a better scripted  
departure,'' the son said. ``When my father died, he had all his 
ducks in a row. My father went out a winner -- undefeated on the 
field and in the game of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the memorial service were his fellow assistants at  
Georgia and the Bulldogs football team, along with some of his 
former players when he was an assistant at Georgia Tech and 
Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Dooley, brother of Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley,  
had Watson and Donnan on his staff at North Carolina in 1967-68. 
Other former coaches attending were Ray Goff, who preceded Donnan 
at Georgia; and Paul Davis, who coached at Auburn and Mississippi 
State, where Watson was an offensive lineman and linebacker in the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bill Ricketts, pastor of the church, said Watson put a  
lot into his 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a man who knew the value of hard work,'' the minister  
said, as well as a loving family. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was stricken only hours after Georgia's 24-23 victory  
over Central Florida, shortly after having dinner with his family 
at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson will be buried on Thursday in the Pine Hill Cemetery at  
Enterprise, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Meridian, Miss., Watson played two years in the CFL  
before becoming an assistant at such schools as North Carolina, 
Furman, Mississippi State, Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech and Texas 
before joining Donnan's Georgia staff as offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the service, quarterback Quincy Carter said Watson's  
death was ``a reality check on life for all of us. Football is 
important to all of us, but life is first. Right now our focus in 
on coach Watson and his entire family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his weekly news conference before the service, Donnan  
said the team would attend and then have a brief workout later in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to handle adversity that comes,'' Donnan said. ``This  
is just another detour here. It's a tragic one. We've got to 
separate our grief and our sorrow and come back.''

<HEADLINE> Temperament Bars Man From Law Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Paul Converse may not be the nicest guy in  
the world, but does that mean he cannot become a lawyer? 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Denne, Converse's attorney, put that question to the  
Nebraska Supreme Court on Tuesday in an effort to reverse the state 
bar commission's refusal to let Converse take the bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can a person be prevented from taking the bar exam and  
becoming a lawyer in this state for basically being a pain in the 
neck?'' Denne asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Converse, 47, graduated from law school at the University of  
South Dakota in 1998. But his application to take the exam was 
denied because he was consistently ``abusive, disruptive, hostile, 
intemperate, intimidating, irresponsible, threatening or 
turbulent'' while in school, the Nebraska State Bar Commission said 
in a letter to Converse last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said that, among other things, Converse created  
T-shirts with an obscene caricature of the law school's dean, 
threatened to sue over various situations, and put up a photograph 
of a nude woman's backside at his work station. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lessmann, attorney for the bar commission, said Converse  
appears unwilling to change his behavior, which could lead to 
sanctions if he were allowed to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Converse should be encouraged to expend his energies in  
positive directions which could be considered as indicative of 
rehabilitation or reform of his character or fitness, if he is 
allowed by this court to reapply for admission,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denne, however, said keeping Converse from taking the bar exam  
violates his freedom of speech and his due process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no criminal history, no history of fraud or other types  
of dishonesty and no history of violence,'' he said. ``Paul 
Converse is a vigorous advocate for causes he believes in. He has 
an absolute right to champion those causes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high court did not say when it would rule.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Questions Court Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cardinal Bernard Law has raised objections to two  
of Gov. Paul Cellucci's nominees for the state's highest court, 
saying the two women are open to charges of anti-Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	Law told the governor in a letter last week that past actions by  
Supreme Judicial Court Justice Margaret Marshall and Superior Court 
Judge Judith Cowin showed ``an attitude and mentality, which I find 
troubling.'' He cited examples involving a gay rights case and a 
prominent opponent of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fear that in both these nominees there has been evidenced a  
certain mindset which at times is open to the serious charge of 
anti-Catholicism,'' Law wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall has been nominated for promotion from associate justice  
to chief justice on the Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest 
court. Cowin has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall's nomination will be taken up by the Governor's Council  
on Wednesday and Cowin's in the next few weeks. The eight-member 
council, an elected body, has the power to confirm or deny 
gubernatorial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci today said that Law's concerns were serious ones and he  
would have his legal counsel look into them again. He said the 
nominations had previously been reviewed, particularly that of 
Marshall's, and the charges were found to be baseless. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a biased bone in her body,'' he said of Marshall.  
</P>
<P>
	In Cowin's case, Law cited a complaint referred to a council  
member from a lawyer who said she displayed anti-Catholic bias in a 
1997 case involving church-run Carney Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury had had found that the hospital fired a worker because  
administrators thought he was gay, and awarded him $1.2 million. 
The complaint said Cowin increased the amount of the award, citing 
problems ``inherent in suing a respected Boston charitable 
institution ... (and) the strength of the Catholic Church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law's concern about Marshall stems from a letter she wrote while  
general counsel at Harvard University to Mary Ann Glendon, a 
Harvard law professor and leading Catholic intellectual who is an 
antiabortion advocate. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe said the two women and Law were all unavailable  
for comment or did not return calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Dealers See Threat in New GM Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Car buyers looking for a deal on a General Motors  
Corp. car or truck may soon be able to shop at a company-run 
dealership -- an idea that might not sit well with 7,700 dealers 
already selling GM vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Tuesday it has set up an independent subsidiary to own  
and operate dealerships across the country. General Motors Retail 
Holdings will buy or partner with dealerships in the largest 130 
markets across the country, and could own from 5 percent to 10 
percent of GM's dealerships in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A GM executive said the new arrangement was the best way for GM  
to get closer to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical to GM's future competitiveness that we improve  
our market performance where we lag, enhance our revenues, 
understand our customers better and look for ways to reduce 
distribution costs and improve the customer's buying experience,'' 
said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president of GM North American 
Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association  
said the move was ``a huge threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its terrible,'' said James Willingham, who owns two GM  
dealerships in California. ``This announcement was made without any 
consultation of dealers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GMRH is the latest in a series of moves by GM and Ford Motor Co.  
aimed at improving how their vehicles are sold. In recent years the 
automakers have bought out some dealers and consolidated others, 
hoping to trim the number of dealerships and increase sales at 
those remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as more and more dealers have sold out to  
publicly-owned companies such as Republic Industries Inc. and 
United Auto Group. Those groups hope economies of scale will allow 
them to offer better selection, lower prices and better service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has made its own stab at such an arrangement. In five  
cities so far, Ford has consolidated as many as 14 stores into 
three or four big outlets. Ford owns a major stake in what it calls 
the Ford Retail Network, but a dealer or group of dealers manage 
the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been disappointing, said Art Spinella, an  
analyst with CNW Marketing Research, because automakers don't know 
how to sell cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GMRH ``is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Spinella said. ``There  
has never been an auto dealership owned by the factory that has 
ever made a dime. ... GM needs to concentrate on one thing and one 
thing only: manufacturing good product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move may add to dealer anger at GM that has been simmering  
for months. GM reorganized its sales division last year, cutting 
field personnel and asserting more control over a $500 million fund 
used for dealer advertising. Some dealers sued, saying GM was 
taking money from them and using it in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In a NADA survey of dealer satisfaction earlier this year, all  
of GM's divisions except Saturn ranked at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	GM emphasized that GMRH would be treated the same as any dealer  
and not get special favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that promise, Willingham said there were any number of  
ways a GMRH dealership could get a little boost, from getting more 
hot-selling models to better finance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Willingham said if necessary, dealers would go to state  
legislatures and ask for stronger laws against factory-owned 
stores. Some states already have such laws in place.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The first pneumonia vaccine designed for  
infants appears to sharply reduce severe childhood cases and could 
save thousands of lives worldwide, according to researchers who 
heralded a ``triumph for kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, which will be considered soon for approval in the  
United States, is intended to protect youngsters from a variety of 
illnesses caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were released Tuesday from a major study of the  
vaccine's effect on childhood pneumonia. The vaccine has already 
been shown to lower the risk of earaches, meningitis and blood 
poisoning resulting from the germ. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a triumph for kids,'' said Dr. Steven Black, who  
presented the data at an infectious-disease meeting sponsored by 
the American Society for Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the world, pneumonia caused by pneumococcus results in an  
estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Black estimated that the vaccine 
could prevent 450,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the bacteria is rarely fatal. However, it  
does account for 100 to 150 deaths each year. 
</P>
<P>
	An adult vaccine for the germ has long been available, but it  
does not work in youngsters. The new vaccine was developed by 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which paid for the testing. An advisory 
committee of the Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to meet 
Nov. 4 to consider whether to recommend its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and colleagues from the Kaiser Permanente health plan  
tested the vaccine on 37,830 children in California. Half of them 
got the shots at two, four and six months, and again between 12 and 
15 months. The rest got a different experimental vaccine that has 
no effect on pneumococcus. 
</P>
<P>
	During three years of follow-up, 1,309 of the children were  
diagnosed with pneumonia. The vaccinated youngsters were one-third 
less likely to get moderately severe pneumonia that was bad enough 
to show up on X-rays, and they were 75 percent less likely to get 
severe cases, which occurred in 33 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier data released from the study showed that vaccinated  
youngsters were 89 percent less likely to get bacterial blood 
poisoning or meningitis. And they were about 20 percent less likely 
to have inner ear infections bad enough to require insertion of 
drain tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a remarkable vaccine that will have a dramatic effect,''  
said Dr. Henry Shinefield, another of the Kaiser researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 types of the bacteria cause illness. The new vaccine is  
designed to guard against seven varieties that are most common in 
children. These are also types of the bug that are frequently 
resistant to common antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Cynthia Whitney of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention noted that about one-quarter of victims of severe 
pneumococcus infections in the United States have bacteria that are 
resistant to penicillin, and nearly 15 percent are impervious to at 
least three drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the new vaccine makes youngsters less likely to  
carry and spread the bacteria. This could reduce the spread of the 
bacteria even to adults who are not vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that for severe pneumococcal disease,  
this vaccine is excellent,'' said Dr. Edward Janoff of the 
University of Minnesota. ``It would be hard to get one better. For 
less serious disease, such as ear infections, it is less 
effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another study on 1,662 children, conducted by Dr. Juhani Eskola  
and others from the National Public Health Institute in Finland, 
looked at the risk of earaches caused by the varieties of 
pneumococcus bacteria specifically covered by the vaccine. The 
shots reduced the number of these episodes by 57 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Offers $65B Health Care Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drawing lessons from his father's experience  
with a painful spinal disorder, Democratic presidential candidate 
Bill Bradley offered a $65 billion plan today for universal access 
to health insurance that would require coverage for all children, 
with subsidies for families that cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every American deserves what my father got -- the helping hands  
to a productive life,'' Bradley said, outlining the proposal in Los 
Angeles. Under Bradley's plan, individuals of all ages and incomes 
also would be able to exclude from their taxable income whatever 
they pay for health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to America's health, this is not the time to be  
timid,'' said the former U.S. senator from New Jersey. ``It 
requires bold action and a national commitment from the president 
on down to make certain that every American has what should be a 
basic birthright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daring in his contest with Vice President Al Gore to take on an  
issue doomed since the Clinton-Gore administration's first term, 
Bradley would require parents to obtain health insurance for their 
children -- much like drivers are required to buy auto insurance -- 
and would offer full or partial premium subsidies to low-income 
families. Poor adults also would be eligible for subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	All adults would get the option of buying into the same health  
plan provided to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech at the Los Angeles Valley College, Bradley  
recalled how neighbors in his tiny Missouri home town pitched in to 
help his late father with daily routines made excruciating by 
calcified arthritis in his lower spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out his ``life-stage'' approach to health reform,  
Bradley's plan separately would expand Medicare to provide senior 
citizens with an uncapped prescription drug benefit for 
catastrophic and chronic illnesses. Medicare also would provide a 
new system of integrated medical and social services -- such as 
housekeeping and transportation -- that would cut down on 
nursing-home admissions, Bradley maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can commit ourselves to the proposition that, when it comes  
to health care, everyone will have the American dream,'' Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the plan's estimated annual cost of between $55  
billion and $65 billion would be paid for out of the projected 
federal budget surplus, leaving the Social Security trust fund's 
surplus protected and reserved for the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley took a veiled swipe at Gore, his only rival for the  
Democratic nomination, who has not yet provided cost estimates for 
any of his major policy proposals, including a narrower plan for 
health coverage of all children by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides have promised that such costs -- and how to pay them --  
will later be revealed in the context of a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley said today: ``I believe it is irresponsible to  
commit to new programs without also laying the costs before the 
public so that we can decide together how to pay for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore policy adviser Elaine Kamarck alternately blasted Bradley's  
plan as ``wildly unrealistic'' and ``wildly expensive.'' She 
singled out the proposal for tax deduction for premium costs: 
``You're talking about giving Donald Trump tax deductions for his 
insurance premiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamarck also said Bradley's plan does nothing to fortify the  
solvency of Medicare. ``No place in there does he have Medicare 
protection. You need to lay aside a big chunk of money at the 
get-go for Medicare,'' Kamarck said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his long-promised health plan, Bradley was fleshing out  
what he's called his ``big ideas'' policy agenda at a time when 
polls suggest a tightening race against Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as if to guard against association with first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton's unpopular and bureaucratic plan in 1993 for 
universal health care, Bradley emphasized that his proposal would 
not change the private health insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those who are now insured and satisfied with their plans,  
nothing will change,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley noted that an estimated 45 million Americans are  
uninsured -- 34 million of them adults without access to affordable 
health coverage -- and suggested the administration was at fault for 
being too easily scared away from the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that making health care available to all will not be  
easy. But the difficulty is a challenge not a reason to avoid 
engagement,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew important political praise from the 1.3 million-member  
Service Employees International Union, the nation's largest union 
of health care workers. SEIU president Andrew Stern, whose 
endorsement Bradley is courting, called the plan a ``serious 
proposal'' and one that is ``particularly welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in addition to expanding eligibility for the Children's  
Health Insurance Program for low-income families, has proposed 
giving senior citizens and self-employed people a 25 percent 
refundable tax credit for health insurance premiums if they do not 
have employer-based coverage.

<HEADLINE> Dole Takes Pass on Buchanan Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole  
sidestepped a pointed question Tuesday on Pat Buchanan's views on 
World War II. But neither does he plan to buy Buchanan's book, he 
told a Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, was testifying  
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Balkans policy. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dole said he believed Kosovo should be independent of  
Yugoslavia, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., asked whether he also 
believed Montenegro should seek self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should that be our policy?'' Smith asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that would be my policy,'' Dole said. ``I don't know  
whether it would be 'our' policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak -- I don't belong to any organized group anymore.  
I'm a Republican,'' Dole said, paraphrasing humorist Will Rogers' 
famed comment about the Democratic party. ``And I'm not in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Republican, do you share my view that it was OK to stand  
up to Adolph Hitler?'' Smith asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a clear reference to the controversy surrounding  
Buchanan's views on America's entry into World War II, spelled out 
in his book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole chuckled at the question.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, yes,'' he said. ``I thought World War II was a fairly  
noble cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dole, a World War II Army veteran who was severely wounded  
in Italy, added: ``You know, I haven't read anyone's book so I 
can't really comment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interrupted Smith: ``I haven't read it either. But I don't like  
what I've heard, read, of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I don't want to buy it,'' Dole said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Museum Debates Pulling Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Brooklyn Museum of Art official proposed  
removing a portrait of the Virgin Mary that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
deemed offensive, but then backed away from the offer after other 
museum officials balked, the mayor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the portrait ``was being discussed. Apparently members  
of the board got real upset about that,'' Giuliani said at a 
morning news conference announcing that a purported deal had fallen 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle over the painting ``The Holy Virgin Mary'' by Chris  
Ofili has been raging for several days and even drew in first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani has threatened to pull $7 million 
in city funds from the Brooklyn Museum, where the painting is 
scheduled to be exhibited starting Saturday as part of a show on 
young British artists. 
</P>
<P>
	It depicts Mary with dark skin, African features and flowing  
robes and includes a shellacked clump of elephant dung, suggesting 
a breast, and dozens of pictures of female private parts apparently 
cut out of pornographic images. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporation Counsel Michael Hess, the city's top lawyer, met  
with Robert Rubin, chairman of the museum's board of directors, on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said Rubin offered a package of proposals. They included  
removing the painting, having the museum forgo 20 percent of its 
city funding while the exhibit is open; and segregating half-dozen 
other objectionable works from the rest of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one person thought this could be done and then when  
the arts professionals got involved in it they got very offended by 
the whole thing,'' the mayor said today, referring to Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told The New York Times he was not offering the three  
steps as a package, but had mentioned them as separate 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever I discussed is now off the table,'' Rubin said.  
Museum director Arnold Lehman said he remained opposed to removing 
any work from the exhibit. Any agreement would have to be approved 
by the museum board. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of possible resolutions were looked at, but there was  
and is no agreement of any kind,'' a museum statement said. ``The 
museum is planning to open 'Sensation' on Saturday as scheduled and 
as planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation'' has also become the latest issue in the duel  
between Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton, both all-but-declared candidates 
for the Senate from New York. Mrs. Clinton said Monday that she the 
museum shouldn't lose its city funds -- money that makes up a third 
of its budget. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, she said, she shares ``the feeling that I know  
many New Yorkers have that there are parts of this exhibit that 
would be deeply offensive. I would not go to see this exhibit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who is Roman Catholic, accused the first lady of  
supporting the use of public money to attack Catholicism. But 
critics say Giuliani's attacks threaten artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili is noted for using elephant dung in his works and has been  
dubbed the Elephant Man by some London art critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel as though I have to defend it,'' Ofili, 31, said  
of the painting in a Times interview. ``The people who are 
attacking this painting are attacking their own interpretation, not 
mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili, born in England to Nigerian parents, said he is a  
churchgoing Catholic and former altar boy. He said the elephant 
dung is a cultural reference to his African heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor said he was saddened by what appears to  
be an attack on the Virgin Mary. And Gov. George Pataki said he was 
grateful that no state money was involved in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Other works in the exhibit include a series of mannequins with  
sex organs in place of noses and mouths; two halves of a pig, 
sliced from snout to hoof, suspended in two formaldehyde tanks.

<HEADLINE> Classified Marketplace Urged on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A joint classified advertising service on the  
Internet should be the next venture for newspapers, says the 
chairman of the Newspaper Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am issuing a call to all newspaper owners and publishers.  
Let us put our classified advertising online and build a national 
classified marketplace,'' William S. Morris III said Tuesday in a 
speech at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classified is where we are most vulnerable to new competitors,  
and conversely, where major opportunity awaits us,'' said Morris, 
chairman of Morris Communications Group, which publishes 31 daily 
newspapers, 11 nondailies, 17 shoppers and 13 magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us offer the New Jersey computer user the opportunity to  
view homes for sale in Colorado,'' he said. ``Let us enable the 
unemployed auto worker in Flint, Mich., to scan employment 
opportunities in the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine the commercial marketplace we will create by combining  
the new technology with our traditional classified pages,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newspaper Association of America represents more than 2,000  
newspapers in the United States and Canada, most of which are daily 
newspapers and account for 87 percent of U.S. daily circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' recommendation comes as more and more newspapers are  
taking advantage of online technology. Thousands of papers now have 
online editions; some even have separate staffs to produce online 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, more than 750 newspapers publish classified ads on  
their individual Web sites, Morris said. Some individual newspapers 
have formed limited alliances to compete nationally. And the NAA 
has already trademarked a classified symbol to help viewers and 
readers quickly recognize classified advertisements that originate 
with a daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are ready for a national classified advertising  
service, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about it. We have the ads. We are the portals. We have  
the public trust and brand recognition. We have the technology and 
the technical standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that while he was urging newspaper executives to  
join the effort, ``there is no way I can enforce anything on the 
Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very much a work in progress,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite advances on the Internet, Morris says he doesn't  
envision newspapers becoming extinct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see nothing in the new technology -- nothing coming out of  
Silicon Valley that eliminates the need for newspapers and 
certainly for trained, responsible, ethical and aggressive 
journalists,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> The Lighter Side of Business /  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNG SPENDERS: People aged 12 to 22 believe in saving for the  
future, but relatively few are actually doing it, according to a 
survey conducted for Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. The 
survey of 1,176 students nationwide found 91 percent believe young 
people should save. But 56 percent said they consider themselves to 
be spenders rather than savers. One reason why many may not worry 
about putting money aside is they're optimistic about being 
prosperous as adults -- half said they expect to be wealthier than 
their parents, but only 15 percent said they expect to have to work 
harder than their parents. 

</P>
<P>
	PULLING UP STAKES: With jobs more plentiful these days, many  
out-of-work executives are more willing to take a chance and move 
to another city for a new job, reports Challenger, Gray &AMP; 
Christmas, an employment consulting firm. Challenger Gray found in 
a survey that nearly a third, or 31 percent, of discharged 
executives who had earned $100,000 in their former jobs moved for 
the next position they found. That's a change from the past, when 
many executives were worried about leaving a community or area 
where they had established business contacts, the company said. The 
availability of jobs for their spouses has also made many 
executives willing to take on the risks of relocating. 

</P>
<P>
	IT LOOKS SO EASY: That's what a lot of people think when they  
see the proliferation of Web sites where people sell goods and 
services. But according to Inc. magazine, there are a lot of 
potential legal problems that would-be Internet entrepreneurs need 
to be aware of. For example, the magazine reports in its October 
issue, one Internet company ran into trouble with competitors after 
inserting their names into coding that helps the company's site to 
be picked up by online search engines. Linking one company's site 
to another's can cause problems if there's no agreement between the 
two sides over how it's done. And many sites have found themselves 
vulnerable to copyright infringement because the material on their 
Web pages hasn't been registered with the government. Inc. suggests 
Web site operators be sure they're complying with federal and state 
laws before getting started.

<HEADLINE>  Lawyers Lay Out Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet is not to blame for torture  
and disappearances that occurred under his regime, his lawyers are 
contending in their bid to prevent his extradition to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hand is not on these deeds,'' Pinochet's lead attorney,  
Clive Nicholls, said during the opening day of the long-delayed 
extradition hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholls is to present his full arguments today.  
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old general, under arrest in Britain since last  
October, is accused by Spanish judge Baltsar Garzon of heading a 
regime that used torture to silence and intimidate opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean government has acknowledged that 3,197 people died  
in the years after Pinochet ousted elected Marxist President 
Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup. The campaign of terror allegedly 
continued until Pinochet relinquished power in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon -- who initially had been investigating the alleged deaths  
of Spanish citizens under Pinochet's regime -- wants to extradite 
the former dictator to Spain to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet faces charges including 34 counts of specific incidents  
of torture against Chileans dating from December 1988 to December 
1989, and one count of ongoing conspiracy to commit torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Alun Jones, a British lawyer who is representing Spain, said the  
conspiracy count encompasses not only the 1,198 people who 
allegedly disappeared during Pinochet's rule but also their 
families who continue to suffer from their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	He read a letter in court from a 73-year-old Chilean woman whose  
five family members disappeared in April 1976. It read: ``For 23 
years I've suffered the torture of not knowing what happened to 
them ... we desperately need to find our families -- even if just 
their remains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones outlined the 34 torture allegations, saying many of the  
victims were subjected to beatings and electrical shocks and 
deprived of food and sleep. And he argued that the disappearances 
have caused ongoing mental torture for surviving relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lawyers for Spain spent considerable time Monday  
outlining the allegations against Pinochet, they are not required 
to submit evidence. An extradition hearing is primarily a legal 
formality, where extradition law and issues of jurisdiction take 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholls, Pinochet's lawyer, said that constrained the general's  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, Sen. Pinochet is before you today with his hands  
tied behind his back,'' said Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Pinochet has already proved to be a legal  
minefield. Aspects of it have been considered again and again by 
Britain's highest courts. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the House of Lords threw out all but the charges of  
torture and conspiracy to torture after Dec. 1988 -- when Britain 
adopted an international law making torture a crime that can be 
prosecuted anywhere. In throwing out the pre-1988 charges, the 
House of Lords dismissed all the allegations involving Spanish 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholls said he would attempt to show today that Spain has no  
jurisdiction because no Spanish citizens are now involved, that 
there is no evidence linking Pinochet to the alleged crimes and 
that the charges are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	If Deputy Chief Magistrate Ronald Bartle rules against Pinochet,  
the general's lawyers can appeal. And after all legal options are 
exhausted, the case would return to Home Secretary Jack Straw for a 
final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who is not attending the hearing, remains defiant.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read to the court in April, Pinochet declared,  
``I do not agree with this ... I have nothing to do with any of 
these charges .... I am being humiliated. I am a general with 64 
years service and I am a gentleman who knows about honor.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Rookie Zereoue Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers rookie Amos Zereoue was  
charged with drunken driving early Tuesday and released into the 
custody of teammate Pete Gonzalez, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brentwood police chief George Swinney said Zereoue was stopped  
at about 2 a.m. after an officer saw his GMC Yukon fail to stop at 
a stop sign in Brentwood, a suburb a few miles southeast of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	As patrolman William Meisel spoke with Zereoue, he smelled  
alcohol on the player's breath and asked him to perform a field 
sobriety test. The running back failed, Swinney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue, a running back, was taken to Jefferson Hospital for a  
blood test and charged with drunken driving, pending the results of 
the blood analysis. Test results from the Allegheny County Crime 
lab are expected in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue, a third-round draft pick from West Virginia, was  
released on his own recognizance into the custody of Gonzalez, a 
third-string quarterback.

which raised concerns that Gammage had been targeted because of his

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Bids for NHL, NBA Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Las Vegas wants in on the action.  
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Oscar Goodman spent Tuesday visiting NBA commissioner  
David Stern and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, hoping the leagues 
will consider his city for franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bet on it.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodman has a fundamental problem: Neither the NHL or NBA is  
considering any expansion and both Bettman and Stern said their 
leagues had no teams seeking to switch cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the matter of gambling, a particularly thorny issue  
with the NBA. Basketball betting accounts for 23 percent of the 
total sports handle in Las Vegas, according to Vegas Sports 
Consultants, which helps set betting lines for sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, the NBA has opposed betting on its games and, in  
fact, forced Canada's provincial lotteries to drop NBA games before 
it granted expansion franchises to Vancouver and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had a discussion of this issue in five years,''  
Stern said. ``I don't know any reasons why the NBA owners have 
changed their policy or haven't changed it. My guess is it might 
not have changed. I am comfortable with the NBA's historic 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey betting is less of an issue, accounting for just 3  
percent of the Vegas betting handle. Bettman indicated the NHL 
might accept the same ground rules that are applied to UNLV. Vegas 
books do not accept bets on the local college football and 
basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gambling issue, the mayor was enthusiastic about the  
couple of hours he spent chatting with the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trip was 100 percent successful,'' Goodman said. ``I wish  
we had the go-ahead. We don't. We took a giant step today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the only pro team in the city is the Las Vegas Stars  
of the PCL, an affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The Las Vegas 
Thunder played in the International Hockey League for six years but 
lost its arena lease and has been unable to find an alternate site. 
John Moores, owner of the Padres, is the proposed owner of any NBA 
or NHL franchise in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	What Goodman said he accomplished was establishing a dialogue  
with the league and that the two sides would stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman called the meeting cordial and pleasant. ``We talked of  
how we went through our last expansion and how we looked at new 
markets,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Vegas' gambling industry a problem for the NHL?  
</P>
<P>
	``To characterize anything as an issue would be premature,''  
Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was not the case at the NBA, where Stern made it clear that  
gambling is definitely an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a gaming issue,'' Stern said. ``Gambling is part of  
the American fabric. Every state has gambling of some sort. The NBA 
issue is betting on NBA games. Our historic position is there for 
all to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman got the message.  
</P>
<P>
	``He indicated gambling can't take place at all,'' the mayor  
said. ``The precedent was set in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means for Las Vegas to get a team, either the city  
prohibits betting on basketball or the league changes its policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the hunt,'' Goodman said. ``But we have to overcome  
these issues.''

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Sign Up for Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Volunteers began signing up today for the first  
human trials of endostatin, an experimental drug that has been 
shown to shrink tumors in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care was seeking 15 to 30 Boston  
volunteers over age 17 with solid tumors that have not benefitted 
from other treatment. Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma or 
primary brain tumors are not eligible for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone number for applicants was printed in local  
newspapers today and the response this morning was heavy, with four 
nurses answering calls, said Steve Singer, spokesman for the 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care is a 
collaboration of the institute and several local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and a sister protein, angiostatin, work by destroying  
a tumor's ability to sprout new blood vessels. In research done in 
the lab or Dr. Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital, cancer went 
dormant or disappeared altogether in test animals treated with the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no certainty the same thing will happen in people.  
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the trial will check for adverse side  
effects, though researchers will also look for signs that the drug 
is halting progress of tumors. If the drug is found to be safe, a 
second phase will evaluate the drug's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to stress that this is a Phase I clinical  
trial that seeks to determine dose levels for endostatin 
treatment,'' said Dr. Donald Kufe, principle investigator of the 
study. ``It may take up to a year before we complete the study, and 
even then, only future studies can determine the effectiveness of 
the drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other sites also will enroll patients for the study in the  
near future: the University of Texas M.D. Cancer Center in Houston 
and the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 100 people are expected to receive the drug at the  
three locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial tests are being sponsored by EntreMed Inc., a  
Maryland-based biotech company that licensed the right to develop 
endostatin from Boston's Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and angiostatin have been the subject of a roller  
coaster of speculation ever since an enthusiastic front-page story 
on Folkman in The New York Times last year. Doubts cropped up last 
fall when it was reported that scientists from the National Cancer 
Institute had not been able to reproduce Folkman's results. Then in 
February, an NCI team said it had at last duplicated Folkman's work 
by having the NCI scientists conduct the experiments at Folkman's 
laboratory in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Kills Two in Kosovo Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Attackers fired two rifle-propelled  
grenades into a suburban market packed with shoppers today, killing 
two Serbs and injuring 39 other people, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred in the outdoor market in Kosovo Polje, just  
west of the provincial capital of Pristina, said Emma Salle, 
spokeswoman of Britain's Irish Guards. Several people were detained 
for questioning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the injured were said to have been gravely wounded. It  
was not know who fired the grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials also announced today that NATO  
peacekeepers have arrested nine Serbs in the past three days on 
suspicion of murder, cracking down on paramilitaries accused of 
committing atrocities against ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the Serbs were taken into custody after French  
investigators exhumed 28 bodies from a burial site just west of 
Kosovska Mitrovica, NATO said. The others were arrested by German 
and Dutch troops near the southern town of Orahovac, according to 
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, French police said the bodies of more than  
20 ethnic Albanians who disappeared during the NATO bombing 
campaign against Yugoslavia have been exhumed from the mass burial 
site in Vidomiric. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven bodies have been identified; they were among 23 ethnic  
Albanian men rounded up during a paramilitary raid in Kosovska 
Mitrovica on April 14, three weeks after the start of the 78-day 
NATO bombing campaign, the French statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Netherlands, war crimes tribunal spokesman Paul Risley  
said investigators from the U.N. court provided some of the 
evidence leading to the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb militia members are suspected of killing thousands of  
people during an 18-month crackdown that ended in June when 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a U.N.-backed peace 
plan for Kosovo and 45,000 peacekeepers to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ethnic Albanians whose relatives disappeared in the  
April raid gathered Monday at the library in Kosovska Mitrovica, 
where the local prosecutor announced the deaths had been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The French believe the victims were separated from their  
families on April 14 by Serb forces, the daily newspaper Kosova Sot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments, the U.S. diplomatic office in Pristina  
also warned Americans today to be on alert to ``a potential 
terrorist threat'' against U.S. citizens, but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said 100 Serbs staged a demonstration Monday in Ugljare,  
just west of Pristina, to protest the shooting of a Serb. An ethnic 
Albanian man who drove into the crowd was dragged from his car and 
severely beaten, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, a Serb official claimed more than 300 non-Albanians  
have been killed, about 500 kidnapped and some 250,000 have fled 
Kosovo since the arrival of the international peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, Veljko Odalovic, accused the NATO-led peacekeeping  
force of siding with ethnic Albanian rebels and allowing ``Albanian 
gangs'' to roam the province.

<HEADLINE> Young, 49ers Deal With Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young will miss at least a week  
and possibly more because of his latest concussion, though tests 
showed no signs of more serious brain trauma, the agent for the San 
Francisco 49ers quarterback said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Young took a frightening hit midway through Monday night's game  
at Arizona and left with his fourth concussion since 1996. He 
underwent an MRI on Tuesday and then met with Dr. Gary Steinberg, 
the chief neurologist at Stanford Hospital who treated Young when 
he suffered his last concussion two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The MRI did not show any of the so-called white spots, which  
are thought to be indicative of progressive brain trauma,'' said 
agent Leigh Steinberg, who is not related to the neurologist. ``So, 
that was clear. But the doctor did recommend he sit out at least a 
week and possibly two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci later confirmed that Young would be  
sidelined for a minimum of one week, leaving backup Jeff Garcia in 
position to make his first NFL start against Tennessee on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely something I kind of anticipated,'' Garcia  
said. ``It's something I'm prepared to face. I'm not trying to 
replace Steve Young. I'm just trying to help this team get a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Young's MRI and neurological exam came back normal  
but that Dr. Steinberg recommended holding him out of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will participate in practice but will not play against  
Tennessee,'' Mariucci said. ``We will re-evaluate Steve's status 
next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said he spoke to Young and that the quarterback  
intends to return to play this season as soon as possible. He said 
Young has no intention of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve is not in denial in terms of this concussion issue. He  
will follow the medical advice,'' Steinberg said. ``He obviously 
has tremendous opportunities for life after football and he's not 
going to endanger that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he happens to love the game and he wants to play. Right  
now, his focus is on still making this a winning season. Frankly, 
he wanted to play this week but I guarantee you he won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young lost consciousness for several seconds after the  
head-snapping hit in Monday night's 24-10 win at Arizona. He walked 
off the field under his own power with just seconds remaining in 
the second quarter and didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to dodge pressure, Young instead caught the full force of  
a hit from blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams. The violent blow 
knocked Young backward, and as he fell, his head hit offensive 
tackle Dave Fiore's leg before smashing against the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless on the field with his eyes shut, and tackle  
Derrick Deese tugged at his jersey to try to help him up. When 
there was no immediate response, Deese waved to the sideline for 
help and team trainers and doctors ran onto the field, along with 
Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Young came to after a few moments and walked off. At one point,  
he even tried to talk Mariucci into letting him re-enter the game, 
but Mariucci ruled it out. Young then donned a baseball cap and 
watched from the sideline as Garcia finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion punctuated what has been a trying season thus far  
for the 37-year-old Young. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection has been spotty and he has been battered by the  
opposition weekly. In last week's 28-21 victory over New Orleans, 
Young was hit 21 times, including five sacks, in what was one of 
the most sustained poundings he's endured in a 15-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The protection appeared slightly improved Monday night until the  
fateful breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-game interview, Young appeared lucid and told  
reporters he does take the issue of repeated concussions seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am much more sober about it than anyone,'' Young said.  
``I'll deal with it as realistically as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion is at least the fourth Young has had since 1996.  
The previous three occurred over a 10-month span, two during the 
1996 season and another in the 1997 opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The three previous concussions in relatively quick succession  
raised fears about the possible impact on Young's long-term health 
if he continued playing. Some of his friends and relatives at the 
time urged him to consider retiring, and there was concern that one 
more serious hit could force him out of football. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was cleared to play and he's missed only two games  
due to injury over the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Slightly Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged slightly higher against the yen  
Tuesday, continuing its rise from the day before on hopes that 
Japanese financial authorities may take steps to curb the yen's 
recent ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank disappointed markets last week by refusing  
to yield to pressure from its own government to inject money into 
the banking system as a way of easing interest rates and weakening 
the yen's strength against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But hopes for some kind of action to rein in the yen were  
renewed after a weekend meeting in Washington, where senior 
financial officials from the Group of Seven countries said they 
shared Japan's concern over the yen's rapid rise against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	An overly strong yen could harm Japanese exporters by crimping  
the profits they earn from overseas sales. That in turn could 
threaten a nascent economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.10  
Japanese yen, up from 106.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the euro as traders hoped that some  
emerging signs of strength in the European economy could lead the 
European Central Bank to push interest rates higher. The euro was 
quoted at $1.0554, up from $1.0468 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5175 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5303, and 1.4613 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4703. The British 
pound rose to $1.6502 from $1.6472. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8534 German 
marks, down from 1.8680; 6.2159 French francs, down from 6.2651; 
and 1,834.63 Italian lire, down from 1,849.35.

<HEADLINE> 'SNL' Special Draws Big Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC was more than ready for prime time.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 22.4 million people watched the network's 25th  
anniversary show Sunday night for ``Saturday Night Live,'' the 
highest-rated entertainment special since the Academy Awards in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour, prime-time show also had the best numbers for  
any NBC special since 1993 among the 18-to-49-year-old audience 
demographic the network craves, Nielsen Media Research said Monday. 
Not bad for a show whose original repertory cast was dubbed the Not 
Ready for Prime Time Players. 
</P>
<P>
	The show opened with Bill Murray, in his lounge singer guise,  
belting out Bruce Springsteen's ``Badlands,'' among other songs. 
Billy Crystal later resurrected his Fernando talk-show character 
with the famous line, ``You look mahvelous,'' while comedian Chris 
Rock poked fun at all the bad movies former cast members have made. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also paid tribute to ``SNL'' cast members who have  
died: Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman, Chris Farley and John Belushi. 
</P>
<P>
	After the show, the star-studded cast and guests took elevators  
to the Rainbow Room, where a makeshift Blues Brothers band with Dan 
Aykroyd, John Goodman and Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Steven Tyler 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a couple of well-known no-shows. Eddie Murphy and  
Dana Carvey both didn't attend, and an NBC spokesman didn't have an 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was a big night for network television in general. With  
season premieres of ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``The Practice'' and 
the new escapist drama, ``Snoops,'' more people watched TV Sunday 
than on any night since May 23, said Alan Wurtzel, NBC's chief 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Network executives are heartened by ratings during the  
one-week-old TV season, particularly for one-hour dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have programming, audiences show up,'' Wurtzel said.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Sign 7-foot-3 Radojevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Alek Radojevic, the 12th pick in the NBA draft,  
signed a three-year deal with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone through a lot, so this is one of the happiest days  
of my life,'' Radojevic said after a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Radojevic fled war-torn Yugoslavia for the  
United States two years ago. After playing at Barton County 
Community College in Kansas, where he averaged 13 points and 7.6 
rebounds, the 7-foot-3 Radojevic signed a letter of intent to play 
for Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because he played a total of 19 minutes for a  
professional basketball team in Yugoslavia, the NCAA ruled he was 
ineligible to play. He then entered the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I would be drafted, or who would draft me,  
and then the club in Yugoslavia didn't want to release me,'' 
Radojevic said in describing his uncertain offseason.

<P>
	Last month an arbitrator ruled he was free to join the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	But the dispute slowed his progress. The raw center wasn't able  
to work out for the Raptors, or play for their summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real mystery,'' Toronto general manager Glen Grunwald  
said. ``He has a lot of talent, but he hasn't played against 
top-notch competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic, whose deal averages out to about $1 million a season,  
knows the transition to the NBA is going to be tough, but he said 
he's in the best shape of his life. He's been working with a 
personal trainer for the last two months and has added 15 pounds, 
up to 260.

<HEADLINE> Coke Produces Some Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co., which has already turned over more  
than 37,000 documents pertaining to a racial discrimination 
lawsuit, is insisting that another 93 documents should remain 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	Four current and former Coke employees are suing the company in  
federal court, alleging they were denied raises and promotions 
because they are black. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action 
status, which would cover almost all of the company's 1,500 other 
black salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives said they would be willing to make 1  
million additional documents available if plaintiff attorneys wish 
to look them over. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coke reserves its right to keep 93 more documents private,  
the company said Monday. The documents involve communications 
between the company and its lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A motion from the plaintiffs filed last month said the documents  
``likely contain evidence that senior company officials had 
knowledge of and failed to prevent ... barriers to equal employment 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Story has yet to rule on their  
admissibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``An uninformed reader might conclude ... that Coca-Cola has  
been unreasonably stingy ... jealously guarding even the most 
fundamentally discoverable documents,'' the company said in a 
statement. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.''

<HEADLINE> New Brewers GM Hires David Wilder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- New Milwaukee Brewers general manager Dean  
Taylor hired Chicago Cubs executive David Wilder on Tuesday to a 
newly created position of vice president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said Wilder, who becomes the highest ranking black  
executive the Brewers have had, will be involved in ``every player 
personnel decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring is another move in Taylor's shakeup of the player  
development system, considered one of the team's weak spots for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder, 38, who knew Taylor when both with the Atlanta Braves,  
said the Brewers personnel system needs some fixing but isn't 
completely broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system has gone through some dry spells,'' Wilder said,  
``but the nucleus of the major league club has a lot of young, 
pretty talented players. The lack of pitching is something you have 
to address. But it's not a situation where the system is bare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said when hired as general manager a week earlier that he  
would make improving personnel development his top priority, and he 
soon began reshaping the organization by reassigning several top 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder will be the primary talent evaluator for the club at the  
major and minor league levels and will oversee scouting and player 
development, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system,'' Wilder said, ``is not overwhelmingly talented.  
What you need to do is to instill a sense of pride and work ethic, 
the foundation of every successful organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder was the Cubs' farm director for three years before  
becoming assistant general manager this season. 
</P>
<P>
	An outfielder for seven seasons in the minor leagues with the  
Cubs and Oakland Athletics, Wilder retired in 1989 and began a 
career in player development. He started as a scout with Oakland 
and worked his way up by 1995 to become assistant director of 
scouting and player development for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball for years has been trying to get teams to  
hire more minorities in the front office, and Wilder said he's 
happy that some progress is being made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's positive,'' Wilder said. ``I would say there are still  
too few, but I'm happy they are addressing it. We've got a lot of 
people in different positions today that they never had in the 
past. That's good. I hope I can do something that will help other 
minorities to advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor last week demoted Fred Stanley, an assistant general  
manager who headed the player development and scouting departments, 
and Ken Califano, director of scouting. They will be offered other 
jobs with the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Cooper, the former Brewers star who was director of player  
development, was reassigned as a special assistant for player 
personnel.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Freelance Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new court ruling is raising questions about  
compensation for freelance writers whose work appeared in 
electronic databases without their permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Copyright law ``does not permit the publishers to license  
individually copyrighted works for inclusion in the electronic 
databases,'' according to the unanimous ruling issued Friday by a 
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals' Second Circuit in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1993 by six writers and the National  
Writers' Union, which represents 5,000 freelance writers. The suit 
was filed against The New York Times Co., Newsday, Time Inc. 
Magazine Co., Mead Data Central Corp., and University Microfilms 
International and The Atlantic Monthly Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors had claimed, according to the ruling, ``that the  
copyright each owns in his or her individual articles was infringed 
when the publishers provided them to the electronic databases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since the lawsuit was filed, most large publishers  
have made the purchase of electronic rights, which include use of 
stories on the Web, a standard part of contracts with freelance 
writers. Typically they do not provide extra compensation for the 
electronic rights, although a big-name author might be able to 
negotiate additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear what, if any, recourse might be available to  
writers whose work was purchased for publication only in a print 
format and was then later archived in an electronic format without 
express permission -- for example, in Nexis, which is comprised of 
stories from hundreds of periodicals over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute applies mainly to electronic news databases such as  
Nexis, and predates the widespread use of the World Wide Web as a 
publishing medium by several years. Nexis had been owned by Mead 
Data at the time the suit was filed but is now owned by Reed 
Elsevier PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to two dozen major media companies, Jonathan Tasini,  
president of the National Writers' Union, warned that the ruling 
``potentially puts your company at great financial and legal 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of writers are now positioned to hit the industry  
with thousands of new claims,'' Tasini said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the defendants will respond. ``We just got  
the decision Friday,'' said Carolyn Shurr, general counsel for 
Newsday. ``We are reviewing it and looking into our options. We 
have not decided how to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One option would be to appeal the ruling, requesting that the  
decision by the three-judge panel be evaluated by the entire Second 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling is not appealed, it will be up to a lower court  
judge to decide what the plaintiffs' obligations are. The original 
lawsuit did not specify any monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a real open question,'' said George Freeman, general  
counsel for The New York Times. ``There's no significant money 
involved with the articles'' that were written by the individual 
authors who filed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``From The New York Times' point of view, when we  
looked at whatever evidence there is, we found the monetary value 
to be insignificant. Millions more people read the piece in The New 
York Times the day it's printed than ever read it on line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he believed researchers using electronic databases  
were more likely to want articles by staff writers than Op-Ed 
pieces or magazine articles written by freelancers, and that it 
would be very difficult for freelancers to prove that publishers 
profited from the electronic use of their material. 
</P>
<P>
	Tasini has proposed resolving the electronic rights issue  
through a collective licensing system, called the Publication 
Rights Clearinghouse, similar to the system governing royalties for 
the use of copyrighted music. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a writer you license your work to the PRC and then we make  
it available for anyone to buy it and use it legally for a fee,'' 
Tasini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he wasn't sure publishers would be interested. ``I  
don't know that the model really works for this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-year statute of limitations pertains to copyright  
infringements. But Tasini believes there is a legal basis for 
claims going back more than three years because if they are 
available electronically, ``there is a notion of continuous 
infringement'' from the time the item was archived.

<HEADLINE> Broncos on Wrong End of Three-Peat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Their offense has gone from superlative to  
stagnant, and the Denver Broncos' definition of a big play has 
become anything going more than 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Mike Shanahan is not contemplating a quarterback change  
after an 0-3 start that marks Denver's longest losing streak since 
he took over as coach in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian Griese's our starter,'' Shanahan said Monday as he  
defended the second-year quarterback who has been given the 
unenviable task of replacing John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's taking a lot of heat right now, but that's the  
nature of this business. What I've got to do is evaluate who I 
think is the best to go in there and execute. I've been dealing 
with the quarterbacks for a long time,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Denver's poor start, Shanahan has been vulnerable to  
criticism for his preseason decision to demote veteran quarterback 
Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also has been accused of being stubborn and unwilling  
to admit a mistake now that the Broncos are in last place in the 
AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my ego is not that strong where I couldn't look at  
something and make a decision,'' he said. ``I'm doing what I think 
is best for the football team and gives us the best chance to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 4-0 as an emergency starter last season, did not  
comment on the quarterback situation Monday, and Griese deferred 
all questions to his Wednesday press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-string quarterback Chris Miller shrugged off suggestions  
that he be given a chance to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pay attention to that,'' Miller said. ``Sure, I'd love  
to be playing. We'd all like to be playing, but right now, that's 
not my role. I've just got to support Brian and keep my arm in 
shape and be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's improbable start -- the worst for a defending Super Bowl  
champion since 1987 -- has blindsided the Broncos, who play host to 
the New York Jets (0-3) on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expected this. Everybody believes we're better than  
this,'' defensive end Harald Hasselbach said. ``I can't really come 
out and say that we are. It's up to us to show that we are. We're 
searching for the answers from within. We'll know them when we get 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have had few answers defensively, allowing 155 yards  
rushing per game. Kansas City's Kimble Anders ran for a career-high 
142 yards against them in Week 2, and Mike Alstott had a 
career-best 131 yards Sunday for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Denver's running game has disappeared. Reigning  
league MVP Terrell Davis, who ran for 2,008 yards last year, is 
averaging 64 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a running threat has prompted opponents to challenge  
Griese to beat them through the air. The results have been dismal 
as Denver has scored 41 points -- 62 fewer than through three games 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just stuck in the mud,'' fullback Howard Griffith said.  
``We need to win games. That's the bottom line. ... If we can get a 
win, it's not going to be a cure-all, but at least we have some 
positive momentum going into the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History says it might be too late for the Broncos to get back in  
the race for a third straight championship. No NFL team has started 
the season 0-3 and won a divisional playoff game, let alone a Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am personally not a guy who likes to draw from history,''  
Hasselbach said. ``I believe that anything is possible. I think we 
create our own fate, so to speak. It's up to us how good we want to 
play.''

<HEADLINE> IRL's Run in Charlotte Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Indy Racing League's foray into the  
heart of stock-car country is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The promoter of the suburban Charlotte track where three  
spectators were killed during an IRL event in May has decided 
against bringing back the series, racing sources said Tuesday, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. had been leaning in recent weeks  
against renewing its three-year contract to hold IRL races at 
Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. The company finalized its 
decision as it draws closer to finishing plans for its 2000 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI officials declined to discuss their decision Tuesday, saying  
they preferred that the announcement come from the IRL. The 
sanctioning body also would not speak publicly about losing the 
Charlotte race from its calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte stop was one of five SMI-controlled races on the  
IRL's 11-event schedule for 1999. The company's agreement to stage 
races at Charlotte expired after this year's race, but SMI still 
has pacts in place to hold events at Atlanta, Las Vegas and Texas 
motor speedways. 
</P>
<P>
	When the IRL announces its 2000 schedule in the coming weeks, it  
is expected to include two races at Texas and one each at Atlanta 
and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL's long-term future at SMI tracks could depend on how the  
series responds to the company's concerns of car design. 
Concord-based SMI raised questions of design and safety after a 
wheel and other debris from a multicar wreck flew into the stands 
during the VisionAire 500 on May 1, killing three spectators 
instantly and injuring eight others. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, SMI raised the height of the safety fences  
surrounding the racing surfaces at its tracks, and the IRL slowed 
its cars and instituted a tethering system designed to keep wheels 
from flying off during crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	But SMI wants the IRL to do more, including a move to larger  
cars that would provide more protection for wheel assemblies and be 
more visible to fans. The IRL said it is studying additional 
changes but is not yet ready to commit to any. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling IRL came to Charlotte in 1997, hopeful of tapping  
into the passions of a region where stock-car racing was born 
decades ago and is still home to most NASCAR Winston Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte routinely draws crowds of 170,000 for Winston Cup  
races, and SMI officials were encouraged when more than 72,000 
showed up for the inaugural IRL event at the 1.5-mile, high-banked 
superspeedway. But that number slipped to about 50,000 in 1998 and 
to less than 40,000 for this year's race, which was canceled after 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the accident, SMI officials had expressed concern  
about the IRL race's shrinking attendance, high promotion costs and 
low revenue stream. The fatal crash, which prompted several 
lawsuits by the families of victims, heightened those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In its bid to find alternate revenue sources, SMI is building  
dirt tracks of about four-tenths of a mile in length at Charlotte 
and Texas and will begin holding World of Outlaws races on the 
tracks next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL also is looking elsewhere. The league's 2000 schedule is  
expected to include new races in Nazareth, Pa., and Covington, Ky.

<HEADLINE> Justice Hires 1st Science Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department hired its first chief  
science adviser Monday -- Donald Prosnitz, a physicist from the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz will be on a two-year detail as the department's chief  
science and technology adviser from the lab where he was the chief 
scientist for the Nonproliferation, Arms Control and International 
Security Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This newly created post enables us to consolidate the  
responsibility for technology policy in one position,'' Attorney 
General Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz is the second physicist drawn from the Energy  
Department's nuclear weapons laboratories to take a top Justice 
Department job. By coincidence, the laboratories currently are a 
focus of an FBI investigation into whether China stole secrets 
about U.S. nuclear warheads in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Donald M. Kerr Jr., a physicist-engineer who  
spent six years as chief of the government's Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, where nuclear weapons were designed, became assistant 
FBI director in charge of the bureau's crime laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief interview, Prosnitz said ``familiarity with the  
government'' might be the reason Justice has twice turned to the 
national laboratories for a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz will advise Reno on research, development, procurement  
and legislation relating to technological issues like computer 
crime or the use of DNA evidence. Indeed, his first task was to 
attend a meeting of the department's advisory Commission on the 
Future of DNA Evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will serve as the department's liaison to the scientific  
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Prosnitz's wealth of education, experience and management  
in the scientific community make him the right person for the 
job,'' Reno said. ``He is well-suited to coordinate the Justice 
Department's efforts on complex and novel technological issues such 
as investigating computer crimes and threats to our critical 
infrastructure, the use of DNA evidence and forensic analysis 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was graduated from Yale University with a degree in  
engineering and applied science in 1970 and received his doctorate 
in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Japanese Bank To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An international investment group plans to acquire  
debt-laden Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in what would be the 
first foreign acquisition of a major Japanese bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal disclosed today represents a step forward in the  
government's efforts to clean up loan problems that has suffocated 
the banking industry since Japanese property prices collapsed in 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission announced it had  
approved the deal, and that the investment group organized by the 
private U.S. equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC had signed a 
memorandum of understanding on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood, based in New York City, has specialized in buying  
struggling small-to-midsize companies and making them profitable. 
It hopes to reach a final deal for LTCB by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	Other proposed investors in the New LTCB include GE Capital  
Corp., Mellon Bank Corp., ABN-Amro Bank, PaineWebber Group and 
Deutsche Bank. Former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker is 
a senior advisor to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies like Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui  
Trust and Banking Co. had been in the running to acquire LTCB. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's biggest banks, was nationalized last  
October after regulators determined it would never recover from a 
mountain of bad loans. It was the first time the Japanese 
government had taken over a bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to restore LTCB to its former status as a premier  
financial institution as quickly as possible, so it can contribute 
to the financial stability of Japan,'' said LTCB's new chairman and 
chief executive, Masamoto Yashiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government will inject $2.26 billion into a  
reformed LTCB on condition that the Ripplewood group continue loans 
to the bank's troubled borrowers, according to an FCR official who 
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners will acquire LTCB shares by paying $9.43 million  
to the Deposit Insurance Corp., the Japanese government finance 
body which is now LTCB's sole shareholder, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashiro, formerly a non-executive chairman of Citicorp Japan,  
said that the new bank will try to expand its individual and 
corporate business. It will remain a Japanese-oriented bank in the 
initial years, Yashiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said eight of the 15 top board members are expected to be  
Japanese ``because they would understand the Japanese market 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Collins, founder of Ripplewood who will join LTCB's  
board, said he hoped to play a role in Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said that although there are structural problems in  
Japan's economy, he wanted to ``find an area to restructure the 
Japanese economy and provide strategic advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal was likely to have a positive impact on  
Japan's inefficient banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ripplewood will take it through restructuring you haven't seen  
here, and there will be big pressure on others to follow suit,'' 
said James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	FRC chief Hakuo Yanagisawa welcomed the deal. ``Japanese  
financial institutions are far worse than Western counterparts in 
profitability,'' he said. ``New LTCB made it clear they will focus 
on fixing this problem. We hope this will become reality and affect 
(other Japanese financial institutions) positively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB and the Ripplewood group hope to reach a final agreement by  
Nov. 30, and the government may extend the period if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FRC, a Japanese government body overseeing banking industry  
reform, has been discussing LTCB's transfer since the middle of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is likely to speed up the process of opening Japan's  
financial industry to foreign firms, a pillar of the country's 
financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the government's commitment to creating a level  
playing field, and that it and won't even let nationalism get in 
the way of what needs to be done,'' ING Barings' Fiorillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan collapsed in 
the early 1990s.

	The Financial Reconstruction Commission announced it had  
approved the deal, and that the investment group organized by the 
private U.S. equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC had signed a 
memorandum of understanding on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood, based in New York City, has specialized in buying  
struggling small-to-midsize companies and making them profitable. 
It hopes to reach a final deal for LTCB by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	Other proposed investors in the New LTCB include GE Capital  
Corp., Mellon Bank Corp., ABN-Amro Bank, PaineWebber Group and 
Deutsche Bank. Former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker is 
a senior advisor to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies like Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui  
Trust and Banking Co. had been in the running to acquire LTCB. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's biggest banks, was nationalized last  
October after regulators determined it would never recover from a 
mountain of bad loans. It was the first time the Japanese 
government had taken over a bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to restore LTCB to its former status as a premier  
financial institution as quickly as possible, so it can contribute 
to the financial stability of Japan,'' said LTCB's new chairman and 
chief executive, Masamoto Yashiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government will inject $2.26 billion into a  
reformed LTCB on condition that the Ripplewood group continue loans 
to the bank's troubled borrowers, according to an FCR official who 
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners will acquire LTCB shares by paying $9.43 million  
to the Deposit Insurance Corp., the Japanese government finance 
body which is now LTCB's sole shareholder, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashiro, formerly a non-executive chairman of Citicorp Japan,  
said that the new bank will try to expand its individual and 
corporate business. It will remain a Japanese-oriented bank in the 
initial years, Yashiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said eight of the 15 top board members are expected to be  
Japanese ``because they would understand the Japanese market 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Collins, founder of Ripplewood who will join LTCB's  
board, said he hoped to play a role in Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said that although there are structural problems in  
Japan's economy, he wanted to ``find an area to restructure the 
Japanese economy and provide strategic advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal was likely to have a positive impact on  
Japan's inefficient banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ripplewood will take it through restructuring you haven't seen  
here, and there will be big pressure on others to follow suit,'' 
said James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	FRC chief Hakuo Yanagisawa welcomed the deal. ``Japanese  
financial institutions are far worse than Western counterparts in 
profitability,'' he said. ``New LTCB made it clear they will focus 
on fixing this problem. We hope this will become reality and affect 
(other Japanese financial institutions) positively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB and the Ripplewood group hope to reach a final agreement by  
Nov. 30, and the government may extend the period if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FRC, a Japanese government body overseeing banking industry  
reform, has been discussing LTCB's transfer since the middle of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is likely to speed up the process of opening Japan's  
financial industry to foreign firms, a pillar of the country's 
financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the government's commitment to creating a level  
playing field, and that it and won't even let nationalism get in 
the way of what needs to be done,'' ING Barings' Fiorillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan collapsed in 
the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Uremovich Glad To Be Back With Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- When Matt Uremovich compared himself to other  
college linebackers, he was overwhelmed by the desire to get bigger 
and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely 200 pounds, he felt out of place. Impatient, he didn't  
want to take the time to put on the extra weight through 
conventional methods. So, he purchased a muscle-building supplement 
banned by the NCAA and hoped he wouldn't get caught. 
</P>
<P>
	He was.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was all a mental thing,'' said Uremovich, who is back at  
middle linebacker for No. 9 Georgia Tech after being suspended for 
nearly a year. ``It's how you play and how hard you play, not how 
much you weigh. Ten pounds is not going to make or break you. It 
was just a stupid mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a redshirt freshman, Uremovich earned a starting role at  
outside linebacker and had the best game of his career last Oct. 
10, a 10-tackle performance against North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, he was suspended for testing positive for an  
over-the-counter substance similar to androstenedione, the 
supplement made famous by Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich missed the final seven games of Georgia Tech's 10-2  
season, and also was forced to sit out the first two games this 
year. He finally returned for Tech's 41-10 victory over Central 
Florida, starting at middle linebacker, calling the defensive 
signals and making eight tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long time coming,'' he said. ``It felt good to get  
out there. The first two weeks of this season felt almost as long 
as the seven games I missed last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though McGwire was breaking home run records while using  
andro, a substance legal in baseball, Uremovich doesn't feel 
victimized by a double standard. He took a chance and got caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rule and you can't break the rules,'' he said. ``I paid  
the price for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George O'Leary was furious at Uremovich for using a banned  
substance, especially when two other Tech players had already been 
suspended for similar offenses prior to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it's a lesson learned in life,'' O'Leary said. ``I  
had his parents in and we talked about taking shortcuts in life. 
Eventually, it's going to get you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich was forthright with his coaches, who encouraged him to  
use the suspension time to improve his strength in the weight room 
and devote more time to academics. He now weighs 225 pounds and 
made the dean's list two quarters in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make the most of every game, every practice, every  
day,'' Uremovich said. ``You never know when it's all going to be 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary noticed that newfound maturity and demonstrated his  
faith in Uremovich by starting him in his first game back, 
providing the extra responsibility of calling signals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That meant a lot,'' Uremovich said. ``They want me to show  
some leadership and I'm trying to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the extra weight, Uremovich still looks a bit  
undersized to play such a physically demanding position as middle 
linebacker. But he fits right in with the Grim Reaper tattoo on his 
right arm and a seemingly perpetual cut on the bridge of his nose, 
caused by his helmet tending to slip down on his head while making 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a very big guy, but he plays like he's 260 pounds.  
He's an animal on the field,'' said tight end Conrad Andrzejewski, 
who practiced against Uremovich when he was on the scout team. 
``It's not fun to hit him. He has a hard head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uremovich's pedal-to-the-floor style has been compared to Keith  
Brooking, a former Tech linebacker who now starts for the Atlanta 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely an idol to me,'' said Uremovich, who was  
redshirted while Brooking played his final year at Tech. ``As far 
as me being him, there's not much comparison. He's an unbelievable 
athlete. If I'm half the player he was, I'll have a pretty good 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Uremovich lacks the rare combination of size and  
speed that made Brooking so special. Intensity-wise, they're 
impossible to distinguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keith was special as far as the speed he had,'' O'Leary said.  
``Matt is going to get better and better, but that's the thing 
separating those guys right now.''

<HEADLINE> Man Says Chargers End Assaulted Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Police are investigating a 23-year-old man's  
claim that San Diego Chargers defensive end Chris Mims hit him 
twice with his belt and stole his food following a verbal 
confrontation outside a downtown taco shop early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims left the scene before officers arrived and hadn't yet been  
contacted by police, spokesman Bill Robinson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to a Del Taco at about 2:40 a.m. Monday, some  
10 hours after the Chargers lost their home opener, 27-19 to the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. McKinney told police that Mims threatened him, shoved  
his head into a wall, took his four tacos and then chased him, 
striking him twice with his belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Police likely will talk again with McKinney and a Del Taco  
employee, who recognized Mims as being a member of the Chargers, 
before deciding whether to send the case either to the city 
attorney or district attorney, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers players had Tuesday off and Mims, the team's  
first-round draft pick in 1992, was not available for comment. 
General manager Bobby Beathard was on a scouting trip and Mims' 
agent didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Taco employee Rasean Johnson told police that a black  
limousine pulled up to the drive-through window and Mims got out 
and started urinating in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, who was at a walk-up window, said something to Mims,  
who then came over and said: ``I'll beat you with my belt,'' the 
police report said. McKinney told police he tried to ignore Mims, 
but was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney sustained bruises and welts on the left side and back  
of his neck from being struck with a belt, and had small cuts on 
his lower lip, left side and the back of his right hand, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told KGTV that Mims said to McKinney: ``I'm going to  
keep your damn tacos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a million dollar man right here, who gets a nice  
paycheck, taking this man's $2 tacos,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims, in his second stint with the Chargers, makes the league  
minimum of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims battled his weight and had legal and financial problems off  
the field during his first five seasons with the Chargers. He was 
released in April 1997 and signed by the Washington Redskins. The 
Chargers re-signed him in June 1998, and he's been a reserve ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1995 season ended with a 35-20 home playoff loss to  
the Colts on New Year's Eve, Mims showed up almost an hour late to 
the team's final meeting the next morning, emerging disheveled from 
a limousine.

<HEADLINE> Former Tigers Outfielder Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Tigers outfielder Ron LeFlore on  
Tuesday avoided 45 days in jail on charges he failed to make child 
support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore was arrested Monday after Tiger Stadium's closing  
ceremonies on charges he failed to pay more than $50,000 in back 
child support to DeBorah Lewis of Detroit. He was ordered to pay 
$3,000 or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He evidently paid it or made arrangements for payment,'' a  
spokesman from the Wayne County Sheriffs Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old LeFlore has been living in St. Petersburg, Fla.  
He returned to Michigan to take part in the events surrounding the 
last game at Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	His adopted son and nephew, Gerald LeFlore, said his father has  
paid $300 a month in Florida for at least a year. Ron LeFlore also 
made lump sum payments after various court orders, but Judge Mary 
Beth Kelly ruled that LeFlore still owed Lewis about $52,000 to 
$56,000 for their daughter, LaRonda LeFlore, now 23. 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore testified that his only source of income is a $20,000  
major league pension. He also said that he has a wife and two other 
children to support, and he has problems with a hip and knee. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Allen, the lawyer representing LeFlore on Tuesday, said  
the numbers still need to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He recognizes that there's an arrears, whether it's that  
amount is questionable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said LeFlore's attorney in Florida will examine the  
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said she was upset by the possibility he could be freed  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some crock again,'' she said. ``This man makes money  
signing autographs. He'll pay the money, and he'll be gone again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore family friend and former publicist Jack Taylor said he  
was ``disgusted'' by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole situation was created by a lack of communication  
and correlation of facts and figures,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court decision extends Lewis' fight to get money from her  
former common-law husband. The two have been apart since 
Thanksgiving 1977, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been chasing him ever since he left Michigan,'' she said.  
``All I ask is, `Take care of your kids.''' 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore was considered one of baseball's best baserunners when  
he played with the Tigers from 1974-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said she called the Wayne County Sheriff's Department on  
Monday to tell them LeFlore would be attending Tiger Stadium's 
closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named in a Wayne County Circuit Court bench warrant in  
1993, Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis works as a mechanical engineer. Her daughter has been  
working as a bank teller, but she said she wants to finish college. 
LaRonda LeFlore said she still has about $4,000 in loans to pay 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom raised me and sent me to private school by herself,''  
LaRonda LeFlore said. ``I feel he should've paid something. I feel 
a father should be willing to take care of his kids if he's willing 
to have them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About six years ago, LaRonda LeFlore said, her father didn't  
recognize her when he walked into the Woolworth's where she was 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't know who I was,'' she said. ``I tapped him on the  
shoulder and told him my name. His eyes bugged open. He was 
surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaRonda LeFlore said she has a 1-year-old son whom her father  
has never seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron LeFlore's wife, Emily, also sat in the courtroom but  
declined to talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	She, LeFlore's mother, and Gerald LeFlore were all present when  
LeFlore was arrested at the stadium Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandmother was really torn up,'' Gerald LeFlore said.  
``She was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Tigers in 1974, Ron LeFlore served time in  
prison for armed robbery. His story was the basis for a movie, 
``One In A Million'' in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, then-Tigers manager Billy Martin heard about a young  
man playing on the ball team in the Southern Michigan Prison in 
Jackson. He went and watched him play a couple times and urged the 
Tigers to sign him. LeFlore went to Detroit Eastern High School, 
but didn't play ball before prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he was paroled, he signed with the Tigers and jumped from  
Class A to the major leagues in less than two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Fell in Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence slipped in September for the  
third consecutive month, and by much more than analysts had 
expected, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's 
higher-interest-rate strategy is cooling off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said today that its index of consumer  
confidence, which is a measure of consumer's willingness to spend, 
dipped to 134.2 in September, down 1.8 percentage points from a 
revised 136 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had forecast that September's reading would be 135.4.  
</P>
<P>
	Economists noted, however, that the latest level still was not  
far below the June reading of 139, which was the strongest in more 
than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the September dip, confidence levels are still at  
historically high levels,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the 
Conference Board's consumer research center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest figure is only five points off the June reading,  
with consumer generally optimistic about both the economy and job 
prospects. We anticipate no dramatic shifts soon in consumer 
spending patterns,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has twice this year raised interest rates to  
try to keep the economy from overheating and to head off a 
resurgence of inflation. Fed policy-makers meet next on Oct. 5, and 
some economists are not ruling out a further increase if retail 
sales continue to show the strength they have in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's report, which is based on a sample of  
5,000 American households, said consumer expectations about the 
future also weakened in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of expectations slipped to 105.7 this month from 109.2  
in August and was the lowest reading since March's 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 7.1 percent of respondents said they expected business  
conditions to worsen in the next six months, while 16.4 percent 
expected them to improve. The rest said they expected no change. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures were more pessimistic than in August. Employment  
expectations also declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the Conference Board, a business-financed research  
group, uses a baseline of 100, set in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Dealers See Threat in New GM Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it has set up  
an independent subsidiary to own and operate dealerships across the 
country -- a move the head of a national dealers' association vowed 
to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the company, General Motors Retail Holdings, would buy  
or partner with dealerships in the largest 130 markets across the 
country, and could own from 5 percent to 10 percent of GM's 7,700 
dealerships in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A GM executive said the new arrangement was the best way for GM  
to get closer to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical to GM's future competitiveness that we improve  
our market performance where we lag, enhance our revenues, 
understand our customers better and look for ways to reduce 
distribution costs and improve the customer's buying experience,'' 
said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president of GM North American 
Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association  
said the move was ``a huge threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its terrible,'' said James Willingham, who owns two GM  
dealerships in California. ``This announcement was made without any 
consultation of dealers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GMRH is the latest in a series of moves by GM and Ford Motor Co.  
aimed at improving how their vehicles are sold. In recent years the 
automakers have bought out some dealers and consolidated others, 
hoping to trim the number of dealerships and increase sales at 
those remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as more and more dealers have sold out to  
publicly-owned companies such as Republic Industries Inc. and 
United Auto Group. Those groups hope economies of scale will allow 
them to offer better selection, lower prices and better service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has made its own stab at such an arrangement. In five  
cities so far, Ford has consolidated as many as 14 stores into 
three or four big outlets. Ford owns a major stake in what it calls 
the Ford Retail Network, but a dealer or group of dealers manage 
the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been disappointing, said Art Spinella, an  
analyst with CNW Marketing Research, because automakers don't know 
how to sell cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GMRH ``is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Spinella said. ``There  
has never been an auto dealership owned by the factory that has 
ever made a dime. ... GM needs to concentrate on one thing and one 
thing only: manufacturing good product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move may add to dealer anger at GM that has been simmering  
for months. GM reorganized its sales division last year, cutting 
field personnel and asserting more control over a $500 million fund 
used for dealer advertising. Some dealers sued, saying GM was 
taking money from them and using it in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In a NADA survey of dealer satisfaction earlier this year, all  
of GM's divisions except Saturn ranked at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	GM emphasized that GMRH would be treated the same as any dealer  
and not get special favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that promise, Willingham said there were any number of  
ways a GMRH dealership could get a little boost, from getting more 
hot-selling models to better finance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Willingham said if necessary, dealers would go to state  
legislatures and ask for stronger laws against factory-owned 
stores. Some states already have such laws in place.

<HEADLINE> New Medicare Reference Books Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new guidebook the government is mailing out  
this fall to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries has prompted a 
flood of questions from senior citizens and the disabled about 
their health care choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of weekly calls to Medicare's national toll-free help  
line has quadrupled to 20,000 since the first batch of guides were 
mailed out Sept. 15, according to the program's director of 
beneficiary services, Carol Cronin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that will probably continue to increase as more  
beneficiaries get their handbook,'' Cronin said, adding that the 
deluge of calls was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first comprehensive effort to get information to  
beneficiaries to help them make decisions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guides are similar to Medicare handbooks that in the  
past have been sent to those newly eligible to the national health 
insurance program and available to others upon request. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, Medicare is sending them to 32 million households  
in an attempt to reach all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries 
nationwide. From now on, the massive mailing will be an annual fall 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Also for the first time, the guidebooks come in 26 different  
regional editions, offering specific information about the private 
health plans open to Medicare beneficiaries in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the help line have included many requests for more  
details about such health plans. 
</P>

	The new information campaign, which cost $133 million this year,  
was required by Congress in 1997 legislation aimed at encouraging 
more Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in private health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government can save money when senior citizens choose  
private plans -- mainly HMOs -- that accept a flat, monthly 
per-patient fee from Medicare regardless of the amount of care 
provided. In contrast, the government must pay each medical bill 
directly for patients who stay in the traditional Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidebook provides general information about how  
Medicare works and also explains tradeoffs for those considering 
joining an HMO. For example, people who choose an HMO may get extra 
benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, that are not normally 
offered by Medicare. At the same time, however, they may have less 
freedom to choose their doctors.

<HEADLINE> FBI Fund-Raising Notes Being Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee will investigate the  
disappearance of an FBI agent's notes that were written at a time 
of internal strife in a campaign fund-raising investigation, Sen. 
Fred Thompson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs  
Committee, said FBI and Justice Department officials were ``wholly 
unprepared'' last week to discuss details of their ongoing internal 
investigations into the disappearance. Thompson said he wouldn't 
wait for the Clinton administration to finish before launching a 
Senate probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Parker told members of Thompson's committee during a  
public hearing last week that the 27 pages of notes covered a 
period in 1997 when the agents, and Justice Department attorneys, 
had strong disagreements about tactics in the investigation of 
presidential friend Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie. Trie was a major 
Democratic fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to campaign finance 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes had been subpoenaed by a House committee. The agent  
said they could only have been torn from her spiral notebook. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said sworn depositions would be taken from government  
officials who handled the notes.

<HEADLINE> Folic Acid May Fight Down Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women who have trouble metabolizing the  
vitamin folic acid are at a higher risk of having children with 
Down syndrome, a discovery by government researchers that raises 
the question of whether folic acid supplements might fight the 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers with a genetic abnormality that hinders how the body  
processes folic acid were 2.6 times more likely to have a child 
with Down syndrome than mothers without that genetic defect, 
concludes the study published Tuesday in the American Journal of 
Clinical Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery by Food and Drug Administration researchers is  
only one piece in the complicated puzzle of Down syndrome, 
cautioned FDA Commissioner Jane Henney. That's because millions of 
women appear to have this genetic abnormality, yet the risk of 
having a child with Down syndrome actually is small -- one in 600 
births. 
</P>
<P>
	So something else has to help trigger the devastating condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``this opens the door to look at other genes,'' explained  
S. Jill James, an FDA biochemist who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	And birth defect experts were excited because the study points  
to a possible, albeit still unproven, way to reduce the risk: 
Eating more folic acid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have this mutation and you happen to have a very poor  
diet, it magnified the problem,'' James said. ``We call it a 
gene-nutrient interaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folic acid is a B vitamin found naturally in leafy green  
vegetables, beans, tuna, eggs and other foods. Also, in 1998 the 
government ordered some grain products such as flour, breakfast 
cereal and pasta to be fortified with folic acid. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who eat 400 micrograms of folic acid a day cut in half  
their chances of having babies with birth defects of the brain and 
spinal cord, such as spina bifida. Whether a baby develops these 
defects is determined in the first days after conception -- well 
before a woman knows she is pregnant. And even with food 
fortification, it can be hard to eat enough. So health experts 
recommend that every woman of childbearing age take a daily dietary 
supplement, such as a multivitamin, containing 400 micrograms of 
folic acid. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been hints that folic acid might play a role in other  
birth defects, too, but the FDA research is the first good 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that combines mental  
retardation with such physical abnormalities as a broad, flat face 
and slanting eyes. Affected children are at high risk of heart 
defects, visual or hearing impairment and other health problems. 
The March of Dimes estimates there are 250,000 Americans with Down 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, each egg and sperm cell contains 23 chromosomes. When  
either an egg or a sperm carries a certain extra chromosome, Down 
syndrome results. In most cases, the problem arises during 
ovulation, when a woman's body produces an abnormal egg. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene MTHFR plays a role in how chromosomes separate during  
ovulation, and in how much folic acid people need for various 
bodily reactions. 
</P>
<P>
	So James studied whether an MTHFR abnormality also could affect  
Down syndrome. She compared 57 mothers of Down syndrome children 
with another 50 mothers of healthy children, and concluded the gene 
abnormality did indeed increase the risk of Down syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA researchers did not give women folic acid supplements to  
see if they would prove enough -- and at what dose -- to counter the 
genetic defect. Experts said a treatment study is the necessary 
next step. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the study was in younger mothers, and mothers over 40 have  
the highest risk of a Down syndrome baby. So how age complicates 
the genetics is a big question. 
</P>
<P>
	However, 28 percent of the Down syndrome mothers claimed they  
had taken folic acid supplements at the time of conception. 
</P>
<P>
	If eating extra folic acid does prove protective, getting women  
to take it for several months before they conceive -- in time to 
protect eggs produced during ovulation -- would be vital, said Dr. 
Donald Mattison, medical director of the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folate status prior to conception is more critical than we  
might have thought,'' he said. ``The important message to women is 
this reinforces the importance of them taking folic acid on a daily 
basis.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg Home From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  
returned home from the hospital Tuesday, 11 days after surgery for 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said part of Ginsburg's colon was  
removed during the surgery. In a generally upbeat statement, she 
said the cancer had not spread to any lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	A small tumor had invaded Ginsburg's colon and ``minimally  
penetrated the outer muscle,'' according to a statement released by 
Arberg. There was no speculation as to when the justice might 
return to her court chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, 66, participated in consideration of cases that were  
granted review Tuesday and in several death penalty cases acted on 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Arberg said, ``All lymph nodes proved negative for cancer and  
there was no metastasis evident. A small tumor, 2 centimeters by 3 
centimeters size, had invaded her sigmoid colon and minimally 
penetrated the outer muscle.'' The sigmoid colon is one of four 
areas of the colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg fell ill this summer while teaching in Crete, and  
initially was treated for acute diverticulitis, a gastric disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extraordinarily, the severe abdominal inflammation for which  
Justice Ginsburg was first treated ... was unrelated to her colon 
cancer,'' Arberg said. ``It did, however, lead to discovery of the 
tumor ... two weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg's surgeon, Lee Smith, found a perforation higher in the  
bowel -- separate from the site of the cancer and determined to be 
non-cancerous -- that was the source of Ginsburg's abdominal 
infection, Arberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, who had been a pioneering advocate for women's rights,  
became the second woman ever to serve on the nation's highest 
court, joining Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the bench, when 
appointed by President Clinton in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She since has found an ideological home somewhere left of center  
on a conservative court dominated by Republican appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United  
States and the second-leading cancer killer, behind lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The common treatment is surgical removal of the cancerous part  
of the colon and any nearby lymph nodes where the cancer has 
spread. Post-surgical chemotherapy and radiation are often 
prescribed to kill any leftover tumor cells and decrease the 
chances of recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Arberg's statement did not mention additional treatment.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Win at Ballpark's Last Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The memory palace had one last treasure left.  
</P>
<P>
	With Al Kaline, Ernie Harwell and a sellout crowd bidding  
farewell, the Tiger Stadium went out with a bang Monday, just the 
way it came in. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1912, the park opened with some 24,384 fans jammed  
into a place with a listed capacity of 23,000. The Tigers rallied 
to beat Cleveland 6-5 in 11 innings. The game included a steal of 
home by Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, 1999, Robert Fick, wearing the No. 25 of former  
Tigers favorite Norm Cash, hit his first career grand slam in the 
eighth inning -- a towering shot off the top of the right-field roof 
-- and Detroit beat Kansas City 8-2 in the final game at the corner 
of Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 43,356 sensed something special might be about to  
happen after Kansas City reliever Jeff Montgomery loaded the bases 
with no outs. Thousands of flash bulbs went off around the old park 
on every pitch during Gabe Kapler's at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	When his grounder forced Dean Palmer at the plate, bases were  
still loaded for Fick. Now, the crowd was really into it, cheering 
itself hoarse as Fick strode to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was a sea of flashing camera lights as Montgomery  
threw his first pitch to Fick. The roar from the fans was deafening 
as the ball exploded off Fick's bat, bouncing off the roof and back 
down to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After he circled the bases, the crowd chanted Fick's name,  
demanding a curtain call. He stepped shyly to the top of the dugout 
steps and doffed his cap as thousands of flash bulbs popped once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I'm never going to forget,'' Fick said. ``It's  
something nobody here is ever going to forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions ran high for the fans as well as the players, but order  
prevailed. Only a few fans jumped over the fence and tried to run 
across the field after Doug Jones struck out Carlos Beltran to end 
it at 7:07 p.m. But they were quickly escorted from the grounds, 
and a security force of both mounted and foot police ringed the 
warning track for postgame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Home plate was dug up immediately after the final out and  
carried to Comerica Park, where it was relocated in the new 
facility being built about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger Stadium may be laid to rest and we may be moving to  
Comerica Park,'' catcher Brad Ausmus said, ``but the people, the 
players and the memories of Tiger Stadium will never be 
forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So went this one last sentimental journey for the ballpark built  
on the site of a haymarket, a place that was once home to Cobb, 
Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Denny McLain and Kaline. It opened 
as Navin Field five days after the sinking of the Titanic. Fenway 
Park opened in Boston the same day, making them the two oldest 
ballparks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's finale was the 6,873rd regular season game at the  
stadium, which also has played host to 35 postseason games and 
three All-Star games. The sellout put the Tigers over the 2 million 
mark in attendance for just the sixth time in club history, and the 
first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final Tiger Stadium game, Detroit's players all wore  
numbers of Tigers who played through the years. The starters wore 
the numbers of the Tigers' all-time team. Center fielder Gabe 
Kapler wore a uniform without a number, honoring Cobb -- the 
greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in an era before uniforms 
were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Special baseballs were used, and the bases were changed after  
each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, a Hall of Famer, exchanged lineup cards with Royals Hall  
of Famer George Brett. Both wore their familiar uniforms, Kaline 
with his No. 6, Brett with No. 5. Harwell, the beloved broadcaster, 
emceed pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great times we've experienced in Tiger Stadium we'll  
cherish forever,'' Mayor Dennis Archer told the crowd. ``Now, let's 
create some new memories in Comerica Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers won 3,764 games in the old ballpark, lost 3,090 and  
tied 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was home to us for a long time,'' said Eddie Mayo, a member  
of the 1945 World Series champions. ``Old friends are hard to 
slough off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, with the Old English ``D'' on his breast, was saluted  
with a two-minute standing ovation during the pregame festivities 
and again during postgame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken many times about the first day I ever saw this  
ballpark, as an 18-year-old kid fresh off the train from 
Baltimore,'' Kaline said. ``I again find myself humbled and a bit 
overwhelmed by the events unfolding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Rogell, a shortstop from 1930-39, threw out the ceremonial  
first pitch as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good day, but a sad day,'' said U.S. Sen. Jim  
Bunning of Kentucky, a Hall of Fame pitcher who was with the Tigers 
from 1955-63. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Bill Freehan, selected by Detroit fans as the greatest  
Tigers catcher ever: ``Bittersweet is the perfect word for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weather cooperated, with pale blue skies, gentle sunshine  
and a pleasant breeze coming off the Detroit River as thousands of 
fans came through the old ballpark's turnstiles one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	What they saw was what they no doubt remembered from their  
youth. By the middle of the game, the setting sun was casting long, 
loving shadows across the verdant outfield, bathing the players and 
the field in glow. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the Tigers won. The Tigers almost always win in  
the memories of the true believers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levine, a 53-year-old fan, flew in from Chicago. In his  
wallet were ticket stubs from the 1968 game when the Tigers 
clinched the AL pennant and the game when McLain got his 30th win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out here on the plane this morning, probably 80 percent  
of the people were coming here to see a ballgame for the last 
time,'' he said. ``I have tons of feelings about this old place. I 
used to skip school regularly to attend opening days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler, the starting and winning pitcher, was just like  
any other fan when it came to saying goodbye to this revered mass 
of rusting girders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my video camera around and I could see where people  
were trying to take the signs down,'' Moehler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving postgame ceremonies emceed by Harwell, 65 former  
Tigers -- from Eldon Auker, who played in 1933, to Brad Ausmus of 
the 1999 squad -- formed a chronological line from home plate to the 
flag pole in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the stands remained for as long as they could, taking in  
one last, loving look. Some, who were close enough, leaned over the 
rail and scooped handfuls of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	With music from the movie ``Apollo 13'' playing in the  
background, Harwell's voice began to choke with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farewell old friend, Tiger Stadium,'' Harwell said. ``We will  
remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, former pitching sensation Mark Fidrych, who was  
famous for talking to the baseball during his starts, was asked 
what he might say to the stadium on its final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, stadium, for all the excitement you gave me. I had  
fun here. I had a lot of memories here,'' he said. ``But it's like 
everything in life, you have to go. You can't be around forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the stadium, maybe. But the memories will live forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Italian publisher Poligrafici Editoriale  
SpA and USA Today's internet service, USA Today.com, joined forces 
Tuesday to develop an internet venture. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agreement, the on-line versions of the Italian  
publisher's four daily newspapers -- the Bologna-based Il Resto del 
Carlino, the Florence-based La Nazione and the Milan-based Il 
Giorno -- will be displaying their homepages on U.S. internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Poligrafici Editoriale will also be displaying on U.S. internet  
sites, an on-line national daily, Il Quotidiano.net, which will be 
updated with news reports throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Poligrafici Editoriale plans to target the U.S.  
market by developing an English-language channel covering topics 
like tourism, art, food, cars and a guide on how to use the Italian 
internet system. The channel will also include a special section 
called ``Fashion Trends'' with news from Italy's top designers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal allows USA Today to enjoy permanent access to the  
Italian and European internet through Poligrafici Editoriale's 
internet sites and the two companies plan to generate income by 
developing and offering on-line shopping and advertising services. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest venture comes barely 10 days after Italian publisher  
Editoriale L'Espresso SpA and CNN Interactive announced the 
creation of the first 24-hour internet news service in Italy on 
Sept. 15.

<HEADLINE> Total, Elf Focus on Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARiS (AP) -- French oil companies Total Fina and Elf Aquitaine  
will focus on completing their merger rather than seeking further 
alliances, Total Fina's chairman said in an interview published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, the issue of complementary alliances is not in the  
agenda in the coming months,'' Thierry Desmarest told the Le Figaro 
daily. ``We have a lot of work this year to make sure this merger 
is a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina came out the big winner earlier this month in its  
2-month takeover battle for Elf to create the world's 
fourth-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina's offer for Elf shares is set to close Oct. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the merger would create the largest company on the  
French stock market in terms of capitalization, it still lags way 
behind Royal Dutch Shell AG, BP Amoco PLC and the planned 
combination of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has already arisen that Total may pursue more  
alliances, notably with Italian energy giant ENI, which held merger 
talks with Elf before Total Fina launched its own bid back in July. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said he would  
evaluate the possibility of linking ENI with the Total Fina-Elf 
group once the French companies have completed their merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina is already a product of industrywide consolidation,  
the result of Total's 1998 acquisition of Belgium's Petrofina. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movement of concentration has been so rapid over the past  
15 months that it must slow down,'' Desmarest said. ``The number of 
possible combinations is limited as well because we will come up 
against the opposition of the competition authorities.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Accepts Rape Law Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to judge the  
constitutionality of a federal law that lets rape victims sue their 
attackers, a test of how far Congress can go in fighting sex 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, who have curtailed Congress' power in recent  
years, will decide whether a former Virginia Tech student, Christy 
Brzonkala, can sue two college football players under a provision 
of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. She says they raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court threw out the lawsuit, saying Congress'  
power to regulate interstate commerce and assure equal protection 
to all citizens did not authorize it to allow rape victims to sue 
their attackers for financial damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which filed its own appeal to the  
top court, told the justices the appeals court ruling ``places 
unwarranted limits on Congress' authority to address a national 
problem of the first magnitude.'' Gender-based violence harms 
victims' ability to work and costs the economy billions of dollars 
a year, government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala's lawyer, Martha Davis of the NOW Legal Defense  
and Education Fund, said she hopes the Supreme Court ``will draw a 
line around the decisions they've been reaching recently to rein in 
Congress' power, and recognize Congress' historic responsibility 
when dealing with gender discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael E. Rosman, a lawyer for Antonio J. Morrison, one of  
the athletes, said, ``We feel confident'' the justices will 
invalidate the provision allowing lawsuits over gender-based 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate criminal provisions of the Violence Against Women Act  
are not at issue in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices will hear arguments this winter, and a decision is  
expected by late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala, who has allowed her name to be disclosed, became  
the first person to utilize the federal law when, in late 1995, she 
sued Morrison and James Crawford, alleging they raped her in a 
dormitory room. She did not report the alleged rape for several 
months. No criminal charges were filed against the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison and Crawford challenged the constitutionality of the  
provision letting rape victims sue their attackers, and a federal 
judge in Virginia ruled for them. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
reinstated Brzonkala's lawsuit. However, the full 4th Circuit Court 
ruled 7-4 last March that the provision was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the law's purpose ``unquestionably laudable,'' the  
appeals court nevertheless ruled that Congress ``sought to reach 
conduct quintessentially within the exclusive purview of the 
states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court relied heavily on a 1995 Supreme Court  
decision that struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which had 
made it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of any 
school. The justices said gun possession was insufficiently linked 
to interstate commerce and that the law usurped states' authority 
over such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration contends that Congress, in enacting  
the provision allowing federal lawsuits by rape victims, found that 
state justice systems were biased against such cases and ``treated 
women's complaints of rape, domestic abuse, and other acts of 
violence as trivial, exaggerated, untruthful or somehow the woman's 
own fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gender-motivated violence has ``a direct and substantial effect  
on interstate commerce,'' government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosman contended that the Supreme Court rejected a similar  
argument in the 1995 gun case, when backers of the Gun-Free School 
Zones Act argued that gun violence affected children's ability to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one states filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting  
the appeals by Ms. Brzonkala and the Clinton administration, saying 
the Violence Against Women Act ``does not interfere with state and 
local governmental efforts to address the problem of 
gender-motivated violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,  
Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, 
Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Mystery, Alaska' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The fanatical hockey players of Mystery, Alaska, a mythical  
Mudville where the path of glory is paved with ice, are watching a 
videotape of their next unlikely opponent, the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a brawl among the NHL stars drags on, one of the Mystery  
players offers a suggestion to help prepare for the game: ``Maybe 
we should fast-forward to the hockey part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only the makers of ``Mystery, Alaska'' had followed that cue.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery'' enters sudden death from the outset. The first  
two-thirds of this Cinderella-on-ice story drags its tail like a 
defenseman who's been on the rink for a full period without a 
breather. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of tedious melodrama, the movie comes alive only  
when the Rangers arrive for a bizarre open-air game against the 
home team. 
</P>
<P>
	How strange that the movie lumbers along so woodenly before  
then, considering it's the latest big-screen entry from 
small-screen scribe and producer David E. Kelley, this year's 
double Emmy winner for ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley co-wrote and co-produced the character-driven  
``Mystery,'' but there's little evidence of the sharp dialogue from 
his character-driven TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fine ensemble cast featuring Russell Crowe, Hank  
Azaria, Lolita Davidovich, Mary McCormack, Colm Meaney and Burt 
Reynolds as the patriarchal town judge and hockey coach. But 
there's just not much for them to sink their skates into. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was a sound one for the sort of eccentric  
characterizations Kelley excels at. Mystery, Alaska, a town of 633 
somewhere in the wastelands north of Fairbanks, lives for its 
Saturday hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
	The players enter their pond rink along a snaking ice trail to  
the reverential cheers of the fans. The town fathers painstakingly 
assess each player's performance. Schoolchildren gossip over who 
might get dumped from the team and what fresh young skater might be 
``going up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town catches the NHL's eye when an expatriate Mystery native  
(Azaria) lands an article in Sports Illustrated, hyperbolically 
stating that Mystery's players can skate with the best of the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	The league decides to dispatch the Rangers to Mystery for an  
exhibition game, bringing dreams of glory and terror of failure to 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if we lose this game 25-zip?'' Crowe, the town sheriff,  
asks Azaria. ``You brought back the one thing that could tear the 
heart out of this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the tumult of the Rangers' visit comes a spate of  
small-town problems. The mayor's wife is cheating on him with one 
of the hockey players. Crowe grapples with age as he's cut from the 
team in favor of a younger skater. A grocery clerk, one of the 
team's key players, is put on trial for shooting a corporate spy 
from retail behemoth Price World in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this is terribly interesting, though. The situations are  
milked excessively for what is little more than piffling drama, 
choking off the few humorous forays in the first part of the film, 
such as the team's method of punishment: Forcing a player to slide 
feet first into a snow bank wearing only a jockstrap. 
</P>
<P>
	The grocery shooting amounts to nothing more than a cheap device  
to show how far the town will go to rally 'round its team. Once the 
trial is over, the Price World scenario, which at first seemed 
integral to the small-town-vs.-outside-world plot, disappears 
through the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Roach, who directed the ``Austin Powers'' movies, seems lost  
in weak material early on with ``Mystery.'' He finally gets some 
action going about the time Crowe pulls Azaria over for driving a 
Zamboni under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a witty scene, Mystery's mayor conspires with Little Richard  
to sing an interminable version of the national anthem to keep the 
Rangers, unused to arctic weather, immobile. Little Richard then 
launches into ``O Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers'' star Mike Myers makes a funny appearance as a  
hockey commentator spouting such colorful sports babble as, ``If 
you don't play this game with a big heart and big bag of knuckles 
in front of the net, you don't got dinky-doo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, though, the movie is down 12-0 without much chance of  
catching up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery, Alaska,'' needed a heavier dose of the wit and oddity  
that characterized the small-screen ``Northern Exposure,'' set in 
fictional Cicely, Alaska, or Kelley's own ``Picket Fences.'' It's a 
mystery why a talent like Kelley couldn't deliver a big-league 
script. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery, Alaska,'' distributed by Buena Vista Pictures, is  
rated R.

<HEADLINE> Wife Loses Family in Hawaii Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- Bobbie Bailey told  
her husband, son and daughter-in-law she wouldn't be joining them 
on a sightseeing plane trip around the Big Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful of flying, Mrs. Bailey told the group to go on without  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	They never returned: Her loved ones were among 10 people killed  
in a fiery weekend crash high on Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	``I waved and told them `Bye,' and told them, `Now you guys be  
careful and have fun.''' Mrs. Bailey said Monday . ``They all had 
smiles on their faces, said `We will.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``So they left without me. And... they still left without me,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating what  
caused the Big Island Air twin-engine plane to smash nearly 2 miles 
up on the active volcano during Saturday's around-the-island tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park sifted through the  
wreckage of the Piper Navajo Chieftain plane early Monday, finding 
the 10th body amid the charred ruins of Hawaii's worst air tour 
disaster in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of seven NTSB specialists, covering every area from  
engineering to counseling, were involved in the investigation, said 
John Hammerschmidt of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency hoped to get two of investigators to the crash site  
Monday afternoon, but were stopped by poor weather conditions 9,800 
feet up the volcano. They were to try again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also involved in the probe are representatives of Piper Aircraft  
Co., which manufactures the plane, and Lycoming Corp., which makes 
the plane's engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was not carrying a flight data recorder since federal  
law does not require one for sightseeing planes, Hammerschmidt 
said. A global positioning system onboard might contain some useful 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed included David Bailey Sr., 55; David Bailey Jr.,  
27; and his wife, Dana, 26. All three were from San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Other victims identified so far include pilot Dennis O'Leary, of  
Kentucky; Wade Abac of Hawaii; Hank Risley, 53, who ran New 
Hampshire's prison system; and Risley's stepmother, Norah Risley, 
71. 
</P>
<P>
	Touring the islands by air is a popular way to see breathtaking  
waterfalls, lava-spewing volcanoes and other spectacular sites too 
remote or dangerous to be seen by the car or on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash seemed to have little effect Monday on the air tour  
industry, which provides rides to 400,000 people a year in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had one cancellation due to that,'' said Wendy Hart  
of Island Hoppers, which offers nine daily plane tours. ``We've had 
questions, but no cancellations.''

<HEADLINE> B&AMP;W Professes Love for Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The folks who brought you Kools,  
Carltons, Lucky Strikes have something they wish to confess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., are in love with  
you,'' a male voice gushes on a toll-free number listed on packages 
of Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a giant corporation and you make us feel like a little  
kitten,'' the voice continues, as soft piano music swells toward a 
crescendo. ``Thank you, lover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callers -- they must be at least 21 -- are then invited to sign up  
for Brown &AMP; Williamson's mailing list, speak to a company 
representative or get information about stores selling B&AMP;W 
cigarettes in their area. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry critics warned consumers Monday not to embrace  
the smoky overture. They say the nation's third-largest tobacco 
company is only after more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a cigarette company wants to endear itself to  
anybody, you have to beware,'' said Ahron Leichtman, executive 
director for Citizens for a Tobacco-free Society, based in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really ludicrous that any cigarette company would attempt  
to befriend their customers by telling them how much they love 
them, when in fact what they love about the customer is that he or 
she is going to become addicted to a product for the rest of their 
lives,'' Leichtman said. 
</P>
<P>
	B&AMP;W spokesman Joe Helewicz said the company wanted to have fun  
with the number, which connects callers to the consumer-information 
center at its Louisville headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You call an 800 number and it's kind of cold,'' Helewicz said.  
``We're just trying to do something that's a little different. We 
do have a sense of humor, contrary to what people in the outside 
world think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The line was installed six weeks ago and will continue for  
another couple of weeks. Brown &AMP; Williamson won't say how many 
people have called, but considers the marketing pitch a success. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was concocted months ago when B&AMP;W employees discussed  
ways to be more responsive to callers, while mixing in 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not come up with something a little different from the  
usual boring, mundane, bureaucratic message,'' Brown &AMP; Williamson 
spokesman Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Carol Birgmann, executive director of Kentucky ACTION, a  
tobacco prevention and control coalition, said the number was a 
marketing ploy to skirt restrictions on advertising to those under 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no accountability,'' she said. ``Clearly it's a  
desperate attempt by a desperate company that's looking for ways to 
continue their name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recorded message, while proclaiming its love for B&AMP;W  
consumers, also uses the line to take a swipe at its competitors. 
``By the way, the other tobacco companies hate you and think you're 
ugly,'' the voice says. ``They told us so.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Y2K Readiness Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Russia already on the economic edge could be  
heading for more woes on New Year's Day when Y2K-related problems 
are likely to cause power and telecommunications failures, U.S. 
officials said at a Senate hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., an expert on Russian defense  
operations, also told the special Senate panel on the Y2K problem 
that while the chances of an accidental Russian missile launch are 
almost non-existent, computer problems could further compound 
deterioration of Russia's incoming missile early warning system. 
Y2K could also impede Russia's efforts to secure its nuclear 
stockpile from intrusions and other potential threats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are advising U.S. citizens who will be in Russia over the  
millennial transition to be prepared for possible disruptions, 
especially in key sectors like electricity, heat and 
telecommunications,'' said John R. Beyrle, a State Department 
expert on the New Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to home, lawmakers and health care experts don't know  
whether the hospitals, doctors and nursing homes that provide 
services to the 39 million Americans under Medicare benefits have 
come to grips with the year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain deeply concerned that many providers still do not  
appear to be doing all that they must to prepare for the year 
2000,'' Gary Christoph, chief information officer of the Health 
Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, said at a 
House hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook is alarming,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee monitoring the 
Y2K computer issue. As of last week, he said, less than 2 percent 
of the 230,000 hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other health 
care providers who submit claims to Medicare had tested their 
computer systems with Medicare contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said HCFA has completed its efforts to assure that all  
its internal computer systems are Y2K-compliant and there will be 
no interruptions in services from its end. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Brown, chairman of the board of trustees of the American  
Hospital Association, also said hospitals had spent $8 billion to 
upgrade their computers and will be ready for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the concern is that thousands of physicians, nursing homes  
and small inner-city and rural hospitals either have not addressed 
the problem or haven't tested their systems to make sure they will 
work on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Until tests are carried out, said Joel Willemssen of the General  
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, ``the ability 
of these entities to process Medicare claims in a future date 
environment is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel that follows Y2K developments came to a similar  
conclusion in a report last week on Y2K status 100 days before the 
new millennium. It said that while HCFA and most large hospitals 
are doing well, there was real concern that doctors and smaller 
health care centers weren't making adequate preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits in a year,  
raising the possibility that they will be unable to differentiate 
2000 from 1900. That could cause malfunctions and breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said all Medicare managed care organizations are  
required to certify that their systems will perform into the new 
millennium, but reviews of the contingency plans for national 
chains indicate that while 50 percent are reasonable or in need of 
minor improvements, the other 50 percent need major improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 7 million in Medicare HMO programs require  
preauthorization for specialty care, said Joseph R. Baker of the 
Medicare Rights Center. Computer breakdowns could mean that these 
people can't get the care they need, ``with potentially devastating 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Whitney Addington, president of the American College of  
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, said doctors have 
a high level of Y2K awareness and many have taken corrective 
measures. But few have tested their systems, he said, and this 
could lead to a ``last minute 'debugging' demand that could 
overwhelm available resources.''

<HEADLINE> Gehry To Deisgn New Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Architect Frank O. Gehry, who designed the  
ultramodern Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain, has been hired 
again by Guggenheim, this time for a dramatic new building here. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry has designed a building that rises about 45 stories out of  
a cloud-like shape, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing an 
internal Guggenheim memo and unidentified officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The structure would be on a platform above piers along the East  
River near Wall Street in lower Manhattan and include exhibition 
space, a theater and a skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is one of nine the city is considering for the  
site; a decision is expected within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum and city officials wouldn't comment on the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Gehry designed the $100 million Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. Its  
big plunging, curved forms are considered one of the world's most 
important works of contemporary architecture.

<HEADLINE> Article Spurs Medical Journal Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An article in the current New England Journal of  
Medicine that praises two popular baldness medicines was written by 
a doctor who has served as a paid consultant to the drugs' makers, 
highlighting questions about conflicts of interest in journal 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Vera H. Price, who concludes that the ``treatment of hair  
loss has been advanced'' by the drugs Rogaine and Propecia, 
disclosed her previous positions with the drug manufacturers to 
journal editors when they invited her to write the review article. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers were not told of the affiliation.  
</P>
<P>
	Editor-in-chief Dr. Marcia Angell maintains the publication has  
``the most stringent conflict-of-interest policy'' of any medical 
journal in the country, prohibiting review authors like Price 
``from having any financial connection with a company that benefits 
from a drug or device discussed in the editorial or review 
article.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Angell acknowledged the policy's language is open to  
interpretation by editors, barring authors who have ``current, 
recent past, or planned future financial associations'' with 
companies that could gain from a positive plug. 
</P>
<P>
	``How recent is recent? ... There are adjectives in this  
statement that necessarily involve some measure of judgment,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers are not told of an author's past affiliations with drug  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	That raises questions about one of the nation's most  
well-respected medical publications, said Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts 
University professor of environmental policy who has studied 
journal conflict-of-interest policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they print the article -- but don't print the disclosure --  
one could say they don't have the most stringent policy,'' he said. 
``It's certainly something readers and other scientists would want 
to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angell said Price's affiliations with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.,  
the maker of Rogaine, and Merck &AMP; Co., which manufactures Propecia, 
were not ``relevant'' and did not merit disclosure to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's office said she was out of the country and could not be  
reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Moved by Forgiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after confessing to sin and apologizing  
for scandal, President Clinton said today he has been profoundly 
moved ``by the pure power of grace'' and forgiveness from his 
family, associates and American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one of the most difficult years in my life,''  
Clinton told ministers gathered at the White House for Clinton's 
annual prayer breakfast. ``This occasion, because of what it has 
come to mean to me, was a very difficult one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same event last September, a moist-eyed Clinton  
apologized for the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-cover-up scandal that 
later led to his impeachment in the House and acquittal in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned. ... I have repented,'' he said then.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton thanked people he said have helped him over the  
past year, including three ministers who have kept a promise to 
meet with him ``both to help me and to hold me accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A somber Clinton lowered his voice and bowed his head at the  
lectern to address the Lewinsky scandal. The audience of about 130 
listened quietly. Some nodded their heads as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to say only this about that,'' Clinton said,  
without naming Ms. Lewinsky. ``I have been profoundly moved as few 
people have by the pure power of grace. Unmerited forgiveness 
through grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He owes thanks, he said, ``most of all to my wife and daughter,  
but to the people I work with, to the legions of American people 
and to the God in whom I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers of all faiths, many in traditional robes, applauded as  
Clinton concluded: ``I am very grateful to all of you who had any 
role in that.''

<P>
	At last year's breakfast, Clinton said his sorrow extended  
beyond his family, friends, staff and Cabinet to Ms. Lewinsky and 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time he had expressed any remorse for his  
affair with the former White House intern not half his age. He 
admitted he had a problem and promised to seek ``pastoral support'' 
and help from others. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the president also called on religious leaders to help  
America combat violence and gun deaths. He said that 13 children 
die every day in America from guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``If America is to be good, at least according to my faith, we  
must do more to prevent and overcome evil with good,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that the faith community can play a major role  
in protecting our children from violence, in supporting commonsense 
gun legislation, in participating in our campaign against youth 
violence, in forming community partnerships to identify and 
intervene in the lives of people before it is too late,'' Clinton 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged the House to approve Senate-passed legislation  
expanding the government's power to pursue perpetrators of hate 
crimes. The measure would add sexual orientation, gender and 
disability to the categories protected under federal hate-crime 
law. Currently, the law only covers race, color, religion or 
national origin.

<HEADLINE> Gehry To Design New Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Architect Frank O. Gehry, who designed the  
ultramodern Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain, has been hired 
again by Guggenheim, this time for a dramatic new building here. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry has designed a building that rises about 45 stories out of  
a cloud-like shape, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing an 
internal Guggenheim memo and unidentified officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The structure would be on a platform above piers along the East  
River near Wall Street in lower Manhattan and include exhibition 
space, a theater and a skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is one of nine the city is considering for the  
site; a decision is expected within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum and city officials wouldn't comment on the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Gehry designed the $100 million Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. Its  
big plunging, curved forms are considered one of the world's most 
important works of contemporary architecture.

<HEADLINE> European Noise Rule End Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House asked the transportation and  
commerce secretaries on Monday to do all they can to rescind a 
European Union regulation that could ban many U.S. aircraft from 
landing or taking from European airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation would ban any aircraft equipped with engine  
mufflers known as ``hush kits'' or engines altered to reduce air 
noise. EU officials contend that while reducing noise pollution, 
the kits are ineffective at controlling pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the House called the regulation a  
discriminatory, anti-American trade action thinly disguised as 
environmental protection. The EU restriction would apply only to 
American airliners, although they in some cases are quieter than 
their European counterparts, the said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the House resolution, approved 402-2, said that if  
the regulation is allowed to go into effect, the restriction could 
cost U.S. industry $1 billion in sales of spare parts and engines 
and reduce the resale value of more than 1,600 U.S. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has threatened to retaliate by imposing a U.S. flight  
ban on the noisy Concorde jetliner, the pride of European aviation 
and the world's only supersonic passenger jet.

<HEADLINE> Dole Promises To Rebuild Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole promises to rebuild the  
military, develop a defensive missile system and, when necessary, 
have America act alone when force must be used in the world's 
trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, in the third foreign-policy address of her Republican  
presidential campaign, said the Clinton administration seems to 
think ``the United States should act only in concert with its 
allies and can only use force if it is authorized by international 
organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said that will change if she is elected president.  
</P>
<P>
	``When it is necessary to act, we will build coalitions with our  
friends and allies,'' Dole said Monday. ``But, if necessary, we 
will act alone. In short, America will be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told a standing-room crowd of about 800 people at the  
College of Charleston that America will be strong ``because peace 
and security can only endure through strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership, strength and resolve have been sadly lacking''  
under the Clinton administration, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The themes were similar to those Texas Gov. George W. Bush  
touched on during a speech last week across town at The Citadel, 
South Carolina's military college. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican hopefuls have been campaigning in the state in  
advance of South Carolina's first-in-the-South Republican primary 
on Feb. 19. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was to campaign here today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's three-day swing through the Carolinas included a Sunday  
night fund-raising stop in Myrtle Beach, a fund-raiser in 
Charleston and stops today in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Her South Carolina campaign also announced the addition of  
Lexington County business executive Scott Malyerck, a state 
organizer for former Vice President Dan Quayle, who withdrew from 
the presidential race Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	During her campaign stops, Dole promised to develop defensive  
missile systems that can be used to protect the nation or in battle 
areas. She would end the United States' adherence to the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which she said was outdated and 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said last week he would create an antiballistic missile  
system and spend an additional $20 billion on researching new 
weapons systems. Dole, however, did not mention specific spending 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have the money to do that,'' she said later. ``There are  
surpluses on the operating side. You've got to set your priorities 
as to what you feel is most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said cutting wasteful government spending and privatizing  
some government services also could provide money. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole promised to improve security at the nation's weapons labs  
and said she opposed making the United States a party to the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which she said was neither effective 
nor verifiable. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dole administration would forge stronger relations with major  
powers, open China to American trade and ``treat authoritarian and 
totalitarian states such as North Korea as rogue regimes, not as 
our equals,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, asked where she differed with Bush on defense policy,  
replied, ``I think I would focus on where we differ with the 
Clinton-Gore administration.''

<HEADLINE> Bride Fatally Shot by Ex-Boyfriend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- A man accused of killing his  
ex-girlfriend on her wedding day can't remember much of the 
incident and says he was jumped at her home by wedding guests, 
according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't remember the gun going off,'' attorney Fernando  
Oliver said of Agustin Garcia, who pleaded innocent Monday to 
killing Gladys Ricart. Oliver said he may argue Garcia acted in 
self-defense and is also considering an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Monday, prosecutor James Santulli called Garcia ``a  
desperate, desperate man,'' and said his office may seek the death 
penalty. Garcia was held on $5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricart, a 39-year-old New York City accountant, was to marry  
James Preston Jr., 36, on Sunday. The couple met a few months after 
Ms. Ricart ended a seven-year relationship with Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in her wedding gown with a lacy top and a shining tiara,  
Ms. Ricart had posed for photographs in her front yard with nine 
bridesmaids, waving to neighbor Janet Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looked absolutely gorgeous, radiant,'' Donnelly said.  
``Five minutes later, she's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At about 4 p.m., shortly before the wedding, Garcia walked into  
Ms. Ricart's living room wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, 
telling guests he was invited, Santulli said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulled a .38-caliber revolver from the briefcase and shot Ms.  
Ricart twice in front of her 20-year-old son and other relatives, 
Santulli said. Garcia's gun fired three additional times, including 
one shot that hit Ms. Ricart after her brother wrestled him to the 
floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ricart died of gunshot wounds to the head, spine and upper  
arm. Her fiance was waiting for her at a Flushing, N.Y., church 
when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said that Garcia, 47, of North Bergen, N.J., was ``jumped  
by a lot of people'' when he walked inside Ms. Ricart's home and 
had not come to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and authorities said Garcia was abusive and violent,  
and had stalked Ms. Ricart after she ended their relationship about 
nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody liked him,'' said Donnelly, 48. ``The son absolutely  
hated him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her engagement, Ms. Ricart had been communicating with  
Garcia ``trying to turn him around,'' friend Joseph Bongiovanni 
said. Oliver said Garcia and Ms. Ricart had spent last weekend 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Preston, ``she finally found happiness,''  
Bongiovanni said Monday as he looked toward the empty house where 
Ms. Ricart had lived with her mother and son, its railings still 
decorated with white wedding flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he wasn't going to let her go,'' Bongiovanni said of  
Garcia. ``The bastard should rot in hell, I'm telling you. He took 
a beautiful life.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 56.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today as the  
markets were unable to sustain Monday's timid rally. Technology and 
Internet stocks were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 56.67 at 10,246.72. 
</P>
<P>
	yesterday, the Dow rose 24.06 to 10,303.39, halting a four-day  
retreat as bargain-hunters entered the market. But the blue chip 
index finished well below its highs of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 8.44 at 1,274.87, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
off 23.65 at 2,738.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a research group, today said consumer  
confidence dipped in September for a third consecutive month, 
although forecasters expected a moderate increase. The report may 
indicate consumer spending may be slowing, and thus, reduce the 
need for the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates to cool of the 
economy. The Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee meets next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer confidence report did little to move the  
markets, probably because most analysts expect the Fed to leave 
interest rates alone for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, whose recent weakness was a factor in the market's  
big decline last week, has held steady against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, off 1 1/16 to 77 1/8, and Microsoft, off 7/8 to 90 9/16,  
helped depress technology issues today. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 105.28 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 1.63 at 420.23.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.0 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.85 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.93 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> Billy Crystal Buys Mantle's Glove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Billy Crystal once wanted to be Mickey Mantle.  
Now, at least, he's got the glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal bought one of Mantle's old gloves at a Sotheby's auction  
of baseball memorabilia Monday for $239,000, far exceeding its 
pre-sale estimate of $10,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees legend wore the glove around 1960.  
</P>
<P>
	At an unveiling of a red granite monument to honor Mantle in  
1996, Crystal recalled how as a 9-year-old boy in 1956 he watched 
in awe as Mantle blasted a home run off the right-field facade at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That day,'' Crystal said, ``I knew I wanted to play baseball.  
I wanted to be Mickey Mantle.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Use of DNA Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department advisory panel warns  
police officers collecting DNA evidence to wear gloves, avoid 
sneezing on the sample and keep it in new paper bags or envelopes, 
not plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic bags retain moisture, which could damage cells of human  
tissue containing DNA genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence also urged  
federal and state prosecutors Monday to agree to and pay for DNA 
tests that could exonerate convicts, even if the deadline for 
appeals has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission of prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, police  
executives, forensic scientists and academics was set up last year 
at the request of Attorney General Janet Reno. It issued its first 
recommendations Monday in two publications: a pamphlet for police 
officers and a 117-page book for prosecutors, defense attorneys, 
judges and lab directors titled ``Postconviction DNA Testing: 
Recommendations for Handling Requests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Attorney General Ray Fisher said his department's  
research arm, the National Institute of Justice, would distribute 
the pamphlet to every police officer in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The pamphlet, ``What Every Law Enforcement Officer Should Know  
About DNA Evidence,'' also lists places where such evidence can be 
found: hats, dirty laundry, toothpicks, used cigarettes, licked 
stamps, pillow cases, even baseball bat handles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the widespread dissemination of this pamphlet starts us  
down a path toward eliminating the need for the other publication 
on how to deal with postconviction DNA test requests,'' Fisher told 
a commission meeting. ``By committing ourselves to more accurate 
and effective investigative processes through the use of DNA 
technology, we work toward elimination of the real tragedy of 
wrongful convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the Justice Department now knows of 65 people  
wrongly convicted and later exonerated by DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA, an acid that contains an individual's genetic makeup, is  
found in almost every cell in the body. Except for identical twins, 
each person's DNA is unique and can be used for identification, and 
it often can be found where no fingerprints are left. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing number of convictions overturned by DNA evidence has  
weakened the legal presumption that verdicts are correct, the panel 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Time limits were imposed on federal and state appeals because,  
as the memory of witnesses fades, ``questions of guilt or innocence 
become more uncertain with the passage of time,'' the panel wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the results of DNA testing do not become weaker over time.  
... To the contrary, the probative value of DNA testing has been 
steadily increasing as technological advances and growing databases 
amplify the ability to identify perpetrators and eliminate 
suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommended that requests for DNA tests after  
conviction be divided into one of five categories, ranging from 
those that clearly could exonerate a convict to totally frivolous 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a request that clearly could exonerate a convict, the  
prosecutor should join the defense attorney in requesting tests and 
pay for them if the convict is cleared, the panel recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two states, New York and Illinois, have passed laws  
specifically authorizing late appeals based on DNA tests. The panel 
said if the time for appeals based on new evidence has expired, 
both sides may agree to waive the time limit or the judge can use 
inherent powers ``to prevent what may be a miscarriage of 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's findings are recommendations and have no force  
of law.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Check Atlanta Games Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee will look into  
a report that some of its members were offered special perks during 
Atlanta's successful bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, submitted to Congress by former Attorney General  
Griffin Bell, detailed lavish gifts, travel, college scholarships, 
job assistance and other perks offered to IOC members and their 
families by the Atlanta bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission, set up after the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal, said Monday it would study the report. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report was sent last week to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch after he asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to 
provide details on any abuses related to the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the report showed there was a  
``culture of corruption'' in the bid process and that ``clearly, 
votes were for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in connection  
with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC members and their relatives 
received $1.2 million worth of cash payments, college scholarships 
and other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the chairman of the  
eight-man ethics panel, IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, a former 
vice president of the World Court at The Hague, would examine the 
Atlanta report. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mbaye finds ``anything meaningful,'' he will submit the  
information to the full commission for review, Servan-Schreiber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the IOC is serious about reforms and the ethical  
practice of its members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IOC received a letter from Upton last  
Friday requesting Samaranch to testify at a House hearing on the 
Atlanta bid excesses Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The House commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation  
has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to appear 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at a Senate hearing in April  
prompted by the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said Samaranch was traveling and had not yet  
replied to Upton. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ethics panel dropped its inquiry into the conduct  
of Finnish IOC member Peter Tallberg related to Sydney's winning 
bid for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg, who denied any wrongdoing, had been under scrutiny for  
allegedly asking a Sydney bid official for help in getting his son 
a temporary job in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said the panel dropped the case on grounds that the  
Sydney official was a long-time friend of Tallberg's and the 
request was unrelated to the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel asked for more information on the only other  
pending case against an IOC member. The member, who has not been 
identified, was accused of making sexual advances toward a member 
of Cape Town's unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission, which also finalized its procedural rules  
Monday, is composed of three IOC members and five from outside the 
IOC. The outside members include former U.S. Senate Republican 
leader Howard Baker and former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez 
de Cuellar.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Sheds Components Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Siemens AG said today it has agreed to  
sell its electromechanical components business to Tyco 
International Ltd. for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction, which is still subject to antitrust approval,  
completes Siemens' plan to leave the components business. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens chief financial officer Heinz-Joachim Neubuerger said  
Tyco was the most suitable of more than 40 bidders for the 
electromechanical components business, which has 12,400 employees 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, based in Exeter, N.H., is the world's largest maker of  
electrical and electronic components. It expects 1999 sales over 
$22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a press release Tuesday that it sees ``a  
significant immediate positive impact to earnings'' from the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Siemens Electromechanical Components had sales of  
$806 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Neubuerger said he expects the sale to Tyco to be closed by the  
second quarter of fiscal 2000.

<HEADLINE> Visitation Rights To Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether grandparents are entitled to visitation rights to their 
grandchildren when the children's parents object. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will use a case from Washington state to  
make their first venture into the area of ``grandparents' rights.'' 
All 50 states have some type of law allowing court-ordered 
visitation for grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's highest court struck down its state law, ruling  
that only parents are entitled to court-enforced visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Most such state laws were enacted by the early 1990s, and the  
Supreme Court repeatedly has turned away requests to review them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the justices rejected challenges to  
grandparent-visitation laws in Kentucky and Wisconsin. But in 1995, 
the court let stand a state court's ruling that struck down a 
Georgia law allowing grandparents to win such access to their 
grandchildren over parents' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Washington case acted on today, Gary and Jenifer Troxel  
of Anacortes, Wash., are seeking visitation rights to their young 
granddaughters, Natalie and Isabelle, over the objections of the 
girls' mother, Tommie Granville Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Brad Troxel and Tommie Granville, who were never married, had  
two daughters during their relationship. When they separated, 
Troxel lived with his parents. The girls regularly visited their 
father at their paternal grandparents' home. 
</P>
<P>
	After Troxel's death, the girls continued visiting their  
grandparents regularly but their mother then sought to limit their 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1993, the Troxels went into state court to obtain  
enforceable visitation rights, and in 1995 were awarded visitation 
one weekend each month, one week during the summer and four hours 
on the girls' birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	While Granville appealed, she married Kelly Wynn. He then  
adopted Natalie and Isabelle. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court and the Washington Supreme Court ruled  
against the grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have a right to limit visitation of their children  
with third persons,'' the state Supreme Court said in its decision 
Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family entity is the core element upon which modern  
civilization is founded. ... A parent's constitutionally protected 
right to rear his or her children without state interference has 
been recognized as a fundamental liberty interest ... and also as a 
fundamental right derived from the privacy rights inherent in the 
Constitution,'' the state court said. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that the Washington law gave ``any person'' the right  
to petition for visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that in certain circumstances where a child has  
enjoyed a substantial relationship with a third person, arbitrarily 
depriving the child of the relationship could cause severe 
psychological harm to the child,'' the state court said. But it 
said the state law's lack of safeguards could do too much damage to 
stable families in which one or both parents are found to be fit. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Troxel vs. Granville, 99-138.

<HEADLINE> Wife Loses Family in Hawaii Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- Bobbie Bailey told  
her husband, son and daughter-in-law she wouldn't be joining them 
on a sightseeing plane trip around the Big Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful of flying, Mrs. Bailey told the group to go on without  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	They never returned: Her loved ones were among 10 people killed  
in a fiery weekend crash high on Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	``I waved and told them `Bye,' and told them, `Now, you guys be  
careful and have fun.''' Mrs. Bailey said Monday . ``They all had 
smiles on their faces, said `We will.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``So they left without me. And ... they still left without me,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating what  
caused the Big Island Air twin-engine plane to smash nearly 2 miles 
up on the active volcano during Saturday's around-the-island tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park sifted through the  
wreckage of the Piper Navajo Chieftain plane early Monday, finding 
the 10th body amid the charred ruins of Hawaii's worst air tour 
disaster in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of seven NTSB specialists, covering every area from  
engineering to counseling, were involved in the investigation, said 
John Hammerschmidt of the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency hoped to get two of investigators to the crash site  
Monday afternoon, but were stopped by poor weather 9,800 feet up 
the volcano. They were to try again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also involved in the probe are representatives of Piper Aircraft  
Co., which manufactures the plane, and Lycoming Corp., which makes 
the plane's engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was not carrying a flight data recorder since federal  
law does not require one for sightseeing planes, Hammerschmidt 
said. A global positioning system onboard might contain some useful 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed included David Bailey Sr., 55; David Bailey Jr.,  
27; and his wife, Dana, 26. All three were from San Jose, Calif. 
Bailey Sr. was vice president of San Jose-based Cybor Corp., an 
11-year-old private company selling chemical supplies like metering 
pumps and chemical dispensing cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other victims identified so far include pilot Dennis O'Leary, of  
Kentucky; Wade Abac of Hawaii; Hank Risley, 53, who ran New 
Hampshire's prison system; and Risley's stepmother, Norah Risley, 
71. 
</P>
<P>
	Touring the islands by air is a popular way to see breathtaking  
waterfalls, lava-spewing volcanoes and other spectacular sites too 
remote or dangerous to be seen by the car or on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash seemed to have little effect Monday on the air tour  
industry, which provides rides to 400,000 people a year in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had one cancellation due to that,'' said Wendy Hart  
of Island Hoppers, which offers nine daily plane tours. ``We've had 
questions, but no cancellations.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Victims Flood Phone Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 1,300 cancer patients called special  
phone numbers Tuesday to sign up for the first human trials of 
endostatin, an experimental drug that has been shown to shrink 
tumors in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 15 and 30 people will be selected.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a great breakthrough to begin the clinical  
trials,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal, spokesman for the American 
Cancer Society New England Division and a professor of medicine at 
Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer patients are always eager and hopeful for new news.  
This has been on the radar screen since almost a year and a half 
ago as one of the new major ways of treating cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search is being conducted by Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer  
Care, a collaboration of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 
Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital and 
the Beth Israel Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were looking for volunteers over age 17 with solid  
tumors who have not benefited from other treatment. Patients with 
leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma or primary brain tumors are not 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead researcher, Dr. Donald Kufe, cautioned that this is  
only the first phase -- to check for adverse side effects. However, 
researchers also will look for signs that the drug is halting 
progress of tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may take up to a year before we complete the study, and  
even then, only future studies can determine the effectiveness of 
the drug,'' Kufe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and a sister protein, angiostatin, work by destroying  
a tumor's ability to sprout new blood vessels. In research done by 
Dr. Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital, cancer went dormant or 
disappeared altogether in animals treated with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubts cropped up last fall when it was reported that scientists  
from the National Cancer Institute had not been able to reproduce 
Folkman's results. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in February, an NCI team said it had at least duplicated  
Folkman's work by conducting the experiments at Folkman's 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial tests are being sponsored by EntreMed Inc., a  
Maryland-based company that licensed the right to develop 
endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trials will be conducted at the University of Texas M.D.  
Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Wisconsin 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Fewer than 100 people are expected to 
receive the drug at the three locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Fewtrell, 34, has been adding to a file full of newspaper  
clippings about cancer treatments ever since she beat breast cancer 
two years ago. She has been avidly following news about endostatin, 
so the beginning of human trials is especially heartening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely gives us hope,'' Fewtrell said. ``I am a  
survivor, but God forbid one day I go to the doctor and I'm out of 
remission. This gives me hope that there is a chance I'll have many 
more tomorrows.''

<HEADLINE> Insect-Borne Outbreak Grows in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have tossed out their original  
diagnosis of a mosquito-borne ailment that has killed four people 
in the New York City region. Now they say it's a virus never before 
seen in this hemisphere and that birds flying south may have spread 
it to a far wider geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in one New Jersey county started spraying  
mosquitoes today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven people have tested positive for the West Nile-like  
virus, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and state health officials said 
Monday. Many patients -- including the four who died -- original were 
thought to have St. Louis encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reclassified the  
cases as West Nile-like fever, which is usually found in Africa and 
Asia. It's called West Nile-''like'' because scientists have not 
yet identified it with certainty. The disease's symptoms -- fever 
and headache -- are similar to those of St. Louis encephalitis but 
are generally milder. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and  
death. The elderly, young and anyone with a weakened immune system 
are most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a question of two very, very rare diseases, and there  
was just some confusion about it,'' Giuliani said. ``If anything, 
the disease we're dealing with now is somewhat less severe than the 
one we were dealing with before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, it may exist in a far wider geographic region that  
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on the level of New York City anymore,'' state Health  
Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello said Monday. ``It's on the level 
of New York state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strain probably entered the United States in infected birds,  
said Dr. Ned Hayes, a CDC epidemiologist, 
</P>
<P>
	People contract the virus from mosquitoes that have bitten  
infected birds, and there is concern that migrating birds may 
already have carried the virus south. 
</P>
<P>
	``These viruses do travel with birds, and bird migration has  
been in process now for a better part of the month,'' Dr. Duane 
Gubler, director of the CDC's division of vector-borne infectious 
disease, told The New York Times. ``There is a good possibility 
that this virus has already been taken to areas further south. We 
are going to rethink our whole surveillance approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 520 dead birds have been found in the metropolitan  
region and nearby counties, Novello said. Four have tested positive 
for the West Nile-like virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Hudson County officials  
began using helicopters to spray insecticide early today in the 
Jersey City area. Mosquito control commissions in several other 
counties are spraying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	No trace of the virus has been found yet in New Jersey, but the  
state's Department of Health has sent about three dozen dead crows 
to a federal lab to be tested for evidence of the West Nile-like 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, the virus has been found in mosquitoes and a  
dead bird but not in people 
</P>
<P>
	New York City has been spraying pesticides for several weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	In Westchester County, immediately north of New York City,  
officials on Monday announced the county's first death in the 
outbreak -- a woman in her 60s who died about two weeks ago -- and 
said the number of confirmed cases had doubled to eight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau County, east of the city on Long Island, four people  
have tested positive for the virus, Novello said. No deaths have 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists got their first hint that St. Louis encephalitis  
might be a misdiagnosis when a number of birds in and near the 
Bronx Zoo died and tested positive for West Nile-like fever.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ridicules Reagan's Biographer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Bush rejects an author's  
claim that the Bushes were unwelcome ``upstairs'' in the Reagan 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous. Upstairs? I mean that's a kind of English,  
upstairs-and-downstairs approach to life,'' Bush said in an 
interview aired today on NBC's ``Today.'' ``I don't even use the 
terminology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' Edmund Morris writes of  
a Christmas Eve 1988 conversation he said he had with Bush and wife 
Barbara, a month before Bush would become president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love that guy, he's such a terrific fellow,'' Bush is  
quoted as saying about the man he had served as vice president. 
Morris then quotes Bush as commenting about Reagan and his wife, 
Nancy: ``I kinda wished they'd shown -- 'y'know, a little 
appreciation. Didn't seem to want us upstairs in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in the NBC interview that he never felt unappreciated.  
``Ronald Reagan had and Nancy had friends that were closer friends 
than the Bushes. ... We never felt we were unwelcome some place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Morris' characterization of Reagan as an ``airhead,''  
Bush said: ``That is brutal and grossly unfair and untrue. ... I 
just find that outrageous, outrageous and grossly mean and 
unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his working relationship with Reagan was ``heaven,  
total access, a totally relaxed relationship. From my point of view 
I couldn't have asked for a better mentor. He was a joy to work 
with.''

<HEADLINE> Amends Eyed for False Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- How do the innocent collect when they are released  
from prison after spending years behind bars for crimes they didn't 
commit? 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, they sue for reparations. In California and  
Massachusetts, they petition lawmakers for relief. But what they're 
paid differs wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill before Massachusetts lawmakers proposes an examination of  
how the state should make amends. Rather than leave monetary 
judgments to a jury or the Legislature, Rep. Thomas P. Kennedy has 
proposed establishing a commission to investigate and recommend 
possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians say the system must compensate victims of its  
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that when there's been a miscarriage of justice, the  
state does owe the person who has been harmed,'' said Norma 
Shapiro, an American Civil Liberties Union legislative specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the idea of a public policy for compensating former convicts  
has raised concerns. Michael Sullivan, president of the 
Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, said payments 
shouldn't be made to those freed on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should really be truly set up and only considered for those  
that are clearly innocent and wrongly accused, charged, convicted 
and sentenced,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen states, the District of Columbia and the federal  
government have statutes addressing compensation for those wrongly 
imprisoned, according to an article in a recent publication of the 
American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Two states -- New York and West Virginia -- do not limit damages.  
Elsewhere, caps range up to $300,000, while the federal limit is 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	California, for example, allows up to $10,000, which former  
Marine Kevin Lee Green received after spending 17 years in prison 
after being convicted of beating his wife and killing their unborn 
child. Citing DNA evidence, a judge ruled in 1996 that Green did 
not commit the crime; earlier this year, the actual killer was 
convicted after confessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Green is appealing to lawmakers to pass a bill that would give  
him $650,000, equivalent to about $100 a day for every day he spent 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you compensate for that kind of time?'' Green said.  
``For the things I missed that I can't get back?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU's Shapiro said people like Green often lack political  
clout or the money to win their fight for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have only just begun to recognize that those who have been  
wrongly convicted are also victims,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants More Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said today  
the Clinton administration still hopes stalled Israeli-Syrian and 
Israeli-Lebanese peace talks can be restarted although obstacles to 
an overall peace remain daunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here is whether we can find the way to restart  
negotiations that will match the will that all sides profess to 
feel,'' she told an audience of leaders of Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright suggested that both Israel and Syria, in particular,  
``clearly want to find a way forward. Both are treating the other 
with unusual trust and respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also denounced congressional efforts to slash foreign  
aid, saying a spending bill in Congress that would cut $2 billion 
from President Clinton's budget remains a veto candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diplomacy is America's first line of defense,'' Albright said.  
``It should be treated as a budget priority,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as an aside, she added, ``I have eliminated the words  
'foreign aid' from our vocabulary. These two words don't seem to 
excite a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $12.6 billion bill makes deep cuts in many international  
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is unhappy that negotiators rejected its  
request to provide funds for carrying out the Wye River Middle East 
peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has Congress ignored the administration's request for  
at least $500 million for Israel and the Palestinians to carry out 
the accords in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, but foreign aid 
negotiators also cut $100 million that had been promised to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The final version of the bill has been held up over a  
House-Senate dispute over an unrelated provision denying U.S. funds 
to international family-planning programs that support or advocate 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, here for the two-week opening session of the U.N.  
General Assembly, made a breakfast address to the Conference of 
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	She expressed optimism for peace talks, not only those between  
the Israelis and the Palestinians, but also efforts to resume 
Israel's suspended negotiations with Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has met in New York, on the sidelines of the U.N.  
meetings, with the foreign ministers of both Syria and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters  
after his meeting with Albright that any efforts to link wider 
Mideast peace talks to progress made in resuming talks with Syria 
was ``not acceptable to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright today asserted that ``the key is to establish a basis  
on which to resume negotiations that neither side sees as 
prejudicing the negotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both she and Clinton will remain ``actively engaged with both  
sides,'' Albright said. ``If we did not think an agreement were 
possible, we would not be making the effort to bring them 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, sought  
to pressure Israel to make concessions by saying Arabs would not 
resume multilateral peace talks until Israel resumed negotiations 
with Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The multilateral talks were launched in 1992, covering such key  
issues as disarmament, Palestinian refugees, the environment and 
economic cooperation before being suspended in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levy said that whether the talks with Syria are resumed  
should have no bearing on the multilateral talks. 
</P>
<P>
	During a closed-door portion of today's meeting, Albright was  
questioned about the Egyptian position and told the audience she 
did not agree with it, said a senior administration official who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright urged that the multilateral talks go forward regardless  
of progress or lack of progress in other negotiations, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said that, during the closed session, the subject  
of new construction in West Bank Jewish settlements, a divisive 
issue in the Israeli-Palestinian talks, did not come up. Nor did 
Albright mention the settlements in her public remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took power July  
6, has called for the resumption of talks, Syria's insistence that 
the Golan Heights be returned first has placed new obstacles in the 
way of new talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golan Heights were captured from Syria in 1967.  
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the Clinton administration remains committed to  
working with the parties toward a comprehensive peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we cannot make the hard decisions that will produce peace  
itself,'' she added. ``Only those who live in the region can do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Black Stuntworkers Claim Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Minority stuntworkers are accusing Hollywood  
of discrimination, saying the industry is hiring whites to stand in 
for black actors such as Eddie Murphy, Samuel Jackson and Louis 
Gossett Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday, several stuntworkers asked viewers  
to boycott all Viacom products Oct. 8-10. Viacom owns CBS, MTV, 
VH-1 and Nickelodeon, as well as the Paramount studios and the 
Blockbuster chain of video-rental stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne King Jr., who doubled for Michael Jordan in ``Space Jam,''  
said he can count on one hand the number of days he's worked as a 
stuntman this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In industry parlance, a ``paint down'' refers to a white  
stuntworker who dons dark make-up and wigs to stand in for a 
minority actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have paint downs, you're taking jobs away from  
African-Americans,'' said Marvin Walters, a retired black stuntman. 
``I don't care what they say, this is discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest follows the criticism of TV networks for their  
largely white casting this season. The lack of roles for minorities 
in Hollywood has been a contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters estimated that of some 65 black stuntworkers in  
Hollywood, only 15 work on a regular basis. Walters said ``we hold 
SAG ultimately responsible,'' referring to the Screen Actors Guild, 
which represents nearly 96,000 actors, including stuntworkers, 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Moore, a SAG spokeswoman, said the guild has an  
aggressive diversity campaign and has published for the second year 
a directory called ``Stunt Performers of Color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters said a white stuntwoman stood in for the female Asian  
lead of CBS's ``Martial Law'' and complained over the hiring 
choices on Paramount's ``Shaft,'' a spin-off of the 1970s TV 
detective series. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Chris Ender said ``Martial Law'' star Kelly Hu has  
a regular Asian stuntwoman but that one time the woman didn't want 
to do a stunt where she had to fall off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaft'' director and producer John Singleton, who is black,  
said he simply ``hired the best people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Any allegations that anyone is being hired on a racial basis  
is unfounded, totally erroneous and very offensive to me,'' he said 
in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Study: Students Can't Write Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About three-fourths of the nation's school  
children demonstrated only partial mastery of the knowledge and 
skills needed to write proficiently for their grade level, the 
Education Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Testers asked 60,000 fourth-graders, eighth-graders and  
12th-graders to write stories, personal essays, reports about 
events or experiences and persuasive pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests and score levels were determined by the National  
Assessment Governing Board, a quasi-governmental body created by 
Congress to act as an independent judge of education standards, and 
the testing itself was undertaken by the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than three-fourths of the students showed at least  
a basic level of writing -- or partial mastery of the prerequisite 
knowledge and skills fundamental to proficient work at their grade 
level -- and roughly one-fourth of the students in each grade level 
were at least proficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings are important, because how well students write  
at the end of the 20th century is an indicator of how well they 
will be able to communicate and reason in the beginning of the 21st 
century,'' Gary Phillips, acting commissioner for the Education 
Department's National Center for Education Statistics, said in 
remarks prepared for the test results' release. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 23 percent of fourth-graders wrote at the proficient level  
or above, which meant -- in the testers' terms -- that they could 
deliver a solid academic performance and competently write about 
challenging subject matter. Eighty-four percent wrote at the basic 
level or above, and 16 percent were below the basic level. 
</P>
<P>
	For eighth-graders, 27 percent were at least proficient, 84  
percent were at least basic, and 16 percent were below basic. For 
12th-graders, 22 percent were proficient, 78 percent were basic and 
22 percent were below basic. 
</P>
<P>
	And in each grade group, 1 percent of students wrote at an  
advanced level, which signified a superior performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing, which took place in 1998, included students at both  
public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first national test of students' writing skills since  
1992, but the Board said the results could not be compared because 
the tests used a new methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, fourth-graders were asked to write about their  
favorite object and what they would find in a magic castle, 
eighth-graders about the arrival of a space ship and what they 
would like to see on public television, and 12th-graders a story 
related to a poem by Walt Whitman and their opinion about voter 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, students who wrote better were used to writing  
several drafts, had teachers who talked to them about writing and 
required them to use computers with their writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-five states, the District of Colombia and the Virgin  
Islands also tested an additional 100,000 eighth-grade public 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas and Wisconsin had the  
highest percentages of students writing at the proficient level. 
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina and Hawaii had the 
lowest percentages of students writing at the proficient level.

</P>
<P>
	12th-graders:  
</P>
<P>
	Your school is sponsoring a voter registration drive for  
18-year-old high school students. You and three of your friends are 
talking about the project. Your friends say the following. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 1: ``I'm working on the young voters' registration drive.  
Are you going to come to it and register? You're all 18, so you can 
do it. We're trying to help increase the number of young people who 
vote and it shouldn't be too hard -- I read that he percentage of 
18-to-20-year-olds who vote increased in recent years. We want that 
percentage to keep going up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 2: ``I'll be there. People should vote as soon as they  
turn 18. It's one of the responsibilities of living in a 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 3: ``I don't know if people should even bother to  
register. One vote in an elections isn't going to change 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Do you agree with friend 2 or 3? Write a response to your  
friends in which you explain whether you will or will not register 
to vote. Be sure to explain why and support your position with 
examples from your reading or experience. Try to convince the 
friend with whom you disagree that your position is the right one.

<HEADLINE> Redstone: Don't Offend Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- International news organizations should  
report the truth but avoid being ``unnecessarily offensive'' to 
foreign governments, the head of the company poised to take over 
CBS said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc.,  
were significant in light of Viacom's impending purchase of CBS and 
the venue -- a forum of global business leaders in China. 
</P>
<P>
	As they expand their global reach, media companies must be aware  
``of the politics and attitudes of the governments where we 
operate,'' Redstone said at a news conference at the Fortune Global 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalistic integrity must prevail in the final analysis,''  
he said. ``But that doesn't mean that journalistic integrity should 
be exercised in a way that is unnecessarily offensive to the 
countries in which you operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The communist government in Beijing has jailed domestic  
political critics and journalists. It tries to keep tight control 
on information and has tried to curb access to its media markets by 
foreign firms, especially those seen as unfriendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom -- whose $35 billion takeover of CBS will mark its entry  
into the news-gathering business -- has encountered resistance from 
Chinese regulators. Its MTV music video network has been relegated 
to secondary cable channels and poor time slots in many Chinese 
media markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine also has had recent troubles in China.  
</P>
<P>
	The news magazine -- whose parent company, Time Warner Inc.,  
organized the business forum -- has had its latest edition pulled 
from the international hotels in China where it is normally sold, a 
senior Time executive said. Although no reason was given, the issue 
contains articles written by exiled dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner chairman Gerald M. Levin, speaking at the  
conference, said the magazine ``raised some concerns'' within the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I don't necessarily agree with that, it's not going to  
change the conduct of our journalism or the nature of our business 
in China,'' said Levin, who appeared with Redstone at the gathering 
of 300 senior executives from foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Another Ali Readies for the Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Laila Ali's beauty and name is a  
one-two punch that can floor people in Hollywood. But the only 
place where Muhammad Ali's daughter wants to be a knockout is in 
the boxing ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to do something, I just do it,'' she said. ``I  
really don't care what anybody has to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali will make her professional debut Oct. 8 at Turning Stone  
Casino in upstate New York on a card featuring Donovan ``Razor'' 
Ruddock. Her opponent in the four-round bout will be April Fowler, 
who has an 0-1 record as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila couldn't resist imitating a bit of her father's famous  
rhyming for the 18 TV cameras and gaggle of photographers and 
reporters who came to see her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many expectations that I must meet, but there is  
only one promise that I can make. On October 8 in Verona, New York, 
April Fowler will suffer a painful defeat,'' she said, prompting 
laughter from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her father, who has Parkinson's Disease, hasn't decided  
whether to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father being at my fight would take a lot of the attention  
away from me and there will be a lot of media surrounding him,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also not going to be easy for him to watch me get into  
the ring. But whether he's there or not, I'm coming to the ring to 
do what I need to do and I'm serious about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her father and her mother, Veronica, Ali's third wife,  
are skeptical about her new profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want me to get hurt, but he's going to support me  
100 percent as a father,'' she said. ``My mother is not comfortable 
with me going into the ring, but she knows that I know what I'm 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Ali painted the worst possible picture of boxing for  
the second-youngest of his nine children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always wants to make sure that I know what I'm doing is not  
easy and you're going to get hit and bruised and the wind is going 
to get knocked out, but that's just my father,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always takes your mind to the worst possible scenario to  
see if you're going to still want to go forward with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila, 21, who runs her own nail salon in Los Angeles, decided a  
year ago that she wanted to box professionally after picking up the 
sport as a form of exercise. She's even sparred with her father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just love how it feels,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	And what about the danger involved?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get hit, I'm going to get my face swollen, it's  
going to happen,'' she said. ``I'm just going to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila's six-day-a-week training regimen involves running three  
to four miles, jumping rope, sparring and working on punching bags. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran so many miles that I have blisters on my feet,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her trainer, Dub Huntly, says Laila's best punch is a right hand  
into a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't compare myself to my father because we're two  
different people, but I know that because I am his daughter that I 
naturally have boxing skills that most people probably don't have 
when they start,'' she said. ``At the level that I'm at, I would 
rate myself as excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, she's just a beginner. Laila admits she isn't  
familiar with such other female fighters as Christy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad never had this much attention on him when he was first  
fighting,'' she said. ``It's a lot of pressure on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila was too young to see her father fight in person, but she's  
watched tapes of his bouts and says her favorite is Ali's knockout 
of George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``My footwork is very good like my father's. I'm also very  
strong and very confident,'' the 5-foot-10, 168-pounder said. ``My 
movement in the ring is just like my dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huntly said he trains Laila like he would any male boxer.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I get in the gym, I don't look at her as a lady, I look  
at her as a fighter,'' he said. ``She's mean and she's tough. She's 
not in it just for the money; she wants to be a champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Laila's corner is her boyfriend, Johnny McClain, a boxer  
himself. Like the elder Ali, he's not thrilled with Laila's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate it. It's real hard for me to watch every day,'' he  
said. ``I never wanted her to do it, but since she's going to, I've 
got to give her as much knowledge as I have and support her the 
best that I can.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Keeps Senior Tour at Dunes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Damage caused by Hurricane Floyd is  
keeping the Senior Tour Championship at the Dunes Golf and Beach 
Club, again this year instead of moving to the new TPC at Myrtle 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The season-ending event, scheduled for Nov. 4-7, was supposed to  
move to the new course this year. However, PGA Tour commissioner 
Tim Finchem said Tuesday there were too many trees down and too 
much flooding at the TPC to have it in tournament shape within six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The course lost about 200 trees and many bunkers were washed  
out. There was also damage to several greens, an 80-foot section of 
cart path and the drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem would have been getting those greens back  
into condition in such a short period of time to host a major 
championship,'' said Pete Davison, senior vice president and chief 
operating officer of PGA Tour Golf Properties, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Davison said the TPC course would close for a month for cleanup  
and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior championship moved to The Dunes in 1994. Hale Irwin  
is defending champion of the $2 million event, which is played by 
the tour's top 31 money winners.

<HEADLINE> FBI Veteran Heads China Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 21-year FBI veteran with a background in  
counterintelligence will head the task force conducting the 
bureau's newly broadened investigation into the alleged Chinese 
theft of secrets about a sophisticated nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI announced Tuesday that Stephen W. Dillard, currently  
head of its Jackson, Miss., office, has been selected as inspector 
in charge of the task force. The bureau said it is still deciding 
how many agents should be assigned to the probe of whether data 
about the miniature W-88 warhead and other weapons was taken from 
U.S. nuclear laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard, who has a law degree from Mississippi College School of  
Law, has served in the FBI's national security division at 
headquarters where he managed all foreign counterintelligence and 
counterespionage operations as chief of the global section. He also 
has served as assistant chief of the counterterrorism section, unit 
chief of the Russian section and unit chief of the counterterrorism 
section of that division. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard, who took over the task force Monday, also previously  
worked in the Kansas City, Washington and Salt Lake City field 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI broadened its investigation last week, after focusing  
for nearly four years on a scientist at the Los Alamos nuclear 
weapons lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said the expansion ``is in response  
to questions that have been raised in terms of new evidence. I 
think there may have been new facts brought to the attention of the 
FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has rejected any allegations of espionage.  
</P>
<P>
	Several outside panels have criticized the original probe for  
concentrating exclusively on Los Alamos and pointed out that many 
other government and industry people -- more than the FBI originally 
realized -- had access to the information that may have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical information about the miniature W-88 warhead ``had  
been widely available'' from numerous places in government and 
among private contractors ``and could have come from many 
organizations other than the weapons labs,'' a panel of the 
president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board concluded in a 
report in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A government official said the FBI will put more resources into  
the investigation and expand it beyond the Los Alamos laboratory, 
where the bureau's attention has been concentrated since early 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	More serious consideration will be given to other agencies or  
individuals as possible sources of the technical information that 
China is believed to have obtained in the 1980s, said the official, 
speaking on condition of not being further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a former Los Alamos computer scientist, Wen Ho  
Lee, who was fired in March for violating security rules, remains a 
suspect in the FBI's investigation, said another official, also 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not charged with a crime, he has been the prime -- some  
say virtually only -- target the FBI has pursued in the nearly 
four-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwan-born computer scientist who worked with the  
top-secret weapons design team at Los Alamos since the late 1970s, 
has denied giving any secrets to China and has accused the 
government of singling him out because he is Chinese-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Government sources familiar with the investigation have  
expressed doubt that an espionage case can be made against him, 
although prosecution on lesser security violations has not been 
ruled out.

<HEADLINE> Young, 49ers Deal With Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's latest concussion after  
a frightening hit sent him to a neurologist on Tuesday and left the 
San Francisco 49ers wondering about the future of their star 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lost consciousness for several seconds after the  
head-snapping hit in Monday night's 24-10 win at Arizona. He left 
the game with just seconds remaining in the second quarter and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to dodge pressure, Young instead caught the full force of  
a hit from blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams. The violent blow 
knocked Young backward, and as he fell, his head hit tackle Dave 
Fiore's leg before smashing against the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless on the field with his eyes shut, and tackle  
Derrick Deese tugged at his jersey to try to help him up. When 
there was no immediate response, Deese waved to the sideline for 
help and team trainers and doctors ran onto the field, along with 
coach Steve Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who has a history of concussions, came to after a few  
moments and walked off the field under his own power. At one point, 
he even tried to talk Mariucci into letting him re-enter the game, 
but Mariucci ruled it out. Young then donned a cap and watched from 
the sideline as backup Jeff Garcia finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion punctuated what has been a trying season thus far  
for the 37-year-old Young. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection has been spotty and he has been battered by the  
opposition weekly. In last week's 28-21 win over New Orleans, Young 
was hit 21 times, including five sacks, in what was one of the most 
sustained poundings he's endured in a 15-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The protection appeared slightly improved Monday night until the  
fateful breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-game interview, Young appeared lucid and told  
reporters he does take the issue of repeated concussions seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am much more sober about it than anyone,'' Young said.  
``I'll deal with it as realistically as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concussion is at least the fourth Young has suffered since  
1996. The previous three occurred over a 10-month span, two during 
the 1996 season and another in the 1997 opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The three previous concussions in relatively quick succession  
raised fears about the possible impact on Young's long-term health 
if he continued playing. Some of his friends and relatives at the 
time urged him to consider retiring, and there was concern that one 
more serious hit could force him out of football. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was cleared to play and he's missed only two games  
due to injury over the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, P.O. Share Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The giant internet bookseller Amazon.com and  
the Postal Service are launching a joint advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ``is to position Amazon.com as the ultimate gift-giving  
destination and the U.S. Postal Service and Priority Mail as the 
preferred shipper of leading e-commerce companies,'' explained 
postal spokeswoman Judy deTorok. 
</P>
<P>
	Postmaster General William Henderson said the project was  
initiated during a meeting of the postal governing board in 
Seattle, when officials visited Amazon.com's headquarters to 
discuss common interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the effort is ``several million dollars,'' a small  
part of the overall postal advertising budget, Henderson noted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said several other companies have approached the post office  
about similar projects and those discussions are in the early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, announced today at a national postal convention in  
Chicago, is the latest of several cooperative efforts launched by 
the post office and major mail-order firms. Others include Eddie 
Bauer, Nordstrom and L.L. Bean. 
</P>
<P>
	While some television ads have already appeared, the  
Postal-Amazon.com campaign is scheduled to expand in mid-October, 
postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the two sides share the costs of the ads and the  
cooperative effort will provide increased efficiency in advertising 
spending.

<HEADLINE> Underwood's Family Blames Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- As Miami Dolphins rookie Dimitrius  
Underwood recovers from a suicide attempt that left him severely 
cut and bleeding on a downtown street, his mother blamed a ``cult 
that's posing as a church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was able to talk and get out of bed Tuesday following  
surgery Sunday, a Sparrow Hospital spokeswoman said. He was listed 
in fair and improving condition. 
</P>
<P>
	What police say was a self-inflicted slash to the neck was the  
latest turn in the life of the former Michigan State defensive end, 
a first-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings. He left the Vikings in 
August without explanation a day after signing a five-year, $5.3 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter later found him in a Philadelphia hotel, where he  
said he had been torn between his faith in God and his football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was released by the Vikings. When Underwood decided to  
return to football to support his family, the Miami Dolphins picked 
him up on waivers. He played one preseason game on Sept. 2, then 
injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen, told The Miami Herald she wanted to  
speak out against a church Underwood began attending while at 
Michigan State. She did not identify the church, but said she might 
take action against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are controlling spirits in there,'' Underwood, an  
ordained minister, told the newspaper in Tuesday's editions. ``I 
visited one time and the pastor was talking about if a young man 
and woman in the church are dating and then they break up, he won't 
let them date anyone else for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not in the Bible. I know the Bible. That's just someone  
trying to control people. It's a den of witches sitting up in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She could not be reached Tuesday for more comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Underwood had been attending Immanuel's Temple Community Church  
for about a year, the Lansing State Journal reported in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Phillip Owens, the church's pastor and prophet, walked  
away from an Associated Press reporter without comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens told the State Journal in August that neither he nor his  
wife, Patricia, had ever counseled Underwood and that no one in the 
church told Underwood to leave football. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson placed Underwood on the reserve,  
non-football injury list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow him to focus on his recovery, both medically  
and physically,'' Johnson said. ``It takes away the thought of 
playing this year and lets him get back on the right track, and go 
through some counseling and focus on next year as far as playing 
for the Dolphins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins set up counseling for Underwood last week, Johnson  
said. ``It wasn't as intense as what it will be,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the 6-foot-6, 270-pound Underwood slashed his neck  
with a knife on Sunday during a visit with his twin 17-month-old 
children and their mother in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	The night before, police found him near Lansing Community  
College after firefighters at a nearby station called them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He appeared somewhat confused,'' said Lt. Ray Hall, spokesman  
for the Lansing Police Department. ``He did appear to be talking to 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing police arrested Underwood on a warrant accusing him of  
nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted about three 
hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the jail for another 
hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has said he wants to be a Christian minister, but  
doesn't have any formal training and doesn't plan to receive any. 
</P>
<P>
	``God blessed me with enough for the day,'' he said. ``When the  
future comes, God will bless me another day. You have to have faith 
in God. If you have a million dollars in the bank, that becomes 
your faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood played defensive end at Michigan State for three  
seasons before sitting out his senior year with a sprained ankle. 
The Vikings made him the 29th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with Minnesota on Aug. 1, but walked out of training  
camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis Green he had no 
desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75  
million signing bonus by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he'll be fine and then find the kind of assistance,  
help that he needs to do a good job, and I'm not talking about 
football,'' Green said.

<HEADLINE> X-ray Ring Found in Crab Nebula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A never-before-seen ring of X-rays has been  
discovered surrounding the heart of the massive crab nebula in 
space, NASA announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring was revealed by the 2-month-old Chandra X-ray  
observatory. The finding, combined with other observations, may 
provide clues as to how a powerful neutron star provides energy to 
the nebula, NASA researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crab nebula, located about 6,000 light-years from Earth in  
the constellation Taurus, is the remnant of a star that was 
observed to explode in the year 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inner ring is unique,'' said Jeff Hester of Arizona State  
University. ``It has never been seen before, and it should tell us 
a lot about how the energy from the pulsar gets into the nebula. 
It's like finding the transmission lines between the power plant 
and the light bulb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Weisskopf, Chandra Project Scientist at NASA's Marshall  
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the pulsar inside the 
nebula ``is accelerating particles up to the speed of light and 
flinging them out into interstellar space at an incredible rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Hubble Space Telescope images have shown moving  
knots and wisps around the neutron star and X-ray images have shown 
the outer parts of the jet and hinted at the ring structure. With 
Chandra's new observations the ring pattern clearly appears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulsar within the Crab nebula, discovered by radio  
astronomers in 1968, is a neutron star rotating 30 times per 
second. Neutron stars are formed when gravity crushes the central 
core of the star to densities 50 trillion times that of lead and a 
diameter of only 12 miles. They are highly magnetic and rotate 
rapidly, creating a powerful generator.

<HEADLINE> Europeans May Skip Ryder in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European golfers might refuse to play another  
Ryder Cup in the United States because of the abuse they were 
subjected to from fans, outgoing European captain Mark James says. 
</P>
<P>
	James, whose wife was spit on by a spectator, said he feared  
fights will break out unless action is taken to curb the behavior 
by players and fans that tainted the Americans' comeback victory in 
Brookline, Mass., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of players will not be bothered competing in American  
again,'' James said in British newspapers Tuesday. ``Certainly that 
is the case with me. It's not something I would look forward to. We 
don't need to be treated like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James' wife, Jane, said a young fan spit at her on the final day  
of the three-day competition at The Country Club. Colin Montgomerie 
said his 70-year-old father left the course Sunday because of the 
merciless heckling of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just awful,'' Jane James said. ``There were lots of  
incidents of people telling us to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next Ryder Cup is at the Belfry in England in 2001. The  
tournament returns to the United States in 2003 at Oakland Hills 
outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark James called for an alcohol ban at major golf events, an  
idea backed by Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
	The European team and British media kept up their scathing  
criticism of the celebrations on the 17th green Sunday by American 
players, wives and caddies after Justin Leonard made a 45-foot putt 
that eventually decided the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The wild scenes came as Europe's Jose Maria Olazabal still had a  
chance to keep Europe's chances alive with his own long putt. He 
eventually missed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw later apologized, but Montgomerie said  
it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of apology can make amends for what they did,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	James said the conduct at the 17th green ``pale in comparison''  
to the behavior of fans toward the European players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been playing myself, I might have lost my temper  
completely,'' he said. ``Cheering when you miss putts or hit into 
bunkers is one thing. But personal abuse is something different. We 
are going to get into a situation where fights will break out if we 
don't stop this thing now.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes D.C. Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed Congress' budget for  
the District of Columbia on Tuesday because lawmakers added 
restrictions that would have prevented residents from ``making 
their own decisions about local matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should not impose such conditions on the District of  
Columbia,'' he said in a statement. Addressing some Republicans' 
threats that a veto could jeopardize the district's funding, he 
said it was ``wrong for some in Congress to threaten to cut funding 
that would fight crime, expand educational opportunity ... and 
improve children's health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget as drafted on Capitol Hill would have prevented the  
district from taking a number of actions, including spending its 
own funds to lobby for voting rights for its citizens and allowing 
the use of marijuana for medical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., R-Okla., said the veto sent the wrong  
message in the effort to fight drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about legalizing drugs in the nation's capital, and  
using that as a steppingstone for the rest of the country,'' Istook 
said. ``Everyone who cares about combating drugs should be sickened 
by the Clinton veto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and  
Budget, said Clinton acted to defend the principle of home rule, 
not in response to any individual restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about the ins and outs of each rider,'' she said.  
``This is about permitting the local residents of the District of 
Columbia to make their own decisions about local matters the way 
that any citizen of any other city in America is entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the measure would govern how the district could spend  
the entire $5.1 billion budget, the federal government would 
provide less than one-tenth of the total, $429 million, with local 
taxes and fees providing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have prevented the city from allowing the use of  
marijuana for medical purposes despite a Nov. 3 referendum -- 
approved by 69 percent of the voters -- that backed such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would have required the National Park Service to  
implement an earlier decision allowing towers to be built in Rock 
Creek Park for cellular phone use. Local leaders and 
environmentalists have objected. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 27th veto of Clinton's presidency and comes amid a  
contentious budget season. Last week, Clinton vetoed a $792 billion 
Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has sent only four of the 13 annual spending bills to  
Clinton this year. Lawmakers are working on a stopgap spending 
measure that would keep the federal government operating while 
lawmakers and the administration continue wrangling over a budget.

<HEADLINE> Study: Students Can't Write Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only one in four of the nation's  
schoolchildren has the knowledge and skills needed to write stories 
and reports proficiently, the Education Department reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Testers asked 60,000 fourth-graders, eighth-graders and  
12th-graders to write creative narratives, reports about events or 
experiences and persuasive pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three-fourths of the students showed at least a basic  
level of writing -- or partial mastery of the prerequisite knowledge 
and skills fundamental to proficient work. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests and score levels were determined by the National  
Assessment Governing Board, a quasi-governmental body created by 
Congress to act as an independent judge of education standards, and 
the testing itself was undertaken by the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, roughly one-fourth of the students in each grade level  
were at least proficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings are important, because how well students write  
at the end of the 20th century is an indicator of how well they 
will be able to communicate and reason in the beginning of the 21st 
century,'' said Gary Phillips, acting commissioner for the 
Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 23 percent of fourth-graders wrote at the proficient level  
or above, which meant -- in the testers' terms -- that they could 
deliver a solid academic performance and competently write about 
challenging subject matter. Eighty-four percent wrote at the basic 
level or above, and 16 percent were below the basic level. 
</P>
<P>
	For eighth-graders, 27 percent were at least proficient, 84  
percent were at least basic and 16 percent were below basic. For 
12th-graders, 22 percent were proficient, 78 percent were basic and 
22 percent were below basic. 
</P>
<P>
	And in each grade group, 1 percent of students wrote at an  
advanced level, which signified a superior performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing, which took place in 1998, included students at both  
public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first national test of students' writing skills since  
1992, but the board said the results could not be compared because 
the tests used a new methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, fourth-graders were asked to write about their  
favorite object and what they would find in a magic castle, 
eighth-graders about the arrival of a space ship and what they 
would like to see on public television, and 12th-graders a story 
related to a poem by Walt Whitman and their opinion about voter 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who wrote better were used to writing several drafts,  
had teachers who talked to them about writing and required them to 
use computers with their writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley used the test results to push  
the Clinton administration's efforts to raise federal funding for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to increase our investment in the art and practice of  
writing,'' Riley said. ``If we don't, we will never reduce the 
large number of high school graduates who have to take remedial 
writing classes in college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-five states, the District of Colombia and the Virgin  
Islands also tested an additional 100,000 eighth-grade public 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas and Wisconsin had the  
highest percentages of students writing at the proficient level. 
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina and Hawaii had the 
lowest percentages of students writing at the proficient level.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Y2K Readiness Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Russia already on the economic edge could be  
heading for more woes on New Year's Day when Y2K-related problems 
are likely to cause power and telecommunications failures, U.S. 
officials said at a Senate hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., an expert on Russian defense  
operations, also told the special Senate panel on the Y2K problem 
that while the chances of an accidental Russian missile launch are 
almost non-existent, computer problems could further compound 
deterioration of Russia's incoming missile early warning system. 
Y2K could also impede Russia's efforts to secure its nuclear 
stockpile from intrusions and other potential threats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are advising U.S. citizens who will be in Russia over the  
millennial transition to be prepared for possible disruptions, 
especially in key sectors like electricity, heat and 
telecommunications,'' said John R. Beyrle, a State Department 
expert on the New Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to home, lawmakers and health care experts don't know  
whether the hospitals, doctors and nursing homes that provide 
services to the 39 million Americans under Medicare benefits have 
come to grips with the year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain deeply concerned that many providers still do not  
appear to be doing all that they must to prepare for the year 
2000,'' Gary Christoph, chief information officer of the Health 
Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, said at a 
House hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook is alarming,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee monitoring the 
Y2K computer issue. As of last week, he said, less than 2 percent 
of the 230,000 hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other health 
care providers who submit claims to Medicare had tested their 
computer systems with Medicare contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said HCFA has completed its efforts to assure that all  
its internal computer systems are Y2K-compliant and there will be 
no interruptions in services from its end. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Brown, chairman of the board of trustees of the American  
Hospital Association, also said hospitals had spent $8 billion to 
upgrade their computers and will be ready for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the concern is that thousands of physicians, nursing homes  
and small inner-city and rural hospitals either have not addressed 
the problem or haven't tested their systems to make sure they will 
work on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Until tests are carried out, said Joel Willemssen of the General  
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, ``the ability 
of these entities to process Medicare claims in a future date 
environment is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel that follows Y2K developments came to a similar  
conclusion in a report last week on Y2K status 100 days before the 
new millennium. It said that while HCFA and most large hospitals 
are doing well, there was real concern that doctors and smaller 
health care centers weren't making adequate preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits in a year,  
raising the possibility that they will be unable to differentiate 
2000 from 1900. That could cause malfunctions and breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said all Medicare managed care organizations are  
required to certify that their systems will perform into the new 
millennium, but reviews of the contingency plans for national 
chains indicate that while 50 percent are reasonable or in need of 
minor improvements, the other 50 percent need major improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 7 million in Medicare HMO programs require  
preauthorization for specialty care, said Joseph R. Baker of the 
Medicare Rights Center. Computer breakdowns could mean that these 
people can't get the care they need, ``with potentially devastating 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Whitney Addington, president of the American College of  
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, said doctors have 
a high level of Y2K awareness and many have taken corrective 
measures. But few have tested their systems, he said, and this 
could lead to a ``last minute 'debugging' demand that could 
overwhelm available resources.''

	The move was not unexpected after Tampa Bay left the winger  
unprotected for last Monday's waiver draft. As a result, Daigle is 
expected to be assigned to a minor league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get out what you put in,'' Tampa Bay coach Steve Ludzik  
said Saturday after the team opted not to protect Daigle in the 
waiver draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle was taken first overall in the 1993 draft by Ottawa.  
Since that time, his work ethic has come into question. He has 92 
goals and 215 points in 401 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle was acquired by the Lightning as part of a three-team  
trade last Jan. 29. He also played for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay also designated defenseman Jassen Cullimore for  
assignment. Wingers Andy Bezeau, Kyle Freadrich and Steve Walker 
were sent to Detroit of the International Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Airline Fined For Moving Passenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A first-class passenger who refused to sit  
next to a seeing-eye dog prompted America West Airlines to move a 
blind passenger and her dog to coach class. And that led to a 
$1,000 government fine against the carrier, the Transportation 
Department announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department levied the penalty because its rules state that  
America West should have instead moved the objecting passenger or 
taken him off the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with the carriers to ensure that our air  
transportation system is inclusive in its service and, therefore, 
accessible to all travelers,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater said in announcing the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred Sept. 16, 1998, when Sherry Layne of  
Phoenix, Ariz., and her seeing-eye dog, a golden Labrador named 
``Faith,'' boarded an America West flight from Baltimore to 
Phoenix. Layne was using a first-class ticket she bought at a 
reduced rate through a relative who was an America West employee. 
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived to take her window seat -- intending to have the  
dog rest at her feet -- the aisle seat passenger objected to flying 
next to a seeing-eye dog and blocked Layne from sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
	The case docket -- which did not include that passenger's name --  
said America West flight attendants tried both to change his mind 
and to find a different seat in the first-class compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	When he held firm and no other first-class passenger would move,  
Layne was switched to coach, where she and Faith could sit 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make matters worse, while I was standing in full view of  
everyone who saw this total rejection of me in first class because 
I was visually impaired, the captain began `playing' with my guide 
dog,'' Layne wrote in her initial complaint to the airline in 
October 1998. ``I politely but firmly asked him not to touch my 
guide dog, yet he kept doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department rules say travelers have the right to  
bring service animals on airplanes and the animal must be 
accommodated near the passenger. If another passenger objects, the 
carrier must outline the disabled passenger's rights and find 
another seat for the objecting passenger, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	If that fails, the airline must remove the objecting passenger  
from the flight, the rules say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Dec. 1, 1998 letter of apology to Layne, America West said  
it would use the incident in its training materials, but it also 
said that passengers traveling with a company-discounted ticket are 
not guaranteed a specific seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I regret the passengers in first class were not willing  
to sit next to your guide dog, our personnel were able to 
accommodate you on the flight. I'm sorry you feel this constitutes 
a violation of your rights,'' wrote Dee L. Mann, special assistant 
to America West Chairman William Franke. 
</P>
<P>
	Layne's attorney, Ellen Sue Katz of the Arizona Center for  
Disability Law, said she and Layne did not know of the settlement 
before it was announced Tuesday. She said they were undecided about 
whether to appeal, although Layne's complaint did not seek monetary 
damages other than legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted them to change their practices and policies so their  
staff knew how to treat people with service animals, that the 
airline have a compliance officer and when complaints are made, 
they are handled appropriately. We don't think any of that happened 
in this case,'' Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine will not be paid to the government. Instead, the  
department and America West agreed to put the money toward the 
airline's program for training guide dogs to handle airplane 
flight.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Look Like the Same Ol' Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Bob Whitfield, walking toward the meeting  
room to watch video from another Falcons loss, summed up the plight 
facing the defending NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you if we go 13-3, we'll have the best record in  
football,'' Atlanta's offensive tackle said Monday. ``We've just 
got to win the rest of our games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dirty Birds may have been able to pull off such a feat.  
However, these guys look like the same ol' Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mere eight months, Atlanta (0-3) has gone from Super Bowl  
to super trouble, threatening to ruin all the goodwill that built 
up during that magical run to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, is it hockey season yet?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun playing in front of a lot of people,'' Whitfield  
said. ``If we lose a couple of games and the people don't want to 
come out, so be it. I guess we'll have to play in front of 
nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons sank further into the abyss Sunday, when a St. Louis  
team that was 4-12 a year ago routed the Falcons 35-7. The game 
wasn't even as close as the score, the Rams converting on their 
first four possessions and outgaining Atlanta 311-67 in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like they were playing a different speed than we  
were,'' coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 17-0 in each of their first two games, the  
Falcons trailed 28-0 to the Rams. The injury-depleted offense, 
averaging 9.3 points per game, struggled once again, only this time 
it was complemented by a complete breakdown on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran into a buzz saw in St. Louis,'' Marty Carter said.  
``Wow. It was bombs away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams' dominance was epitomized by a three-play sequence in  
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	With his team already leading 7-0, Kurt Warner threw a 38-yard  
touchdown pass to Torry Holt on third-and-18. After Todd Lyght 
intercepted a pass from Chris Chandler, Warner capitalized on the 
very next play with a 46-yard scoring strike to Isaac Bruce. On the 
first play of St. Louis' next possession, Marshall Faulk broke off 
a 58-yard run to set up another TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just gave up way too many big plays,'' Reeves said. ``On  
the road, where your defense has to play well, we just didn't get 
the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling, the Falcons secondary ``looked like the Keystone  
Kops,'' in the words of free safety Eugene Robinson. During a bye 
week, St. Louis came up with a game plan that caught Atlanta 
completely off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took chances downfield and caught us with different  
formations we didn't expect,'' Carter admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, the Falcons have been plagued by factors beyond their  
control. All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson is out for the season 
with a knee injury, while Chandler is hobbling on a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed one game, tried to come back too soon Sunday and  
wound up being knocked out again before halftime. He is 
questionable for next weekend's game against the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very good,'' Chandler said Monday. ``I'm just trying  
to get it better before it gets worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already worse for the Falcons is the situation on the defensive  
line, where tackles Shane Dronett and Ed Jasper are both out for 
2-to-4 weeks. Dronett pulled his right calf muscle, while Jasper 
sustained ligament damage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, the entire team is suffering a severe case of  
shellshock. Although the Falcons have never put together 
consecutive winning seasons during their 34-year history, no one 
expected a start like this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning breeds confidence,'' Reeves said. ``Losing brings  
around the wrong kind of things: people second-guessing you, people 
talking about how bad you are playing. That is all you hear and all 
you read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, this is not what Carter had in mind when he signed  
with the Falcons as a free agent after eight mostly losing seasons 
in Tampa Bay and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have such high  
expectations,'' he said. ``That's the most difficult thing. We're 
on every sports show, every channel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only five teams have rebounded from an 0-3 start to make the  
playoffs, and it's little consolation that the Super Bowl champion 
Broncos are also winless after three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons owner Taylor Smith is confident Reeves can get things  
turned around, as he did during his first season in Atlanta. In 
1997, the Falcons were 1-7 at the midway point but won six of their 
final eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is so consistent,'' Smith said. ``He knows how to handle  
things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He better hurry.

<HEADLINE> Dean Settling Watergate Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A settlement has been reached in a seven-year  
libel lawsuit that former White House counsel John W. Dean III 
filed against the author of a book portraying him as the mastermind 
of the Watergate conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan signed a one-page order  
Monday dismissing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal came after State Farm Insurance Cos., the author's  
personal liability insurance carrier, decided to pay the Deans an 
undisclosed sum to resolve the dispute, insurance company spokesman 
Joe Johnson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate deal, he said State Farm agreed to pay Leonard  
Colodny of Tampa, Fla., the author of the 1991 book titled ``Silent 
Coup,'' an undisclosed amount of money for fees and expenses that 
Colodny incurred in defending the suit. The sum is ``well up into 
the six figures,'' according to Colodny's attorney, Martin Lobel. 
</P>
<P>
	The book claims Dean orchestrated the 1972 burglary at the  
Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. The book 
says the break-in at the Watergate complex was an effort to obtain 
information on an alleged link between Democrats and a prostitution 
ring run by a friend of Dean's future wife, Maureen. 
</P>
<P>
	The book says Dean planned the break-in to collect damaging  
information on the Democrats to heighten his own influence at the 
White House and then concocted the cover-up without consulting 
superiors. Dean's damaging testimony to congressional investigators 
further unraveled the Watergate affair, which forced President 
Nixon to resign in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled about the settlement and we feel we have ample  
evidence proving his story is false,'' said John Garrick, the 
Deans' attorney. ``The Deans have repeatedly refuted the claim that 
there was a call girl ring linked to the Democratic National 
Committee and that Mr. Dean's wife was friends with the madam of 
the call girl ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colodny, however, says Dean agreed to accept a settlement and  
sign an agreement not to sue the author again on the same grounds 
because he wanted to avoid a public courtroom drama. Colodny wanted 
the court to hear the case because he was confident that a public 
trial would validate his reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it heard,'' Colodny said. ``We had source after  
source after source for what we wrote and Dean knew it.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings Trade Colinet for Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings got defensive  
tackle Jerry Ball back from the Cleveland Browns on Tuesday in a 
trade for defensive end Stalin Colinet and an undisclosed draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a great opportunity to get a player that was  
with us before,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``We will miss 
Stalin. He was a player who was making progress as a young player. 
However, taking advantage of the opportunity to bring Jerry back is 
something we thought we should do. We look forward to Jerry helping 
our team be successful for the next two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball will be reunited with college defensive linemate Joe  
Phillips. The two starred at Southern Methodist in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns signed Ball in April. He was the third important  
defensive free agent the Browns lured away from the Vikings. 
Cleveland earlier signed cornerback Corey Fuller and defensive end 
Derrick Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball started all three games for the expansion Browns this  
season, posting four tackles and notching a sack against Baltimore 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year veteran and three time Pro-Bowl selection had 15  
tackles for losses last season. He started 25 consecutive games at 
nose tackle for the Vikings over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball started his career with Detroit, then played for the old  
Browns in 1993, before moving on to the Raiders and then Minnesota.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Offers $65B Health Care Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Presidential candidate Bill Bradley unveiled  
a $65 billion plan Tuesday to dramatically expand the federal 
health care system, and accused Al Gore of shying away from the 
challenge to insure all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to be timid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who called health care coverage an unalienable right --  
as much as the guarantees of ``life, liberty and pursuit of 
happiness'' -- would allow Americans to enroll in the same health 
care coverage provided for members of Congress and federal 
employees, potentially exploding the size of the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor would get subsidies, parents would be told to seek  
insurance for their newborns, the Medicaid system would largely 
scrapped and tax breaks would go to all Americans who pay insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign called Bradley's plan to provide universal  
coverage the plan ``wildly unrealistic'' and ``wildly expensive,'' 
defending the vice president's more limited approach that would 
expand federal efforts to insure all children and incrementally 
extend coverage to uninsured adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, for his part, made clear what he thought of the Gore  
plan. ``I think that what he has proposed is definitely timid 
compared to what we have proposed,'' he said at a news conference 
following the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweeping, expensive nature of the program fits with  
Bradley's promise to be the candidate of ``big ideas.'' But his 
proposal also opens the former New Jersey senator to criticism that 
he is pushing liberal, big-government solutions to a complicated 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the failure of President Clinton's 1993 health care  
plan, Bradley said he would not create ``a massive bureaucracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is mounting a stiff challenge to Gore in early primary  
states, largely because of his support among independents and 
moderate Democrats. Yet, on health care and other issues, Bradley 
is generally more liberal-leaning than the vice president as he 
seeks to carve into Gore's political base. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can commit ourselves to the proposition that when it comes  
to health care, everyone will have the American dream -- at last,'' 
Bradley told 500 supporters and students packed into an auditorium 
at Los Angeles Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his price tag ``is a great deal of money, but a campaign  
proposal without a price tag is just another politician's 
promise.'' The line was a clear reference to Gore, who has not 
estimated the cost of his health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the vice president distributed press releases at  
the college questioning the cost of Bradley's plan and suggesting 
that employers might be tempted to drop insurance coverage provided 
to employees. Bradley said he had no plan to forbid employers from 
dropping coverage, but he left the door open to address the problem 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his plan, people and families at or near the poverty line  
would get subsidies, either for private insurance or to opt into 
the expanded federal system. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans of all incomes and ages would be able to exclude from  
their taxable income whatever they pay in health care premiums, a 
benefit Bradley designed for middle-class Americans who don't 
qualify for subsidies. It also would apply to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about giving Donald Trump tax deductions for  
his insurance premiums?'' Gore adviser Elaine Kamarck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would require parents to enroll newborns in private or  
the new public insurance program before leaving the hospital after 
birth. Cars need insurance, he said, ``So should we have a lesser 
requirement'' for children? 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bradley was not prepared to say how he would enforce  
the measure, though they suggested that there would be no severe 
penalties for not cooperating. Bradley would encourage the 
enrollment children in health plans at different stages in their 
lives -- at hospitals, at school and in doctor's offices, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the elderly, Bradley is offering to expand Medicare to  
include an optional prescription drug benefit, similar to what 
Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said his plan would evolve and be fleshed out during his  
candidacy. In the meantime, he is leaving many questions 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	His health care team had no estimates on the size and cost of  
expanding the bureaucracy of the federal employees' health 
insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	His $65 billion annual budget would suck up about half of the  
federal surplus not already dedicate to Social Security, but makes 
no adjustments in the event of an economic downturn that saves or 
eliminates the surplus. Bradley said new technologies would save 
money, even if the economy dives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think taxes will be needed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also uncertain is the impact of Bradley's plan on states, which  
share a cost of the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	States, which would no longer have responsibility for providing  
health insurance for the poor, would still handle nursing home 
costs on their own. Bradley's advisers expect the changes to save 
states $18 billion in the first year, but they acknowledged that 
the former New Jersey senator has not considered the impact upon 
states when babyboomers explode the nursing home population. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's response to critics will be: At least I'm trying.  
Aides said he had Gore in mind in saying, ``When it comes to 
America's health, this is not the time to be timid. It requires 
bold action.''

penalties for not cooperating. Bradley would encourage the 
enrollment children in health plans at different stages in their 
lives -- at hospitals, at school and in doctor's offices, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the elderly, Bradley is offering to expand Medicare to  
include an optional prescription drug benefit, similar to what 
Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said his plan would evolve and be fleshed out during his  
candidacy. In the meantime, he is leaving many questions 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	His health care team had no estimates on the size and cost of  
expanding the bureaucracy of the federal employees' health 
insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	His $65 billion annual budget would suck up about half of the  
federal surplus not already dedicate to Social Security, but makes 
no adjustments in the event of an economic downturn that saves or 
eliminates the surplus. Bradley said new technologies would save 
money, even if the economy dives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think taxes will be needed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also uncertain is the impact of Bradley's plan on states, which  
share a cost of the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	States, which would no longer have responsibility for providing  
health insurance for the poor, would still handle nursing home 
costs on their own. Bradley's advisers expect the changes to save 
states $18 billion in the first year, but they acknowledged that 
the former New Jersey senator has not considered the impact upon 
states when babyboomers explode the nursing home population. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's response to critics will be: At least I'm trying.  
Aides said he had Gore in mind in saying, ``When it comes to 
America's health, this is not the time to be timid. It requires 
bold action.''

<HEADLINE> Trump Hits Snag in TV Show Taping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has town officials in a  
huff over a home-decorating TV show filmed at his Mar-a-Lago 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems Trump ran afoul of the upscale island's rules again,  
this time violating an ordinance against commercial filming in a 
residential area by allowing the cozy home and garden show ``It's a 
Snap'' into his lavish estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief code enforcement officer Brian House gave Trump a cease  
and desist order Monday. Trump agreed, and he will not be taken 
before the town board. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the second episode of the show filmed at Mar-a-Lago  
will not be aired as planned Friday on the South Florida PaxNet 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump could face a $250 fine if the show is broadcast.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Trump got a warning after allowing a magazine shoot at  
Mar-a-Lago. He also has a long history of legal battles with the 
town council over restrictions on his private club.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Underwood Wound Self-Inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's mother claims her  
son's apparent suicide attempt and his recent erratic behavior have 
been influenced by a ``cult that's posing as a church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a defensive end from Michigan State who walked away  
from a multimillion-dollar NFL contract with Minnesota, only to 
resurface in Miami, slashed his own neck Sunday and was found 
bleeding on a Lansing street, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before she left Monday for Lansing from her Philadelphia home,  
Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, said she wanted to speak out 
against ``a cult that's posing as a church,'' which Underwood began 
attending while he was at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are controlling spirits in there,'' Eileen Underwood, an  
ordained minister, told The Miami Herald. ``I visited one time and 
the pastor was talking about if a young man and woman in the church 
are dating and then they break up, he won't let them date anyone 
else for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not in the Bible. I know the Bible. That's just someone  
trying to control people. It's a den of witches sitting up in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Underwood declined to name the church, but said she might  
take legal action against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's sister, Andrea Underwood, said one member of the  
church who recruited Dimitrius Underwood always seems to be around 
when Underwood acts in a bizarre manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was the Minnesota Vikings' second first-round draft  
pick in April, but left training camp after one day, saying he 
could not resolve the conflict between playing football and serving 
God. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems like Dimitrius is fine until this man shows up,  
and then he starts doing all these bizarre things,'' Andrea 
Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood gave football another chance in August when the  
Dolphins claimed him on waivers, but attended only two practices 
before dislocating his left shoulder in a preseason game. He had 
been expected to begin practicing again with the Dolphins this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Lansing police arrested Underwood on a warrant  
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted 
for him about three hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the 
jail for another hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dimitrius' behavior over a little bit of time here has  
been a little bit unusual,'' Michigan State coach Nick Saban said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to help the guy last year; I know the Dolphins have  
tried to help him now, and I've talked to him on several occasions. 
... Maybe now someone can help him and he can do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Underwood slashed his neck with a knife at the home of  
the mother of his twin 17-month-old children. He was staying there 
during the Dolphins' off week. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the home saw him cut himself, but several people in  
the neighborhood saw him running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood wrote a 
suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was listed in fair condition Monday at Sparrow  
Hospital after undergoing surgery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old player cooperated with police when they found  
him about 12:45 p.m. Sunday, and has spoken with police since, Hall 
said. He declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his 
actions, but said police are close to completing their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood played defensive end at Michigan State for three  
seasons before sitting out his senior year with a sprained ankle. 
The Vikings made him their 29th draft pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1, but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75  
million signing bonus by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he'll be fine and then find the kind of assistance,  
help that he needs to do a good job, and I'm not talking about 
football,'' Green said Monday. ``Because when you're in the 
hospital in serious condition, then football is very secondary for 
the things that he needs as a young man of 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams passed  
on him, and is now getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said he spoke with  
Sparrow Hospital nurses about Underwood's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have passed on the word that we are 100 percent supportive  
of him. Our No. 1 concern is his health and well-being, and the No. 
1 thing we want to do is for him to get well,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Warned About Leaving GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson told  
Pat Buchanan on Tuesday that bolting to the Reform Party could help 
elect a Democratic president next year and put liberal judges on 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting at the conservative commentator's northern  
Virginia home, Nicholson asked Buchanan to be ``very careful before 
taking any action that could in any way help Al Gore or Bill 
Bradley extend the Clinton-Gore era,'' according to a statement 
released by Nicholson's office after a spokesman was asked about 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan spokeswoman Joanne Hansen said her boss had no comment.  
Aides said he would consider Nicholson's concerns when he decides 
whether to abandon the GOP. Buchanan has said he expects to 
announce his decision in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time presidential candidate, his campaign sagging in  
the GOP primaries, is seriously considering leaving the Republican 
Party to seek the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not be guaranteed the third-party nod.  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's new book, ``A Republic, Not and Empire,'' has drawn  
harsh criticism for his argument that Germany was not a threat to 
the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican and conservative leaders, particularly  
presidential rival John McCain, have said the party has no room for 
Buchanan's beliefs. Others, chiefly Republican presidential 
front-runner George W. Bush, have urged Buchanan to remain in a 
united GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans worry that a third-party Buchanan bid would siphon  
conservative votes from the GOP presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson took a similar position Tuesday, though he was careful  
not to praise Buchanan or mention the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reminded him that the next president would almost certainly  
make several lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court,'' 
Nicholson said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Use of DNA Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department advisory panel warns  
police officers collecting DNA evidence to wear gloves, avoid 
sneezing on the sample and keep it in new paper bags or envelopes, 
not plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic bags retain moisture, which could damage cells of human  
tissue containing DNA genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence also urged  
federal and state prosecutors Monday to agree to and pay for DNA 
tests that could exonerate convicts, even if the deadline for 
appeals has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission of prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, police  
executives, forensic scientists and academics was set up last year 
at the request of Attorney General Janet Reno. It issued its first 
recommendations Monday in two publications: a pamphlet for police 
officers and a 117-page book for prosecutors, defense attorneys, 
judges and lab directors titled ``Postconviction DNA Testing: 
Recommendations for Handling Requests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Attorney General Ray Fisher said his department's  
research arm, the National Institute of Justice, would distribute 
the pamphlet to every police officer in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The pamphlet, ``What Every Law Enforcement Officer Should Know  
About DNA Evidence,'' also lists places where such evidence can be 
found: hats, dirty laundry, toothpicks, used cigarettes, licked 
stamps, pillow cases, even baseball bat handles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the widespread dissemination of this pamphlet starts us  
down a path toward eliminating the need for the other publication 
on how to deal with postconviction DNA test requests,'' Fisher told 
a commission meeting. ``By committing ourselves to more accurate 
and effective investigative processes through the use of DNA 
technology, we work toward elimination of the real tragedy of 
wrongful convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the Justice Department now knows of 65 people  
wrongly convicted and later exonerated by DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA, an acid that contains an individual's genetic makeup, is  
found in almost every cell in the body. Except for identical twins, 
each person's DNA is unique and can be used for identification, and 
it often can be found where no fingerprints are left. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing number of convictions overturned by DNA evidence has  
weakened the legal presumption that verdicts are correct, the panel 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Time limits were imposed on federal and state appeals because,  
as the memory of witnesses fades, ``questions of guilt or innocence 
become more uncertain with the passage of time,'' the panel wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the results of DNA testing do not become weaker over time.  
... To the contrary, the probative value of DNA testing has been 
steadily increasing as technological advances and growing databases 
amplify the ability to identify perpetrators and eliminate 
suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommended that requests for DNA tests after  
conviction be divided into one of five categories, ranging from 
those that clearly could exonerate a convict to totally frivolous 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a request that clearly could exonerate a convict, the  
prosecutor should join the defense attorney in requesting tests and 
pay for them if the convict is cleared, the panel recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two states, New York and Illinois, have passed laws  
specifically authorizing late appeals based on DNA tests. The panel 
said if the time for appeals based on new evidence has expired, 
both sides may agree to waive the time limit or the judge can use 
inherent powers ``to prevent what may be a miscarriage of 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's findings are recommendations and have no force  
of law.

<HEADLINE> HMO Bill Stresses Insurance Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A package of tax cuts aimed at improving  
access to health insurance was offered today by House Republican 
leaders hoping to blend the measure with bills giving people rights 
to sue managed care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said each of the bills giving  
patients a host of new legal rights is missing two key pieces: 
improving health care access and affordability for an estimated 44 
million uninsured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be impossible to move forward with patient protection  
and not do something about the uninsured,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP measure, which includes numerous tax breaks costing $43  
billion over 10 years, is expected to be debated in the House next 
week. It is an attempt to put a Republican stamp on one of several 
popular, Democratic-driven measures aimed at increasing patient 
rights through lawsuits or independent appeal boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, all the lawsuits in the world won't do a thing for a  
worker struggling to buy health insurance for themselves or their 
family,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax breaks, most of which were part of the 10-year, $792  
billion GOP tax cut vetoed last week by President Clinton, are 
strongly supported by small businesses and the self-employed. They 
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 100 percent health insurance premium deduction for people who  
purchase their own policies and the self-employed. It could be 
claimed whether or not a taxpayer itemizes deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--A similar 100 percent deduction for people who purchase  
long-term care insurance for elderly family members and an 
additional personal exemption -- worth $2,750 this year -- for people 
who care for elderly family members at home. 
</P>
<P>
	--An expansion of medical savings accounts to allow employers and  
employees to contribute and to permit all individuals, not just 
small employers and the self-employed, to take part. 
</P>
<P>
	--Additional long-term care insurance and medical savings  
accounts benefits for workers whose companies offer ``cafeteria'' 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Several provisions added by Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo.,chairman of  
the Small Business Committee, would enable more small businesses to 
pool risks and buy health insurance more cheaply and form local 
purchasing cooperatives for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed changes, Talent said, would enable small businesses  
``to offer employees the same kinds of health care options big 
corporations have offered for years.''

<HEADLINE> Twain's Account of Hanging Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The folklore of the Old West is often  
a mishmash of myth and reality, so an archivist knew he was onto 
something when he discovered a newspaper account of one of the 
state's first public hangings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see that stiff straight corpse hanging there yet,''  
wrote the reporter, ``with its black pillow-cased head turned 
rigidly to one side, and the purple streaks creeping through the 
hands and driving the fleshy hue of life before them. Ugh!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter? Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark  
Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Rocha found the 1868 article after learning that a number of  
newspapers had approached Twain about writing for them upon his 
return from a tour of Europe and the Holy Land that year. 
</P>
<P>
	A request to the Library of Congress and the University of  
California turned up all six stories Twain wrote for the Chicago 
Republican -- long before ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bingo, there it was,'' Rocha said. ``Nobody had ever looked at  
them closely. The big one was the eyewitness account of the hanging 
of John Millian, which I believe had not seen the light in 131 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-forgotten dispatch reveals details about two  
personalities that would become larger than life: a slain 
prostitute-turned-heroine and an itinerant newspaperman who became 
one of America's best known writers. 
</P>
<P>
	It sheds new light on a little-publicized period of Twain's  
life: after he got his start as a newspaperman and before he went 
on to write his greatest works and speak out against capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most the time he is a humorist,'' said Rocha, who published  
the account in the September-October edition of Nevada Magazine. 
``This one didn't have much humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twain scholars were aware that the author-to-be was in Virginia  
City at the time of the hanging, ``but virtually no one knew he 
wrote an eyewitness account,'' Rocha said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tale of Julia Bulette -- called ``the prostitute with the  
heart of gold'' -- and her killer has become folklore in an offbeat 
state famed for casino gambling, the Burning Man counterculture 
festival and, of course, legal prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In its heyday, Virginia City was home to 40,000 people, four  
banks, five newspapers, six schools, seven churches and about 
two-thirds of the state's population. Its Comstock Lode of silver 
and gold made instant millionaires out of grubby miners, though 
Twain wasn't among them. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bulette, historian Susan James describes her as the  
``Queen of the Red Lights.'' Her portrait still hangs in many of 
the saloons in Virginia City's National Historic District. 
</P>
<P>
	James has argued that impassioned newspaper stories, dime novels  
and popular imagination transformed Bulette's image from that of a 
simple frontier prostitute into the darling of the Comstock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Territorial Enterprise, where Twain started as a reporter,  
once cited her ``kind-hearted, liberal, benevolent and charitable 
disposition.'' Virginia City's Engine Company No. 1 named her as an 
honorary member. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulette was murdered on Jan. 20, 1867, at the age of 35, by a  
man who fled with furs and jewels. Millian was arrested with some 
of the jewelry but said two men had framed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Folklore has it he was strung up by vigilantes -- an oft-repeated  
story that reinforced tales of frontier justice among the rugged 
cowboys, miners and women who sought their fortunes in the Silver 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	But in reality, Millian was convicted by a district court jury  
and appealed all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court before he 
finally went to the gallows April 23, 1868, Rocha said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had witnessed an execution before and did not believe  
I could be present at this one without turning away my head at the 
last moment,'' Twain wrote under his adopted byline. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to say that if any anyone deserved to be hanged, it  
was Millian -- a ``heartless assassin'' who ``knocked her senseless 
with a billet of wood as she slept and then strangled her with his 
fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the man I wanted to see hung. ... He strode firmly  
away and skipped gaily up the steps of the gallows like a happy 
girl,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him at that sickening moment when the sheriff was  
fitting the noose about his neck, and pushing the knot this way and 
that to get it nicely adjusted to the hollow under his ear,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down through the hole in the scaffold the strap-bound figure  
shot like a dart! -- a dreadful shiver started at the shoulders, 
violently convulsed the whole body all the way down and died away 
with a tense drawing of the toes downward, like a doubled fist -- 
and all was over,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it all. I took exact note of every detail, even to his  
considerately helping to fix the leather strap that bound his legs 
together and his quiet removal of his slippers -- and I never wish 
to see it again.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Backed in Rival's Backyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Republican front-runner George W. Bush claimed an  
endorsement Tuesday from the governor of a rival's home state, 
setting the stage for what could be a fierce Arizona presidential 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a common vision,'' Gov. Jane Hull said in  
announcing her support for the Texas governor. She cited Bush's 
support for low taxes, open international trade markets, small 
government with local control and a strong military as well as his 
character and experience as governor as reasons for her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the winning combination,'' Mrs. Hull said. ``In baseball  
they call it a grand slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement could mean trouble for Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., who has been gaining on Bush in New Hampshire, site of the 
nation's first primary next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain also is counting on his home state to boost his  
campaign heading into the critical California primary less than 
three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bush picked up the endorsement of another  
prominent Arizona Republican, former congressman John Rhodes. New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also was set to endorse Bush, 
possibly this week, a top New York Republican said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Hull's support will ``make a difference for me in this  
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some advice for anyone who decides to run for  
president,'' he said. ``If you decide to run, get the governor on 
your side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he intends to campaign hard in Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's an important state and I intend to be  
competitive,'' he said. ``I know I've got a lot of work to do in 
Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's visit Tuesday was scheduled well in advance and was not  
set up to embarrass McCain, Mrs. Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but the highest respect for John McCain,'' she  
said. ``No matter what happens he and I will work together for the 
betterment of Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush agreed, calling McCain a good man, a good senator and an  
American hero. ``We just have a difference of opinion and the 
difference is who should be the nominee of the Republican Party.''

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Waste Rising in Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- A vast waste tank at the Hanford nuclear  
reservation that used to ``burp'' gas has a new problem: The 
radioactive goop inside has risen like bread dough. 
</P>
<P>
	While the development within the million-gallon tank has  
provoked concerns about a possible explosion or contamination, 
managers at the Department of Energy site in south-central 
Washington say both scenarios are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chance of explosion is very low,'' said Rick Raymond, the  
project manager for the contractor, Lockheed Martin Hanford. Still, 
``any time you have a situation where you're trapping gas faster 
than releasing it, it's an unacceptable situation and needs to be 
dealt with in an urgent manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The radioactive waste in Tank SY-101 is a byproduct of the  
process used to extract plutonium from uranium irradiated at 
Hanford's now-defunct nuclear reactors. The tank, less than 10 
miles from the Columbia River near Richland, contains cesium and 
decaying organic materials that generate hydrogen, nitrogen, 
nitrous oxide and ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The tank became notorious in the late 1980s and early '90s as  
Hanford's ``burping'' tank because it released thousands of cubic 
feet of gas every three months or so. If an ignition source had 
been present, the flammable gases could have exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	A mixer pump installed in 1993 took care of the problem by  
allowing the continuous escape of small amounts of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also created a new problem no one expected -- without the  
periodic releases of huge amounts of gas, bubbles began to build up 
in the meringue-like crust floating in the liquid waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The crust began to thicken and grow. It is now about 10 feet  
thick in a tank just over 38 feet tall. The top of the crust is 26 
inches from the top of the tank, although it was 2 inches higher in 
May, when Hanford managers began releasing gas at the same rate it 
is produced. 
</P>
<P>
	While the possibility exists that the waste could spill over and  
breach the tank, the five-eighths-inch-thick steel welds on the 
double-shell tank should prevent that from happening, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in late October or early November, Lockheed Martin  
Hanford will begin pumping out the tank, diluting 300,000 gallons 
of the radioactive brew as it is transferred to another tank, and 
then diluting the 700,000 gallons still in SY-101 with water. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be a permanent fix, said Craig Groendyke, manager  
for the SY-101 project for the Energy Department's Office of River 
Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanford was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project  
to build the atomic bomb. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was 
produced at the site until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The site has 54 million gallons of radioactive waste stored in  
149 aging single-shell tanks, 67 of which have leaked. Newer tanks, 
such as SY-101, have two shells, and none has leaked.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Underwood Wound Self-Inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's mother claims her  
son's apparent suicide attempt and his recent erratic behavior have 
been influenced by a ``cult that's posing as a church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a defensive end from Michigan State who walked away  
from a multimillion-dollar NFL contract with Minnesota, only to 
resurface in Miami, slashed his own neck Sunday and was found 
bleeding on a Lansing street, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before she left Monday for Lansing from her Philadelphia home,  
Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, said she wanted to speak out 
against ``a cult that's posing as a church,'' which Underwood began 
attending while he was at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are controlling spirits in there,'' Eileen Underwood, an  
ordained minister, told The Miami Herald. ``I visited one time and 
the pastor was talking about if a young man and woman in the church 
are dating and then they break up, he won't let them date anyone 
else for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not in the Bible. I know the Bible. That's just someone  
trying to control people. It's a den of witches sitting up in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Underwood declined to name the church, but said she might  
take legal action against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's sister, Andrea Underwood, said one member of the  
church who recruited Dimitrius Underwood always seems to be around 
when Underwood acts in a bizarre manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was the Minnesota Vikings' second first-round draft  
pick in April, but left training camp after one day, saying he 
could not resolve the conflict between playing football and serving 
God. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems like Dimitrius is fine until this man shows up,  
and then he starts doing all these bizarre things,'' Andrea 
Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood gave football another chance in August when the  
Dolphins claimed him on waivers, but attended only two practices 
before dislocating his left shoulder in a preseason game. He had 
been expected to begin practicing again with the Dolphins this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Lansing police arrested Underwood on a warrant  
accusing him of nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted 
for him about three hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the 
jail for another hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dimitrius' behavior over a little bit of time here has  
been a little bit unusual,'' Michigan State coach Nick Saban said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to help the guy last year; I know the Dolphins have  
tried to help him now, and I've talked to him on several occasions. 
... Maybe now someone can help him and he can do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Underwood slashed his neck with a knife at the home of  
the mother of his twin 17-month-old children. He was staying there 
during the Dolphins' off week. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the home saw him cut himself, but several people in  
the neighborhood saw him running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood wrote a 
suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was listed in fair condition Monday at Sparrow  
Hospital after undergoing surgery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old player cooperated with police when they found  
him about 12:45 p.m. Sunday, and has spoken with police since, Hall 
said. He declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his 
actions, but said police are close to completing their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood played defensive end at Michigan State for three  
seasons before sitting out his senior year with a sprained ankle. 
The Vikings made him their 29th draft pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1, but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75  
million signing bonus by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he'll be fine and then find the kind of assistance,  
help that he needs to do a good job, and I'm not talking about 
football,'' Green said Monday. ``Because when you're in the 
hospital in serious condition, then football is very secondary for 
the things that he needs as a young man of 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams passed  
on him, and is now getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said he spoke with  
Sparrow Hospital nurses about Underwood's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have passed on the word that we are 100 percent supportive  
of him. Our No. 1 concern is his health and well-being, and the No. 
1 thing we want to do is for him to get well,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Transsexual Teacher Fights for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTELOPE, Calif. (AP) -- David Warfield served in the Navy,  
worked as a political consultant and was a whitewater rafting 
instructor before becoming a high school journalism teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Warfield struggled with a secret: He felt like a  
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, after beginning hormone therapy, he approached Center  
High Principal Steve Wehr to announce that, by fall, he intended to 
return to school under a new name -- Dana Lee Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision, he says, has put his job in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Rivers learned he will be fired due to his  
``evident unfitness for service'' as a teacher, his lawyer, 
Margaret Geddes, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers has filed a complaint with the state labor commissioner.  
School district spokesman Jan Adams said she could not comment on 
the case because it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers -- he has officially changed his name -- is taking hormones  
to prepare for a sex-change operation that would complete his 
transformation into a woman. He said he has a disorder that causes 
people extreme discomfort with their sexual identity. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, knowing that he would return to school this fall as Dana  
Rivers, he sent a letter to co-workers in this community 25 miles 
northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a whole person,'' he wrote. ``It is not a  
lifestyle choice. It is not a fetish. I am not hoping to make any 
kind of social or political statement. It is the single most 
significant aspect of who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative group  
pushing for the teacher's dismissal, Rivers then spoke with 
students about sexual abuse he experienced as a child, gender 
identity issues and his decision to become a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Geddes said that account was inaccurate but declined further  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's founder, Brad Dacus, said his group became  
involved after several parents complained there was no notice given 
about the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dacus said the teacher's talk with students -- not his sex change  
-- was the issue behind the district's response. ``The actions of 
this teacher were not only inappropriate, but outrageous,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dacus said Rivers should have quietly transferred to another  
school as a woman. ``He could have kept it to himself,'' he said. 
``That would have been the easiest for the students with less 
stress and trauma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers did not respond to messages seeking comment left on his  
home answering machine Monday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his complaint against the board, Rivers said he was  
notified three days before the start of the school year that he had 
been placed on administrative leave and would not be allowed on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Students held a rally Friday to show their support, and the  
school newspaper dedicated most of this school year's first edition 
to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ms. Rivers should do whatever she wants,'' said junior  
Mary Muehe, one of Rivers' former students. ``If anything, she'll 
only be a better teacher now because she won't have to hide this.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains, Japanese Stocks Surge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar gained against the yen Tuesday on hopes  
that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy. Tokyo share 
prices surged on the back of the greenback's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 106.52 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT) Tuesday, up 2.38 yen from 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 504.64  
points, or 3.00 percent, to 17,325.70 Tuesday. On Monday, the 
average closed down 50.67 points, or 0.30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained in part on expectations  
that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency head Taichi  
Sakaiya said he disagreed with the BOJ's stance that further easing 
would be ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya said that increasing reserves in the money market could  
lower mid- to long-term interest rates, thus encouraging corporate 
activities and support further economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded in a relatively narrow range from 105.43 yen  
to 106.72 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback also continued to be supported on the expectations  
of coordinated efforts by leading industrialized countries to buy 
up the U.S. currency against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, finance ministers and central bankers from the  
Group of Seven industrialized nations met in Washington and agreed 
to ``continue to monitor developments in exchange markets and 
cooperate as appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Japan failed to obtain a clear pledge from other G-7  
members for coordinated action to weaken the yen. The G-7 includes 
the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said investors were encouraged by  
the dollar's gains against the yen to buy up export-oriented 
blue-chip shares in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen helps Japan's exporting companies by making their  
products cheaper abroad and thus more competitive, which government 
officials fear could hurt the country's budding economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange was  
estimated at 350.45 million shares, up from 347 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners 843 to 335, while 149 issues  
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's message  
overnight from Washington urging Japan to develop more vibrant 
stock and bond markets also gave Japanese investors an impetus to 
buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight rises in U.S. stocks also reduced fears of a possible  
downturn on Wall Street, which could prompt foreign investors to 
take profits on Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.06  
points to 10,303.29, led by gains in some high-technology and 
consumer issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 39.91 points, or 2.79 percent, to 1,469.29. 
The TOPIX closed down 1.04 points, or 0.07 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.61 yen, up  
sharply from 109.13 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7150 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6850 percent. Its price 
fell 0.26 point to 99.87.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Fitness Called Outstanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush is in excellent health, his doctor said Tuesday, with a 
fitness level among the top 1 percent of men in their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper of Dallas, who has treated the 53-year-old  
Bush since 1989, said the Texas governor has ``no history of any 
alcohol, drug, mental or psychiatric treatment or rehabilitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-page written statement issued by Bush's campaign, and  
in a later telephone interview, Cooper said the candidate, who is 
an avid runner, has an ``outstanding level of fitness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's cardiovascular fitness is rated excellent to superior,  
there are no signs of coronary artery disease, he has a low to very 
low coronary risk profile, and his test for prostate cancer was 
excellent, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush suffers from stiffness in his left knee, which he  
attributes to his exercise program. Some back stiffness also was 
noted, particularly with running, but stretching controlled the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has a mild high-frequency hearing loss likely due to flying  
jets, the doctor said, and his hearing tests excellent in the 
speech frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Bush's level of fitness would put him among the top  
1 percent of men in their 50s and the top 5 percent of men in their 
40s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very, very pleased with his outstanding level of  
fitness,'' the doctor said. ``His state of health at the time of 
his most recent examination was excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That exam was conducted on June 17, 1999. The governor is 6 feet  
tall, weighed 192 1/2 pounds, had blood pressure ``in the right arm 
sitting position'' of 104 over 80, pulse 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Bush's pulse rate -- determined from both wrists and  
an electrocardiogram -- is considered normal ``for a highly 
conditioned athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush regularly runs three to four miles, five times a week, his  
doctor said. He's been exercising regularly since 1972, the doctor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written statement, Cooper said Bush ``has totally  
abstained from alcohol during the past 13 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he made ``mistakes'' in his youth and that he  
stopped drinking after his 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no evidence or credible allegation that he ever  
has used cocaine or other illegal drug. When pressed on the 
question last month, Bush said he had not used illegal drugs in the 
past 25 years. He declined to elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said that from questionnaires filled out by Bush as well  
as medical examinations, he's seen no signs of drug or alcohol 
abuse while treating Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no knowledge of any drug use. I have no knowledge of  
any alcohol abuse,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there were no indications from other tests and  
examinations that Bush ever abused drugs, and he said that in 
consulting with the doctor who previously treated Bush, nothing 
came up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't pursue that further because I didn't see any  
indication for doing that,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if Bush ever had undergone drug or alcohol  
treatment, campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Tuesday: ``As 
part of his complete disclosure of his medical history, he neither 
needed nor ever received mental, emotional, drug or alcohol 
treatment or rehabilitation -- ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's medical history includes minor surgery to his chest wall  
at age 13, an appendectomy at age 10, and arthroscopic knee surgery 
in 1997. Two benign polyps also were surgically removed from his 
colon in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is taking no prescribed or self-prescribed medications,  
except supplemental vitamins and minerals, his doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said the medical summary was made public ``in  
accordance with past presidential campaigns.'' Spokeswoman Mindy 
Tucker said the campaign had received two or three requests from 
news organizations seeking the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer,  
Steve Forbes and Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and John McCain of 
Arizona are in good health and plan to release health evaluations 
in the future, campaign spokesmen said Tuesday. Aides for 
Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes and Democrat Bill Bradley 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore also is in good health and plans to  
release a health evaluation in the future, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Bush in Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush is in excellent health, although the 53-year-old does 
suffer some stiffness in his back and one knee, his doctor said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has totally abstained from alcohol during the past 13  
years. He has no history of any alcohol, drug, mental or 
psychiatric treatment or rehabilitation,'' Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper 
said in a written, three-page medical summary released by Bush's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Bush has been examined annually at his Dallas clinic  
since 1989. The Texas governor received his most recent 
comprehensive physical exam on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``His state of health at the time of his most recent examination  
was excellent,'' the doctor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is 6 feet tall, weighed 192 1/2 pounds, had blood pressure  
``in the right arm sitting position'' of 104 over 80, pulse 38. 
``For a highly conditioned athlete, resting heart of 38 was 
considered to be normal,'' the doctor's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor said Bush -- a runner -- has excellent to superior  
cardiovascular fitness, no signs of coronary artery disease, good 
body weight and a low to very low coronary risk profile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the written summary, Cooper noted that Bush suffers ``some  
minor stiffness in his left knee, which he attributed to his 
exercise program. Also, some back stiffness was noted, particularly 
with running, but stretching controlled the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, Bush has been exercising regularly. He now runs  
three to four miles five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is taking no prescribed or self-prescribed medications,  
except supplemental vitamins and minerals, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's medical history includes minor surgery to his chest wall  
at age 13, an appendectomy at age 10, and he had arthroscopic knee 
surgery in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recovery from all surgeries was uncomplicated,'' the doctor  
wrote, ``and the only other surgical procedure was the removal of 
two benign polyps from his colon July 6, 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said the medical summary was being made public  
``in accordance with past presidential campaigns.'' Spokeswoman 
Mindy Tucker said the campaign had received two or three requests

<HEADLINE> Watson, Irwin Tee Off for TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Tom Watson shot a 4-under-par 68 to beat  
Hale Irwin and take home the $100,000 first prize on Tuesday in a 
made-for-television match at the Jasna Polona golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people watched the two play on a sunny, unseasonably  
warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a five-time British Open winner, led throughout the  
friendly match. His lead was as large as six strokes at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, 1998 Senior PGA Tour Player of the Year, and winner of  
three U.S. Opens, finished with a 1-under-par 71. He received 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was played for a segment of ``Shell's Wonderful World  
of Golf,'' to be aired Oct. 26 on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Down six strokes, Irwin closed the gap to three on the 17th when  
he birdied and Watson had a double-bogey 5. Both parred the 18th.

<HEADLINE> Antibiotic May Kill Resistant Germs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An antibiotic designed from scratch to  
attack germs in an entirely new way has proven effective in human 
tests and should soon give doctors a fresh weapon against 
drug-resistant bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers of the medicine, called Zyvox, say it is the first  
example of what they call the first new class of antibiotics in 
more than three decades. The drug appears effective against bugs 
that have grown resistant to all other medicines, including 
vancomycin, now the drug of last resort for lingering infections. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a crying need for new antibiotics'' for use against  
common but potentially deadly infections, said Dr. Jack Remington 
of Stanford University. Zyvox ``is the first new antibiotic in the 
world in 35 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox works only against gram-positive bacteria, so-called  
because of the way they turn purple when stained. More than half of 
all serious infections treated in hospitals worldwide are gram 
positive. These include staph, strep and enterococci bacteria that 
cause pneumonia and infections of the skin, bloodstream and urinary 
tract, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Often these infections are caught while patients are in the  
hospital for other things. They tend to be resistant to many of the 
standard antibiotics in use since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 patients have been treated so far with Zyvox, most  
of them in a variety of studies. However, the drug has also been 
given to 550 patients who could not use other antibiotics. Dr. 
Carol Kauffman of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Ann Arbor, 
Mich. said the drug cleared up the infection in three-quarters of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers presented the results of several large studies with  
the drug Monday at a conference sponsored by the American Society 
for Microbiology. Its maker, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, plans to seek 
approval for Zyvox from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and 
other regulatory agencies around the world by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox is likely to be reserved for particularly ill patients,  
especially those with bugs resistant to older drugs. It will join 
another new antibiotic, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's Synercid, which was 
approved by the FDA last week. Although available for the first 
time in the United States, Synercid is one of a class of 
antibiotics that has long been used in Europe as an additive to 
animal feeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers say Zyvox is entirely new. Because the drug will be  
different from anything that bacteria have encountered before, 
resistance should be rare, at least at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that resistance will be very slow to emerge,'' said  
Dr. George Eliopoulos of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in 
Boston. However, at least three cases of Zyvox resistance have 
already been seen during experimental use. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Zyvox studies outlined Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In 397 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, Zyvox plus  
aztreonam cured 66 percent of patients, compared with 68 percent on 
vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In treatment of 526 who caught pneumonia outside hospitals, 91  
percent got better on Zyvox, compared with 89 percent on 
cefpodoxime. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In 591 patients with complicated skin infections, Zyvox worked  
on 91 percent, compared with 86 percent on oxacillin. 
</P>
<P>
	-- For treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant staph  
bacteria, Zyvox succeeded in 77 percent of patients, compared with 
75 percent on vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Among 145 patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus,  
Zyvox worked in 89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox, known generically as linezolid, is the first of a class  
of drugs called oxazolidinones. Dr. Donald Batts of Pharmacia &AMP; 
Upjohn said the last entirely new category of antibiotics was the 
quinolones, discovered 35 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom May Get Brit Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators Tuesday  
approved Deutsche Telekom's $11 billion takeover of British 
mobile-phone operator One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition will not lead to any overlap on the market,''  
for mobile phones in Britain since Deutsche Telekom was not 
previously active there, the European Commission said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU executive body said its investigation also showed the  
takeover will not lead to a creation of an unfairly dominant 
position in Germany or on mobile calls between Britain and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of One2One was announced last  
month following the German company's failed attempt to merge with 
Telecom Italia. The deal with the smallest of Britain's four mobile 
phone companies was seen as a first step in a new international 
expansion effort by Deutsche Telekom in the increasingly global 
telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	About 95 percent of Telekom's annual sales come from the German  
market.

<HEADLINE> Browns Offense Looking for Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- In training camp, Cleveland Browns coach  
Chris Palmer presented his team with a playbook big enough to pass 
as a college textbook. 
</P>
<P>
	But after three games, it looks like his offense has only read  
the introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's offense has sputtered this season, and while each  
week's performance has been noticeably better, the Browns are still 
a long way from becoming a serious threat to most NFL defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a whole lot we've done that's been effective,''  
said fullback Marc Edwards. ``What is our bread and butter? We 
haven't found that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's for sure. The winless Browns are averaging just 6.3  
points a game, an offensive output equaled by baseball's Cleveland 
Indians, who have averaged 6.3 runs a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Browns' woes come down to poor execution.  
</P>
<P>
	Dropped passes, a harried quarterback and a poor running game --  
89 of Cleveland's paltry 192 yards rushing have come on scrambles 
by rookie quarterback Tim Couch -- all have kept Cleveland from 
developing an offensive rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of veterans even questioned Palmer's offensive  
strategy, which was supposed to be his strength coming into the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Leslie Shepherd, guilty of a couple of drops in  
Sunday's 17-10 loss to Baltimore, stopped short of calling the 
Browns predictable, but said Cleveland has to adjust better to how 
it's being defended. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a certain amount of plays you run each Sunday and the  
other team prepares to stop them,'' Shepherd said. ``If they throw 
a defense at you, you've got to make adjustments. Right now, we're 
not doing a good job of making adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We run a lot of the same plays. I'll tell Tim (Couch) they  
gave us a certain defensive look on one play and I was open. He'll 
come back and call the play again, and they'll roll the coverage 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has made no secret he's simplified his offense to  
accommodate Couch taking over for Ty Detmer after an opening 43-0 
loss to Pittsburgh, but he said Cleveland's problem ``isn't as much 
a matter of adjustments as it is execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Palmer's offensive decisions have been criticized by some  
as too conservative for an expansion team with nothing to lose, 
while others have second-guessed him for taking bad risks. 
</P>
<P>
	On their second possession Sunday, the Browns punted on  
fourth-and-1 from Baltimore's 39-yard line. Palmer explained later 
he thought the game would be low-scoring and didn't want to give up 
field position. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, Lomas Brown gave up a critical sack of  
Couch on the Browns 2 when Peter Boulware beat him with an outside 
rush. Couch fumbled, the Ravens recovered and went on to score a 
touchdown that made the score 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown questioned Palmer's decision to have Couch pass out of  
the shotgun with Cleveland facing a third-and-26 deep in its 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put a young quarterback in that position, having to  
make something big right there,'' Brown said. ``I know I'm going to 
get in trouble for this, but my whole thing is, we needed to run 
the ball, try a draw and kick it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many things going against you. You can't audible  
because the linemen can't hear you. It's all about punt and playing 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Cleveland, punting and playing defense have  
been what most of the first three games have been about.

<HEADLINE> Justice Hires 1st Science Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department hired its first chief  
science adviser Monday -- Donald Prosnitz, a physicist from the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz will be on a two-year detail as the department's chief  
science and technology adviser from the lab where he was the chief 
scientist for the Nonproliferation, Arms Control and International 
Security Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This newly created post enables us to consolidate the  
responsibility for technology policy in one position,'' Attorney 
General Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz is the second physicist drawn from the Energy  
Department's nuclear weapons laboratories to take a top Justice 
Department job. By coincidence, the laboratories currently are a 
focus of an FBI investigation into whether China stole secrets 
about U.S. nuclear warheads in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Donald M. Kerr Jr., a physicist-engineer who  
spent six years as chief of the government's Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, where nuclear weapons were designed, became assistant 
FBI director in charge of the bureau's crime laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief interview, Prosnitz said ``familiarity with the  
government'' might be the reason Justice has twice turned to the 
national laboratories for a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosnitz will advise Reno on research, development, procurement  
and legislation relating to technological issues like computer 
crime or the use of DNA evidence. Indeed, his first task was to 
attend a meeting of the department's advisory Commission on the 
Future of DNA Evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will serve as the department's liaison to the scientific  
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Prosnitz's wealth of education, experience and management  
in the scientific community make him the right person for the 
job,'' Reno said. ``He is well-suited to coordinate the Justice 
Department's efforts on complex and novel technological issues such 
as investigating computer crimes and threats to our critical 
infrastructure, the use of DNA evidence and forensic analysis 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was graduated from Yale University with a degree in  
engineering and applied science in 1970 and received his doctorate 
in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Bauer: Affair Gossip Is Outrage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer  
dismissed a gossip item about an alleged affair as ``disgusting'' 
and ``outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Daily News ran a gossip column Monday that read:  
``What presidential candidate is praying that a former secretary 
doesn't go public with her claim that he's been having an affair 
with a twentysomething woman?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed by the San Francisco Chronicle after the gossip  
piece appeared Monday, Bauer said he thought the Daily News was 
referring to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's supposed to be me. And it's disgusting,'' Bauer  
said. ``It almost makes me physically sick. My wife and I have been 
married for 27 years ... I have been loyal to her, and she's been 
loyal to me all those years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who might be the source of the rumors, Bauer refused to be  
specific but said, ``I think it's coming from the camp of one of my 
political opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer planned a news conference Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Slips in Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence weakened in September for  
the third consecutive month, suggesting that Federal Reserve moves 
to raise interest rates are cooling off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts looking at the Conference Board's survey results  
on Tuesday said they expect retail sales to remain strong as the 
holiday season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The report added to jitters on Wall Street, where stocks tumbled  
in afternoon trading, at one point pushing the Dow Jones industrial 
average down 222 points before it roared back, recovering nearly 
all its lost ground bit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow ended the day down 27.86 at 10,275.53.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the consumer confidence report was not a major  
influence on trading. Stocks have been retreating from record 
heights on worries about upcoming corporate earnings, interest 
rates and the decline of the dollar against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence,  
which is a measure of consumers' willingness to spend, dipped to 
134.2 in September, 1.8 percentage points lower than a revised 136 
reading in August. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a greater drop than analysts had expected; their  
prediction was 135.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists noted, however, that the latest level wasn't far  
below the June index peak of 139, which was the highest reading in 
more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the September dip, confidence levels are still at  
historically high levels,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the 
Conference Board's consumer research center. ``We anticipate no 
dramatic shifts soon in consumer spending patterns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the Washington-based  
National Retail Federation trade group, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employment is strong, income is strong, (consumer) confidence  
is still very high,'' she said. ``I don't see anything that will 
stop consumers from buying. I see a good holiday season upcoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is a closely watched indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has twice this year raised interest rates to  
try to keep the economy from overheating and to head off a 
resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers meet next on Oct. 5, and some economists  
believe they could raise rates again if retail sales continue to 
surge as they have in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald D. Cohen, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New  
York, said September's consumer confidence reading was consistent 
with predictions ``for some moderation in consumer spending over 
the next couple of quarters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``'Moderation' is the key word here,'' he added, suggesting  
there won't be a steep drop-off in retail sales this Christmas 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  
again before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary R. Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in  
St. Louis, said the September index ``shows some cooling'' in 
consumer confidence and added that ``I won't be surprised to see 
some further weakness in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This, he said, should be ``good news for the Fed'' and said  
there was just a 50-50 chance the Fed would raise rates before 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's report, which is based on a sample of  
5,000 American households, said consumer expectations about the 
future also weakened in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of expectations slipped to 105.7 this month from 109.2  
in August and was the lowest reading since March's 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 7.1 percent of respondents said they expected business  
conditions to worsen in the next six months, while 16.4 percent 
expected them to improve. The rest said they expected no change. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures were more pessimistic than in August. Employment  
expectations also declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the Conference Board, a business-financed research  
group, uses a baseline of 100, set in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Court OK's Bilingual Education Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a ruling that strengthens a  
voter-approved ban on bilingual education, a California appeals 
court has held that only parents -- not entire school districts -- 
may apply for exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Monday from the 1st District Court of Appeal said  
Proposition 227, a 1998 ballot measure approved by 61 percent of 
the voters, prohibits school districts from gaining waivers that 
would allow them to keep bilingual programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court overturned a judge's decision that the state  
Board of Education must consider waivers sought by numerous 
districts where support for bilingual classes was strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, still controlled by appointees of former Republican  
Gov. Pete Wilson, has not approved any district-wide waivers and 
argues it has no authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Only parents, with the approval of their children's teachers and  
schools, can obtain waivers allowing students to continue to learn 
English and other subjects in their native language, the court 
said. Waivers are available only if a child is older than 10 or has 
``special needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court ``recognized that Proposition 227 was meant to empower  
parents, not school boards and school administrators,'' said 
attorney Eric Grant of the Pacific Legal Foundation, which 
represented two anti-bilingual education groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Schulkind, a lawyer for three San Francisco Bay area  
districts seeking waivers, said the ruling ``is not good for 
districts, but more important, it's not good for kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a longstanding state law that was designed to  
preserve local control of schools, and was not mentioned in 
Proposition 227. The law allows the state Board of Education to 
waive virtually any statewide educational law at a district's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said the proposition, which condemns  
bilingual education and grants parents the sole power to seek 
waivers from English-only instruction, could not be reconciled with 
a waiver allowing entire districts to keep bilingual classes.

	LEESBURG, Ala. (AP) -- Comedian Jeff Foxworthy's father, Jim  
Foxworthy, was killed Monday when the car he was driving collided 
with a truck on a rain-slickened road in this east Alabama town. He 
was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Terrell Ransum said Foxworthy was alone in his  
vehicle at the time of the accident. Two men in the truck suffered 
minor injuries.

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Retired golf pro U.C. Ferguson Jr., who  
taught former Women's U.S. Open champion Susie Maxwell Berning, 
died Sunday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson was credited with building Lincoln Park Golf Course  
into one of the country's best public courses. He worked at the 
course for 61 years and taught many of Oklahoma City's junior 
golfers how to play the game.

<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Don Sanders, a former Senate lawyer  
who revealed the existence of a recording system in Richard Nixon's 
White House, died Sunday after a long battle with cancer. He was 
69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders had returned to his home state in the 1980s after more  
than two decades of federal government service -- as a lawyer for 
congressional committees, as an FBI agent and as an assistant 
secretary of defense under President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the GOP staff lawyer on the Senate Watergate  
Committee who first asked then-presidential aide Alexander 
Butterfield whether there was a recording system in Nixon's White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	After Butterfield confirmed that there was, Sanders said he  
rushed to tell Fred Thompson, the lead minority counsel and now a 
Republican senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1959 to 1969, Sanders was an FBI agent. In 1969, he started  
working as a lawyer for congressional committees.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down, Gold Continues Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was mostly lower today against  
other major currencies in European trading. Gold prices extended 
Monday's sharp increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0473, up from $1.0440 Monday.  
</P>

<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6475, down from $1.6478.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no

<HEADLINE> NYC Exhibit Becomes Political Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying its ideals were ``not on the bargaining  
table,'' the Brooklyn Museum of Art denied caving in to demands 
from the mayor that it pull a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin 
Mary from an upcoming exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid conflicting assertions that a compromise had been worked  
out, Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the debate and chastised Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely opponent in the race for a U.S. Senate 
seat next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to penalize and punish an institution  
such as the Brooklyn Museum,'' Mrs. Clinton said Monday during an 
appearance at a Harlem school. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said she shares ``the feeling that I know many New  
Yorkers have that there are parts of this exhibit that would be 
deeply offensive. I would not go to see this exhibit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of cultural and political spectacle is the British  
show, ``Sensation,'' which includes ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' a 
painting by Chris Ofili depicting Mary with dark skin, African 
features and flowing robes. It has shellacked clumps of elephant 
dung and dozens of cutouts of female private parts from 
pornographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic leaders have denounced the work as blasphemous,  
and Giuliani accused the first lady of supporting the use of public 
money to attack Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor had promised to freeze $7 million in public funding to  
the museum because he considered the show -- which also features 
bisected animals and a topless woman in the place of Jesus at the 
Last Supper -- ``sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Rubin, chairman of the museum's board of directors, met  
on Monday with city officials to try to end the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A Giuliani administration source who spoke on condition of  
anonymity said Rubin offered: to remove the painting from the 
exhibition; to display six objectionable works separately from the 
rest of the exhibit; and to sacrifice one-fifth of the museum's 
city funding for as long as the show remains on display. The 
exhibit occupies one-fifth of the museum's floor space. 
</P>
<P>
	But the museum denied that any deal had been reached.  
</P>
<P>
	``A number of possible resolutions were looked at, but there was  
and is no agreement of any kind,'' the museum said in a statement. 
``The museum is planning to open `Sensation' on Saturday as 
scheduled and as planned. The BMA remains committed to resolving 
the dispute, but the ideals of the institution are not on the 
bargaining table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement would have to be approved by the museum's board of  
trustees. A message left at the museum was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	City Hall declared victory in the dispute, which infuriated many  
in the artistic community who say public officials should not have 
veto power over museum exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the artist, he said in today's New York Times that the  
elephant dung is a cultural reference to his African heritage and 
that the uproar seemed ``very distant and confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel as though I have to defend it,'' Ofili, 31, said  
of the painting. ``The people who are attacking this painting are 
attacking their own interpretation, not mine. You never know what's 
going to offend people.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes D.C. Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed Congress' budget for  
the District of Columbia on Tuesday because Congress added numerous 
``unacceptable'' restrictions ``that prevent local residents from 
making their own decisions about local matters,'' he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget as drafted on Capitol Hill would, for example,  
prevent the district from spending its own funds to lobby for 
voting rights for its citizens and undermine a local medicinal 
marijuana initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	But Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and  
Budget, said Clinton acted to defend the principle of home rule, 
not in response to any individual restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about the ins and outs of each rider,'' she said.  
``This is about permitting the local residents of the District of 
Columbia to make their own decisions about local matters the way 
that any citizen of any other city in America is entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the measure would govern how the district could spend  
the entire $5.1 billion budget, the federal government would 
provide less than one-tenth of the total, $429 million, with local 
taxes and fees providing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have prevented the city from allowing the use of  
marijuana for medical purposes despite a Nov. 3 referendum -- 
approved by 69 percent of the voters -- that backed such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would have required the National Park Service to  
implement an earlier decision allowing towers to be built in Rock 
Creek Park for cellular phone use. Local leaders and 
environmentalists have objected.

<HEADLINE> Oil Billionaire Ends NFL Team Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Billionaire oilman Marvin Davis, who  
considered writing a huge check for an NFL stadium and team, has 
instead ended his bid for an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spoke with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and other NFL  
officials recently about the possibility of building a stadium at 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	The price for a stadium and franchise fee reportedly would have  
topped $1 billion, which would have been the league's first 
billion-dollar deal for a team and facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that his company has investments in gambling turned out  
to be the deciding factor in Davis' decision to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recently, we were told by NFL officials that they believed  
team owners would likely vote for acceptance of our proposal to 
bring an NFL team to Los Angeles if our family would dispose of all 
of its gaming interests,'' Davis said in a statement issued 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal to the league was that the team would belong to the  
Davis Children Family Trust, which has no gambling investments. The 
74-year-old Davis apparently wanted the franchise for his sons, 
Gregg and John. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (NFL officials) said they knew that I would have no  
involvement in the ownership of the team and that the trust had no 
gaming interests,'' Davis said. ``But they also knew that there 
were certain owners who, nevertheless, would vote against our being 
granted the franchise unless all our gaming interests were 
divested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not want to do that.  
</P>
<P>
	``While we may not agree with the NFL's position, we understand  
it. We are sorry we couldn't make an LA NFL team a reality,'' Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had paid $100,000 for an option on some 100 acres at  
Hollywood Park, near the horse racing track. The option was due to 
expire last Friday unless he put up another $250,000, but he was 
granted an extension by Hollywood Park Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had expressed interest in buying sports teams previously,  
but did not complete a deal. In past years, his name has been 
linked to efforts to buy the Denver Broncos, Dallas Cowboys and 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis began talking with NFL officials after the league, which  
had been dealing exclusively with backers of the LA Coliseum, began 
soliciting other potential stadium sites and owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, which has a stadium and financing plan ready to go, is  
favored to get the expansion franchise that will be the league's 
32nd team. The NFL also seems determined to have a team in Los 
Angeles, and may consider moving an existing team to the LA area 
within the next few years.

	Grandparents Rights To Be Decided  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set the stage today for a  
ruling on grandparents' rights to see their grandchildren even when 
parents object -- a case that could affect laws in all 50 states. 
The nine justices -- six of them with grandchildren of their own -- 
agreed to decide whether a state can give visitation rights to 
grandparents when, after a divorce or other family split, the 
children's parents say no. The case involves Washington state, 
where the state's highest court ruled that such a law violates 
parents' ``fundamental right'' to rear their families without 
governmental interference. All other states have similar laws. 

</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court To Review Rape Law  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to review the  
constitutionality of a federal law that lets rape victims sue their 
attackers. It may test how far Congress can go in fighting sex 
discrimination. The justices, who have curtailed Congress in recent 
years, will decide whether a former Virginia Tech student, Christy 
Brzonkala, can sue two college football players under the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act. She says they raped her. A federal 
appeals court had thrown out the lawsuit. 

</P>
<P>
	Encephalitis May Migrate Via Birds  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rare African strain of encephalitis that has  
already killed four people around New York City could spread to 
other parts of the country as infected birds fly south for the 
winter, health officials said. The virus is transmitted to humans 
by mosquitoes that have bitten infected birds. New York City and 
New Jersey have been spraying pesticides to kill mosquitoes, and 
scientists in southern states are testing dead birds there for the 
virus. The African strain has never before been seen in the Western 
Hemisphere.

<P>
	Bradley Offers Health Care Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
proposed a $65 billion plan today for universal access to health 
insurance. His plan would require coverage for all children, with 
subsidies for families that cannot afford it. Under Bradley's plan, 
individuals of all ages and incomes also would be able to exclude 
from their taxable income whatever they pay for health premiums. 
Parents would also be required to obtain health insurance for their 
children. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Moved by Forgiveness  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after confessing to sin and apologizing  
for scandal, President Clinton said today he has been profoundly 
moved ``by the pure power of grace'' and forgiveness from his 
family, associates and American citizens. ``Last year was one of 
the most difficult years in my life,'' Clinton told ministers 
gathered at the White House for Clinton's annual prayer breakfast. 
At the same event last September, a moist-eyed Clinton apologized 
for the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-cover-up scandal that later led to 
his impeachment in the House and acquittal in the Senate. 

</P>
<P>
	House OKs Stopgap Spending Measure  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eyeing Friday's start of fiscal 2000, the  
House today approved a stopgap measure that will keep federal 
agencies functioning for three weeks as President Clinton and 
Republicans sort through spending disputes. Prior to the vote, 
Democrats blamed unyielding Republican demands for Congress' 
failure to complete most of the 13 spending bills on time, a 
failure that is nearly an annual event. 

</P>
<P>
	Study: Students Can't Write Well  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About three-fourths of the nation's school  
children demonstrated only partial mastery of the knowledge and 
skills needed to write proficiently for their grade level, the 
Education Department reported today. Testers asked 60,000 
fourth-graders, eighth-graders and 12th-graders to write stories, 
personal essays, reports about events or experiences and persuasive 
pieces. Roughly one-fourth of the students in each grade level were 
at least proficient.

in the afternoon. It marked the Dow's fifth drop in six sessions. 
Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
1,898-1,232. The Nasdaq composite index was off 5.48 at 2,756.27.

	Las Vegas Seeks NHL, NBA Teams  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman spent today  
visiting NBA commissioner David Stern and NHL commissioner Gary 
Bettman, hoping the leagues will consider his city for franchises. 
Neither the NHL or NBA is considering any expansion and both 
Bettman and Stern said their leagues had no teams seeking to switch 
cities. Gambling is a particularly thorny issue with the NBA. 
Basketball betting accounts for 23 percent of the total sports 
handle in Las Vegas, according to Vegas Sports Consultants, which 
helps set betting lines for sports books.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plummet; Dow Down 148.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted today, falling for the fifth  
time in the past six sessions as traders' concerns about interest 
rates intensified. Buying was scarce amid the paucity of positive 
economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	At late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 148.49 at 10,154.90 after having fallen more than 
222 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow slipped more than 200 points in two separate sessions  
last week, and finished the week down 524.30, its biggest weekly 
point loss ever. Only bargain-hunting provided a short-lived uptick 
in the market on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell markedly today. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 13.93 at 1,269.38, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was off 41.71 at 2,720.04. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn was particularly severe in the oil, financial  
services and computer sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is suffering from a vacuum of positive  
information,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist 
at Advest Inc of Hartford, Conn. ``There's no incentives to buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, investors have to deal with concerns of rising  
interest rates and gold prices and uncertainty regarding the value 
of the dollar vs. the Japanese yen. Although the surge in gold 
prices the past two days has helped gold mining concerns, it also 
may heighten inflation fears, Shaughnessy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a research group, said today that consumer  
confidence dipped in September for a third consecutive month. The 
drop was larger than economists had expected, and may be a sign 
that consumer spending will slow. That could in turn influence the 
Fed against boosting interest rates to cool off the economy when 
its policy-setting Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer confidence report did little to move the  
markets, which remained anxious and unsettled before the Fed 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a water-torture type of correction,'' said Alfred  
Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. 
Louis, of the market's recent performance. Goldman said the Dow 
rose 46 percent from early October through last April, and has been 
in a correction ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while there is some uncertainty on Wall Street  
about interest rates, most traders expect the Federal Reserve to 
leave interest rates alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard, down 3 to 93 1/8, and General Electric, down 3  
1/16 to 116 3/4, led the Dow lower. Exxon was off 1 13/16 at 73 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and financial services companies showed little reaction to  
the latest merger in the sector. Shares of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist were 
up 7 11/16 to 48 3/4, after Chase Manhattan said it would buy the 
brokerage operation, but Chase was off 1 1/4 to 72 7/8, and other bank 
stocks were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, whose recent weakness was a factor in the market's  
big decline last week, held steady against the Japanese yen today. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, off 1 5/8 to 76 9/16, and Microsoft, off 1 3/16 to 90 1/4, were  
among the falling technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, the largest U.S. health insurer, fell 6 7/16 to 60 1/2 on  
concern the company's profits will be hurt by the purchase of 
Prudential HealthCare it bought earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 686.56 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 5.77 at 416.05.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fines Hall of Famer Tarkenton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton was  
among those cited Tuesday when the SEC announced enforcement 
actions against 68 people and companies for alleged accounting 
fraud, including creating phony invoices and inflating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkenton, the former head of a computer software company,  
agreed to settle by paying a $100,000 fine without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC called the series of civil fraud actions its first  
``coordinated assault on financial reporting misdeeds.'' Arthur 
Levitt, chairman of the market watchdog agency, has been pushing 
publicly traded companies to improve their financial reporting and 
avoid manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the cases involved a ``cookbook of recipes'' for  
fraudulent accounting, including reporting income from shipments 
that never were made, shipping products without customers wanting 
them, creating phony invoices and inflating the value of 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarkenton's case, he and 10 other former executives of his  
computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were 
accused by the SEC of fraudulently inflating by millions of dollars 
the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 
30, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $100,000 fine, the former Minnesota Vikings  
and New York Giants quarterback also agreed in his settlement to 
pay $54,187 in restitution. The money will go to a federal court, 
and shareholders of the company might make claims to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based KnowledgeWare merged with another software company  
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tarkenton is pleased to have this matter resolved,'' his  
attorney, Robert Thornton, said in a statement. ``The events in 
question took place about five or six years ago ... He has long 
since moved on with his life to other business ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the SEC took action against 15 companies whose stock is  
publicly traded, some of whom are in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Current or former chief executive officers of 11 of the 15 
companies are among the individuals named by the SEC in the fraud 
charges.

<HEADLINE> Woman Awarded $40M in Rail Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Union Pacific Railroad Co. and Amtrak  
have been ordered to pay a Missouri woman $40.4 million for a 1997 
crossing accident that left her with brain damage and more than 20 
broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jackson County jury ruled Monday that Union Pacific was 75  
percent at fault and Amtrak 25 percent as it awarded actual damages 
to Kimberly Alcorn, 34. The mother of two teen-agers suffered brain 
damage, broken bones and disfiguring injuries, her lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific acted ``with complete indifference to or conscious  
disregard for the safety of others,'' according to the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found Union Pacific liable for punitive damages,  
which could add millions to what lawyers say is already Missouri's 
largest award for a rail-crossing accident. That phase of the trial 
was to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad attorneys declined to comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	State officials allegedly told the company 11 months before the  
1997 accident that the crossing was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyer Grant L. Davis told jurors that Ms. Alcorn  
lived with extreme pain because Union Pacific waited for state aid 
instead of paying $200,000 for lights and gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about corporate greed,'' Davis said. ``It's about  
putting dollars ahead of lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers also relied on testimony that Amtrak engineers did not  
apply brakes until after the train hit the car Ms. Alcorn was in. 
The train was traveling at 65 mph to 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, an attorney for the rail companies, told jurors:  
``You can see a train if you look.'' He suggested the accident was 
the fault of Curtis Edwards, the driver of the car hit by the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Rollins represented Edwards, who was driving Ms.  
Alcorn back to Sedalia after they visited an Independence mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins said that a sign which warned of a railway crossing was  
in a ditch and that Edwards did not know he was approaching the 
crossing. Rollins cited the testimony of area residents who said 
that it was hard to see a train even if they stopped and looked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins said Union Pacific's attitude was ``we run the trains,  
we make the money ... but we're not responsible for safety.''

<HEADLINE> Residents Comb the Ashes After Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- David Redlich and his two sons had  
turned down an invitation for a Sunday outing to an amusement park, 
a decision that probably saved the lives of Faith and Bud, their 
dogs, and pet rat Charity. 
</P>
<P>
	When a sudden fire caused by sparks from a dragging trailer ramp  
blew through their semirural Happy Valley neighborhood, Redlich was 
able to bring the animals along to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	His mobile home and his mother's behind it were destroyed Sunday  
along with 37 others when gusting winds pushed the fire through the 
community of modest houses, ranchettes and mobile homes. Flames 
also scorched 2,000 acres and leveled at least 43 outbuildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was started by sparks from a loading ramp on a trailer  
being pulled by a pickup truck, said Kevin Colburn, a California 
Department of Forestry spokesman. The sparks caused several fires 
that combined. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was contained early Monday, and residents were allowed  
back to salvage valuables. Redlich and Rachael Hanks used a rake, 
its wooden handle burned off, in an unsuccessful search for her 
jewelry box. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks and her son had gone to the amusement park on Sunday. She  
was thankful Redlich had saved their pets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was here to get the dogs out,'' she said. Had Redlich been  
gone, ``we would have really lost something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redlich found a charred shotgun his late father left him, and  
retrieved his wife's wedding ring in the ashes of what used to be 
the bathroom. She and the couple's daughter were in Pennsylvania 
visiting relatives Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Trinity Alps Wilderness north of Redding, firefighters  
reported progress against two lightning-triggered wildfires that 
have burned more than 65,300 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central California coast, fires have burned more than  
46,000 acres. High temperatures on Monday and Big Sur's steep 
slopes made firefighting difficult, spokesman Mark Savage said.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Japanese Bank To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An international investment group plans to acquire  
debt-laden Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in what would be the 
first foreign acquisition of a major Japanese bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal disclosed today represents a step forward in the  
government's efforts to clean up loan problems that has suffocated 
the banking industry since Japanese property prices collapsed in 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission announced it had  
approved the deal, and that the investment group organized by the 
private U.S. equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC had signed a 
memorandum of understanding on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood, based in New York City, has specialized in buying  
struggling small-to-midsize companies and making them profitable. 
It hopes to reach a final deal for LTCB by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	Other proposed investors in the New LTCB include GE Capital  
Corp., Mellon Bank Corp., ABN-Amro Bank, PaineWebber Group and 
Deutsche Bank. Former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker is 
a senior advisor to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies like Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui  
Trust and Banking Co. had been in the running to acquire LTCB. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's biggest banks, was nationalized last  
October after regulators determined it would never recover from a 
mountain of bad loans. It was the first time the Japanese 
government had taken over a bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to restore LTCB to its former status as a premier  
financial institution as quickly as possible, so it can contribute 
to the financial stability of Japan,'' said LTCB's new chairman and 
chief executive, Masamoto Yashiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government will inject $2.26 billion into a  
reformed LTCB on condition that the Ripplewood group continue loans 
to the bank's troubled borrowers, according to an FCR official who 
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners will acquire LTCB shares by paying $9.43 million  
to the Deposit Insurance Corp., the Japanese government finance 
body which is now LTCB's sole shareholder, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashiro, formerly a non-executive chairman of Citicorp Japan,  
said that the new bank will try to expand its individual and 
corporate business. It will remain a Japanese-oriented bank in the 
initial years, Yashiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said eight of the 15 top board members are expected to be  
Japanese ``because they would understand the Japanese market 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Collins, founder of Ripplewood who will join LTCB's  
board, said he hoped to play a role in Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said that although there are structural problems in  
Japan's economy, he wanted to ``find an area to restructure the 
Japanese economy and provide strategic advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal was likely to have a positive impact on  
Japan's inefficient banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ripplewood will take it through restructuring you haven't seen  
here, and there will be big pressure on others to follow suit,'' 
said James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	FRC chief Hakuo Yanagisawa welcomed the deal. ``Japanese  
financial institutions are far worse than Western counterparts in 
profitability,'' he said. ``New LTCB made it clear they will focus 
on fixing this problem. We hope this will become reality and affect 
(other Japanese financial institutions) positively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB and the Ripplewood group hope to reach a final agreement by  
Nov. 30, and the government may extend the period if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FRC, a Japanese government body overseeing banking industry  
reform, has been discussing LTCB's transfer since the middle of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is likely to speed up the process of opening Japan's  
financial industry to foreign firms, a pillar of the country's 
financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the government's commitment to creating a level  
playing field, and that it and won't even let nationalism get in 
the way of what needs to be done,'' ING Barings' Fiorillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan collapsed in 
the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Avoiding Divorce Queries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a  
congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep 
lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest twist in the Gingriches' bitter divorce fight,  
lawyers for Marianne Gingrich charged in court papers Monday that 
Gingrich ``willfully failed and refused to answer virtually each 
and every interrogatory concerning his personal and professional 
relationships as well as the finances of his marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in motions filed last week in Superior Court for the  
District of Columbia, Callista Bisek, a clerk for the House 
Agriculture Committee, asked a judge to overturn a Georgia court 
order requiring her to answer questions about her relationship with 
Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	No hearing has been set, but Ms. Bisek's scheduled appearance  
Wednesday for questioning by Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers likely will be 
postponed until her motions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers filed in Marietta, Ga., where the Gingriches lived,  
show that Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed 32 sets of questions to 
Gingrich, including one about sexual relationships with other 
women. He answered parts of only two sets of the questions that 
dealt with sources of his income and retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich  
gave Ms. Bisek money or spent the couple's money on her. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Evans, Gingrich's lawyer, said Georgia divorce law limits  
each side to 50 questions, and with the 32 questions and their 
subparts Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed more than 150. 
</P>
<P>
	``We answered 50 and told them if they want more than that, they  
need to follow the rules,'' said Evans. ``There has been no refusal 
to answer. It's just that we're going to go by the rules the best 
we can. Otherwise, this thing will spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But John Mayou, attorney for Mrs. Gingrich, said using the  
50-question rule is simply ``a ploy not to answer legitimate 
questions.'' In his court filing, he described the position taken 
by Gingrich's lawyers as ``preposterous and unsupported by any 
authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans characterized the accusations as ``litigation saber  
rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute will be decided by a Superior Court judge in  
Marietta, after a hearing that has yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving to block her testimony, Ms. Bisek argued that her  
constitutional right to privacy would be violated if Mrs. 
Gingrich's attorneys were allowed ``to rummage through every aspect 
of her personal life without any meaningful restrictions or 
limitations of any nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also argued that she cannot be required to testify about her  
relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition 
against self-incrimination, because adultery is a crime in the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena to Ms. Bisek requests documents and other items  
dating from January 1995, when Gingrich became speaker. They 
include cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms. 
Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone 
records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; 
photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video 
recordings of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requests any of Gingrich's clothes or other  
personal items in Ms. Bisek's possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, was separated from his wife of 18 years on May 10  
and filed for divorce July 29. The Gingriches reached an agreement 
this month on how to temporarily split their assets until the 
divorce is final.

<HEADLINE> AOL, China.com Launch AOL Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- America Online Inc. and China.com launched AOL  
Hong Kong on Tuesday amid concerns over the Chinese government's 
threat to enforce a ban on foreign investment in Web-based ventures 
on the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, the U.S. Internet access provider with 18 million users  
worldwide, refused to put a value on the deal that will offer 
Chinese and English-language content designed for local Hong Kong 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chief Executive Steve Case said his company hoped to expand  
from Hong Kong into mainland China, playing down recent remarks by 
China's information minister, Wu Jichuan, on enforcing a ban on 
foreign investment in Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a matter of time before the markets there open up  
and Internet companies of all sorts are able to provide their 
services,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Case said he would have a better idea of the opportunities for  
investing in China after talking with Wu and other Chinese leaders 
on his next stop in Shanghai where he's also planning to meet Hong 
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that foreign companies are going ahead with  
investments despite Wu's threat, Yahoo! Inc. of the U.S. launched a 
China-based Internet site on Friday with a local partner. 
</P>
<P>
	China has banned foreign ownership of telecommunications and  
Internet companies for several years, but largely ignored the 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule two years ago and is  
largely autonomous, is exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Yip, of China.com, which was recently listed on the Nasdaq  
index in the United States, said the partnership hopes to work with 
the Hong Kong government in its goal to become ``the information 
gateway'' to mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory has been trying to revamp itself as a  
high-technology hub in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com's affiliate China Internet Corp. and StarEastNet.com,  
a Hong Kong-based self-styled ``web of the stars,'' also teamed up 
with AOL for its new venture. Film star Jackie Chan, a director of 
Star East, was set to participate in a live chat on AOL Hong Kong 
later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL owns an 8 percent stake of China.com. Other key shareholders  
are China's state news agency, Xinhua, with a 10.9 percent, and 
Hong Kong-based New World Infrastructure, with 18.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a spotty track record, China.com, with its perfect name  
playing on the hype of both China and the Internet, attracted a 
hoard of investors when it went public in mid-July. The Hong 
Kong-based company was the first Chinese-language Internet company 
to list in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new Hong Kong venture, AOL offers services in 14  
countries in six languages.

<HEADLINE> Sony To Close Boca Raton Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Sony Electronics is closing a factory  
that makes broadcast equipment, eliminating 200 jobs as it moves 
the work overseas to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony opened the factory in 1991 in Boca Raton where it makes  
large digital broadcast studio cameras for television networks and 
commercial stations as well as professional broadcast editing 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the 116,800-square-foot plant was Sony's main  
manufacturing site outside Japan for audio and visual recording 
equipment. Now, the work will be transferred to other plants, 
primarily in the United Kingdom and Japan, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees will be offered severance pay, retraining assistance  
and possible job transfers to Sony's nine other manufacturing 
plants around United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer electronics and entertainment company is closing  
the plant as part of a restructuring announced in March. The 
company said it would lay off 17,000 of its 170,000 employees and 
cut its manufacturing plants from 70 to 55 during the next four 
years.

<HEADLINE> Cards' McGee Indicates He'll Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The end of the line is near for St. Louis  
Cardinals outfielder Willie McGee, who indicated Tuesday that he'd 
retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't honestly see myself playing anymore,''  
McGee said. ``Just like anything else, it hits you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee was a World Series hero as a rookie in 1982. He was the NL  
MVP in 1985, when he batted .353 with 216 hits for another World 
Series team, and with five games to go in this season he had a 
career .295 batting average. He has won two NL batting champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be 41 in November and his performance has slipped the past  
two years. More than anything, McGee, who's been mulling retirement 
the last three years, has lost the inner fire to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like I've got things to offer, but it's one thing  
to be able to play physically and another thing to want to be 
there, want to go through the grind,'' McGee said. ``It's the 
traveling that gets you. Mentally, I'm not going to be the player I 
once was, and I'm realizing that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee was traded late in 1990 because he was about to become a  
free agent and the Cardinals were worried about salary escalation. 
Since returning in 1996 he's been perhaps the team's most popular 
player -- even more so than home run king Mark McGwire. A sighting 
of McGee, head down and bat in hand, has routinely drawn huge 
ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, he's had trouble living up to that noise, batting .253  
last year and hitting .256 with no homers and 20 RBIs in 266 
at-bats heading into the final homestand this season. Perhaps most 
telling, he's 8-for-47 as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said McGee would have a job next season if  
he wanted one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie's always harder on his performance than the rest of  
us,'' La Russa said. ``He always thinks he did less than we think 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But La Russa said he wouldn't try to talk McGee into coming  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows himself,'' La Russa said. ``That's one of the worst  
things you can do, lay a guilt trip on him. You just let him know 
that he's done better than he thinks he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee would rather make room for a young player on the roster  
than hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got guys like Craig Paquette, Thomas Howard and Marcus  
Jensen that can do the same thing I can do and they've got that 
hunger and that fire,'' McGee said. ``I've got 18 years of this. 
Their candle is just being lit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, McGee expressed an interest in coaching  
and ultimately managing. He wants to remain in the game in some 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game, and I've always loved it,'' McGee said. ``I  
love talking to these young guys. I wish there was a role in 
baseball where you could come in and just deal with the mental 
aspects.''

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Dealing on Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republican leaders tried to  
break a logjam on an agricultural spending bill by offering 
farm-state lawmakers a compromise that would provide $8.7 billion 
to financially stressed producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, within the week we'll have an agreement,'' Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed deal would add $1.2 billion in disaster relief to  
an aid package approved by the Senate in August and omit dairy and 
trade provisions that has delayed passage of the farm bailout for 
the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the Republicans could get necessary  
support for the deal in the House-Senate conference committee that 
would have to approve the final version of the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal won a major convert on the panel, Rep. Tom Latham,  
R-Iowa, when House leaders agreed to add a provision to require 
meatpackers to start reporting prices they pay for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups complained that the disaster relief remains  
insufficient, and Democrats reacted angrily to word of the proposed 
agreement, complaining that they had been excluded from the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to write the bill with a few leaders and a few  
staffers. In the end, we will not be able to produce good 
legislation,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, a member of the 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've not seen the package. Never heard of it,'' said another  
of the panel's Democrats, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The House leadership floated a similar proposal last week but  
was rebuffed by farm organizations and members of the conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to removing any mention of dairy policy, the  
proposed deal would kill a Senate amendment that would allow sales 
of food and medicine to Cuba and make it difficult for a president 
to include such items in future embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dairy dispute involves an Agriculture Department overhaul of  
milk pricing that is scheduled to take effect Friday. Lawmakers in 
the South and East want to use the spending bill to block the new 
system, as well as win congressional authority for states to get 
together to set prices. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one major farm organization, the American Farm Bureau  
Federation, urged lawmakers Tuesday to reject the proposed deal 
because it failed to include the dairy and trade provisions or 
enough money to cover farmers' weather-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had raised objections to both the  
dairy and trade measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott was under pressure from a fellow Republican, Sen. James  
Jeffords of Vermont, to insist on the dairy measure because it 
would keep alive a New England pricing compact that will otherwise 
end this week. Jeffords is up for re-election in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But by Tuesday afternoon, Jeffords had all but given up his  
effort. Asked what he was doing to save the New England compact, he 
replied, ``Praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was discussion of putting the dairy issue to a separate  
vote in the Senate this week, but that appeared to be doomed with 
the threat of a filibuster by Wisconsin senators who support USDA's 
new pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is ever over, but it appears to me that the odds of  
the (dairy) policy changing via legislation are not good,'' said 
Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind.

<HEADLINE> Vols' Coach Downplays Distractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A loss to Florida, a near-loss to lowly  
Memphis, the arrest of starting cornerback Dwayne Goodrich and now 
an academic fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough 10 days for coach Phillip Fulmer and defending  
national champion Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer insisted Tuesday the problems off the field won't be a  
distraction when Auburn (3-1 overall, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) 
visits the No. 7 Vols (2-1, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``The season's just starting,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer wouldn't discuss accusations of academic fraud, which is  
the subject of an internal investigation by the university's 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said it obtained internal memos that show high-level  
administrators in Tennessee's athletic department were told of four 
tutors who may have done schoolwork for at least five football 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the information was passed on to campus authorities  
charged with investigating possible rules infractions, according to 
Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations are proven, Tennessee could face punishment  
by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Four redshirt freshmen, including kick returner and NCAA  
champion sprinter Leonard Scott, were held out of the Memphis game 
on Saturday and placed on indefinite suspension as a result of the 
school's internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, Goodrich, one of the team captains, was arrested  
early Sunday and charged with disorderly conduct. Police allege he 
was drunk and threatened officers who asked him to leave a 
convenience store near campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer announced Tuesday that Goodrich is suspended from  
Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwayne is a fine young man who made an error in judgment,''  
Fulmer said. ``He apologized to the team without me asking him to, 
and looks forward to having this incident behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich said he ``thoroughly respects'' Fulmer's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think coach Fulmer handled it real well. We run a clean  
program here and I totally respect his decision,'' Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's problems off the field come as the team looks to  
regroup and regain confidence after a 23-21 loss to arch-rival 
Florida and 17-16 victory over Memphis in which the Tigers (1-3) 
outplayed the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fortunate to be 2-1,'' Fulmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer said the Vols' problems on the field start with him and  
include every coach and player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all accountable,'' he said. ``It's everybody's fault.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said the problems in the Memphis game, in which the Vols  
managed just 10 first downs and 216 yards, were a combination of 
poor play by the Vols and good defense by the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Vols were lackluster all week in practice and played  
that way coming off the emotional loss at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to pay attention to detail from a coaching standpoint,  
and make sure the players are listening,'' he said. ``It does no 
good for the coaches to know something if the players don't. It's 
mostly offensively. Our defense has played pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the offense has struggled at times. Although the Vols  
drove 78 yards in seven plays in the waning minutes to get the 
victory over Memphis, tailback Jamal Lewis was held to a career-low 
45 yards and quarterback Tee Martin was mediocre outside the final 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor contributing to the slow start goes beyond the  
last two weeks, Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't assume just because you're good one year you'll be  
good the next,'' he said. ``I think that was part of the problem.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are easing House-approved  
cuts in President Clinton's plans for education and other social 
programs, but they still face clashes over many of the White 
House's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee planned to vote today on a  
$324 billion social spending bill for fiscal 2000, which begins 
Friday. The measure, approved Monday by a subcommittee, would 
outspend Clinton on education by $500 million, but provide less 
than he wants for hiring teachers, after-school centers and some of 
his other favorite initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very tough line between what I think the president  
will sign and what I can sell'' to congressional Republicans, the 
subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said in an 
interview. ``It is a devilishly difficult judgment play, but I 
think we're on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by the new fiscal year, GOP leaders planned to push a 
compromise $21 billion energy and water projects measure through 
the Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, which would be the fifth to be sent to Clinton, was  
likely to get his signature after Republicans dropped language that 
would have helped developers and local governments file quicker 
legal appeals when the government blocks them from building on 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure Monday by 327-87. Even so, Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson criticized Republicans for ``severe 
cuts'' in Clinton's requests for security of plutonium and 
computers and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step, House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise  
$12.6 billion foreign aid measure for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators dropped language barring aid to groups that  
lobby to ease overseas abortion restrictions, a defeat for 
anti-abortion conservatives. But the bill contained $2 billion less 
than Clinton wanted, cuts that prompted an administration veto 
threat when they were proposed in earlier versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress certain to fail to send Clinton all the spending  
measures by Friday, lawmakers planned votes as early as today on a 
stopgap bill that would keep agencies functioning through Oct. 21. 
White House budget chief Jack Lew said the president would sign the 
bill, but warned that Republicans should be under ``no illusion'' 
that he would sign several short-term measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already threatened to veto the House's version  
of the education-health-labor bill, citing its cuts in his plans 
for job training for teen-agers, hiring teachers, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill eased many of the reductions, but not all. But  
its numbers pushed it far closer to what an eventual compromise 
between the White House and Congress was likely to look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better  
than what the House did,'' said the subcommittee's top Democrat, 
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000. It is the most 
controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual spending bills to 
begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $35.2 billion for education, $500 million  
more than Clinton; $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200 million 
less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and human 
services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Gold Up; Dollar Mostly Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gold extended its sharp rebound today, closing  
above $300 an ounce in Europe to reach its highest level in almost 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell against  
most other major currencies in European trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $301.50 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$279.90 on Monday and the highest level since Oct. 2, 1998, when it 
also finished the day at $301.50. In Zurich the bid price was 
$301.02 an ounce, up from $280.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound in gold prices followed the announcement on Sunday  
by 15 central banks that they would limit their combined sales of 
bullion for five years. Gold in London had closed Friday at $268.60 
an ounce and had traded at 20-year lows approaching $250 in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, gold rose $5.75 in Hong Kong to $288.75 an ounce.  
That compared to $281.80 in New York late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.65 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$5.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which is recovering from a 3 1/2-year low against  
Japan's currency, nudged up to 106.23 yen today in Europe from 
106.19 yen late Monday. In afternoon trading in New York, the 
dollar bought 106.09 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose to $1.0498 in Europe from $1.0440 Monday and the  
British pound climbed to $1.6492 from $1.6478. In New York, the 
euro was quoted at $1.05.15 and the pound was worth $1.6480 this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.5260  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5340, and 1.4631 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.4694. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8634 German marks, down from 1.8743; 
6.2538 French francs, down from 6.2855; 2.1004 Dutch guilders, down 
from 2.1120; and 1,845.47 Italian lire, down from 1,855.55.

<HEADLINE> Steel Co. Woes Said To Delay Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steel companies hammered by competition from  
imports are being restrained from investing in crucial technology, 
industry observers at an engineering expo said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There continues to be a hunger and a very pressing need for  
new technology and lower cost approaches,'' said R. Lee Sholley, 
president of the Pittsburgh-based Association of Iron and Steel 
Engineers, which is holding its annual Iron and Steel Exposition in 
Cleveland this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Likewise, there continues to be an increasing amount of  
opportunity out there in the form of technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the question for U.S. steel producers is how to invest in  
modern, low-cost methods while holding prices low enough to be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry has a real crisis in accessing capital today,''  
said Edward R. Caine, president and chief executive officer of 
Warren, Ohio-based WCI Steel Inc. ``It's simply because of the 
cloud hung over it because of unfairly traded imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how well run and managed a company is, whether  
it's marginally profitable or in Chapter 11 (bankruptcy 
reorganization), they are all facing that same issue of how do you 
attract scarce capital into a business where you've got to have 
capital to invest and be low cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day exposition features 74 technical panel discussions  
and about 500 exhibitors displaying such technologies as sensors, 
filters, pumps, bar codes and computerized manufacturing controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and the U.S. steel industry have been  
closely monitoring the monthly import figures for signs of fewer 
low-priced imports from Japan, Russia and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the administration has been promoting free trade, it has  
been reluctant to impose tariffs sought by the industry. The 
administration said Monday it will hold a series of talks with 
Japan about last year's surge in Japanese steel shipments to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'd like to see is a system more like Canada has, in  
which you allow people to import into the United States, but before 
they do they need an import license,'' said John Correnti, an 
industry consultant who is the former Nucor Corp. chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone on the exhibit floor was downbeat about trade  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the issues are settled. I think there's not so  
much tension,'' said Takeshi Iwasaki, general manager of the metals 
machinery division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the U.S. steel industry might still ``face tough years  
the coming year or two.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Win Is Biggest to Tiller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Undefeated No. 11 Purdue against undefeated  
No. 4 Michigan looks, and is, a huge game. Yet Purdue coach Joe 
Tiller said it's not the biggest in his turnaround of the 
Boilermakers program. 
</P>
<P>
	That distinction rests with a victory over Notre Dame in 1997,  
Tiller's first year at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``In '97 when we were able to beat Notre Dame after Purdue had  
lost to them for a dozen or more years in a row. That was a huge 
game for the program, and will probably go down as maybe the game 
that allowed us to kind of springboard into the future,'' Tiller 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``From that standpoint, (Saturday's) game is not the biggest  
that we've played in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue and Michigan both are 4-0 and 1-0 in the Big Ten. For  
Purdue, it marks the start of a challenging string of games that 
continues with games against No. 12 Ohio State, No. 14 Michigan 
State and No. 2 Penn State on consecutive Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unbelievable stretch,'' Tiller said. ``It will be a  
real test for us, but I think we've got to lighten up and enjoy the 
moment, the opportunity to play this level or caliber of 
competition. ... That's a difficult draw for anybody, but that's 
the way the schedule has been set, so we plan on being there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue is playing Michigan and Ohio State back-to-back on the  
road, two teams it hasn't played since Tiller brought his spread 
offense from Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiller sees a Michigan team that has changed its offensive  
philosophy away from one that was dominated by a potent ground 
game. Statistics prove the assessment. Michigan is averaging 117.8 
yards per game rushing and 223.8 passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see them attempting to rush as much as they have in  
the past. I see some different formations out of Michigan,'' Tiller 
said. ``There's a lot of one-back stuff showing up, people spread 
out. I don't remember those formations at Ann Arbor. I think their 
offense is diversified. ... When I look at their overall physical 
scheme, it's set to throw the ball to big, physical wide 
receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines have been utilizing two quarterbacks this season  
with senior Tom Brady starting and sophomore Drew Henson coming off 
the sideline. Brady is 49-of-76 for 555 yards, Henson 32-of-58 for 
340. Tiller sees little difference between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	``They almost look like clones in the sense that they're both  
tall, physical guys. They both have very strong arms. You would 
think, normally, when a team rotates quarterbacks, you see a little 
bit of change in play selection,'' Tiller said. ``As far as 
Michigan is concerned, it doesn't seem to matter which one is in, 
the offense continues to move along with the same preferences. ... 
The impressive thing is they make good decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue will be seeking to reach 5-0 for the first time since  
1945 and extend a 10-game winning streak that is the school's 
longest since it won 11 straight in 1928-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Brees, who moves up among Purdue career leaders in passing  
statistics with every outing, has been a major factor in the 
winning streak. He was selected Big Ten offensive player of the 
week after completing 32 of 50 passes for 405 yards and three 
touchdowns in Saturday's 31-23 victory over Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning football games is what Drew is all about,'' Tiller  
said.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Short-Term Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eyeing Friday's start of fiscal 2000, the  
House today approved a stopgap measure that will keep federal 
agencies functioning for three weeks as President Clinton and 
Republicans sort through spending disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the 421-2 vote, Democrats blamed unyielding Republican  
demands for Congress' failure to complete most of the 13 spending 
bills on time, a failure to meet the schedule that in fact is 
nearly an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing seven White House veto threats, he said Republicans  
``turned seven bipartisan bills into seven partisan war zones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Bill  
Young, R-Fla., said he invited Clinton months ago to join 
Republicans in working through their spending differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his decision not to do so,'' Young said.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate was expected to approve the bill as early as today. White  
House officials said Clinton would sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by the new fiscal year, GOP leaders pushed a compromise 
$21 billion energy and water projects measure through the Senate 
today by a 96-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, the fifth to be sent to Clinton, was likely to get  
his signature after Republicans dropped a provision that would have 
helped developers and local governments file quicker legal appeals 
when the government blocks them from building on wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure Monday by 327-87.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee planned to vote  
today on a $324 billion social spending bill for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Friday. The measure, approved Monday by a subcommittee, 
would outspend Clinton on education by $500 million, but provide 
less than he wants for hiring teachers, after-school centers and 
some of his other favorite initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step, House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise  
$12.6 billion foreign aid measure for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators dropped language barring aid to groups that  
lobby to ease overseas abortion restrictions, a defeat for 
anti-abortion conservatives. But the bill contained $2 billion less 
than Clinton wanted, cuts that prompted an administration veto 
threat when they were proposed in earlier versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already threatened to veto the House's version  
of the education-health-labor bill, citing its cuts in his plans 
for job training for teen-agers, hiring teachers, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill eased many of the reductions, but not all. But  
its numbers pushed it far closer to what an eventual compromise 
between the White House and Congress was likely to look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better  
than what the House did,'' said the subcommittee's top Democrat, 
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000. It is the most 
controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual spending bills to 
begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $35.2 billion for education, $500 million  
more than Clinton; $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200 million 
less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and human 
services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001.

<HEADLINE> Rambis Gets New Job With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Kurt Rambis, who has held a variety of  
jobs with the Los Angeles Lakers, got a new post Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, a former player, assistant coach and head coach with Los  
Angeles, is now advisor to the president-basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The position will involve Rambis' working with team owner and  
president Jerry Buss, executive vice president Jerry West, and 
general manager Mitch Kupchak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except for a few years at the end of his playing career when  
he was with other teams, Kurt Rambis has been a mainstay in the 
Lakers' organization since 1981,'' Kupchak said. ``We're pleased 
that he will remain part of the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis served as Los Angeles' interim coach after Del Harris was  
fired during the lockout-shortened 1999 season. Rambis was not 
retained in that job because the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as coach 
after the season ended.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Wants Aid for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international development program to help  
the world's poorest nations is needed to parallel the new global 
financial sytsem, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said coalitions involving these nations with U.N.  
organizations, governments, multilateral institutions, the private 
sector and civil society would play a major role in shaping the new 
``development architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a coalition in which we recognize that, yes, we  
must break the chains of debt,'' Wolfensohn said,'' but we must 
also have the resources to go much further and break the chains of 
poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn addressed the annual meetings of the bank and its  
sister institution, the International Monetary Fund after being 
reappointed to serve a second five-year term as head of the 
182-nation organization. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Treasury Secretary  
Lawrence Summers also were speaking to hundreds of finance 
ministers and central bank governors in the cavernous ballroom of a 
Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	After the global financial crisis of the past two years rocked  
markets around the world, governments, the IMF and the World Bank 
made changes to produce what they called the new global financial 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	These changes included requiring governments to make public more  
financial information and better regulate their banking systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said his new development architecture would ``build  
coalitions for change, coalitions with the private sector which 
will bring investment, create jobs, promote the transfer of 
technology and skills and foster social responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``bringing corruption in the glare of the sunlight''  
also was an important part of helping poor countries to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the World Bank-IMF  
meetings Monday that emerging market countries need a spare tire -- 
sound banks and alternative sources of money -- if they want to 
avoid future Asian-style currency crises or lessen their damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis of the past two years, Greenspan  
said, emphasized the necessity for these countries to pay attention 
to issues such as bank regulation and whether the right steps are 
being taken to build sound financial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Improving deficiencies in domestic banking systems in emerging  
markets will help to limit the toll of the next financial 
disturbance,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the chief lessons learned from the Asian economic  
crisis were that countries with narrow capital markets in which 
there are no alternatives to banks suffer greater economic 
disruption than those with diverse capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``East Asia had no spare tires,'' Greenspan said in his speech.  
``Banks, being highly leveraged institutions, have throughout their 
history periodically fallen into crisis. When there was no backup, 
they pulled their economies down with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said countries increase the cost of recovery when they  
don't act promptly to deal with a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Global financial turmoil began in Thailand in July 1997 with a  
currency devaluation, then spread to Indonesia and South Korea 
later that year. The following summer Russia's economy collapsed 
and then Brazil had to devalue its currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failure of normal adjustment processes to contain the  
financial turmoil made this crisis longer and deeper than any of us 
had expected in its early days,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Many Unhappy With Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's authorized biography is coming  
under fire from Reagan's eldest child and former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Reagan says that based on the excerpts she read and the  
interviews she heard with biographer Edmund Morris, she has 
concluded he ``wasted an incredible and irreplaceable 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have decided that I have read all the fiction about Ronald  
Reagan I intend to read -- so I think I will pass on this book,'' 
she said in a statement from Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush denied Morris' claim in ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald  
Reagan'' that he and his wife were unwelcome ``upstairs'' in the 
Reagan White House when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous,'' he said in an interview shown today on  
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Upstairs? I mean that's a kind of English,  
upstairs-and-downstairs approach to life. ``I don't even use the 
terminology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes of a Christmas Eve 1988 conversation he said he  
had with the Bushes a month before Bush became president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love that guy, he's such a terrific fellow,'' Bush is  
quoted as saying. Morris then quotes Bush as commenting about 
Reagan and his wife, Nancy: ``I kinda wished they'd shown -- 
'y'know, a little appreciation. Didn't seem to want us upstairs in 
the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in the NBC interview that he never felt unappreciated.  
``Ronald Reagan had and Nancy had friends that were closer friends 
than the Bushes. ... We never felt we were unwelcome some place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Morris' characterization of Reagan as an ``apparent  
airhead,'' Bush said: ``That is brutal and grossly unfair and 
untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his working relationship with Reagan was ``heaven,  
total access, a totally relaxed relationship. From my point of view 
I couldn't have asked for a better mentor. He was a joy to work 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Reagan is described in passages of ``Dutch'' excerpted  
by Newsweek as ``the eldest and largest of the president's 
children, her brilliant smile and button nose reminding the world 
that there once was another Mrs. Reagan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She ``sings and acts well, memorizes like a VCR and luxuriates  
in the spotlight,'' Morris wrote, saying she could have made a 
career in show business if she only had the figure of Jane Wyman, 
her mother and Reagan's first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was granted close access to Reagan during his second  
term. Although the book is not being released until Thursday, it 
has already created a stir with historians and former Reagan aides, 
in part because Morris inserts himself as a semi-fictional 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect when all is said and done, given the unprecedented  
access graciously provided the author, the American people will 
conclude that the author wasted an incredible and irreplaceable 
opportunity,'' Maureen Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris told CBS' ``60 Minutes'' he expects Nancy Reagan to be  
disturbed by the book because, despite his admiration for the 
ex-president, ``I do not hide the fact that Reagan was frequently 
an old, spaced-out man, inattentive to details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,  
devotes about 250 pages of text to the Reagan presidency in its 874 
pages of text and notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan biographer Lou Cannon told CBS that Morris' contribution  
could have been ``to tell us what went on during the presidency 
and, with very few exceptions, he doesn't.''

<P>
	``Mary'' (MCA Records) -- Mary J. Blige  

</P>
<P>
	Mary J. Blige may not have a voice like Aretha Franklin, but  
like the Queen of Soul, the so-called Queen of Hip-Hop has a voice 
that captures your heart, seizing the emotion of a song so strongly 
that you begin to think it's your emotion, too. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Mary,'' the rhythm and blues diva's fourth album, Blige  
embarks on a musical and emotional journey that stirs the soul, 
leaving you alternately happy, sad, feeling hopeless -- and hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	The album starts out on an upbeat note, with Lauryn Hill's ``All  
That I Can Say,'' a dreamy, uptempo track that has Blige in awe of 
the man in her life. Blige's sometimes gravelly alto voice sounds 
beautiful in the backdrop of Hill's mellow groove. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, like much of the album, has a 1970s soul feel. Blige  
actually reaches back to that era to capture some of that magic, 
using part of the melody of ``I Can't Help It,'' from Michael 
Jackson's ``Off the Wall'' on ``Sexy,'' the most hip-hop oriented 
track of the disc, and Elton John's ``Benny and the Jets'' on 
``Deep Inside,'' in which she asks people to see her as ``just 
plain ol' Mary'' and not an untouchable superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Franklin makes an appearance on the disc, on ``Don't Waste  
Your Time,'' on which she gives Blige advice to dump her no-good 
man. No-good men are an underlying theme on this disc, and it's 
when Blige sings about kicking them to the curb that she seems to 
be at her best -- on ``Not Lookin','' she and ex-love K-Ci trash 
talk while engaging in a sexually charged tango. 
</P>
<P>
	Most moving is ``Your Child,'' in which Blige learns about her  
man's secret child from his lover. She so intensely makes the 
listener feel the pain and the hurt in her voice that it will make 
a woman look at her man cross-eyed -- even if he hasn't done 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Blige co-wrote at least half the songs on this disc, and is one  
of its executive producers. Perhaps that is why it is her best 
recording yet. Maybe the more ``Mary'' Blige gives, the better she 
gets.

	``Rough Harvest'' (Mercury Records) -- John Mellencamp  

</P>
<P>
	Call this John Mellencamp's attempt at an ``Unplugged'' album.  
``Rough Harvest'' appears on the surface to be a throwaway project 
and an attempt to cash in on the craze started by the 
acoustic-style MTV performance show. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead, the recording gives new depths to the work of one  
of the most prolific artists of the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Using stripped-down arrangements, Mellencamp revisits some of  
the best songs of the latter stages of his career, with the few 
years he's added also giving needed depth to such socially 
challenging songs as ``Love and Happiness'' and ``Jackie Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the gravel in his voice -- the result of a lot of hard  
touring and even harder living in his early days -- doesn't do any 
harm to ``Minutes to Memories,'' a tale of an old man telling his 
life story on a bus ride through the Midwest, or ``Human Wheels,'' 
which gets a dose of humanity missing in the original studio 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The liner notes say this is the kind of music Mellencamp and his  
crack band play when they just want to play music. Perhaps they 
should play this way all the time.

	``Ariodante'' (Archiv) -- opera by George Frideric Handel; Anne  
Sophie von Otter, Lynne Dawson, Ewa Podles, Richard Croft, Veronica 
Cangemi, Denis Sedov, Luc Coadou; Les Musiciens du Louvre , 
conducted by Marc Minkowski 

</P>
<P>
	In 1909, an English music historian named R.A. Streatfeild wrote  
that Handel's operas were ``sadly remote from the circle of modern 
sympathy,'' with virtually no performances in more than 100 years. 
Handel was an oratorio man, you see, despite more than 40 of his 
operas taking the stages of Covent Garden and the King's Theater 
between 1711 and 1741. 
</P>
<P>
	But something happened in the early 1950s. Championed by  
musicologist Edward J. Dent, Handel opera performances sputtered 
back to life; a Joan Sutherland Alcina in 1957 with the Handel 
Opera Society was momentous. 
</P>
<P>
	Other societies began regular performances. Soon major houses  
and cutting edge directors like Peter Sellars were producing them. 
Then, riding the original instrument performance wave of recent 
years, the works have been coming out regularly on CD. 
</P>
<P>
	The high quality of this latest entry from Archiv, conducted by  
37-year-old Baroque performance prodigy Marc Minkowski, shows how 
far we've come from Mr. Streatfeild's lament. A star-quality cast, 
superb sound,excellent playing and a mainstream label tell that 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	The other story here is Ariodante's (von Otter) love for Ginevra  
(Dawson), daughter of the king of Scotland (Sedov). Polinesso 
(Podles), with designs on the throne, induces her attendant Dalinda 
(Cangemi) to receive him dressed as her mistress. Ariodante sees 
this and goes off in jealously suicidal fashion. But Dalinda 
reveals all, Ariodante's brother Lurcanio (Croft) strikes down the 
evil suitor and rejoicing breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
	Minkowski, a Frenchman, brings together a truly international  
cast -- Swede, Briton, Pole, American, Argentine, Russian-born 
Israeli and another Frenchman -- not bad for a German composer 
writing Italian operas for the English stage. He propels the action 
forward and shows unusual attention to dynamic subtleties for a 
Baroque conductor. The original instrument sound is a bit grainy, 
but not too gritty. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Otter's lied-singing strengths serve her well in Ariodante's  
inner monologues, and she sings with intense expression, the 
quality needed to make these sorts of arias work. Dawson brings a 
beauty of tone and Podles a cavernous contralto to the mix. The 
rest of the cast reveals few faults. 
</P>
<P>
	Handel provides his usual wonderful touches: furious  
violin-bowing to summon the Furies; low, sustained string chords 
depicting a moonlit night; hollow bassoon tones to evoke the ghost 
that Ariodante wants to return as before the perfidy is revealed.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Pageant CEO Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Miss America Pageant officials, still  
reeling from a controversy over whether to allow contestants who 
have had abortions or been divorced, have a new problem: Their boss 
has been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant chief executive Robert Beck was fired Sunday, nearly two  
weeks after it was revealed that the pageant had approved new rules 
-- which have since been shelved -- that would have dropped the 
nearly 50-year ban on contestants who've been married or undergone 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Beck, Miss America board chairman David Frisch nor  
pageant spokesman John Healy would comment in detail on Monday's 
announcement. It came a day after the pageant board voted to 
release Beck from his three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the board acknowledged Mr. Beck's contributions to the  
Miss America program during the 12 months that he served as 
president and CEO, they agreed that selecting a new chief executive 
was in the best interests of the Organization at this time,'' 
Frisch's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy would not say whether Beck was fired because of the  
rules-change fiasco. The changes have been put on hold pending 
talks with state pageant officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck also had little to tell, saying today he was not ready to  
talk about his dismissal publicly. ``I can't, at this stage, give 
you my side of it.'' He would not say when he would make a 
statement or whether he planned to sue over the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just speculating, but there has to be more than the  
contract issue,'' said Libby Taylor, who runs the Miss Kentucky 
Pageant and went to court to stop the board from enacting the new 
rules. ``I'll be interested to find out what really happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Coleman, executive director of the Miss Memphis Pageant, said  
local pageant directors were upset with the new rules because they 
would have struck at the heart of the ``ideal'' that Miss America 
is supposed to embody. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck got the $250,000-a-year job on the strength of a resume  
that included work with the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation and 
the national advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving. He had a 
son killed by a drunken driver in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came under fire after The Associated Press reported Sept.  
13 that the pageant had quietly revoked its long-standing ban on 
divorce and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was initially recommended by Steven Perskie, a pageant  
lawyer who was asked to review and update the contestant contract 
that must be signed by Miss America hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were made to bring the contract into compliance with  
state anti-discrimination law, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by the pageant's 21-member board last June but never  
made public, the changes outraged state pageant directors, former 
winners and other Miss America pageant traditionalists.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tiger Ron LeFlore Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Tigers outfielder Ron LeFlore was  
arrested following closing ceremonies at Tiger Stadium on charges 
he failed to pay $57,000 in child support to his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore, 51, was one of many Tigers greats who assembled -- in  
uniform -- for the stadium's final game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the lights dimmed for the last time at the stadium  
about 9 p.m., Wayne County Sheriff's deputies approached him near 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to interfere with the final ceremonies of the  
Tigers,'' Sheriff Robert Ficano said this morning. ``We were able 
to work out the circumstances once the ceremonies were done and he 
was changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-wife Deborah Lewis, who lives in the area, had called  
authorities when she learned LeFlore would be part of the closing 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the most pleasant thing to do, but once we have  
knowledge of his whereabouts, we have an obligation,'' Ficano said. 
``He was completely cooperative. I don't know if he was completely 
surprised, I guess he was a little surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore, a speedy baserunner who played with the Tigers from  
1974-79, was named in a Wayne County Circuit Court bench warrant in 
1993, Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	LeFlore, now a Florida resident, spent the night in the county  
jail. Before joining the Tigers in 1974, he served time in prison 
for armed robbery. His story was the basis for a movie, ``One In A 
Million'' in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Davidson New ABC Studio Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Davidson was hired Tuesday as the studio  
analyst for ABC's NHL coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, lead game analyst for Fox before the network's NHL  
package expired after last season, will work with John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to be joining ABC,'' Davidson said. ``Now,  
because ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC are all working together with the NHL, 
the league will receive more exposure than ever before, which will 
make hockey the big winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC begins its first season of a five-year deal on Feb. 6, 2000  
with the NHL All-Star Game. The network will also televise four 
regional regular season games, playoff games and up to five Stanley 
Cup finals contests. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Graziano Fired As Dodgers President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bob Graziano was fired as president and chief  
executive officer of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who fell out of 
contention in June and never approached .500 again. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we feel a change is necessary at this time, I have  
discussed with Bob our interest in creating another position for 
him at Fox Sports Enterprises,'' Rick Welts, president of Fox 
Sports Enterprises, said in making the announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Welts said no timetable has been established for selecting  
Graziano's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers are winding up a disappointing season.  
</P>
<P>
	The club started the year with one of baseball's highest  
payrolls, about $79 million, and was favored to win the NL West 
after an offseason of change that included the hiring of manager 
Davey Johnson and the signing of pitcher Kevin Brown to the richest 
contract in the history of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	With six games remaining entering tonight's contest at San  
Francisco, the Dodgers (74-82) were already assured of their first 
losing season since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziano, 41, was promoted to the Dodgers' president and CEO on  
March 19, 1998 -- the day the sale of the team from the O'Malley 
family to the Fox Group was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 14 years, I have played an integral role with the Dodger  
organization, from the early years with the O'Malley family until 
recently with Fox,'' Graziano said in a statement. ``As a 
professional and unwavering Dodger fan, I will cherish those 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Los Angeles, Graziano joined the Dodgers on Jan. 1,  
1986 as the team's director of financial projects. He was promoted 
to vice president, finance, on Oct. 28, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	He was responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the  
business side of the team as executive vice president, a position 
he was appointed to on Feb. 13, 1997 and held until named president 
and CEO.

<HEADLINE> MLS Board Discusses Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Major League Soccer's board of directors said  
Tuesday a number of changes will be announced after November's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no changes we can discuss at this point. We made  
some recommendations as it relates to rule changes, our schedule, 
our future on television, and our thoughts about expansion,'' newly 
installed commissioner Don Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league turned to Garber, a former NFL vice president,  
because it had trouble putting fans in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber, who spent the last three years running NFL Europe,  
replaced Doug Logan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some great ideas from the owners for the long term,''  
Garber said. ``We'll take the next couple of months to finalize the 
recommendations and announce them to the public.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Health Care Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snapshot: An estimated 43.4 million Americans have no health  
insurance, including 11 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions of Democratic and Republican presidential candidates  
on expanding health coverage: 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats:  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley: Ensure universal access to affordable health  
coverage by fully or partially subsidizing premiums for children 
and adults in low- to middle-income families and by offering 
everyone a tax break for premiums. Expand Medicare by adding 
optional prescription drug benefit with $500 deductible, $25 
premium and 25 percent co-pay. Total estimated annual cost: Up to 
$65 billion, to be paid for from non-Social Security budget surplus 
and program efficiencies. Latest projections of non-Social Security 
surplus: $82 billion, 2002; $75 billion, 2003; $85 billion, 2004; 
$92 billion, 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore: Give states more money to provide health  
coverage for children. Children in families earning up to 250 
percent of poverty level would qualify for federally supported 
state coverage, up from 200 percent now. Families earning more and 
lacking insurance could buy into the state program. Goal: All 
children covered by 2005. Cost: Unspecified. Also: 25 percent 
refundable tax credit for premiums for self-employed; long-term 
care tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans:  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer: Expand option of medical savings accounts -- tax-free  
accounts people can use for routine health bills and to save up for 
premiums for high-deductible health plans covering major expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan: Allow workers to invest money they would otherwise  
put into Medicare, so they can provide for their own health care in 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush: Expand medical savings accounts. Medicare  
means-testing a possibility for federally subsidized premiums. 
Strengthen tax incentives to small businesses that provide health 
care to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole: Full tax deduction for health insurance for  
self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes: Expand medical savings accounts.

deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed. 
Worked with Democrats in Congress to expand health care 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes: Previously supported medical savings accounts.

<HEADLINE> Beatty in Limbo Over White House Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than seven weeks after he hinted at a  
White House run, Warren Beatty is still teasing the political and 
entertainment worlds about his intentions. That is unlikely to 
change with his highly anticipated speech Wednesday, friends and 
associates say. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty is to be honored in Beverly Hills by a group that shares  
his liberal philosophy, the Southern California Americans for 
Democratic Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just heard he wants to lay out a specific set of policies  
and issues, and does not plan to lay out his intentions of whether 
he plans to seek the Democratic nomination or any nomination for 
president,'' said Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres is an open supporter of Beatty's potential primary rival,  
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Several others with close ties to Beatty also said the  
actor-director is unlikely to tip his hand at the Beverly Hills 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he does, Beatty will do it under a news media  
microscope. Reporters from around the nation and world, drawn 
irresistibly by the Tinseltown-Washington nexus, are thronging to 
the speech, even though it holds little promise of a bombshell 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	C-SPAN, the government affairs cable network, plans to record  
the speech and air it nationally on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	So Beatty is certain to accomplish his stated objective,  
regardless of whether he discloses his plans. He will train a 
spotlight on issues he believes are being neglected by the two 
Democrats running for president, Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is trying to impact the debate,'' said Bill  
Carrick, a Democratic political adviser who is not on the payroll 
of any presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worried the Democratic Party is not discussing some of  
the issues he considers important and are part of the history and 
tradition of the party,'' Carrick said. ``Namely that people have 
been left out of the prosperity -- low-income, poor people have been 
left out, and that's not been adequately addressed from his point 
of view in the debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for Bradley, said the former New Jersey  
senator had stressed ``pulling children out of poverty'' from the 
start of his presidential campaign, and pointed out that Bradley 
has called for a ban on the unlimited ``soft money'' donations to 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyche said he had no intention of monitoring Beatty's speech.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore said Gore is committed to ``leading  
the fight for change that works on critical issues like making sure 
our kids have health care, making sure economic prosperity reaches 
every corner of the country, making sure children have a future 
full of opportunities because they have the education they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Clinton administration, the child poverty rate has  
undergone its longest sustained drop since the early 1960s, added 
Gore spokesman Roger Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she'd be paying attention to Beatty's address,  
Moore said: ``We try to pay attention to all kinds of public 
dialogues that are going on out there.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Denounces Bank of N.Y. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior aide to President Boris Yeltsin said  
Tuesday that allegations of massive Russian money-laundering 
through a New York bank were invented by the West and government 
opponents at home to tarnish Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been reluctant to open a major investigation into  
media reports that Russians may have funneled as much as $10 
billion through the Bank of New York. On Tuesday, deputy chief of 
staff Igor Shabdurasulov added his name to the list of Russian 
media and officials who have denounced the whole case as an 
anti-Russian plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are grounds to believe that this scandal has to a large  
degree been inspired by circles in Russia and abroad with an aim to 
discredit Russia, humiliate it and push it farther away from making 
important decisions on the international scene,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shabdurasulov wearily dismissed media reports on the case and  
allegations of bribe-taking by Kremlin officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extremely negative for us, but not fatal,'' he said.  
``We have coped with worse problems. We shall solve this one too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met with U.S.  
businessmen in New York this week and urged them ``not to fuel 
scandal, but to join forces in returning the Russian money taken to 
the West,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports said the money allegedly laundered through the  
Bank of New York was connected to Russian organized crime, possibly 
with the involvement of Russian officials. But many analysts now 
believe that some of the capital flight could have been legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov, Russia's top negotiator with international  
lenders, said Tuesday that capital flight from Russia reaches from 
$700 million to $1 billion a month. Zadornov dismissed allegations 
that the money was laundered by the mob with officials' 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``After studying the documents I have received, I can definitely  
say that the origin of the money and the essence of the 
transactions are absolutely different from what the world media is 
reporting,'' he said Tuesday, Interfax reported. The report did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the Bank of New York scandal began to emerge last  
month, the International Monetary Fund said it would delay the next 
disbursement of a loan to Russia. It said it wanted to scrutinize 
how previous loans have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Tuesday that Russia might  
not receive the next $640 million of the loan until late October. 
In that case, Russia would have to resort to other sources -- likely 
dwindling Central Bank reserves -- to make a payment to the IMF due 
on Oct. 10, he said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's latest IMF loan -- $4.5 billion total -- is intended to  
help the cash-strapped government pay back previous debts to the 
fund. The money will simply be transferred from one IMF account to 
another.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Sign Lang, Waive Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks, who are heading into  
training camp not knowing when injured center Patrick Ewing will be 
ready to play, signed free agent Andrew Lang on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks also requested waivers on 18-year veteran Herb  
Williams, who played in just six games last season, his seventh 
with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Lang is an 11-year veteran who averaged 3.8 points  
and 4.4 rebounds in 21 games with the Chicago Bulls last season. No 
details of his contract were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely happy to add Andrew to our roster,'' Knicks  
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He's a solid defender and a good 
rebounder who will provide us with great depth in the frontcourt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lang, who played collegiately at Arkansas, was a first-round  
draft pick by Phoenix in 1988 and has played with Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, Minnesota, Milwaukee and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Ewing is coming off two injury filled seasons,  
including last year when he missed the last nine games of the 
Knicks' run to the NBA Finals because of an Achilles' tendon 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, one of the most popular Knicks with the fans, is one  
of just eight players to play 18 seasons in the NBA.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs third baseman Gary Gaetti left the  
team Tuesday to return to his home outside New Orleans and undergo 
surgery on his left knee.

Wilder had been hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as vice president of 
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder came to Chicago from the Atlanta Braves organization in  
January 1996 and was the club's minor league director before being

<HEADLINE> US, China Break Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators have broken  
off talks on a major trade deal after only one day of discussions 
although the Clinton administration says the two sides will get 
back together soon. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky met with her  
counterpart, Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, for two hours 
Monday morning and then both sides had lower level officials go 
over specific details in various sectors in an afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a planned meeting on Tuesday was canceled because Shi  
had to return to Beijing earlier than expected, Barshefsky said 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there was ``nothing to be drawn either way'' from the  
fact that this week's discussions were abbreviated. ``There will be 
another meeting. We just haven't figured out the logistics of 
when,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing today, Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator on the  
talks, said both countries were ``very close'' to an agreement. But 
he said a U.S. list distributed in April of Chinese proposals to 
lower trade barriers contained ``10 to 15 mistakes'' that continue 
to be a source of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they could work on the basis of our clarifications, I think  
we could have a deal,'' Long said in an interview with CNN. But if 
the U.S. side won't accept those clarifications, ``then I don't 
think we should have a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long's comments highlighted the key sticking point in the  
negotiations. U.S. negotiators are struggling to get China to 
commit to at least agree to the list of concessions China put on 
the table in April. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton rejected that offer as not good enough,  
particularly in the area of textiles, where the United States wants 
to commit to further restrictions on its imports to the United 
States beyond what would be allowed under WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. businesses and farm groups are anxious for an agreement,  
which would remove barriers they have long complained about that 
limit their sales in China's vast market. In return for removing 
barriers to U.S. goods, China would gain the support it needs from 
the United States for membership in the 134-nation World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before this week's discussions were shortened to one day,  
trade observers said chances for a breakthrough had been lessened 
by the absence of Long from the delegation that traveled to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who oversaw  
efforts during the Clinton administration's first term to strike a 
China WTO agreement, told a business group Monday that he viewed 
Long's absence as a negative sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Long is not there, so we have to be somewhat concerned as  
to whether there will be an agreement,'' Kantor said during an 
appearance in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Mastel, global economic policy director at the New America  
Foundation, a Washington think tank, said that Long was ``the man 
who understands all the issues. It is strange that he would not be 
along if they expected to get a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries had come very close to an agreement last April  
but Clinton ultimately decided that the concessions made by Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji did not go far enough in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
	After a number of U.S. business groups criticized the  
administration for failure to obtain an agreement in April, the 
administration pledged to restart the negotiations with an aim of 
sending a completed agreement to Congress in June. 
</P>
<P>
	That deadline passed after China broke off further talks to  
protest the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin agreed to restart the  
talks two weeks ago with the aim of getting China into the WTO 
before late November. That's when the Geneva-based organization 
that sets the rules for world trade will launch a new round of 
global trade talks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	For the trade concessions to take effect, Congress must approve  
them in the form of legislation granting permanent normalized trade 
relations to China. Currently, U.S. trade relations with China are 
subject to annual review. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House accused Republican congressional leaders last  
week of jeopardizing chances for a trade agreement with statements 
indicating there was little or no chance Congress would take up the 
matter this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Republican Leader Richard Armey responded with a  
statement saying that once the negotiations were completed, he 
looked forward ``to working hard ... to ensure congressional 
approval of WTO accession.''

<HEADLINE>  Cards' McGee Indicates He'll Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The end of the line is near for St. Louis  
Cardinals outfielder Willie McGee, who indicated Tuesday that he'd 
retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't honestly see myself playing anymore,''  
McGee said. ``Just like anything else, it hits you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee was a World Series hero as a rookie in 1982. He was the NL  
MVP in 1985, when he batted .353 with 216 hits for another World 
Series team, and with five games to go in this season he had a 
career .295 batting average. He has won two NL batting champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be 41 in November and his performance has slipped the past  
two years. More than anything, McGee, who's been mulling retirement 
the last three years, has lost the inner fire to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like I've got things to offer, but it's one thing  
to be able to play physically and another thing to want to be 
there, want to go through the grind,'' McGee said. ``It's the 
traveling that gets you. Mentally, I'm not going to be the player I 
once was, and I'm realizing that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee was traded late in 1990 because he was about to become a  
free agent and the Cardinals were worried about salary escalation. 
Since returning in 1996 he's been perhaps the team's most popular 
player -- even more so than home run king Mark McGwire. A sighting 
of McGee, head down and bat in hand, has routinely drawn huge 
ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, he's had trouble living up to that noise, batting .253  
last year and hitting .256 with no homers and 20 RBIs in 266 
at-bats heading into the final homestand this season. Perhaps most 
telling, he's 8-for-47 as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said McGee would have a job next season if  
he wanted one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie's always harder on his performance than the rest of  
us,'' La Russa said. ``He always thinks he did less than we think 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But La Russa said he wouldn't try to talk McGee into coming  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows himself,'' La Russa said. ``That's one of the worst  
things you can do, lay a guilt trip on him. You just let him know 
that he's done better than he thinks he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee would rather make room for a young player on the roster  
than hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got guys like Craig Paquette, Thomas Howard and Marcus  
Jensen that can do the same thing I can do and they've got that 
hunger and that fire,'' McGee said. ``I've got 18 years of this. 
Their candle is just being lit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, McGee expressed an interest in coaching  
and ultimately managing. He wants to remain in the game in some 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game, and I've always loved it,'' McGee said. ``I  
love talking to these young guys. I wish there was a role in 
baseball where you could come in and just deal with the mental 
aspects.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Predicts Kosovo Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independence for Kosovo appears an inevitable  
outcome of the continuing ethnic strife in the Balkans, former 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole told a Senate hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe independence will be forthcoming. It should be,''  
the Kansas Republican, who has served as a special envoy to Kosovo, 
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dole cautioned that Kosovo's Albanians, in particular  
the Kosovo Liberation Army, could lose the support of the 
international community, as well as that of Congress, if they don't 
follow Democratic principles. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, meanwhile, said the administration has not  
changed its support for an autonomous -- but not independent -- 
Kosovo within Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have supported for Kosovo, and what we continue to  
support, is autonomy,'' he said during a White House meeting with 
Turkey's prime minister, Bulent Ecevit.

	Dole, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, criticized both the  
Republican Bush administration and the Democratic Clinton 
administration for not being firmer in dealing with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Much bloodshed could have been avoided, he said. ``We could and  
should have acted against Milosevic much earlier,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early intervention is far less costly and often just as  
effective as belated intervention. ... Half measures yield half 
results,'' he said.

	He cited a ``litany of missed opportunities.''

	Dole served as a go-between with Kosovo Albanians for the  
Clinton administration this year in an effort to get Kosovo support 
for a peace plan.

	More recently, he traveled to the region in July in his capacity  
as chairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons.

	While Milosevic's troops heavily damaged Albanian homes and  
businesses, Dole said, ``his forces did remarkably little damage to 
Kosovo's infrastructure and natural resources.''

envisioned may not be necessary.

policy as ``based on empty threats'' and raised the prospect of 
``an endless international presence on the ground.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Navy Not Liable for Spouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit  
brought by a woman who says the Navy is partly responsible for 
injuries she suffered at the hands of her former husband, a sailor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Monday, U.S. District Court Judge  
Christopher F. Droney in Hartford ruled that the Navy doesn't have 
a special duty to protect the civilian spouses of military 
personnel from domestic abuse, even when commanders are aware of 
the violence and attempt to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Brenda M. Green argued that the  
government can't be held ``vicariously responsible'' for the 
actions of its personnel. Droney agreed, ruling that even if 
commanders knew of the potential for violence against Annette 
LaFrancis, they did not have a duty to act outside of the 
employer-employee relationship with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctrine of sovereign immunity limits lawsuits against the  
government, Droney said in dismissing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we are disappointed,'' said attorney Chester  
Fairlie, who represents Ms. LaFrancis. ``We believe the decision 
rings a warning bell for a military spouse who is fearful of 
abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LaFrancis sought $500,000 from the Navy, claiming that the  
commanding officers of her former husband, Chief Petty Officer 
Lance LaFrancis, were negligent and failed to issue appropriate 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrancis assaulted his wife in 1995 and she was treated a base  
hospital in Groton, the lawsuit said. Navy domestic violence 
advocates recommended anger management for him and family 
counseling, but commanders never followed through on those 
recommendations, Ms. LaFrancis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LaFrancis said he threatened her again several months later  
and his superiors again took no action and he attacked her. She 
said she was left with back pain, headaches and post-traumatic 
stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy court-martialed LaFrancis and he was demoted. He was  
not discharged but left the Navy in 1996, the same year the couple 
were divorced.

<HEADLINE> Swank Hotel Sues CBS Over Show Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A posh Fifth Avenue hotel has gone to court to  
try to stop CBS from using a plaza in front of the General Motors 
Building to stage its upcoming ``Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sherry-Netherland Hotel, across the street from General  
Motors Building, cited crowds, noise and other potential annoyances 
and asked the court to void the zoning approval the network 
received for the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Early Show,'' starring Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson, is  
set to debut Nov. 1 at 7 a.m. in one of the city's busiest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS plans to use the plaza in front of the building in addition  
to its ground-floor television studio ``that is, as a `tourist 
destination' where crowds (will be) able to gawk through glass at 
the goings on,'' the hotel said in papers filed Friday in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In this outdoor area, ``people will be waving and shouting and  
creating that fake Beatlemania-like sensation'' and ``CBS will be 
able to stage everything from concerts to cooking demonstrations,'' 
the hotel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel says that the zoning approval for CBS violates the law  
because the zoning hearing did not properly consider the impact the 
crowds and show events would have on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said, ``We don't have any comment  
except to say we intend to be good neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Today'' show, which featured Gumbel for years, airs from  
a ground-level studio in Rockefeller Center. ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' opened its new storefront studio in Times Square earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Trump, the billionaire developer who owns the General  
Motors Building, called the Sherry-Netherland's lawsuit 
``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``CBS never heard from them during the zoning process,'' said  
Trump, who is not a party to the lawsuit. ``That would have been 
the time to raise a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel's lawyer, Eva Talel, said Trump is wrong about the  
Sherry-Netherland's failure to appear at zoning proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may not be aware of it, but the hotel did appear and its  
objection was recorded,'' Talel said.

<HEADLINE> Woman in $17M Heist Gets 7 1/2 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A woman who bought herself breast  
implants and a $635,000 house with loot from a $17 million Loomis, 
Fargo &AMP; Co. heist was sentenced Tuesday to more than 7 1/2 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Michele Chambers was one of 21 defendants in the 1997 robbery of  
a vault at the armored car company -- one of the biggest heists of 
its kind in U.S. history. Twenty people pleaded guilty; one was 
tried and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers' husband, Steven Chambers, was one of the ringleaders  
along with David Scott Ghantt, a former Loomis employee. Chambers 
was sentenced earlier to more than 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a month of the robbery, the Chamberses moved out of their  
mobile home. When agents raided their luxurious new home, they 
found such things as a large oil painting of a dog in military 
uniform and more than $720,000 in cash in a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen sentenced Ms. Chambers to  
seven years and eight months behind bars and ordered her to repay 
$4.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Win at Ballpark's Last Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The memory palace had one last treasure left.  
</P>
<P>
	With Al Kaline, Ernie Harwell and a sellout crowd bidding  
farewell, the Tiger Stadium went out with a bang Monday, just the 
way it came in. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1912, the park opened with some 24,384 fans jammed  
into a place with a listed capacity of 23,000. The Tigers rallied 
to beat Cleveland 6-5 in 11 innings. The game included a steal of 
home by Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, 1999, Robert Fick, wearing the No. 25 of former  
Tigers favorite Norm Cash, hit his first career grand slam in the 
eighth inning -- a towering shot off the top of the right-field roof 
-- and Detroit beat Kansas City 8-2 in the final game at the corner 
of Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 43,356 sensed something special might be about to  
happen after Kansas City reliever Jeff Montgomery loaded the bases 
with no outs. Thousands of flash bulbs went off around the old park 
on every pitch during Gabe Kapler's at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	When his grounder forced Dean Palmer at the plate, bases were  
still loaded for Fick. Now, the crowd was really into it, cheering 
itself hoarse as Fick strode to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was a sea of flashing camera lights as Montgomery  
threw his first pitch to Fick. The roar from the fans was deafening 
as the ball exploded off Fick's bat, bouncing off the roof and back 
down to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After he circled the bases, the crowd chanted Fick's name,  
demanding a curtain call. He stepped shyly to the top of the dugout 
steps and doffed his cap as thousands of flash bulbs popped once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I'm never going to forget,'' Fick said. ``It's  
something nobody here is ever going to forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions ran high for the fans as well as the players, but order  
prevailed. Only a few fans jumped over the fence and tried to run 
across the field after Doug Jones struck out Carlos Beltran to end 
it at 7:07 p.m. But they were quickly escorted from the grounds, 
and a security force of both mounted and foot police ringed the 
warning track for postgame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Home plate was dug up immediately after the final out and  
carried to Comerica Park, where it was relocated in the new 
facility being built about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger Stadium may be laid to rest and we may be moving to  
Comerica Park,'' catcher Brad Ausmus said, ``but the people, the 
players and the memories of Tiger Stadium will never be 
forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So went this one last sentimental journey for the ballpark built  
on the site of a haymarket, a place that was once home to Cobb, 
Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Denny McLain and Kaline. It opened 
as Navin Field five days after the sinking of the Titanic. Fenway 
Park opened in Boston the same day, making them the two oldest 
ballparks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's finale was the 6,873rd regular season game at the  
stadium, which also has played host to 35 postseason games and 
three All-Star games. The sellout put the Tigers over the 2 million 
mark in attendance for just the sixth time in club history, and the 
first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final Tiger Stadium game, Detroit's players all wore  
numbers of Tigers who played through the years. The starters wore 
the numbers of the Tigers' all-time team. Center fielder Gabe 
Kapler wore a uniform without a number, honoring Cobb -- the 
greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in an era before uniforms 
were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Special baseballs were used, and the bases were changed after  
each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, a Hall of Famer, exchanged lineup cards with Royals Hall  
of Famer George Brett. Both wore their familiar uniforms, Kaline 
with his No. 6, Brett with No. 5. Harwell, the beloved broadcaster, 
emceed pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great times we've experienced in Tiger Stadium we'll  
cherish forever,'' Mayor Dennis Archer told the crowd. ``Now, let's 
create some new memories in Comerica Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers won 3,764 games in the old ballpark, lost 3,090 and  
tied 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was home to us for a long time,'' said Eddie Mayo, a member  
of the 1945 World Series champions. ``Old friends are hard to 
slough off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, with the Old English ``D'' on his breast, was saluted  
with a two-minute standing ovation during the pregame festivities 
and again during postgame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken many times about the first day I ever saw this  
ballpark, as an 18-year-old kid fresh off the train from 
Baltimore,'' Kaline said. ``I again find myself humbled and a bit 
overwhelmed by the events unfolding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Rogell, a shortstop from 1930-39, threw out the ceremonial  
first pitch as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good day, but a sad day,'' said U.S. Sen. Jim  
Bunning of Kentucky, a Hall of Fame pitcher who was with the Tigers 
from 1955-63. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Bill Freehan, selected by Detroit fans as the greatest  
Tigers catcher ever: ``Bittersweet is the perfect word for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weather cooperated, with pale blue skies, gentle sunshine  
and a pleasant breeze coming off the Detroit River as thousands of 
fans came through the old ballpark's turnstiles one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	What they saw was what they no doubt remembered from their  
youth. By the middle of the game, the setting sun was casting long, 
loving shadows across the verdant outfield, bathing the players and 
the field in glow. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the Tigers won. The Tigers almost always win in  
the memories of the true believers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levine, a 53-year-old fan, flew in from Chicago. In his  
wallet were ticket stubs from the 1968 game when the Tigers 
clinched the AL pennant and the game when McLain got his 30th win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out here on the plane this morning, probably 80 percent  
of the people were coming here to see a ballgame for the last 
time,'' he said. ``I have tons of feelings about this old place. I 
used to skip school regularly to attend opening days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler, the starting and winning pitcher, was just like  
any other fan when it came to saying goodbye to this revered mass 
of rusting girders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my video camera around and I could see where people  
were trying to take the signs down,'' Moehler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving postgame ceremonies emceed by Harwell, 65 former  
Tigers -- from Eldon Auker, who played in 1933, to Brad Ausmus of 
the 1999 squad -- formed a chronological line from home plate to the 
flag pole in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the stands remained for as long as they could, taking in  
one last, loving look. Some, who were close enough, leaned over the 
rail and scooped handfuls of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	With music from the movie ``Apollo 13'' playing in the  
background, Harwell's voice began to choke with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farewell old friend, Tiger Stadium,'' Harwell said. ``We will  
remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, former pitching sensation Mark Fidrych, who was  
famous for talking to the baseball during his starts, was asked 
what he might say to the stadium on its final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, stadium, for all the excitement you gave me. I had  
fun here. I had a lot of memories here,'' he said. ``But it's like 
everything in life, you have to go. You can't be around forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the stadium, maybe. But the memories will live forever.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw Won't Lead Golf Team Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Once was enough for Ben Crenshaw.  
</P>
<P>
	Leading the United States to victory over Europe was a dream  
come true for the Ryder Cup captain, also a golf historian and 
former Master's champion. But the preparation, controversy before 
the tournament and three days of intense golf that sparked a war of 
words over the behavior of the American spectators took a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said Tuesday he wouldn't lead the team again and that  
the next captain will be selected before the end of the year. The 
United States plays the Europeans for the cup again in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I unequivocally can say no. I can't do this. Look at me, I'm  
emaciated,'' Crenshaw said. ``It took two years of my life. It 
seems like I've been on the telephone for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he didn't enjoy the experience.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will carry to my grave those cheers around the golf  
course,'' Crenshaw said. ``This is a great achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his players won the matches, Crenshaw determined the  
lineups. Sending some of his strongest players onto the course 
early Sunday turned the tide for the Americans, whose early 
victories in singles matches applied pressure on the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we do this was to start a chain reaction. Never  
before have I seen such a fighting spirit. The cheers never stopped 
the whole day,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw apologized again for the wild scene that erupted after  
Justin Leonard's 45-foot birdie putt on No. 17 in his match against 
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal. The putt eventually decided the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans have said the jubilation disrupted Olazabal, who  
still had a birdie attempt. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justin tried as hard as he could to calm things. It was  
something we could not contain,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said he never lost faith in his team, even when it  
faced a 10-6 deficit that seemed insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something we had to fight and claw for. It was  
disheartening because they knew it had never been done before. They 
never got down,'' Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team gave Crenshaw a signed replica of the Ryder Cup. He  
took it to show-and-tell Tuesday at his two daughters' middle and 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will always be with me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That Leonard made his crucial putt on No. 17, the same hole  
where Francis Ouimet clinched the 1913 U.S. Open over British 
stalwarts Ted Ray and Harry Vardon, was mystical, Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe there's an aura across the 17th green,''  
Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a putt of that diabolical nature go in,'' he  
said, ``that's a little spooky.''

<HEADLINE> House Bill May Curb Bounty Hunters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New restrictions would be placed on bounty  
hunters -- private individuals who hunt down bail jumpers for pay -- 
under legislation introduced in the House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most bounty hunters are trained and responsible professionals,  
said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark, author of the bill that has 
Democratic support. But some are rogues ``who've seen one too many 
`Dirty Harry' movie'' and claim they are trained professionals 
after merely reading a book on bounty hunting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragic results are obvious in the countless cases of  
innocent citizens who are shot, beaten and terrorized,'' Hutchinson 
told a news conference. ``Unbelievably, these innocent victims have 
little recourse after suffering such abuse'' since laws enacted 
during the ``Wild West'' period give bounty hunters more power and 
authority than police officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hutchinson's side was Chinelle Moore, a single mother from  
Laurel, Md., who said five armed men identifying themselves as 
police officers knocked on her door about 5 a.m. in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said she told them she knew nothing about the man they  
were seeking, but they beat her, breaking her nose, covered her 
with pepper spray and pulled a gun on her 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bounty hunters held us in the house against our will,''  
she said. ``They made us sit on the bed and answer questions while 
they ransacked our house and went through our drawers, our phone 
books and kept us from answering the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said the bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make bounty hunters and the bail bondsmen who hire them liable  
for civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require bounty hunters who cross state lines to report their  
intentions to local law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require the attorney general to develop model guidelines that  
state legislatures can consider enacting to regulate bounty 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are harmed by bounty hunters, the victims ... have  
little recourse at all,'' said Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla. ``It is 
frightening to me that individuals can be given the power that 
exceeds the power of law enforcement personnel.''

<HEADLINE> Downpours Cause New N.C. Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six inches of rain kicked off new flooding  
today in an area already devastated by Hurricane Floyd's 
inundation, washing out roads and a spillway. People were urged to 
evacuate two residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The pouring rain that fell during the night cut through roads  
and made bridges in Wayne County and other areas impassable this 
morning southeast of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	In Goldsboro, 80 percent of the downtown streets were flooded  
this morning by Stony Creek, which flows through the middle of 
town, said National Guard Maj. Dave Culbreth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city's almost like an island,'' Culbreth said. ``We have  
some flooding in town again. We're almost back to ground zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising water also poured over the top of the Lake Wackena dam  
three miles southeast of Goldsboro and washed out the spillway, and 
National Guardsmen went door to door urging residents to leave the 
Walnut Creek subdivision. Only a handful of people left. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Tom Ditt, spokesman for the state emergency management  
office, said the wash-out of the spillway helped relieve pressure 
that might have caused a failure of the dam itself. 
</P>
<P>
	North of Goldsboro, guardsmen were sent to tell people living  
near Bear Creek Dam they, too, may need to evacuate as water washed 
over that dam, Culbreth said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina, Goldsboro was nearly cut off from the outside world by 
flooding on the Neuse River and its tributaries. That high water 
had just receded this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were getting ready to pull out and then this came along,''  
Culbreth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The setback came after feeble signs of recovery began to emerge  
Monday in eastern North Carolina. After an unprecedented six-day 
layoff, the flue-cured tobacco markets rebounded with generally 
higher prices to cheer farmers, many of whom had little else to 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 39,000 North Carolina residents have registered for  
state and federal assistance so far since Floyd's devastation. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has approved more than 
$3.8 million in direct aid to hurricane victims in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates show Floyd caused $70.2 million in housing  
damage in eastern North Carolina, with more than 3,000 homes 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 47 people died in North Carolina when the hurricane  
flooded parts of an 18,000-square-mile area. An estimated 2,100 
people remain in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimate agricultural losses due to Floyd will exceed  
$1 billion, and many eastern North Carolina farmers may decide it's 
time to try something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports that we're putting out estimate that fully 15  
percent of the growers affected by these floods will probably go 
ahead and get out of the business,'' said Jim Knight, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer can make a whole lot more money raising houses and  
trailer parks than he can corn and cotton,'' Knight said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have suggested the state should impose  
restrictions that could remove animal waste lagoons, as well as 
municipal sewage plants, from flood-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But farm advocates say that would be complicated and expensive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to say you're going to move people,'' said Ann Cohen  
of the North Carolina Farm Bureau. ``The question is, do they own 
land to move to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agriculture officials have been told that farmers need  
direct assistance, not loans. Most already are carrying all the 
debt they can handle, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Lewis, a 59-year-old farmer from Tarboro, managed to get  
most of his tobacco crop into curing barns by the time Floyd hit, 
but said he lost all of his corn, soybeans and cotton. He already 
owes more than $400,000 for his wife's bone marrow transplant and 
other medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is talking about loans. I've got all the loans  
I need. I can't pay back what I've got,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> UAW, GM Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers reached tentative  
agreements with General Motors Corp. and its former parts division 
Tuesday on contacts covering about 185,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the union's deals with GM and Delphi Automotive  
Systems Corp. were not released. The UAW said the terms would not 
be announced until after ratification votes. No date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal follows a lucrative four-year contract the UAW  
negotiated with DaimlerChrysler AG. And it leaves Ford Motor Co. as 
the only automaker still to finish a contract with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler deal was a four-year pact with 3 percent  
raises each year, a $1,350 signing bonus and improvements in 
pensions. The UAW traditionally negotiates the same basic terms for 
all contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been working on improving relations with the UAW after  
last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories. The 
strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American 
production, costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk 
of market share it has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes were largely over plant work rules and the loss of  
work to outside suppliers, issues certain to be back on the table 
in these talks. GM has said it needs to be more flexible and 
efficient to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also has spun off its Delphi parts unit into a separate  
company with 42,000 UAW employees. GM said Delphi could be more 
profitable and compete better if it went after business from other 
automakers -- something it couldn't do as a division of GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came after two days of intensive talks involving UAW  
President Stephen P. Yokich and GM Chairman Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW represents about 143,000 workers at GM, about 80,000  
fewer than it did in 1990. The job losses have come from GM closing 
factories, using fewer workers on assembly lines, relying on 
suppliers for more work and not replacing workers as fast as they 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, the UAW has made protecting jobs a major goal. The  
DaimlerChrysler contract includes clauses aimed at keeping job 
levels near current totals. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also proposed a ban on outsourcing and the right to  
strike over sourcing issues -- including sending new work to a 
supplier that a GM factory could do. And it asked for an ``America 
First'' pledge, saying GM should invest in plants in the United 
States rather than expand in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW also wanted Delphi workers covered under the GM national  
contract for the foreseeable future. Other demands included adding 
compensatory time off to overtime pay and giving the UAW a seat on 
GM's Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wage improvements, the DaimlerChrysler contract  
also improves pensions -- an important goal for the UAW's older 
workforce. The average GM worker is 48 years old, and some 32,000 
workers have 30 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks at Ford were continuing at a lower level this week. The  
UAW has said it was very concerned that Ford wanted to spin off its 
Visteon parts unit as GM did with Delphi.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel Buys Genesys Laboratories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Alcatel of France is buying Genesys  
Telecommunications Laboratories, a San Francisco-based provider of 
computer telephone technology, for $1.5 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel said Tuesday the acquisition complements its five U.S.  
purchases during the past year, leaving the company 
``well-positioned to benefit from the exploding demand for 
voice-data integration in the United States.'' Recent U.S. 
purchases by the maker of communications equipment have included 
DSC and Xylan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the latest deal, Alcatel will swap 1.667 of its U.S.  
shares for each share of Genesys. The deal is expected to be 
completed in January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Genesys specializes in computer telephone integration equipment  
and telecom management. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel Chairman Serge Tchuruk said the acquisition of Genesys  
should boost the French company's position in the high-growth call 
center market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another major step for Alcatel, which continues to  
move quickly towards high-growth markets fueled by the Internet and 
now, e-commerce,'' Tchuruk said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Warns Banks on Easing Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is warning banks and  
directing its examiners to watch for signs that risky bank loans 
are piling up. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank took the action Tuesday, a day after Fed  
Governor Laurence Meyer warned that some banks may be counting too 
much on the economic boom continuing. Meyer's remarks, in a speech 
to bankers, were the latest among recent warnings by government 
officials about bank lending standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed action came in a supervisory letter, the means by which  
it informs its examiners and the banking industry of key policy 
directives. 
</P>
<P>
	``While loan portfolios are currently sound at the vast majority  
of banks, any trends toward laxity need to be reversed ... to 
ensure that the banking system remains strong and vibrant and 
retains the ability to lend to sound borrowers in good times and in 
bad,'' wrote Richard Spillenkothen, director of the Fed's Division 
of Banking Supervision and Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	A few banks are extending credit to some borrowers ``based  
largely on the expectation that the current strong financial 
performance of these borrowers will continue indefinitely,'' the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that if examiners see signs of problems at banks, such  
as bank officials being slow to recognize problem loans, they 
should consider taking action and downgrading banks' federal 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech Monday to the Institute of International Bankers,  
Meyer cited ``a possible relaxation in credit discipline that our 
supervisory reviews have detected at some (U.S.) banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While noting that bank loans remain sound overall, he said  
numbers of questionable loans ``have been rising modestly at some 
banks'' in recent months, a trend the central bank director called 
``troubling.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Look Like the Same Ol' Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Bob Whitfield, walking toward the meeting  
room to watch video from another Falcons loss, summed up the plight 
facing the defending NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you if we go 13-3, we'll have the best record in  
football,'' Atlanta's offensive tackle said Monday. ``We've just 
got to win the rest of our games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dirty Birds may have been able to pull off such a feat.  
However, these guys look like the same ol' Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mere eight months, Atlanta (0-3) has gone from Super Bowl  
to super trouble, threatening to ruin all the goodwill that built 
up during that magical run to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, is it hockey season yet?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun playing in front of a lot of people,'' Whitfield  
said. ``If we lose a couple of games and the people don't want to 
come out, so be it. I guess we'll have to play in front of 
nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons sank further into the abyss Sunday, when a St. Louis  
team that was 4-12 a year ago routed the Falcons 35-7. The game 
wasn't even as close as the score, the Rams converting on their 
first four possessions and outgaining Atlanta 311-67 in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like they were playing a different speed than we  
were,'' coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 17-0 in each of their first two games, the  
Falcons trailed 28-0 to the Rams. The injury-depleted offense, 
averaging 9.3 points per game, struggled once again, only this time 
it was complemented by a complete breakdown on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran into a buzz saw in St. Louis,'' Marty Carter said.  
``Wow. It was bombs away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams' dominance was epitomized by a three-play sequence in  
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	With his team already leading 7-0, Kurt Warner threw a 38-yard  
touchdown pass to Torry Holt on third-and-18. After Todd Lyght 
intercepted a pass from Chris Chandler, Warner capitalized on the 
very next play with a 46-yard scoring strike to Isaac Bruce. On the 
first play of St. Louis' next possession, Marshall Faulk broke off 
a 58-yard run to set up another TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just gave up way too many big plays,'' Reeves said. ``On  
the road, where your defense has to play well, we just didn't get 
the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling, the Falcons secondary ``looked like the Keystone  
Kops,'' in the words of free safety Eugene Robinson. During a bye 
week, St. Louis came up with a game plan that caught Atlanta 
completely off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took chances downfield and caught us with different  
formations we didn't expect,'' Carter admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, the Falcons have been plagued by factors beyond their  
control. All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson is out for the season 
with a knee injury, while Chandler is hobbling on a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed one game, tried to come back too soon Sunday and  
wound up being knocked out again before halftime. He is 
questionable for next weekend's game against the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very good,'' Chandler said Monday. ``I'm just trying  
to get it better before it gets worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already worse for the Falcons is the situation on the defensive  
line, where tackles Shane Dronett and Ed Jasper are both out for 
2-to-4 weeks. Dronett pulled his right calf muscle, while Jasper 
sustained ligament damage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, the entire team is suffering a severe case of  
shellshock. Although the Falcons have never put together 
consecutive winning seasons during their 34-year history, no one 
expected a start like this. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning breeds confidence,'' Reeves said. ``Losing brings  
around the wrong kind of things: people second-guessing you, people 
talking about how bad you are playing. That is all you hear and all 
you read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, this is not what Carter had in mind when he signed  
with the Falcons as a free agent after eight mostly losing seasons 
in Tampa Bay and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have such high  
expectations,'' he said. ``That's the most difficult thing. We're 
on every sports show, every channel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only five teams have rebounded from an 0-3 start to make the  
playoffs, and it's little consolation that the Super Bowl champion 
Broncos are also winless after three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons owner Taylor Smith is confident Reeves can get things  
turned around, as he did during his first season in Atlanta. In 
1997, the Falcons were 1-7 at the midway point but won six of their 
final eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is so consistent,'' Smith said. ``He knows how to handle  
things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He better hurry.

<HEADLINE> Cook Ejected in Mets' Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Cook, ejected Tuesday during an argument  
in the New York Mets' 9-3 loss to Atlanta, doesn't think he should 
be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook was removed after walking Gerald Williams in the eighth  
inning, and talked to plate umpire Alfonzo Marquez as he walked 
back to the Mets' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a difference of opinion,'' said Cook, angry with  
ball-strike calls. ``I expressed mine. He expressed his. I'm 
frustrated. I thought some of the pitches were good pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An argument ensued, and Cook's cap bumped the cap of Marquez,  
one of the 25 new umpires hired earlier this month. Cook also drew 
a line with dirt over the plate to point out where he thought his 
pitches were. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine quickly got between them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he made any contact with the umpire,'' Valentine  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Cook is suspended, the penalty likely wouldn't take  
effect until next season. He probably would ask the players' 
association to appeal, delaying any suspension until after NL 
president Len Coleman holds a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Cook, the Mets are home all week, so if there  
is a suspension, Coleman could try to hold a hearing in the next 
few days.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Build Va. Service Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's leading maker of  
computer chips, said Tuesday it will locate a $130 million Internet 
service center in Virginia that will employ 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Online Services, a new subsidiary of Intel Corp., will  
house more than 8,000 servers and run the Web sites and 
electronic-commerce operations of numerous companies at the Fairfax 
County site. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73,000 square foot building near Dulles International  
Airport should be in operation by early 2000. That will make it a 
neighbor to the world's largest Internet services company, 
Dulles-based America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., have seen enormous  
growth in high-tech and Internet businesses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large and growing proportion of the world's Internet traffic  
flows through Virginia,'' Mike Aymar, Intel vice president and 
general manager of Intel Online Services, said. ``That made 
Virginia a natural location for Intel's expanding Internet services 
hosting business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first two Internet service centers of Intel Online Services  
already are operational. One is a production plant in Santa Clara, 
Calif., and the other is a development facility in Folsom, Calif. 
The company plans to develop similar centers in Japan and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the world's largest maker of computer chips, Intel  
is also a leading manufacturer of computer, networking and 
communications products.

	``Mary'' (MCA Records) -- Mary J. Blige  

</P>
<P>
	Mary J. Blige may not have a voice like Aretha Franklin, but  
like the Queen of Soul, the so-called Queen of Hip-Hop has a voice 
that captures your heart, seizing the emotion of a song so strongly 
that you begin to think it's your emotion, too. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Mary,'' the rhythm and blues diva's fourth album, Blige  
embarks on a musical and emotional journey that stirs the soul, 
leaving you alternately happy, sad, feeling hopeless -- and hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	The album starts out on an upbeat note, with Lauryn Hill's ``All  
That I Can Say,'' a dreamy, uptempo track that has Blige in awe of 
the man in her life. Blige's sometimes gravelly alto voice sounds 
beautiful in the backdrop of Hill's mellow groove. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, like much of the album, has a 1970s soul feel. Blige  
actually reaches back to that era to capture some of that magic, 
using part of the melody of ``I Can't Help It,'' from Michael 
Jackson's ``Off the Wall'' on ``Sexy,'' the most hip-hop oriented 
track of the disc, and Elton John's ``Benny and the Jets'' on 
``Deep Inside,'' in which she asks people to see her as ``just 
plain ol' Mary'' and not an untouchable superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Franklin makes an appearance on the disc, on ``Don't Waste  
Your Time,'' on which she gives Blige advice to dump her no-good 
man. No-good men are an underlying theme on this disc, and it's 
when Blige sings about kicking them to the curb that she seems to 
be at her best -- on ``Not Lookin','' she and ex-love K-Ci trash 
talk while engaging in a sexually charged tango. 
</P>
<P>
	Most moving is ``Your Child,'' in which Blige learns about her  
man's secret child from his lover. She so intensely makes the 
listener feel the pain and the hurt in her voice that it will make 
a woman look at her man cross-eyed -- even if he hasn't done 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Blige co-wrote at least half the songs on this disc, and is one  
of its executive producers. Perhaps that is why it is her best 
recording yet. Maybe the more ``Mary'' Blige gives, the better she 
gets.

	``Rough Harvest'' (Mercury Records) -- John Mellencamp  

</P>
<P>
	Call this John Mellencamp's attempt at an ``Unplugged'' album.  
``Rough Harvest'' appears on the surface to be a throwaway project 
and an attempt to cash in on the craze started by the 
acoustic-style MTV performance show. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead, the recording gives new depths to the work of one  
of the most prolific artists of the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Using stripped-down arrangements, Mellencamp revisits some of  
the best songs of the latter stages of his career, with the few 
years he's added also giving needed depth to such socially 
challenging songs as ``Love and Happiness'' and ``Jackie Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the gravel in his voice -- the result of a lot of hard  
touring and even harder living in his early days -- doesn't do any 
harm to ``Minutes to Memories,'' a tale of an old man telling his 
life story on a bus ride through the Midwest, or ``Human Wheels,'' 
which gets a dose of humanity missing in the original studio 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The liner notes say this is the kind of music Mellencamp and his  
crack band play when they just want to play music. Perhaps they 
should play this way all the time.

	``Ariodante'' (Archiv) -- opera by George Frideric Handel; Anne  
Sophie von Otter, Lynne Dawson, Ewa Podles, Richard Croft, Veronica 
Cangemi, Denis Sedov, Luc Coadou; Les Musiciens du Louvre , 
conducted by Marc Minkowski 

</P>
<P>
	In 1909, an English music historian named R.A. Streatfeild wrote  
that Handel's operas were ``sadly remote from the circle of modern 
sympathy,'' with virtually no performances in more than 100 years. 
Handel was an oratorio man, you see, despite more than 40 of his 
operas taking the stages of Covent Garden and the King's Theater 
between 1711 and 1741. 
</P>
<P>
	But something happened in the early 1950s. Championed by  
musicologist Edward J. Dent, Handel opera performances sputtered 
back to life; a Joan Sutherland Alcina in 1957 with the Handel 
Opera Society was momentous. 
</P>
<P>
	Other societies began regular performances. Soon major houses  
and cutting edge directors like Peter Sellars were producing them. 
Then, riding the original instrument performance wave of recent 
years, the works have been coming out regularly on CD. 
</P>
<P>
	The high quality of this latest entry from Archiv, conducted by  
37-year-old Baroque performance prodigy Marc Minkowski, shows how 
far we've come from Mr. Streatfeild's lament. A star-quality cast, 
superb sound,excellent playing and a mainstream label tell that 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	The other story here is Ariodante's (von Otter) love for Ginevra  
(Dawson), daughter of the king of Scotland (Sedov). Polinesso 
(Podles), with designs on the throne, induces her attendant Dalinda 
(Cangemi) to receive him dressed as her mistress. Ariodante sees 
this and goes off in jealously suicidal fashion. But Dalinda 
reveals all, Ariodante's brother Lurcanio (Croft) strikes down the 
evil suitor and rejoicing breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
	Minkowski, a Frenchman, brings together a truly international  
cast -- Swede, Briton, Pole, American, Argentine, Russian-born 
Israeli and another Frenchman -- not bad for a German composer 
writing Italian operas for the English stage. He propels the action 
forward and shows unusual attention to dynamic subtleties for a 
Baroque conductor. The original instrument sound is a bit grainy, 
but not too gritty. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Otter's lied-singing strengths serve her well in Ariodante's  
inner monologues, and she sings with intense expression, the 
quality needed to make these sorts of arias work. Dawson brings a 
beauty of tone and Podles a cavernous contralto to the mix. The 
rest of the cast reveals few faults. 
</P>
<P>
	Handel provides his usual wonderful touches: furious  
violin-bowing to summon the Furies; low, sustained string chords 
depicting a moonlit night; hollow bassoon tones to evoke the ghost 
that Ariodante wants to return as before the perfidy is revealed.

<HEADLINE> Jones: NFL Should Expand to Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The NFL should give Houston an expansion  
team, then concentrate on finding a team to relocate to Los 
Angeles, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Houston is ready to begin building the 32nd  
franchise, the moves need to be done as a package to ensure that 
the league gets to pick which team goes to Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, the NFL should not do anything until we've got a  
plan that says, `OK, if we go to Houston, then this is how we go to 
LA,''' Jones said. ``That way, we're still in control of our own 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we make the commitment of where the expansion team goes,  
we're going to leave open a great market like Houston or LA -- a 
better market than some clubs are in. That doesn't necessarily mean 
they're going to pick up and move, but it's going to be an 
attractive situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has made no secret of its desire to return to Los  
Angeles, the nation's second-largest TV market. Getting back to 
Houston has been a secondary concern. 
</P>
<P>
	The logical plan seemed to be to give Los Angeles a new team,  
then try finding a team willing to move to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones said the opposite now seems to make more sense because  
Los Angeles hasn't presented a stadium plan or an ownership group 
that the NFL likes, while Houston has had both in place for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economics already are in place with a good partnership  
between the city, state and proposed ownership in Houston,'' Jones 
said. ``So just from the can-do aspect of it financially, it's less 
of a hurdle to go to Houston than LA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the two main ownership groups vying for the Los  
Angeles franchise did not immediately return messages left by The 
Associated Press. A message also was left for the proposed owners 
in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL set a Sept. 15 deadline for Los Angeles to come up with  
an acceptable stadium and financing plan, but that date passed with 
the league continuing to talk with all interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was important to create an incentive for LA to  
get its act together and get it done, the result being we would 
probably put an expansion team there,'' Jones said. ``It didn't 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving an existing team to Los Angeles would solve several of  
LA's problems, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding an owner wouldn't be a problem, because that team  
already would have one. Neither would the franchise fee that could 
reach $600 million or more. The only remaining question would be 
finding a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he doesn't expect any action to be taken for Houston  
or Los Angeles when owners meet Tuesday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that at least a handful of owners feel like we need to  
make sure that when the decision comes down that we take care of 
both cities,'' he said. ``The best chance to resolve LA-Houston 
would be to leave it open at least through the fall. My thinking is 
that is what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said it's unlikely the league would put expansion teams in  
both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the next expansion team will be the last for many,  
many years to come,'' said Jones, who hinted that the next round of 
expansion would likely be outside the United States. ``I don't want 
to create 33 teams with any decision we make over the next month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones defended the NFL's continued devotion to Los Angeles  
despite all the problems it has encountered. 
</P>
<P>
	``If football is important to 5 or 6 percent of the people in  
LA, that's equal to 100 percent of the people in some other places 
where we are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is apathy there, it's a little bit of a result of not  
having a team there. I think the longer we keep a team out of 
there, the more apathy we're going to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the NFL is hurting itself by not having teams in Los  
Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be in the great population centers,'' he said. ``In  
our infinite wisdom as owners, we have somehow maneuvered so that 
we don't have franchises in these two great markets.''

<HEADLINE> Chase Buying Hambrecht &AMP; Quist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's  
third-biggest bank, is buying Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for $1.35 billion, 
giving Chase the investment banking business it has coveted for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase has long expressed a desire to become a bigger player in  
the securities business ranging from underwriting stock for new 
companies to advising older ones on mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, follows more than a year of  
speculation that Chase would partner with one of Wall Street's 
giant securities firms, such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. or Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at them all, and this is the one the patient  
investor decided to go with,'' said James B. Lee Jr., a Chase vice 
chairman who will head the bank's investment banking arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hambrecht &AMP; Quist caters to technology companies, and has  
underwritten the first stock offerings for companies like Netscape, 
Amazon.com and Garden.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, however, is a relatively small player on Wall  
Street, leading some investors to wonder how New York-based Chase 
will expand the business to beat rivals like Citigroup Inc., which 
owns Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee did not rule out another acquisition, saying ``We will  
continue to review all of our strategic options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as a first step, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist will change its name to  
Chase Securities West. The 30-year-old firm will keep its 
headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel H. Case III, chairman and chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP;  
Quist, will become chairman and chief executive of Chase Securities 
West and head of Chase's global technology group. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's employees from defecting, Chase is  
also establishing a $200 million incentive plan for executives who 
sign contracts to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica Corp. had a problem with employees leaving after the  
No. 2 bank purchased Montgomery Securities in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the acquisition, Chase will pay $50 a share for each share of  
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. That is a 22 percent premium over the closing 
price Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted to the bid by sending Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's  
shares up almost 19 percent, or by $7.75, to $48.81 1/4 in midday 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Chase's stock dipped 
$1.12 1/2 to $73. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has already been approved by the boards of both  
companies and is expected to close by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hambrecht &AMP; Quist employs about 1,000 people in offices in San  
Francisco, New York, Boston, Atlanta, London, Tokyo and Tel Aviv, 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan has more than $357 billion in assets with  
operations in 48 countries around the globe.

<HEADLINE> Mild U.S. Support for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRNS, Australia (AP) -- Indonesia will face ``serious  
consequences'' if it fails to ensure the success of the 
U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping mission in East Timor and prevent more 
violence against refugees who have fled the former Portuguese 
colony into West Timor, Defense Secretary William Cohen said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on an Australian morning news show before  
meeting with Defense Minister John Moore, Cohen said he would make 
the point to top Indonesian leaders as well as opposition figures 
when he holds talks in Jakarta on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message I will deliver is that the Indonesian government  
has an obligation to see to it that these people who are displaced 
now in West Timor are allowed to go back to their homes in East 
Timor, that ... they prevent the militias from in any way 
interfering or harming them,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what would happen if Indonesian did not cooperate,  
Cohen said, ``It will have serious consequences to the nature of 
the relationship that Indonesia will have with the rest of the 
world.'' He mentioned diplomatic isolation and ``perhaps economic 
consequences as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen declined to say whether the United States would change its  
mind about the level of its military involvement in East Timor and 
contribute combat troops if Australia said they were needed to 
ensure the mission's success. So far, the United States has 
contributed about 260 support forces but no combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who arrived in Cairns, on Australia's northeastern coast,  
on Tuesday night local time, said the U.S. military is stretched 
too thin elsewhere in the world to be able to contribute ground 
forces to help restore order in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is very much stretched across the globe  
trying to make sure we contribute to peace and stability, but we 
are not the global policeman,'' Cohen said in Wednesday's TV 
interview in Cairns. 
</P>
<P>
	Later on Wednesday, Cohen was flying to the northern Australian  
city of Darwin, the jumping-off point for peacekeepers, to meet 
with Australian military officials and pay a visit to some of the 
U.S. support troops there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lead has been taken by the Australians,'' Cohen said en  
route to Cairns. ``They are really stepping out, and we are 
providing as much support as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of this week, about 260 Americans were assigned to  
the mission, most in Darwin but a handful in East Timor, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon now is increasing its intelligence support for the  
peacekeepers but is unlikely to offer significant additional 
troops, U.S. officials traveling with Cohen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon sent seven more intelligence officials to Darwin to  
help Australian intelligence. Also, Australia is being supported by 
the U.S. Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 27 Americans are being dispatched, apparently to  
Darwin, ``in support of special intelligence requirements,'' the 
Pentagon said without elaborating. A six-man special communications 
team from Hawaii also is heading to the area to provide secure 
communications and ``specialized intelligence capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping effort in East Timor comprises  
several thousand military personnel, mainly from Australia and 
Southeast Asian nations. Washington says it has no plans to offer 
combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Among additional U.S. contributions Cohen is considering:  
increased use of U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-141 transport aircraft 
for flights into Darwin or Baucau, East Timor's second city east of 
the capital Dili. Eventually the Pentagon intends to send a 
nine-member airlift control squad to Baucau for aircraft loading 
and unloading operations, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. forces might also provide water purification equipment, and  
Cohen said he was looking for ways the United States can help ease 
the humanitarian crisis among displaced East Timorese. He mentioned 
temporary housing, food and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States broke off military relations with Indonesia in  
early September in response to the violence triggered by an Aug. 30 
referendum in which East Timor's population voted overwhelmingly 
for independence from Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Downpours Cause New N.C. Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six inches of rain kicked off new flooding  
today in an area already devastated by Hurricane Floyd's 
inundation, washing out roads and a spillway and forcing residents 
to evacuate one residential area. 
</P>
<P>
	The pouring rain that fell during the night cut through roads  
and made bridges in Wayne County and other areas impassable this 
morning southeast of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising water poured over the top of the Lake Wackena dam three  
miles southeast of Goldsboro and washed out the spillway, said 
National Guard Maj. Dave Culbreth. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guardsmen went door to door this morning, evacuating  
residents of the Walnut Creek subdivision near Goldsboro and piling 
up sandbags to protect homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city's almost like an island,'' Culbreth said. ``We have  
some flooding in town again. We're almost back to ground zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina, Goldsboro was nearly cut off from the outside world by 
flooding on the Neuse River and its tributaries. That high water 
had just receded this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The setback came after feeble signs of recovery began to emerge  
Monday in eastern North Carolina. After an unprecedented six-day 
layoff, the flue-cured tobacco markets rebounded with generally 
higher prices to cheer farmers, many of whom had little else to 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 39,000 North Carolina residents have registered for  
state and federal assistance so far since Floyd's devastation. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has approved more than 
$3.8 million in direct aid to hurricane victims in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates show Floyd caused $70.2 million in housing  
damage in eastern North Carolina, with more than 3,000 homes 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 47 people died in North Carolina when the hurricane  
flooded parts of an 18,000-square-mile area. An estimated 2,100 
people remain in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimate agricultural losses due to Floyd will exceed  
$1 billion, and many eastern North Carolina farmers may decide it's 
time to try something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports that we're putting out estimate that fully 15  
percent of the growers affected by these floods will probably go 
ahead and get out of the business,'' said Jim Knight, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer can make a whole lot more money raising houses and  
trailer parks than he can corn and cotton,'' Knight said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have suggested the state should impose  
restrictions that could remove animal waste lagoons, as well as 
municipal sewage plants, from flood-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But farm advocates say that would be complicated and expensive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to say you're going to move people,'' said Ann Cohen  
of the North Carolina Farm Bureau. ``The question is, do they own 
land to move to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agriculture officials have been told that farmers need  
direct assistance, not loans. Most already are carrying all the 
debt they can handle, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco sales on North Carolina's flue-cured markets resumed  
Monday for the first time since they were halted Sept. 14 as Floyd 
bore down on the region. State officials estimate tobacco losses at 
$98.5 million -- nearly 10 percent of the value of last year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Lewis, his eyes red and moist, said his corn, soybeans and  
cotton all were destroyed by wind and flood. The 59-year-old farmer 
from Tarboro managed to get most of his tobacco crop into curing 
barns by the time Floyd hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He already owes more than $400,000 for his wife's bone marrow  
transplant and other medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is talking about loans. I've got all the loans  
I need. I can't pay back what I've got,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Iran's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton secretly sent a letter last  
month to Iranian President Mohammed Khatemi offering improved 
relations in exchange for help finding the bombers of a U.S. 
military base in Saudi Arabia in 1996, according to The Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was carried to Paris by a senior White House official  
and passed to a messenger from Oman, who then delivered it to Iran, 
the newspaper said in its Wednesday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the letter was first reported earlier this  
month by Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper earlier and was confirmed by 
State Department spokesman James Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request for Iran's help was based partly on  
intelligence reports that three Saudis who could be connected with 
the bombing of the Khobar Towers military housing complex were 
taking refuge in Iran, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 25, 1996 blast killed 19 servicemen and wounded more  
than 500 other people. The FBI has received less than full 
cooperation in the case from Saudi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a senior Clinton administration official, the Post said  
Clinton's message suggested steps Khatemi could take that would 
result in improved relations. Khatemi, a moderate cleric who was 
elected in 1997, has also said he wants better relations with 
Western countries.

<HEADLINE> El Paso Energy OKs Assets Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- El Paso Energy Corp. said Tuesday it has agreed to  
sell pipeline companies in the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico to win 
federal regulators' approval of its merger with Sonat Inc., which 
will create the largest U.S. natural gas transportation company. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials and outside analysts had expected the Federal  
Trade Commission to require some divestiture before allowing the 
merger to proceed. El Paso Energy is buying Sonat Inc. for $4 
billion in stock and also will assume $2 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy, a Houston-based holding company, agreed to sell  
East Tennessee Natural Gas Co., and Sea Robin Pipeline Co. and 
Sonat's one-third interest in Destin Pipeline Co. Analysts who met 
with El Paso management Tuesday in New York said chief executive 
William A. Wise estimated the company will raise more than $500 
million from the sales and use the money to pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't plan for that much to be divested, but I'm more  
concerned with earnings, and earnings will be enhanced when all is 
said and done,'' said Donato Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a forced sale of assets had been expected.  
</P>
<P>
	El Paso and Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat are the top two  
pipeline companies in the Tenneseee-Virginia market where East 
Tennessee operates 1,200 miles of pipeline. Sea Robin and Destin 
operate a combined 665 miles in the Gulf of Mexico, where El Paso 
has a stake another company, Leviathan Gas Pipeline Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy said it hopes to complete the sales by the end of  
next year's first quarter. Spokeswoman Paula Delaney said the three 
pipelines to be sold accounted for $45 million to $50 million in 
earnings before interest and taxes, just 3 percent of the $1.5 
billion in combined earnings before interest and taxes for El Paso 
and Sonat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's not strategic to their operations or they  
wouldn't have made the agreement,'' said Edward Tirello Jr., an 
analyst for Deutche Banc Alex. Brown. He said possible buyers 
include Kinder Morgan Inc., CMS Energy Corp., Duke Energy Corp., 
and Columbia Energy Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirello said the divestitures signal El Paso's shift toward  
power generation instead of just owning pipelines. He also 
predicted that the company will look next to merge with a major 
electric company such as Entergy, Reliant or TXU Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	When combined, El Paso and Sonat will operate 40,000 miles of  
pipeline -- about 25 percent more than rival Enron Corp. -- and be 
involved in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas. 
El Paso is also increasingly involved on the international front, 
building power plants and buying pipelines in South America, 
Europe, and the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Tuesday the merger will save $60 million  
to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders of both companies approved the merger in June, but  
it still needs approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, which is scheduled to take it up Wednesday. The company 
expects the deal to close within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso had revenue last year of nearly $5.8 billion and net  
income of $225 million. Sonat lost $530 million last year on 
revenue of $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso stock fell 25 cents Thursday to close at $37.62 1/2 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where Sonat's shares were up 12 1/2 
cents to $37.25.

<HEADLINE> New Vaccine Reduces Pneumonia Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The first pneumonia vaccine designed for  
infants appears to sharply reduce severe childhood cases of the 
disease and could save hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, which will be considered soon for approval in the  
United States, is intended to protect youngsters from a variety of 
illnesses caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were released Tuesday from a major study of the  
vaccine's effect on childhood pneumonia. The vaccine has already 
been shown to lower the risk of earaches, meningitis and blood 
poisoning resulting from the germ. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a triumph for kids,'' said Dr. Steven Black, who  
presented the data at an infectious-disease meeting sponsored by 
the American Society for Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the world, pneumonia caused by pneumococcus results in an  
estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Black estimated that the vaccine 
could prevent 450,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the bacteria is rarely fatal. However, it  
does account for 100 to 150 deaths each year. 
</P>
<P>
	An adult vaccine for this germ has long been available, but it  
does not work in youngsters. The new vaccine was developed by 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which paid for the testing. An advisory 
committee of the Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to meet 
Nov. 4 to consider whether to recommend its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and colleagues from the Kaiser Permanente health plan  
tested the vaccine on 37,830 children in California. Half of them 
got the shots at two, four and six months and again between 12 and 
15 months. The rest got a different experimental vaccine that has 
no effect on pneumococcus. 
</P>
<P>
	During three years of follow-up, 1,309 of the children were  
diagnosed with pneumonia. The vaccinated youngsters were one-third 
less likely to get moderately severe pneumonia that was bad enough 
to show up on X-rays, and they were three-quarters less likely to 
get severe cases, which occurred in 33 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier data released from the study showed that vaccinated  
youngsters were 89 percent less likely to get bacterial blood 
poisoning or meningitis. And they were about 20 percent less likely 
to have inner ear infections -- otitis media -- that were bad enough 
to require insertion of drain tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a remarkable vaccine that will have a dramatic effect,''  
said Dr. Henry Shinefield, another of the Kaiser researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 types of the bacteria cause illness. The new vaccine is  
designed to guard against seven varieties that are most common in 
children. These are also types of the bug that are frequently 
resistant to common antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Cynthia Whitney of the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention noted that about one-quarter of victims of severe 
pneumococcus infections in the United States have bacteria that are 
resistant to penicillin, and nearly 15 percent are impervious to at 
least three drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the new vaccine makes youngsters less like to  
carry and spread the bacteria. This could reduce the spread of the 
bacteria even to adults who are not vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that for severe pneumococcal disease,  
this vaccine is excellent,'' said Dr. Edward Janoff of the 
University of Minnesota. ``It would be hard to get one better. For 
less serious disease, such as ear infections, it is less 
effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another study on 1,662 children, conducted by Dr. Juhani Eskola  
and others from the National Public Health Institute in Finland, 
looked at the risk of earaches caused by the varieties of 
pneumococcus bacteria specifically covered by the vaccine. The

<HEADLINE> Russian Builders Unveil Naval Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Catering to foreign customers, Russian  
shipbuilders are offering a stealth-technology patrol ship and a 
new missile boat, a news agency reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The St.Petersburg-based Central Maritime Design Office said it  
would start building the new Skorpion patrol ship next year using 
stealth technology that will help it elude radar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Skorpion has a displacement of 470 tons and is equipped with  
four containers of anti-ship Yakhont missiles, two Kashtan-1 
missiles as well as artillery pieces, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Skorpion has a top speed of 40 knots and a range of 2,000  
nautical miles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another St. Petersburg-based design company, Almaz, has  
developed an export version of the Molnia speedboat and plans to 
test-fire supersonic Moskit anti-ship missiles from it next month. 
The 550-ton ship is armed with four Moskit missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the pilot Molnia boat now undergoing tests at the  
Black Sea base of Feodosia, a shipyard based in the Volga River 
city of Rybinsk has made four others which already have potential 
buyers, ITAR-Tass said without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of the impoverished military, the Russian Navy has  
little money for new weapons, and shipbuilders have increasingly 
been looking to export contracts in order to survive.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Facing Small Island Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite recent conservation efforts,  
environmental challenges on small islands represent on a lesser 
scale the problems soon to be faced by larger countries, the U.N. 
Environmental Program said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Small island nations must deal with dramatic increases in  
population, urbanization, natural resource consumption and poverty 
-- just as larger nation do. However, small islands have less 
capacity to deal with the problems, according to three reports 
released at U.N. headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports, drafted by UNEP with support from the European  
Union, cover the Caribbean, the Western Indian Ocean and the 
Pacific Islands. They were released Tuesday to coincide with the 
close of a two-day special session of the General Assembly devoted 
to the environmental and economic troubles facing small islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Klaus Toepfer, the executive director of UNEP, praised the  
governments of small island nations for taking the lead in 
ratifying international environmental treaties, but said 
conservation has fallen far short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the Caribbean, Pacific Islands and the Western Indian  
Ocean regions are on an unsustainable course, environmental 
degradation is threatening their very foundations,'' Toepfer said. 
Land and marine species are under grave threat and little has been 
done to reverse past environmental destruction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the greatest threat to small islands is global  
climate change, which scientists say will cause more severe 
hurricanes and a rise in sea levels, possibly engulfing thousands 
of oceanside communities, Toepfer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism, once seen as a major source of revenue for many small  
islands, actually threatens the islands' environment, if it 
generates too much solid waste, destroys environmental attractions, 
or deplete natural resources, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When (the report) says that the island regions will continue  
to face a steady and serious decline of environmental quality, we 
are not taken by surprise, because we know and we anticipate it,'' 
said Samoa's U.N. ambassador, Neroni Slade, who also chairs the 
Alliance of Small Island States. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports make a number of recommendations, which include  
fighting poverty, integrating natural resource management into all 
aspects of life and preparing for sea-level rise.

<HEADLINE> Miami U. Loses Johnson to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- Miami University lost its top receiver, Sly  
Johnson, to a knee injury as the team prepares to play No. 17 
Marshall on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a junior, is out indefinitely with a torn anterior  
cruciate ligament in his right knee. He was injured during the 
first quarter of last Saturday's game at Central Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	He was second in the nation with 145.3 receiving yards per game  
going into last weekend's games, and was on pace to set numerous 
school receiving records this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had worked so hard in the offseason and was really having a  
special season,'' Miami coach Terry Hoeppner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson caught 16 passes for the Redhawks (3-1) this season,  
including six for 50 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami officials gave no indication of when Johnson might be able  
to play football again.

<HEADLINE> Royal Philips To Sell Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Royal Philips Electronics NV, one  
of the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturers, said 
Tuesday that it plans to sell off its Strategic Projects division. 
</P>
<P>
	The division, which sells electronic networks for purposes such  
as television studios, industrial parks and airports, had sales of 
$424 million in 1998 and employed 1,350 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said it has started discussions with ``a number of  
companies'' but didn't identify potential buyers or say how much it 
expects to make from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which had overall sales of nearly $34 billion last  
year, said it decided to jettison the division after a strategic 
review showed that it ``no longer fits within the overall portfolio 
of the Philips group.''

<HEADLINE> Visitation Rights To Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set the stage Tuesday for an  
important ruling on grandparents' rights to see their grandchildren 
even when parents object -- a case that could affect laws in all 50 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine justices -- six of them with grandchildren of their own  
-- agreed to decide whether a state can give visitation rights to 
grandparents when, after a divorce or some other family split, the 
children's parents say no. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves Washington state, where the state's highest  
court ruled that such a law violates parents' ``fundamental right'' 
to rear their families without governmental interference. All other 
states have similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``State intervention to better a child's quality of life through  
third-party visitation is not justified where the child's 
circumstances are otherwise satisfactory,'' the state court said 
last Dec. 24 in wiping out a Anacortes, Wash., couple's legal right 
to see their two granddaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``To suggest otherwise would be the logical equivalent of  
asserting that the state has the authority to break up stable 
families and redistribute its infant population to provide each 
child with the 'best family,''' the state court added. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices indicated they will hear arguments in the case in  
January. Their decision is expected by next June. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time this month, the court got a head start on  
its 1999-2000 term, which will begin Monday, by granting cases. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who returned home Tuesday after an 
11-day hospital stay during which she underwent colon cancer 
surgery, apparently participated in the court action. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states had enacted grandparent-visitation laws by the early  
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the justices rejected challenges to such laws in  
Kentucky and Wisconsin. But in 1995, the court let stand a state 
court's ruling that struck down a Georgia law allowing grandparents 
to win access to their grandchildren over parents' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Washington case, Gary and Jenifer Troxel seek to regain  
visitation rights to their young granddaughters, Natalie and 
Isabelle, over the objections of the girls' mother, Tommie 
Granville Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ecstatic that this is going to be heard,'' Jenifer  
Troxel said from the couple's home. ``We think it's important to 
grandparents all over the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Wynn's residence went unanswered.  
</P>
<P>
	The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Brad Troxel and Tommie Granville were never married but had two  
daughters during their relationship. When they separated, Troxel 
lived with his parents. The girls regularly visited him there. 
</P>
<P>
	After Troxel's death, the girls continued seeing their  
grandparents regularly until their mother limited their visits. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1993, the Troxels went into state court to obtain  
enforceable visitation rights, and in 1995 they were awarded 
visitation one weekend each month, one week during the summer and 
four hours on the girls' birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	While Granville appealed, she married Kelly Wynn. He then  
adopted Natalie and Isabelle. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court and the Washington Supreme Court ruled  
against the grandparents even while recognizing that in some cases 
children will be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family entity is the core element upon which modern  
civilization is founded. ... A parent's constitutionally protected 
right to rear his or her children without state interference has 
been recognized as a fundamental liberty interest ... and also as a 
fundamental right derived from the privacy rights inherent in the 
Constitution,'' the state Supreme Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that the Washington law broadly gave ``any person'' the  
right to petition for visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandparents on the nation's highest court include Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day 
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The other justices are David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and  
Steven G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	DeCosta Mason, a lawyer with AARP's state legislative  
department, praised the court action. ``We have lots of members who 
are very interested in protecting the special and unique bond 
grandparents have with their grandchildren,'' he said. The 
organization supports such legislation as Washington state's law. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Tuesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to judge the constitutionality of a federal law that  
allows rape victims to sue their attackers, a test of how far 
Congress can go in fighting violence motivated by sex 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will decide whether Colorado violated anti-abortion  
demonstrators' free-speech rights by limiting ``sidewalk 
counseling'' outside abortion clinics. Its ruling likely will 
provide important new guidelines for all states and for communities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to use an Illinois case to decide whether patients can  
sue and collect monetary damages from health-maintenance 
organizations (HMOs) for offering financial bonuses to doctors who 
keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether Georgia, and by extension any other  
state, violates prison inmates' rights by reducing the frequency it 
considers requests for parole.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Presidential Primary Is Feb. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire and Iowa officials hustled  
Tuesday to preserve their status as leaders in the lineup of 
presidential caucuses and primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary will be  
Feb. 1, a week earlier than many observers expected, Secretary of 
State Bill Gardner announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner said the main reason for the earlier date is that  
Delaware officials have told him they will probably hold their 
Republican primary on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire law requires the state's primary to be held a week  
before any other state's primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement gives other states a target date as they  
scramble to schedule their contests as close as possible to New 
Hampshire's primary and Iowa's presidential caucuses, tentatively 
set for Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire primary traditionally has been in  
mid-February, eight days after the Iowa caucuses, the leadoff in 
the nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of the lineup of primaries and caucuses is fought  
every four years because states where the fight begins get heavy 
attention from candidates and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Democratic Chairman Rob Tully and Republican Chairman Kayne  
Robinson met Tuesday and said they would seek to pressure Delaware 
officials to set their date as Feb. 15, which would allow the New 
Hampshire primary to return to Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Tully would not rule out moving the Iowa caucus date even  
earlier if the decision for a Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary remained 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the New Hampshire decision, Mark Pfeifle, spokesman  
for the Republican National Committee, said the primary schedule is 
``something the states should work out and Washington should not 
tell states when their delegate selection should or should not 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Democratic National Committee, spokeswoman Jenny Backus  
said, ``This unexpected announcement by Secretary of State Gardner 
raises some concern and certainly confuses the situation,'' she 
said. ``At this point, we have not received any formal notification 
and when we do receive it, we will refer it to our rules and bylaws 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC decided earlier that states other than Iowa and New  
Hampshire are not allowed to hold a primary or caucus before March 
7 without a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina is having its Republican primary Feb. 19.  
Delaware Democrats will hold their primary four days after New 
Hampshire's, but both Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley have 
pledged to ignore that event. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of pressure prompted the New Hampshire Legislature to  
change state law this year to allow the primary to be held as early 
as December.

<HEADLINE> Diet Drug Settlement Plan Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge rejected a $100 million  
settlement a company proposed to pay injury claims by hundreds of 
users of the once popular diet drug Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle said he was uncertain a  
``limited fund'' that Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of 
Lexington, Mass., proposed to set up to settle the lawsuits would 
be fair to all who might have claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 34-page memorandum issued Monday, Bechtle also cited  
``constitutional concerns'' because the deal would not allow 
claimants to opt out and seek separate trials if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated two million Americans used Redux, which Interneuron  
marketed from 1996 to 1997 under an agreement with American Home 
Products Corp. American Home also marketed Redux with another diet 
pill, Pondimin. Pondimin was part of a popular diet pill 
combination known as fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	At the recommendation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,  
both drugs were pulled off the market in September 1997 after 
doctors reported finding heart-valve damage in some users, and a 
wave of lawsuits followed. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home reportedly has offered about $4 billion to settle  
thousands of suits related to the diet drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Levin, cochairman of a committee of plaintiffs' attorneys  
that had negotiated the settlement, said Bechtle's ruling was 
expected in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent rejection of a 
$1.5 billion limited fund settlement in an asbestos case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bechtle noted in his ruling that Interneuron had additional  
assets that were not part of the settlement fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a blow, but by no means a knockout blow,'' said  
Barbara Wruble, an attorney for Interneuron who said the company 
probably will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Interneuron had proposed to place $15 million in cash and $28  
million in proceeds in the limited fund, which would also receive 
$55 million in royalties from future products if those products 
succeed. Bechtle called the reliance on future royalties ``fraught 
with risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 25,000 people had filed claims to share in the  
settlement, some claiming heart-valve damage and some, unable to 
document current ailments, claiming fear of future health problems.

<HEADLINE> Contests Grow at Grocery Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I've been seeing more and more contests linked to soft  
drinks, cereals and other grocery items. Why do the manufacturers 
feel the need to compete in this way? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Companies need to grab and keep consumers' attention -- and  
contests or special promotions help them do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	There are ``value-added'' offers aimed at regular customers. The  
customer buys a product and gets the added bonus of winning a prize 
or receiving a gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a random chance to have their day brightened,'' says  
Mark Owens, a board member of the Promotion Marketing Association, 
a nonprofit consumer trade group based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Value-added offers may also provide rebates, coupons for future  
purchases or offers for premium items that can be purchased at a 
reduced price or may be given away. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, not all shoppers are loyal to one particular brand.  
But if there is a contest with the chance of winning a hefty prize, 
like an all-expense paid trip to an amusement park, the shopper may 
be swayed to make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	There are ``skill contests,'' a type of promotion that gives  
customers an opportunity to win a prize through competition 
involving the exercise of skill in answering a question or solving 
a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also games of chance that permit consumers to  
participate in a contest even without having to make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show consumers think more highly of companies that put  
money into contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the ``odds of winning has to be reasonable enough  
that there's an excitement and a buzz generated,'' says Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores also like promotions because they create attractive  
displays that can generate more sales.

<HEADLINE> Chase Buying Hambrecht &AMP; Quist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's  
third-biggest banking company, is buying the investment banking 
firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for $1.35 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, will give Chase broad securities  
underwriting capabilities and enable it to offer companies a wider 
range of financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase has long expressed a desire to become a bigger player in  
the securities business ranging from underwriting stock for new 
companies to advising older ones on mergers and acquisitions. It 
has frequently been mentioned as a possible partner of even larger 
brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the deal had been approved by both boards and  
is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Chase will pay $50 a share for each share of  
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. That is a 22 percent premium over H&AMP;Q's closing 
price of $41.06 1/4 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hambrecht &AMP; Quist will take the Chase name and continue to be  
headquartered in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	William B. Harrison Jr., president and chief executive of Chase  
Manhattan, called the deal an important strategic move for Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to offer the right financial relationships for  
companies in the new economy -- from venture capital stage to IPO to 
mature company,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel H. Case III, chairman and chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP;  
Quist, will become chairman and chief executive of Chase Securities 
West and head of Chase's global technology group. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase is also establishing a $200 million plan to encourage  
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's key employees to stay with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Hambrecht &AMP; Quist employs about 1,00 people in offices in San  
Francisco, New York, Boston, Atlanta, London, Tokyo and Tel Aviv, 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan has more than $357 billion in assets with  
operations in 48 countries around the globe.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shares were lower across Europe today, driven down  
partly by losses by British banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, Bank of Scotland was the worst performing of the  
blue-chip shares, with a drop of 50 pence to 745.5 pence, followed 
by Royal Bank of Scotland, which fell 72 pence to 1,319 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares were pulled down further by the Dow Jones Industrial  
Average, which fell 152.60 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,150.79 
before European markets closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Europewide indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592  
European companies shedding 4.00 points, or 1.3 percent, to close 
at 305.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 3.82 points 
at 319.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 54.53 points to 3673.40.  
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's FTSE 100 index fell 1.2 percent,  
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 2.3 percent and the Paris CAC-40 
index fell 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Italy, Milan's MIBtel index closed down 0.4  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Declines in the price of Thyseen Krupp, the German steelmaker  
and French telecommunications equipment supplier Alcatel, also 
contributed to the overall European market dip. 
</P>
<P>
	Thyssen Krupp slipped 6.6 percent, or 1.32 euros, to 18.57  
euros, after various politicians said a train project that Thyssen 
Krupp would partly operate will likely be halted because of German 
government budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel shares fell 2.6 percent, or 3.40 euros, to 126.00 euros,  
after the company made a $1.8 billion all-stock offer for U.S. 
Internet-services company Genesys. Investors feared thier shares 
would be diluted by the new stock issue.

<HEADLINE> McCain Gets Campaign Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. (AP) -- Standing in front of the retired  
aircraft carrier Yorktown, Sen. John McCain on Tuesday officially 
launched his presidential campaign in a state that he has said is 
crucial to his staying in the Republican race. 
</P>
<P>
	A former prisoner of war, McCain has focused resources here  
partly because of the large number of military personnel, active 
and retired, in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to defend the nation's security at all costs.  
</P>
<P>
	``As president I won't ask how much security we can afford. I'll  
ask how much security do we need and I will find the resources to 
pay for it,'' the Arizona senator promised a crowd of about 600, 
including elementary school pupils and World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	He made similar speeches to formally launch his campaign Monday  
in New Hampshire and at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., 
from which he graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's event at the Patriot's Point Naval and Maritime Museum  
officially launched his campaign in South Carolina, but McCain has 
been campaigning in the state for months in preparation for its 
first-in-the South GOP primary on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again he said he must make a good showing here to stay in  
the race against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to do well here in South Carolina to continue this  
campaign,'' McCain told about 400 people at a $13-a-plate breakfast 
in Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech in Mount Pleasant, he noted that his grandfather  
once commanded a World War II task force that included the 
Yorktown.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Bid for Orangina Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- After failing in its first attempt to acquire the  
French soft drink brand Orangina, Coca-Cola went back before a 
government committee Tuesday, seeking approval for a revised 
takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has been trying for two years to buy Orangina from the  
French group Pernod Ricard. But the French government agency that 
governs monopolies, the Competition Council, struck down Coke's bid 
in 1998, fearing it would allow the soft drink maker to edge out 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Coke has toned down its offer to appease those  
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised bid, worth $780 million, does not include Orangina's  
distribution sector, allowing for an independent partner to 
distribute Orangina, a fizzy citrus-tasting drink, in restaurants, 
hotels and cafes during the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other soft drinks companies, including Pepsico Inc., currently  
rely on Orangina's distribution network in the French market. The 
French government has been concerned that these companies would 
lose their distribution outlet if Coke bought out Orangina's 
distribution arm. 
</P>
<P>
	If Coke's newest bid is approved, the company will be allowed to  
distribute Orangina in stores, making up about 80 percent of the 
French market for the drink. Coke would not get the restaurant 
distribution rights that Orangina now controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Competition Council is expected to present its  
recommendations to the Finance Ministry in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that Coke has thoroughly addressed government  
concerns about edging out Pepsi and creating a monopoly in its 
latest bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coke has most likely done enough,'' said Olivier Lebrun, a  
food and beverage sector analyst for Natexis Capital. ``Quite 
simply put, the new bid will allow Pepsi to stay alive in France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it will allow Coke to strengthen its interests in Europe,  
where the group has recently suffered setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Coke withdrew its bids for the soft drink brands of  
Cadbury Schweppes in many European countries, including France, 
because concerns about monopoly were so strong. 
</P>
<P>
	And a spate of production problems that led to the marketing of  
contaminated drinks scared away customers in France and Belgium. 
Several European countries banned Coke products temporarily, and 
Coke issued a large-scale product recall.

<HEADLINE> 7 Indicted in Treasury Theft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Seven people were indicted Tuesday in the alleged  
theft of $9.4 million from the state treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Three former treasury workers, two lawyers, and two businessmen  
were charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money was stolen through false claims made to a  
treasury fund where state checks that haven't been cashed sit 
waiting for their rightful owners, Attorney General Thomas Reilly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned the state Treasury into their own private bank.  
... As they needed it, they took it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Reilly, bags of cash -- some containing between  
$300,000 to $400,000 -- were also hauled away from the treasury 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, $6.5 million has been recovered from what Reilly  
characterized as the largest theft of public money in the state's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Four men were originally arrested in the scandal that rocked the  
treasury earlier this year. Three more men were named in Tuesday's 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	They face a total of 39 charges -- from receiving stolen property  
to embezzlement to forgery. If convicted, they could face between 
two years to life in prison.

<HEADLINE>  X-ray Ring Found in Crab Nebula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A never-before-seen ring of X-rays has been  
discovered surrounding the heart of the massive crab nebula in 
space, NASA announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring was revealed by the 2-month-old Chandra X-ray  
observatory. The finding, combined with other observations, may 
provide clues as to how a powerful neutron star provides energy to 
the nebula, NASA researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crab nebula, located about 6,000 light-years from Earth in  
the constellation Taurus, is the remnant of a star that was 
observed to explode in the year 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inner ring is unique,'' said Jeff Hester of Arizona State  
University. ``It has never been seen before, and it should tell us 
a lot about how the energy from the pulsar gets into the nebula. 
It's like finding the transmission lines between the power plant 
and the light bulb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Weisskopf, Chandra Project Scientist at NASA's Marshall  
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the pulsar inside the 
nebula ``is accelerating particles up to the speed of light and 
flinging them out into interstellar space at an incredible rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Hubble Space Telescope images have shown moving  
knots and wisps around the neutron star and X-ray images have shown 
the outer parts of the jet and hinted at the ring structure. With 
Chandra's new observations the ring pattern clearly appears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulsar within the Crab nebula, discovered by radio  
astronomers in 1968, is a neutron star rotating 30 times per 
second. Neutron stars are formed when gravity crushes the central 
core of the star to densities 50 trillion times that of lead and a 
diameter of only 12 miles. They are highly magnetic and rotate 
rapidly, creating a powerful generator.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Fire 2, Joe Public 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Ante Razov scored on a header in the first half  
and Dema Kovalenko added an insurance goal in the second to lead 
the Chicago Fire to a 2-0 victory over Joe Public of Trinidad and 
Tobago on Tuesday night in the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF 
Champions' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's second game in the eight-team tournament had  
Mexican champion Toluca against Alajuela of Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov, the eighth leading scorer in Major League Soccer, scored  
off a corner kick in the 19th minute. He headed in a bending corner 
kick from Peter Nowak to give the Fire a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago battered Joe Public goalkeeper Dovavon Thomas with 22  
shots on goal. Thomas had 11 saves and faced 10 corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko entered the game in the 76th minute and six minutes  
later he found the back of the net thanks to a short pass from 
fellow reserve Paul Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty dribbled up the left side and drew Thomas out of the  
goal before passing the ball to Kovalenko who had a wide open net. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Public failed to mount a substantial attack and only managed  
three shots on goal. Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton made only one 
save. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire, the defending MLS champions, are in fourth place in  
the Western Conference of the MLS and have clinched a playoff spot. 
Joe Public reached the Champions' Cup by winning the Caribbean Club 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's quarterfinals have D.C. United of the MLS against  
Olimpia of Honduras, and Necaxa of Mexico against Saprissa of Costa 
Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinals are Friday and the finals Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The champions advance to the finals of the FIFA Club World  
Championship next January in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Congress Denies Energy Dept. Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress denied the Energy Department money it  
says is needed to monitor and detect hackers trying to penetrate 
computer systems at nuclear weapons laboratories and other 
sensitive facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson complained Tuesday that the $35  
million he had requested was essential to implement his broad 
security reforms announced earlier this year in response to the 
uproar over alleged Chinese theft of nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the money, ``it will be impossible to provide real time  
cyber-intrusion detection and protection'' at the labs or other 
Energy Department sites, Richardson, who was en route to Russia, 
said in a statement issued by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the spending bill, which  
the Senate approved Tuesday by a 96-3 vote, has $109 million for 
nuclear safeguards and security and ``that's plenty of money'' once 
the department's nuclear weapons programs are streamlined and put 
under a new agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in a separate bill, soon to be signed by President  
Clinton, directed creation of a semiautonomous nuclear weapons 
administration within the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also complained that the bill failed to include  
nearly $6 million aimed at addressing another controversial issue 
facing his department -- allegations that thousands of workers at a 
government uranium plant in Kentucky were exposed to illness from 
radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	He had sought $21.8 million for accelerated cleanup, restoration  
and health monitoring at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 
Kentucky as well as at two other plants in Ohio and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress came up with only $16 million. The nearly $6  
million earmarked for health monitoring and an investigation into 
the history of worker exposure at the plants was not included, said 
department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The $21.3 billion spending bill for energy and water projects  
was approved earlier by the House 327-87 and is expected to be 
signed by Clinton despite Richardson's reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision that had prompted a veto threat -- blocking the Army  
Corps of Engineers from proceeding with more restrictive wetlands 
rules -- was removed from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the controversy over Chinese espionage and  
charges of lax security at weapons laboratories, the bill doubles 
the budget for counterintelligence programs to $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson said that by not providing the money for  
increased computer security, it ``withheld important tools needed 
to implement security reform'' at the labs and other department 
weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bill also did not provide enough money to enforce  
new safeguards in the foreign scientists visitor programs at the 
labs and for programs he initiated to centralize security under a 
new ``security czar'' at DOE headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said there wasn't enough money to provide funds for  
those programs and that some of the money might not be needed under 
the reorganization.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Suit Against Notre Dame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A woman injured by someone lunging for a  
ball in the stands during a Notre Dame football game can proceed 
with her lawsuit against the university, the Indiana Court of 
Appeals ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed a lower court ruling that dismissed the  
lawsuit on grounds that Notre Dame did not owe a duty to protect 
Letitia Hayden from the criminal acts of a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said Notre Dame should have foreseen that  
injury would likely result from people lunging for footballs in the 
stands and taken reasonable steps to prevent it. Mrs. Hayden is 
seeking unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame well understands and benefits from the enthusiasm  
of the fans of its football game,'' the unanimous ruling said. ``It 
is just such enthusiasm that drives some spectators to attempt to 
retrieve a football to keep as a souvenir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hayden and her husband, William, were sitting behind the  
goal post in the south end zone Sept. 16, 1995, when one of the 
teams kicked a football toward the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people lunged for the ball and one of them struck Mrs.  
Hayden from behind, fracturing her left shoulder and collarbone. 
She sued the university for failing to exercise care to protect 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame contended that the action of the person who injured  
Mrs. Hayden was unforeseeable and it therefore owed no duty to 
anticipate it and protect her. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said there was evidence of many prior  
incidents in which people were jostled or injured by fans trying to 
retrieve balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame lawyers William Hoye and Jill Bodensteiner weren't  
available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign Jason Watts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos on Tuesday announced the  
signing of former Kentucky player Jason Watts, who was released 
from jail in July after serving 3 1/2 months for a drunken-driving 
crash that killed a teammate and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, a center, will join Denver's developmental squad. The  
team made room for him by releasing defensive lineman Viliami 
Maumau. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Watts pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless  
homicide and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the Nov. 15, 
1998, accident. 
</P>
<P>
	But a judge granted Watts an early release from prison in a  
probation program for nonviolent offenders. Watts is required to 
attend an alcohol abuse program and perform at least 50 hours of 
community service each year. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammate, Arthur Steinmetz, and Eastern Kentucky student  
Scott Brock, both passengers, were killed when Watts' pickup truck 
went out of control as he tried to pass another driver near 
Somerset, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed Watts' blood-alcohol level to be 1 1/2 times the legal  
limit at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said the team was aware of  
Watts' past legal problems. But he said Broncos coach Mike Shanahan 
talked with Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, who gave Watts an 
``unqualified recommendation as an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation existed, but the legal parts are satisfied,''  
Saccomano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumme's recommendation ``was one of the real reasons why'' the  
Broncos signed Watts to the practice squad, Saccomano said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't just ignore other factors in his life,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Says Wife Going To Be OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The wife of Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa was  
hospitalized for more than 12 hours Tuesday with an illness linked 
to her prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Sosa, 25, went home shortly before 6 p.m., according to  
Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Ellen Petasnick. She had 
been admitted to the hospital shortly after she arrived at 5 a.m. 
in an ambulance from the couple's downtown apartment on Lake 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I received a call about 5 o'clock in the morning, and I was  
scared, because that's my wife,'' Sosa said in Philadelphia, where 
the Cubs played the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't specific about what happened but said his wife had  
been taking prescription medication for her menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to her, she said it was her time of the month  
and she had pain in her stomach,'' Sosa said. ``She took some drugs 
for her pain. Those were the regular pills she was supposed to be 
taking. That was the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary moment for anybody. I love my wife. It's a tough  
moment,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he spoke with her twice Tuesday, including just before  
he left his Philadelphia hotel for the ballpark. He said she told 
him not to leave the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `Go out there. I'm OK now. Do your job and don't  
worry about me,''' Sosa said 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast reports said Sonia Sosa felt unwell after drinking  
beer and taking prescription medication.

<HEADLINE> Court to Decide ``Class of One'' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AM-Scotus-Grandparents, Bjt    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will consider squelching a  
Willowbrook, Ill., woman's fight against City Hall over what she 
says was retaliatory action after she sued the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Tuesday it will use Grace Olech's water-service  
case to decide whether a ``class of one'' -- a person who belongs to 
no specially protected group -- can invoke the Constitution's 
guarantee of equal protection when treated differently by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court said yes last November and revived Mrs.  
Olech's lawsuit against Willowbrook and several officials. The case 
has not gone to trial and might never do so if the justices 
disagree with the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Olech and her husband, now dead, used to get their water  
from a well on their property. When the well broke down in 1995, 
they asked the village to connect their home to the municipal water 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The village agreed. But besides requiring the Olechs to pay the  
hookup costs, village officials sought a 33-foot easement both to 
service the water main and to allow for widening the street where 
they lived. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olechs refused, and after three months the village withdrew  
its 33-foot easement request and sought the standard 15-foot 
easement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olechs sued, seeking monetary damages for the three months  
they were without water. Their lawsuit alleged the demand for a 
33-foot easement had been retaliatory, motivated by an earlier 
lawsuit the Olechs filed for flood damage caused by the village's 
negligent installation and enlargement of culverts near the Olechs' 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the lawsuit, but the 7th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals reinstated it. Its relied on a previous case in 
which it allowed a lawsuit by someone ``who can prove that action 
taken by the state, whether in the form of prosecution or 
otherwise, was a spiteful effort to `get' him for reasons wholly 
unrelated to any legitimate state objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Willowbrook vs. Olech, 98-1288.

<HEADLINE> NYC Exhibit Becomes Political Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying its ideals were ``not on the bargaining  
table,'' the Brooklyn Museum of Art denied caving in to demands 
from the mayor that it pull a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin 
Mary from an upcoming exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid conflicting assertions that a compromise had been worked  
out, Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the debate and chastised Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely opponent in the race for a U.S. Senate 
seat next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to penalize and punish an institution  
such as the Brooklyn Museum,'' Mrs. Clinton said Monday during an 
appearance at a Harlem school. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said she shares ``the feeling that I know many New  
Yorkers have that there are parts of this exhibit that would be 
deeply offensive. I would not go to see this exhibit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of cultural and political spectacle is the British  
show, ``Sensation,'' which includes ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' a 
painting by Chris Ofili depicting Mary with dark skin, African 
features and flowing robes. It has shellacked clumps of elephant 
dung and dozens of cutouts of female private parts from 
pornographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic leaders have denounced the work as blasphemous,  
and Giuliani accused the first lady of supporting the use of public 
money to attack Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor had promised to freeze $7 million in public funding to  
the museum because he considered the show -- which also features 
bisected animals and a topless woman in the place of Jesus at the 
Last Supper -- ``sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Rubin, chairman of the museum's board of directors, met  
on Monday with city officials to try to end the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A Giuliani administration source who spoke on condition of  
anonymity said Rubin offered: to remove the painting from the 
exhibition; to display six objectionable works separately from the 
rest of the exhibit; and to sacrifice one-fifth of the museum's 
city funding for as long as the show remains on display. The 
exhibit occupies one-fifth of the museum's floor space. 
</P>
<P>
	But the museum denied that any deal had been reached.  
</P>
<P>
	``A number of possible resolutions were looked at, but there was  
and is no agreement of any kind,'' the museum said in a statement. 
``The museum is planning to open `Sensation' on Saturday as 
scheduled and as planned. The BMA remains committed to resolving 
the dispute, but the ideals of the institution are not on the 
bargaining table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement would have to be approved by the museum's board of  
trustees. A message left at the museum was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	City Hall declared victory in the dispute, which infuriated many  
in the artistic community who say public officials should not have 
veto power over museum exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the artist, he said in today's New York Times that the  
elephant dung is a cultural reference to his African heritage and 
that the uproar seemed ``very distant and confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel as though I have to defend it,'' Ofili, 31, said  
of the painting. ``The people who are attacking this painting are 
attacking their own interpretation, not mine. You never know what's 
going to offend people.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 101.94; Nasdaq Off 46.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sank today as investors, increasingly  
anxious ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, were unable 
to sustain Monday's timid rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 101.94 at 10,201.56. On Monday, the Dow rose 24.06 to 
10,303.39, halting a four-day retreat as bargain-hunters entered 
the market in response to last week's plunge that sent the Dow 
falling 524.30, its biggest weekly point loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 14.10 at 1,269.21, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was off 46.10 at 2,715.65 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a research group, said today that consumer  
confidence dipped in September for a third consecutive month. The 
drop was larger than economists had expected, and may be a sign 
that consumer spending will slow. That could in turn influence the 
Fed against boosting interest rates to cool off the economy when 
its policy-setting Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer confidence report did little to move the  
markets, which remained anxious and unsettled before the Fed 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a water-torture type of correction,'' said Alfred  
Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. 
Louis, of the market's recent performance. Goldman said the Dow 
rose 46 percent from early October through last April, and has been 
in a correction ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while there is some uncertainty on Wall Street  
about interest rates, most traders expect the Federal Reserve to 
leave interest rates alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard, down 2 3/8 to 93 3/4, and General Electric, down 2 1/2  
to 117, led the Dow lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and financial services companies showed little reaction to  
the latest merger in the sector. Shares of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist were 
up 7 3/4 to 48 13/16, after Chase Manhattan said it would buy the 
brokerage operation, but Chase was off 7/8 to 73 1/4, and other bank 
stocks were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, whose recent weakness was a factor in the market's  
big decline last week, held steady against the Japanese yen today. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, off 1 7/8 to 76 5/16, and Microsoft, off 1 3/16 to 90 1/4,  
helped depress technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 366.96 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 5.30 at 416.56.

<HEADLINE> 7 Tried for Four-Year-Old's Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EPINAL, France (AP) -- Prosecutors charge that his family used  
him as a punching bag, made him sleep in a pigsty when he wet the 
bed, and wanted to kill him to stop him crying. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Johnny Grenglet, aged four at the time, and five  
other family members, went on trial in this town in eastern France 
Tuesday for torture and abuse. They face up to 30 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were alerted to Johnny in 1996 when a carpenter who had  
come for the payment of a bill saw him crouched in a corner of the 
kitchen, his face badly swollen. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found to have multiple bruises from kicks and punches,  
was undernourished, and had often been made to sleep with pigs, the 
court was told. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused, including Johnny's grandmother, aunts and uncles,  
showed little remorse and few signs of emotion Tuesday. There were 
frequent gasps from the public as details of the violence emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist told the court that the family had ``played a  
game'' of who could inflict the most violence on the child. All 
seven -- and Johnny -- lived in the same house. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie-France Coq, the child's aunt, said Tuesday she had been  
``numb when he cried ... and gradually everybody wanted to kill 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny's mother, Sandra Grenglet, said she detested the child  
because he was born during a short, previous relationship with 
another man, and not her current husband, Rene. Rene also hated the 
child for that reason, the court was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny, now seven and living with a foster family with his  
three-year-old sister, was not present in court, but could be 
summoned to testify later in the week, court officials said.

<HEADLINE> $12.6B Foreign Aid Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate negotiators have agreed to a  
compromise $12.6 billion foreign aid bill for the coming fiscal 
year, but the measure may not get President Clinton's signature 
because it falls well short of his spending demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The bargainers worked out their agreement Monday evening after  
they jettisoned language that would have forbidden aid to groups 
that promote liberalized abortion laws overseas. That represented a 
defeat for anti-abortion conservatives, and a victory for the White 
House and moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the measure still has a long way to go before it can become  
law. The House-Senate package still falls $2 billion below the 
amount Clinton wants, and White House officials threatened to veto 
initial versions of the bill with similar reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many Republicans say they would welcome a veto fight in  
which the president demands more spending for foreign aid, an 
intensely unpopular program with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law bans the use of U.S. taxpayer funds for  
organizations that perform abortions overseas. The deleted language 
would have dropped federal aid to groups that use their own money 
to lobby overseas for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar international family planning dispute is delaying  
separate legislation that would authorize about $1 billion in 
delinquent U.S. payments to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate measure provides $385 million for international  
family planning assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill completely omits the $500 million Clinton requested for  
Israel and the Palestinians to carry out the peace accord 
negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers have said they support the peace plan, a top  
administration priority, but cannot find the money because of 
spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Cuts Clinton proposals for aid to former Soviet states, global  
environmental efforts, peacekeeping operations, the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provides more than Clinton wanted for UNICEF, international  
children's health, and economic aid to Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	--Permits funds for the U.S. Army School of the Americas in Fort  
Benning, Ga., which trains foreign soldiers who have been accused 
of committing atrocities in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forbids spending for major construction projects in Kosovo, and  
requires the State Department to certify that U.S. aid to Kosovo 
will be limited to 15 percent of total international assistance to 
the Balkan nation.

<HEADLINE> Treatment OK'd for Aortic Aneurysm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of Americans with the condition that  
killed actor George C. Scott last week won an easier alternative 
Tuesday to the grueling surgery that until now was the only 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Called an abdominal aortic aneurysm, the condition is like a  
time bomb in the abdomen -- a weak spot on the body's largest blood 
vessel that, if it breaks, can cause almost instantly fatal 
internal bleeding. Such burst aneurysms kill 15,000 Americans a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	To patch these aneurysms, the entire abdomen is sliced open and  
delicate organs moved aside to reach the problem. The surgery 
itself kills up to 10 percent of patients, and even those who do 
well can require months of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved two  
patches -- Guidant Corp.'s Ancure system and Medtronic Inc.'s AneuRx 
-- that offer doctors their first alternative to such traumatic 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The patches allow aneurysm repair during minimally invasive  
surgery that, in studies sponsored by the two companies, cut 
surgical complications in half and allowed patients to go home from 
the hospital in just two or three days instead of a week. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the patches seem to offer many patients an easier  
option -- some surgeons say they will revolutionize care -- they are 
not risk-free, the FDA warned. Some people, particularly women, may 
not be good candidates, and doctors must be specially trained to 
use the complex devices, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aorta is the largest blood vessel, like a river running from  
the heart to the groin with tributaries that branch off, carrying 
blood around the body. An aneurysm is a weak bulge in the aorta's 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	If it gets big enough, the pressure of blood pounding past can  
cause it to burst. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors estimate that 1.5 million older Americans have abdominal  
aortic aneurysms, called ``AAAs.'' But because AAAs often cause no 
symptoms until they break, only about 200,000 patients are aware of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to open surgery, Tuesday's approval allows doctors  
to slice an opening into an artery in the groin, thread an aortic 
patch up that artery until it meets the aorta, and then push the 
patch to the aneurysm spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidant's Ancure has metal hooks that grab onto a healthy  
section of aorta to form sort of a sleeve, providing a new path so 
blood doesn't pound on the aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
	Medtronic's AneuRx is a stent, a metal scaffolding that opens up  
until it has expanded against the aortic walls enough to hold the 
patch in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies of over 800 patients, the patches successfully  
repaired over 90 percent of AAAs, but with fewer surgical side 
effects, less blood loss and less recuperation time in the hospital 
than patients who had standard abdominal surgery, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons involved in the studies say the devices could  
revolutionize care, particularly since they offer an alternative 
for elderly patients who could not survive regular surgery and thus 
until now have had no option. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were risks.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, even though fewer women than men get these  
aneurysms, women actually fared worse during experiments with the 
patches. The problem appeared to be size -- doctors didn't realize 
in advance which women had arteries too small to handle threading 
up a patch. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said a surgery team should always be available in case a  
patient failed the patch procedure and needed immediate 
open-abdomen surgery. Also troubling was that some patches leaked. 
It is unclear how risky that is, but the FDA urged proper follow-up 
monitoring of patients.

<HEADLINE> Philly Republican Looks to be Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Businessman Sam Katz hopes to do this  
Election Day what other white Republicans have already done in 
multi-ethnic Los Angeles and New York: snatch City Hall back from 
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	If Katz wins on Nov. 2, he will become Philadelphia's first GOP  
mayor in 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz faces John Street, a black Democrat, in a city where there  
are seven Democrats for every two Republicans and where the 
electorate tends to vote along racial lines. Street is also trying 
to make history as the second black mayor of Philadelphia, where 40 
percent of the city's 1.4 million residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a measure of how much things have changed in the city  
where Frank Rizzo, the white police commissioner-turned-mayor, was 
a polarizing force in the 1970s and '80s, race has not emerged as 
an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a black politician who finished third in the Democratic  
primary crossed party lines this month to endorse Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race in Philadelphia historically has played a significant  
role in the outcome of elections. But race relations have improved 
markedly here,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a professor of political 
science at Millersville University. ``This campaign has been 
remarkably free of race-baiting and racial overtones. Any of that 
would be counterproductive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No independent polls have been conducted, but political analysts  
say Katz has a decent shot even though Street, a former City 
Council president, is endorsed by the popular lame-duck mayor, 
Edward Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who is credited with bringing the nation's  
fifth-largest city back from the brink of bankruptcy, is barred 
from seeking a third consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell succeeded the city's first black mayor, W. Wilson Goode,  
who held office from 1984 to 1992, during which he bombed a 
neighborhood in a confrontation with the radical group MOVE and 
presided as city finances neared financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	While race hasn't galvanized the campaign, neither has much  
else. Newspapers call both Katz and Street policy wonks who are 
dull compared with the gregarious, photogenic Rendell. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, 49, is a former Democrat who made a fortune as a financial  
adviser to cities around the nation. He helped draft the recovery 
plan Rendell employed in Philadelphia and is an expert on stadium 
financing. Katz made failed primary runs for mayor in 1991 and 
governor of Pennsylvania in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, 55, is a former activist who traded in his fiery,  
quick-with-his-fists style of the 1980s for a buttoned-down 
approach in the '90s, honed during his tenure as City Council 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have few differences on issues, with school vouchers  
being the major exception -- Katz supports them, Street does not. 
And that issue will probably be decided at the state Capitol rather 
than in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Their similar ideologies, along with a lack of negative  
campaigning, are why Katz has a shot at defeating the favored 
Street, political analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's campaign got a boost last week when black Democrat John  
White Jr. endorsed him. White, who got 21 percent of the vote in 
the Democratic primary, said he had simply decided the Republican 
Katz would be better for the city than Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Street shrugged it off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to stand with the thousands of voters who voted for  
John White Jr. in the Democratic primary, because I think they will 
respond to the issues that caused them to come and vote 
Democratic,'' Street said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz can put a GOP face on his heavily Democratic city the way  
Richard Riordan has done in Los Angeles and Rudolph Giuliani has 
done in New York. It would be a big victory for Republicans, who 
also are holding their national convention in Philadelphia next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz said the convention and his party's historical weakness in  
Philly are not important. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something I think about very much and it's not  
something that comes up in my meetings with voters,'' he said. 
``People want to know how you are going to make their neighborhoods 
better -- party is irrelevant to them.''

<HEADLINE> Billy Crystal Buys Mantle's Glove </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Billy Crystal once wanted to be Mickey Mantle.  
Now, at least, he's got the glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal bought one of Mantle's old gloves at a Sotheby's auction  
of baseball memorabilia Monday for $239,000, far exceeding its 
pre-sale estimate of $10,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees legend wore the glove around 1960.  
</P>

1996, Crystal recalled how as a 9-year-old boy in 1956 he watched 
in awe as Mantle blasted a home run off the right-field facade at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That day,'' Crystal said, ``I knew I wanted to play baseball.  
I wanted to be Mickey Mantle.''

<HEADLINE> KLM, Northwest Cut Dec. 31 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and its  
U.S. partner, Northwest Airlines, plan to reduce the number of 
international flights scheduled for New Year's Eve this year 
because of lukewarm demand. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM said today it now had only five intercontinental flights  
scheduled as the millennium changes, compared with 35 at the end of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest said it would cancel five flights on Dec. 31, four  
from the United States to Amsterdam and one between Amsterdam and 
Delhi, India. The return legs of those flights scheduled for Jan. 1 
also will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Northwest will operate its scheduled round-trip flights  
to Amsterdam from Detroit, Boston and Minneapolis, as well as its 
service to London, Paris and Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Both airlines, which are notifying passengers affected by the  
schedule changes, noted that travel during the holiday season as a 
whole was up from 1998 levels, with demand shifting to periods 
before Dec. 31 and after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said that although airlines always  
see a drop-off in demand for seats on New Year's Eve, this year's 
decline was particularly steep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's explainable if you look at the destinations,''  
Wellhuner said. ``Demand is strongest for places like the United 
States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. These are countries where 
Dutch people have strong connections. People prefer to visit with 
their families and close friends for an event like the year 2000.''

<HEADLINE> Book Upsets Reagan Daughter, Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's elder daughter says she won't  
be reading his authorized biography because the writer appears to 
have ``wasted an incredible and irreplaceable opportunity'' to 
explain him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have decided that I have read all the fiction about Ronald  
Reagan I intend to read -- so I think I will pass on this book,'' 
Maureen Reagan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Bush pitched in Tuesday with criticisms of his  
own, denying biographer Edmund Morris' claim in ``Dutch: A Memoir 
of Ronald Reagan'' that Bush and his wife felt unwelcome 
``upstairs'' in the Reagan White House when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous,'' he told NBC's ``Today.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Upstairs? I mean that's kind of an English ...  
upstairs-and-downstairs approach to life. I don't even use the 
terminology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he was ``very close to President Reagan, so I don't  
know where Mr. Morris gets that. I mean, I haven't read his book 
yet. Might not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes of a Christmas Eve 1988 conversation he said he  
had with George and Barbara Bush a month before Bush became 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love that guy, he's such a terrific fellow,'' Bush is  
quoted as saying. Morris then quotes Bush as commenting about 
Reagan and his wife, Nancy: ``I kinda wished they'd shown -- y'know, 
a little appreciation. Didn't seem to want us upstairs in the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told ``Today'' he and his wife were not the Reagans'  
closest friends, but ``we never felt that we were unwelcome 
someplace.'' Bush was not asked whether he denied the conversation 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Morris' characterization of Reagan as an ``apparent  
airhead,'' Bush said: ``That is brutal and grossly unfair and 
untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Reagan is described in passages of ``Dutch'' excerpted  
by Newsweek as ``the eldest and largest of the president's 
children, her brilliant smile and button nose reminding the world 
that there once was another Mrs. Reagan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She ``sings and acts well, memorizes like a VCR and luxuriates  
in the spotlight,'' Morris wrote, saying she could have made a 
career in show business if she only had the figure of Jane Wyman, 
her mother and Reagan's first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was granted close access to Reagan during his second  
term. Although the book is not being released until Thursday, it 
has already created a stir with historians and former Reagan aides, 
in part because Morris inserts himself as a semi-fictional 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect when all is said and done, given the unprecedented  
access graciously provided the author, the American people will 
conclude that the author wasted an incredible and irreplaceable 
opportunity,'' Maureen Reagan said.

	Morris told CBS' ``60 Minutes'' he expects Nancy Reagan to be  
disturbed by the book because, despite his admiration for the 
ex-president, ``I do not hide the fact that Reagan was frequently 
an old, spaced-out man, inattentive to details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,  
devotes about 250 pages of text to the Reagan presidency in its 874 
pages of text and notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan biographer Lou Cannon told CBS that Morris' contribution  
could have been ``to tell us what went on during the presidency 
and, with very few exceptions, he doesn't.''

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Bids for NHL, NBA Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't look for the sports books in Las Vegas to  
be taking action any time soon on the city's chances for an NBA or 
NHL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an out bet, a long shot at best and maybe no shot at all.  
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Oscar Goodman led a contingent of city officials on a tour  
of the two leagues Tuesday, meeting with commissioners David Stern 
of the NBA and Gary Bettman of the NHL. He was greeted cordially, 
but received the same news on both fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither league has any plans to expand, and neither league has  
any team seeking a new home. That would seem to be a major obstacle 
for Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Further complicating the matter is the gambling industry that  
flourishes in Las Vegas. Basketball betting accounts for 23 percent 
of the total sports handle there, according to Vegas Sports 
Consultants, which helps set betting lines for sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trip was 100 percent successful,'' the mayor said. ``I  
wish we had the go-ahead. We don't. We took a giant step today. 
We're alive and kicking. I'm happy we took the trip. Our mission 
was to find out information and the attitude of the leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Goodman accomplished was getting Stern to agree to bring up  
Las Vegas and the issue of sports gambling at the next owners 
meeting on Oct. 28. The commissioner, however, was not exactly 
encouraging on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our historic position is documented for all to see,'' Stern  
said. ``We couldn't grant two expansion franchises until they 
eliminated NBA games from their sports lotteries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto and Vancouver franchises were in danger until  
Ontario and British Colombia agreed to remove NBA games from their 
provincial lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said there is no reason to believe that the owners have  
changed their minds, although they hadn't been asked about it for 
five years. ``My guess is it might not have changed,'' the 
commissioner said. ``I am comfortable with the NBA's historic 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So where does that leave Las Vegas?  
</P>
<P>
	``We have our work cut out for us,'' Goodman said. ``We have to  
see if the casinos are interested in changing present procedures. 
If not, it's up to the owners to accept us the way we are. It means 
a major change in the way we do business or changing the way the 
NBA does business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in the driver's seat. We're not.''  
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the only pro team in the city are the Las Vegas Stars  
of the PCL, an affiliate of the San Diego Padres. John Moores, 
owner of the Padres, is the proposed owner of any NBA or NHL 
franchise in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas Thunder played in the International Hockey League  
for six years but lost its lease at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center and 
has been unable to find an alternate site. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman started his tour with Bettman, where the NHL  
commissioner supplied the mayor with some basic information. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are three criteria to be satisfied for a hockey team --  
ownership, arena and market,'' Goodman said. ``Our fear was how 
gambling would be looked upon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was Vegas' gambling industry a problem for the NHL?  
</P>
<P>
	``To characterize anything as an issue would be premature,''  
Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Stern later, Bettman was cordial if not encouraging.  
Reminded that he had not said no to Las Vegas, the commissioner 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't say yes, either,'' he said. ``The process is not a  
simple yes or no. We had a good dialogue.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Said To Sign Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets have reached a verbal  
agreement to sign free agent guard Shandon Anderson to a two-year 
contract, according to a broadcast report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets declined comment on Tuesday's report by KRIV-TV in  
Houston that Anderson will take the deal, valued at $6.6 million 
including an option for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Anderson has played his entire three-year career  
with the Utah Jazz, averaging 7.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Jazz owner Larry Miller said the team was not  
re-signing Anderson. The Jazz reportedly offered Anderson as much 
as $3 million.

<HEADLINE> More Rain Hits Floyd-Ravaged N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Six inches of rain fell Tuesday across  
eastern North Carolina, flooding roads and threatening homes in an 
area scarcely beginning its recovery from the misery brought by 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Swirling brown water again closed streets and highways, and  
rivers inched higher and threatened two dams. Authorities went 
door-to-door advising residents they should prepare for possible 
evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost back to ground zero,'' National Guard Maj. Dave  
Culbreth said glumly in Goldsboro, where downtown streets were 
under water for the second time this month. ``We were ready to pull 
out and then this came along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two weeks ago, Hurricane Floyd dropped 20 inches of rain,  
turning large areas of eastern North Carolina into a soggy mess and 
killing at least 47 people. About 2,100 people remained in 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	As water roared over a dam near his neighborhood in Goldsboro,  
Dave Colburn proudly recounted how he and his neighbors survived 
Floyd's floodwaters by helping one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now, everyone's asking themselves, `How much can we  
take?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 6 inches of rain had fallen by mid-afternoon in  
Goldsboro, and the National Weather Service forecast 5 more inches 
in the region through Tuesday night. The deluge was blamed on a 
tropical air mass in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the Tar and Neuse Rivers, still several feet  
above flood stage in many cities, will rise another 2 feet or more 
as a result of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, relief supplies were running low. Rob Vincent of  
the Salvation Army said a command center in Wilmington had just 
3,000 pounds of canned food left in its warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting into a very dire situation,'' Vincent said. ``So  
many of the trucks that are arriving are loaded with clothing. We 
need food, not clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a task force of funeral directors and experts in  
remains identification reported the recovery of 87 caskets that 
floated away from Edgecombe County cemeteries. A center was to open 
in Tarboro on Wednesday where families can provide information that 
will aid in identification. An estimated 50 to 75 caskets have yet 
to be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	In Goldsboro, about 45 miles southeast of Raleigh, Anne Horne  
said she was flooded by Floyd on Sept. 16 and again Monday night. 
Floodwaters claimed her 1994 Mustang and furniture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh instead of cry,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cora Sedlacek and Edie Brisson said it was their second flood,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``My yard is flooded and they kept saying this won't happen  
again in my lifetime,'' Ms. Brisson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ms. Sedlacek: ``If this is a 500-year flood, then we're  
aging very quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner May Lose Parole Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it will consider  
killing a Georgia prison inmate's challenge to the way the state 
handles parole requests from convicted criminals serving life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will review a federal appeals court  
ruling that reinstated convicted murderer Robert Jones' contention 
that his rights were violated when the state decided to reconsider 
denied parole requests once every eight years. The earlier limit 
was once every three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was sentenced to life in prison in 1982, when state  
regulations required that he first be considered for parole after 
serving seven years. If parole were not granted, the regulations 
provided for reconsideration hearings every three years thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones was imprisoned, but before his 1989 parole hearing,  
the state Board of Pardons and Paroles amended its rules to require 
parole reconsideration hearings once every eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones was denied parole in 1989, the board scheduled him  
for a reconsideration hearing in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1991 the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled that such changes in parole policies unfairly imposed 
after-the-fact punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Jones was reconsidered for parole at three-year  
intervals, being turned down in 1992 and again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court in 1995 ruled in a California case  
that states can increase the time between parole hearings for 
prison inmates who committed their crimes when parole hearings were 
more frequent. In California, hearings that had been conducted 
every year were changed to every three years. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision in the California case was announced, Georgia  
authorities scheduled Jones' next parole hearing for 2003 rather 
than 1998. They did so after concluding that the 1995 Supreme Court 
ruling had overturned the appeals court's 1991 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones sued, but a federal trial judge threw out his case. The  
11th Circuit court, however, revived his lawsuit last January. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, citing numerous differences between the  
California and Georgia regulations, said the reasoning of the 1995 
Supreme Court decision ``reaffirms the correctness of our holding'' 
in the 1991 case. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Garner vs. Jones, 99-137.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Mystery, Alaska' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The fanatical hockey players of Mystery, Alaska, a mythical  
Mudville where the path of glory is paved with ice, are watching a 
videotape of their next unlikely opponent, the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a brawl among the NHL stars drags on, one of the Mystery  
players offers a suggestion to help prepare for the game: ``Maybe 
we should fast-forward to the hockey part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only the makers of ``Mystery, Alaska'' had followed that cue.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery'' enters sudden death from the outset. The first  
two-thirds of this Cinderella-on-ice story drags its tail like a 
defenseman who's been on the rink for a full period without a 
breather. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of tedious melodrama, the movie comes alive only  
when the Rangers arrive for a bizarre open-air game against the 
home team. 
</P>
<P>
	How strange that the movie lumbers along so woodenly before  
then, considering it's the latest big-screen entry from 
small-screen scribe and producer David E. Kelley, this year's 
double Emmy winner for ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley co-wrote and co-produced the character-driven  
``Mystery,'' but there's little evidence of the sharp dialogue from 
his character-driven TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a fine ensemble cast featuring Russell Crowe, Hank  
Azaria, Lolita Davidovich, Mary McCormack, Colm Meaney and Burt 
Reynolds as the patriarchal town judge and hockey coach. But 
there's just not much for them to sink their skates into. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was a sound one for the sort of eccentric  
characterizations Kelley excels at. Mystery, Alaska, a town of 633 
somewhere in the wastelands north of Fairbanks, lives for its 
Saturday hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
	The players enter their pond rink along a snaking ice trail to  
the reverential cheers of the fans. The town fathers painstakingly 
assess each player's performance. Schoolchildren gossip over who 
might get dumped from the team and what fresh young skater might be 
``going up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town catches the NHL's eye when an expatriate Mystery native  
(Azaria) lands an article in Sports Illustrated, hyperbolically 
stating that Mystery's players can skate with the best of the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	The league decides to dispatch the Rangers to Mystery for an  
exhibition game, bringing dreams of glory and terror of failure to 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if we lose this game 25-zip?'' Crowe, the town sheriff,  
asks Azaria. ``You brought back the one thing that could tear the 
heart out of this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the tumult of the Rangers' visit comes a spate of  
small-town problems. The mayor's wife is cheating on him with one 
of the hockey players. Crowe grapples with age as he's cut from the 
team in favor of a younger skater. A grocery clerk, one of the 
team's key players, is put on trial for shooting a corporate spy 
from retail behemoth Price World in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this is terribly interesting, though. The situations are  
milked excessively for what is little more than piffling drama, 
choking off the few humorous forays in the first part of the film, 
such as the team's method of punishment: Forcing a player to slide 
feet first into a snow bank wearing only a jockstrap. 
</P>
<P>
	The grocery shooting amounts to nothing more than a cheap device  
to show how far the town will go to rally 'round its team. Once the 
trial is over, the Price World scenario, which at first seemed 
integral to the small-town-vs.-outside-world plot, disappears 
through the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Roach, who directed the ``Austin Powers'' movies, seems lost  
in weak material early on with ``Mystery.'' He finally gets some 
action going about the time Crowe pulls Azaria over for driving a 
Zamboni under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a witty scene, Mystery's mayor conspires with Little Richard  
to sing an interminable version of the national anthem to keep the 
Rangers, unused to arctic weather, immobile. Little Richard then 
launches into ``O Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers'' star Mike Myers makes a funny appearance as a  
hockey commentator spouting such colorful sports babble as, ``If 
you don't play this game with a big heart and big bag of knuckles 
in front of the net, you don't got dinky-doo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, though, the movie is down 12-0 without much chance of  
catching up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery, Alaska,'' needed a heavier dose of the wit and oddity  
that characterized the small-screen ``Northern Exposure,'' set in 
fictional Cicely, Alaska, or Kelley's own ``Picket Fences.'' It's a 
mystery why a talent like Kelley couldn't deliver a big-league 
script. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mystery, Alaska,'' distributed by Buena Vista Pictures, is  
rated R.

<HEADLINE>  Raptors Sign 7-foot-3 Radojevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Alek Radojevic, the 12th pick in the NBA draft,  
signed a three-year deal with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone through a lot, so this is one of the happiest days  
of my life,'' Radojevic said after a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Radojevic fled war-torn Yugoslavia for the  
United States two years ago. After playing at Barton County 
Community College in Kansas, where he averaged 13 points and 7.6 
rebounds, the 7-foot-3 Radojevic signed a letter of intent to play 
for Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because he played a total of 19 minutes for a  
professional basketball team in Yugoslavia, the NCAA ruled he was 
ineligible to play. He then entered the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I would be drafted, or who would draft me,  
and then the club in Yugoslavia didn't want to release me,'' 
Radojevic said in describing his uncertain offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month an arbitrator ruled he was free to join the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	But the dispute slowed his progress. The raw center wasn't able  
to work out for the Raptors, or play for their summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real mystery,'' Toronto general manager Glen Grunwald  
said. ``He has a lot of talent, but he hasn't played against 
top-notch competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic, whose deal averages out to about $1 million a season,  
knows the transition to the NBA is going to be tough, but he said 
he's in the best shape of his life. He's been working with a 
personal trainer for the last two months and has added 15 pounds, 
up to 260.

<HEADLINE>  Honduras Flood Death Toll at 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The death toll from 17 days of  
torrential rain in Honduras has risen to 13 and the storms show no 
sign of ending, the government said Tuesday. Flooding also hit 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic damage has been devastating for Honduras, which is  
still struggling to rebuild after last year's Hurricane Mitch, 
which caused billions of dollars in damage and killed more than 
5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 12,350 acres of banana, coffee, sugar cane, cocoa and  
basic grains are under water, 12 highways are intransitable and 727 
houses and 16 bridges have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage has occurred throughout Honduras. Ten thousand  
Hondurans have been cut off by the storm and 7,000 have been 
evacuated, said Arturo Corrales, an official with the federal 
government's emergency commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evacuations will continue,'' he said. ``The situation is  
serious -- the critical stage of the (rainy season) is barely 
beginning...so the state of emergency will be extended until 
November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding problems worsened Friday when the country's main  
hydroelectric dam, El Cajon, reached its capacity, forcing 
officials to increase the water flow, which caused flooding on 
several rovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding problems have also affected neighboring El Salvador,  
where five days of heavy rain have forced the evacuation of 3,000 
people and killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvadoran officials ordered the evacuation of hundreds more  
people Tuesday and declared a flood emergency for towns along the 
Lempa River as well as for poor neighborhoods in San Salvador, the 
nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to a shelter, because we're afraid it could become  
another Mitch,'' said Juan Perez, a 56-year resident of this town 
on the banks of the Lempa, 60 miles southeast of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Further to the south, in Costa Rica, that government's National  
Emergency Commission reported that more than 1,300 people had taken 
refuge in 24 shelters in the northern province of Guanacaste 
following flooding caused by intense rain Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding cut roads in Nicaragua and cut off some communities  
along the country's border with Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reports from all over the country of damage due to the  
rains,'' said Maj. Mayor Rogelio Flores Ortiz, head of operations 
for Nicaragua's Civil defense agency.

<HEADLINE> SEC Fines 68 People, Cos. for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators announced enforcement  
actions Tuesday against 68 people and companies, including Hall of 
Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton, for alleged accounting fraud, 
including creating phony invoices and inflating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkenton, the former head of a computer software company,  
agreed to settle by paying a $100,000 fine without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC called the series of civil fraud actions its first  
``coordinated assault on financial reporting misdeeds.'' Arthur 
Levitt, chairman of the market watchdog agency, has been pushing 
publicly traded companies to improve their financial reporting and 
avoid manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The new enforcement actions include a total of $630,000 in fines  
which defendants have agreed to pay in settlements with the SEC. 
The agency also is seeking a total of some $9 million in 
restitution and wants to bar 10 of the individuals involved from 
serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the cases involved a ``cookbook of recipes'' for  
fraudulent accounting, including reporting income from shipments 
that never were made, shipping products without customers wanting 
them, creating phony invoices and inflating the value of 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarkenton's case, he and 10 other former executives of his  
computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were 
accused by the SEC of fraudulently inflating by millions of dollars 
the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 
30, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $100,000 fine, the former Minnesota Vikings  
quarterback also agreed in his settlement to pay $54,187 in 
restitution. The money will go to a federal court, and shareholders 
of the company might make claims to it. 
</P>

	Downpours Cause New Carolina Flooding  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six inches of rain kicked off new flooding  
today in an area already saturated by Hurricane Floyd, washing out 
roads and a spillway. People were urged to evacuate two residential 
areas. The pouring rain that fell during the night cut through 
roads and made bridges in Wayne County and other areas impassable 
this morning southeast of Raleigh. In Goldsboro, 80 percent of the 
downtown streets were flooded this morning by Stony Creek, which 
flows through the middle of town, the National Guard said.

	Bradley Offers Health Care Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley took a bold stand on insuring the  
health of Americans today, proposing a $65 billion plan that would 
require coverage for all children, with subsidies for families that 
cannot afford it. Individuals of all ages and incomes also would be 
able to exclude from their taxable income whatever they pay for 
health premiums. ``When it comes to America's health, this is not 
the time to be timid,'' said the Democratic presidential candidate, 
adding that health insurance should be a basic birthright.

	Visitation Rights To Be Decided  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether grandparents are entitled to visitation rights to their 
grandchildren when the children's parents object. The justices said 
they will use a case from Washington state to make their first 
venture into the area of ``grandparents' rights.'' All 50 states 
have some type of law allowing court-ordered visitation for 
grandparents. Washington's highest court struck down its state law, 
ruling that only parents are entitled to court-enforced visitation 
rights.

	Study Checks Students' Writing

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About three-fourths of the nation's school  
children demonstrated only partial mastery of the knowledge and 
skills needed to write proficiently for their grade level, the 
Education Department reported today. Testers asked 60,000 
fourth-graders, eighth-graders and 12th-graders to write stories, 
personal essays, reports about events or experiences and persuasive 
pieces. The tests and score levels were determined by the National 
Assessment Governing Board, a body created by Congress to act as an 
independent judge of education standards.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A package of tax cuts aimed at improving  
access to health insurance was offered today by House Republican 
leaders hoping to blend the measure with bills giving people rights 
to sue managed care health plans. Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
said each of the bills giving patients a host of new legal rights 
is missing two key pieces: improving health care access and 
affordability for an estimated 44 million uninsured Americans.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge rejected a $100 million  
settlement a company proposed to pay injury claims by hundreds of 
users of the once popular diet drug Redux. A U.S. district judge 
said he was uncertain a ``limited fund'' that Interneuron 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Lexington, Mass., proposed to set up to 
settle the lawsuits would be fair to all who might have claims. The 
judge also cited ``constitutional concerns'' because the deal would 
not allow claimants to opt out and seek separate trials if they 
wish.

	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young  
suffered his fourth concussion since 1995 last night, but he 
insisted this one was nothing close to as serious as his most 
recent one two years ago against Tampa Bay. Young, 37, was injured 
late in the second quarter of a 24-10 victory over the Arizona 
Cardinals. The team is scheduled to announce Young's status for 
this week's game against Tennessee this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Generous Millionaire Ends Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Percy Ross, who for 17 years used a  
syndicated column called ``Thanks a Million'' to share his fortune 
with people who wrote in with good sob stories, says the money has 
run out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross published his final column last week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've achieved my goal. I've given it all away,'' Ross, 83,  
told readers in his farewell column. ``You've given me so much over 
the years. In many respects, I'm far richer today than when I 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross' columns featured letters from readers -- he would get  
10,000 a week -- seeking help, offering suggestions or simply saying 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	His editor, Nancy Webber, said Ross gave out between $20 million  
and $30 million over the years, helping pay for everything from 
recreation centers to organ transplants. He also was fond of giving 
children silver dollars along with his homespun wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks a Million'' ran in about 800 newspapers, from major  
dailies like the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to weeklies like the Swift 
County Monitor in western Minnesota. The column was distributed to 
about 150 of those papers through Creators Syndicate. The other 
newspapers ran Ross' column as advertisements sponsored by local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In one recent letter, a 26-year-old woman whose teeth were gray  
because of her bulimia asked Ross for $1,400 for dental work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're willing to make changes because your past lifestyle  
wasn't healthy. And, you're willing to meet me halfway,'' he 
responded. ``Why on God's green earth wouldn't I be willing to help 
you? 
</P>
<P>
	He sent the woman a check for $700.  
</P>
<P>
	But he had no qualms about rejecting other requests, even with a  
tone of disdain. One woman in prison asked Ross for money so she 
could buy her son a computer. Ross said no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to believe that there are white people who care,'' she  
wrote back, ``only to find the truth staring me in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about being disappointed!'' Ross shot back. ``Anyone who  
can promise a child you'll get him a new computer through this 
rich, white, old guy you can write to while you sit in prison is 
deluded beyond compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of poor immigrants from Latvia and Russia, Ross grew up  
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He moved to Duluth, Minn., in 1936 
to work in the metal and fur industries, and by 1944 had made a 
small fortune in fur. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost that, but in 1969 he sold a company that made plastic  
film and trash bags for $8 million. Later investments helped his 
fortune grow. 
</P>
<P>
	One night in the late 1970s he gave away more than 1,000  
bicycles at a holiday party for children at the Minneapolis 
Convention Center. He liked it so much that he came up with the 
column idea, encouraged by such influential friends as Sen. Hubert 
Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the few occasions when we didn't run his column, we heard  
about it,'' said Mary Panzer, advertising manager for The Brainerd 
Daily Dispatch in central Minnesota. ``People just found it 
interesting that this man would give his money away and draw 
attention to the problems we all face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina, once pledged  
$50,000 to help 50 Vietnam refugees come to the United States. In 
1980, he offered $50 million to Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini in 
exchange for the U.S. hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	That offer was refused.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, Ross is on a cruise in the Mediterranean, compliments  
of a son and daughter-in-law, Ms. Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 17 years, he and his wife never had a proper vacation,''  
she said. ``He thought there would be a lot of kids around, so he 
brought his silver dollars.''

<HEADLINE> Beaver Fight Intensifies / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Armed with explosives, guns and cages, a  
mini-army of experts wages a day-in, day-out battle in Mississippi 
with an unlikely enemy -- a brown furry creature. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone beavers caused nearly $3 million in damages to  
timber, roads, bridges and crops in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippians complain about armadillos, bats, fish-eating  
birds, deer, geese, snakes and skunks, but the beaver is by far the 
most troublesome, said Kevin Sullivan of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers were asked last week to put nearly $1 million  
into a beaver control program in which animal specialists respond 
to complaints from land owners and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're usually at their wit's end when they get ahold of  
us,'' Sullivan said of Mississippians with beaver problems. 
``They've tried all the old-fashioned home remedies, all the tales 
they've heard about like using human hair, ground-up soap, broken 
glass -- you name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal and state governments share the costs of the  
program. Counties put up $2,000 a year to be members, and there is 
a waiting list of counties wanting to join. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of counties has doubled in the past seven years, and  
an additional four counties are being added this year, to bring 
participation up to 64 of the 82 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, county leaders say the aggressive beaver battle is  
paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very pesky critters,'' said Rhea Fuller, Warren County  
road manager for the past decade. ``Before this program was started 
there was no question the beavers were winning. The war is not won 
by any stretch of the imagination, but a lot of improvement has 
taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forrest County Supervisor Lynn Cartlidge said for years his  
county paid trappers per animal they killed but had little success 
stopping the dam problems. He said in the past five years the 
program is working and the destructive beavers are being 
outsmarted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23 beaver experts work out of their homes and in USDA-marked  
pickup trucks. When they get a complaint, the specialists go out to 
inspect damage from the animal's burrowing or dam-building. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a number of methods at their disposal, according to  
Sullivan, the district manager for the USDA's Wildlife Services 
office in Starkville. 
</P>
<P>
	They can rake out a beaver dam then try to capture the  
responsible beavers. They can use dynamite to eradicate a beaver's 
work. Also, they may construct a device to keep beavers out of an 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also a variety of trapping techniques. The rodents  
that are caught are killed. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA figures show that last year in Mississippi, beavers caused  
$1.2 million damage to timber, $1.2 million to roads and bridges, 
$283,000 to ditches and more than $100,000 to crops and other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said troubled farmers have been known to resort to  
desperate measures to battle wily beavers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard of all kinds of things, farmers staying up all  
night. They get a six-pack of beer and shotgun and camp out,'' said 
Johnson, a farmer who has not had beaver problems on his land. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, whose expertise is with beaver damage along roadways,  
also can attest to their persistence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their ingenuity is pretty good. They can plug a draining pipe  
in a heartbeat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Big Trucks Facing Tougher Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is coming  
out with new rules for tougher emission standards and cleaner 
burning diesel fuel to reduce pollution from heavy-duty trucks, 
according to interest groups briefed on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA plans to announce some interim steps within a few weeks  
and follow up by proposing regulations early next year that would 
dramatically reduce the amount of smog-causing chemicals and soot 
coming from truck tailpipes, according to these sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the EPA is preparing regulations that would cut  
sulfur in diesel fuel perhaps by as much as 90 percent, said the 
sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to give details beyond saying that some  
new proposals on truck pollution will be announced within a few 
weeks and that EPA Administrator Carol Browner is intent on 
reducing air emissions from heavy-duty trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the EPA announced it would complete regulations by the  
end of the year to sharply reduce smog-causing chemicals from 
automobiles, including popular sport utility vehicles and pickup 
trucks. And it proposed requiring low-sulfur gasoline to be sold 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar approach that would require cleaner vehicles as well  
as cleaner fuel is being developed as part of the agency's efforts 
to curtail pollution from large tractor-trailer rigs, dump trucks 
and other heavy-duty trucks, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tougher emissions and fuel standards for large trucks would  
begin to be phased in by 2007, according to sources familiar with 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	While the more than 5 million large trucks and buses account for  
only 2.5 percent of all vehicles on the road, they produce 26 
percent of the smog-causing nitrogen oxide from vehicles and more 
than half of the soot in urban air, according to the Clean Air 
Trust, an environmental advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> NY Officials Approve Boxing Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York boxing officials have unanimously  
approved new rules and regulations they hope will help clean up the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State Athletic Commission has approved a reform  
package aimed at increasing confidence in championship bouts again, 
Gov. George Pataki announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These reforms will help restore integrity to the sport of  
boxing and protect the public's confidence in judges' decisions,'' 
said Pataki, who came up with the changes along with Attorney 
General Eliot Spitzer back in May. 
</P>
<P>
	That was after the controversial draw between Lennox Lewis and  
Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight title March 13 at 
Madison Square Garden. Most observers felt Lewis won the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the regulations go into effect, judges must be sanctioned  
by the state, and judges who reside, or are licensed, in other 
jurisdictions must submit a sworn application for a license and 
make certain disclosures. They include a credit check, revealing 
pending litigation such as bankruptcy or criminal proceedings and 
any financial ties with either boxer, promoter, the venue or 
television company. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to be implemented immediately by the New York Commission  
are the way championship fight judges are selected, and tougher 
standards for becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Each sanctioning body with an interest in a title fight must  
submit a list of three candidates for judge, instead of one, and 
the commission will select one from each set of candidates. It can 
reject the nominations and select a judge without further 
nomination. If only two sanctioning bodies are involved, the 
commission will select at least one independent judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges will need to pass written and oral examinations and  
attend a mandatory annual seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms now go before Pataki's Office of Regulatory Reform  
for review. Upon approval, a 45-day public comment period begins, 
culminating in formal implementation and publication in the state 
Register.

<HEADLINE> Swank Hotel Sues CBS Over Show Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A posh Fifth Avenue hotel has gone to court in a  
bid to stop CBS from using a plaza in front of the General Motors 
Building to stage its upcoming ``Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sherry-Netherland Hotel, across the street from General  
Motors Building, cited potential annoyances and asked the court to 
void the zoning approval the network received for the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Early Show,'' starring Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson, is  
to debut Nov. 1 at 7 a.m. in one of the city's busiest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS plans to use the plaza in front of the building in addition  
to its ground-floor television studio ``as a `tourist destination' 
where crowds (will be) able to gawk through glass at the goings 
on,'' the hotel said in papers filed Friday in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the area, ``people will be waving and shouting and creating  
that fake Beatlemania-like sensation'' and ``CBS will be able to 
stage everything from concerts to cooking demonstrations,'' the 
hotel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel said the zoning approval for CBS violates the law  
because the zoning hearing did not properly consider the impact the 
crowds and show events would have on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said Tuesday that the network had  
no comment except that ``we intend to be good neighbors.''

<HEADLINE> White House Acknowledges Riady Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House acknowledged Tuesday that  
President Clinton had a very brief encounter in New Zealand with 
James Riady, the Indonesian businessman who has been sought for 
questioning since 1997 about campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, wrote the White House about a Wall Street Journal report 
Friday that Riady used the economic summit meeting in New Zealand 
this month to chat with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal quoted unidentified Indonesians as saying Riady  
didn't discuss anything ``sensitive'' with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of corporate executive officers with 350 people in  
the room, Clinton and Riady encountered one another ``very briefly 
along a rope line,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton ``spent more time typing the letter than this brief  
rope-line encounter took,'' Kennedy added. ``For Representative 
Burton to spend any time inquiring into this ... is a tremendous 
waste of taxpayer dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the White House ``will respond in some appropriate  
fashion to the chairman's letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton wrote White House counsel Beth Nolan that ``I cannot  
understand what purpose would be served by the president meeting 
with Mr. Riady except to urge him to cooperate with federal 
investigators. ... It is my sincere hope that ... the president 
used the prestige of his office and his long-term friendship with 
Mr. Riady to convince Mr. Riady to return to the United States and 
answer all of the questions posed by Congress and the Justice 
Department so the American public can finally learn the entire 
truth about Mr. Riady's role in tampering with our presidential 
elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to the office of Riady's Washington lawyer, Earl Silbert,  
was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton provided the White House a lengthy list of questions and  
in a postscript, the congressman scrawled, ``If a subpoena is 
required -- please let me know as soon as possible!!!'' Burton asked 
for the identity of any White House officials who expressed concern 
over Clinton meeting with Riady. 
</P>
<P>
	Riady's family -- which has supported Clinton's campaigns dating  
to his years as Arkansas governor -- runs the global conglomerate 
Lippo Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riadys paid longtime Clinton friend Webster Hubbell $100,000  
at a time when Hubbell was under criminal investigation by 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Neither Hubbell nor the Riadys have 
explained why they paid Hubbell the money. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Riady family business executives in the United States,  
John Huang, began cooperating this year with the Justice 
Department's investigation of campaign fund-raising abuses in the 
1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang went to work raising money for the Democratic National  
Committee in 1996 after a White House meeting with the president 
and James Riady. 
</P>
<P>
	``To date, 122 witnesses, including James Riady, have either  
fled the country or pled the 5th Amendment to avoid testifying in 
the committee's continuing investigation'' of campaign fund 
raising, Burton said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats returned $1.6 million raised by Huang amid questions  
about the money's origin.

<HEADLINE> Internet Management Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cash-strapped group assuming management of  
much of the Internet agreed Tuesday to allow a Virginia company to 
continue for at least four years as keeper of the master list of 
World Wide Web addresses in exchange for a $1.25 million payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Praised by participants as a landmark in the 30-year history of  
the Internet, the complex settlement aims to resolve the most 
contentious arguments surrounding transition of control over the 
Web from the federal government to the California-based Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the impact on typical Internet consumers was negligible  
in that the agreement involved largely the behind-the-scenes 
management of technical issues and standards. Organizers said there 
would have been serious problems had the talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's clear there would have been significant risk of  
disruption to electronic commerce, to the growth of the Internet 
... if there was instability and controversy,'' said Andrew Pincus, 
general counsel for the Commerce Department, which helped 
coordinate the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Network Solutions Inc., the world's largest seller  
of Internet addresses, promised they will recognize the California 
group's authority over the Web, a festering issue during 
negotiations that started last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were confident the deal also held a promise of  
financial security for shareholders in their company, whose stock 
climbed from $65.38 last week to $85.50 at close of trading 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a system we need to ensure is stable and something we  
can build the new economy on,'' said Mike Daniels, the company's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said he was pleased that ICANN  
and Network Solutions ``worked this out at the negotiating table 
and not at tables in a courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, Network Solutions has coordinated the Internet's  
most important functions under its role as a government contractor 
and registered more than 5 million addresses with the ``com,'' 
``net'' and ``org'' suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Network Solutions will act as one of about a  
dozen wholesalers of Internet domains, selling Web addresses 
directly to the public for about $35 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it will also continue for at least four more years to  
maintain the master list of Internet domains, called the registry. 
In that capacity, it agreed to charge other wholesalers no more 
than $6 annually for each Web address a customer buys. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Network Solutions offered to pay in advance half  
the expected $2 million in fees ICANN expects to charge it as a 
name wholesaler, plus the full $250,000 it will pay for maintaining 
the Internet's master address list. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman for ICANN's directors,  
called the agreement ``a huge relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody here feels they gave a huge amount,'' Dyson said.  
``This is all about tradeoffs and compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government clearly wants Network Solutions to separate its  
functions as a seller of Web addresses and as keeper of the 
registry. One clause in the deal offers to allow the company to 
maintain the master list for up to eight years if it splits those 
operations within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions announced in August that it split those  
functions into ``discrete business units,'' but not as full a 
separation as sought by the government. Daniels didn't discuss 
future plans Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not started even to consider any particular details of  
what we will consider doing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Va. Cop Admits to Molesting Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCEVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The police chief of a rural farming  
town and a local electrician admitted molesting seven boys between 
the ages of 9 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark D. Harvey, 30, the police chief of Alberta for three years,  
pleaded guilty Monday to 13 charges of forcible sodomy and 
aggravated sexual assault. The assaults took place between December 
1997 and February. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lee Knight, 41, pleaded guilty to 14 similar counts.  
Prosecutors dropped other charges against the two as part of a plea 
agreement. Both men face up to life in prison on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey was placed on unpaid suspension after his arrest. His  
lawyer declined to comment after the court session. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were in court and prepared to testify, said Betsy  
Draper, director of the Brunswick County Victim and Witness 
Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
	With the plea deal, ``I think they were relieved,'' Ms. Draper  
said. ``There are no happy people in a case like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brunswick County Commonwealth's Attorney Lezlie Green said the  
molesting was ``in every sense of the word a joint enterprise'' 
between Harvey and Knight, adding that both men were frequently 
present when the sex acts with the boys took place. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Knight showed at least one of his victims a knife,  
threatening to stab him if the child told what was going on. He 
also gave at least some of the children muscle relaxers and 
alcohol, she said in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, unsuspecting parents allowed their boys to stay  
with Harvey overnight in advance of outings such as fishing or 
baseball, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 16.

<HEADLINE> Western Digital Recalls Hard Drives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Western Digital Corp. has recalled 400,000  
hard disk drives because of a defect in a computer chip, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defect can cause the hard drives -- the part of the computer  
that stores data -- to fail to power up after six to 12 months of 
use, company officials said Monday. The recalled hard drive is part 
of the WD Cavair series. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is the latest in a string of problems, including  
recent layoffs and a plunging stock price, for the Orange 
County-based computer company. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Digital officials said it was unclear how much the  
recall would cost or how many of the affected hard drives actually 
landed in consumer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose largest computer manufacturing costumers  
include Gateway Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp., said many of the 
disk drives are still in the hands of manufacturers and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No data has been lost, and none is in danger of being lost,''  
said Charles Haggerty, Western Digital's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard drives being recalled were made between Aug. 27 and  
last Friday, and have drive capacities between 6.4 gigabytes to 
20.5 gigabytes, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased computers in the past month can check  
specification sheets on their machines to see if they include a 
Western Digital drive, officials said. The company's Web site, 
www.westerndigital.com, offers a software program that can be 
downloaded to identify any affected products.

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Sidewalk Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether Colorado went too far in limiting ``sidewalk counseling'' 
by anti-abortion demonstrators, an effort to protect the privacy 
rights of abortion clinic patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will study an appeal in which three  
sidewalk counselors say the state law violates their free-speech 
rights. A decision, expected sometime in 2000, could provide 
important new guidelines for other states, and for communities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a 1993 Colorado law that bars people from  
counseling, distributing leaflets or displaying signs within eight 
feet of others without their consent whenever they are within 100 
feet of a health clinic entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature enacted the law in response to what the  
state's lawyers said was ``a history of obstructive demonstrations 
outside such clinics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Protesters constructively blockaded clinics by surrounding,  
crowding, yelling at, grabbing, pushing, shoving, hitting and 
spitting on those seeking access, triggering dangerous 
physiological responses in medical patients,'' state Attorney 
General Ken Salazar told the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	The state law was challenged by Leila Jeanne Hill, Audrey  
Himmelmann and Everitt Simpson Jr., who said they merely advised 
women of alternatives to abortion before the Colorado law made them 
fear criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Their appeal called the law an ``overbroad, content-based,  
viewpoint-discriminatory'' prior restraint on speech. 
</P>
<P>
	After Colorado courts upheld the state law, the nation's highest  
court in 1997 sent the case back so the state courts could 
reconsider it in light of a decision in which the justices allowed 
abortion protesters to confront patients on public sidewalks as 
long as they stayed at least 15 feet from clinic entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge in New York had ordered protesters to stay 15 feet away  
from any clinic patient or staff member, but the Supreme Court said 
such ``floating buffer zones'' were unconstitutional in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	After restudying the Colorado dispute, a state appeals court  
again upheld the state law. It drew a distinction between the New 
York case, which involved a judge's injunction against abortion 
protesters, and a generally applicable law enacted by a state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Supreme Court also voted to uphold the state law in  
February, citing ``greater deference for legislative enactments 
regulating speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state court also drew a distinction between buffer zones of  
15 feet and eight feet. The smaller buffer zone ``allows for normal 
conversational tones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the three Colorado abortion protesters said floating  
zones deemed to be invalid when imposed against ``adjudged 
malefactors'' also should be struck down ``if imposed by statute 
upon the general populace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Hill vs. Colorado, 98-1856.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Leading Millennium Gala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will address the American  
people as part of a splashy outdoor millennium gala in the final 
minutes of New Year's Eve on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be no ordinary party for no ordinary time,'' Hillary  
Rodham Clinton said Tuesday. ``This is a tremendous opportunity to 
really unite our nation.'' Along with the Clintons, the event will 
have actor Will Smith as host and will include a special film 
directed by Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady announced the celebration, ``America's  
Millennium: A Celebration for the Nation,'' along with Washington 
Mayor Anthony Williams and George Stevens Jr., who will co-produce 
the show along with Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In her weekly newspaper column, ``Talking It Over,'' the first  
lady said Clinton will speak to the nation just after Spielberg's 
film is shown on large screens on either side of the memorial, and 
before the ``Midnight Moment,'' a high-tech light display planned 
for the stroke of midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens declined to specify what would happen at the precise  
moment the century turns. ``That is something that will reveal 
itself at midnight,'' he said. ``It will be in the sky, and it will 
be inspiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gala caps a national celebration on the Mall that begins New  
Year's Eve with the unveiling of the national time capsule and runs 
through the holiday weekend. All the events are free. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration, with a budget of $12.5 million, will be  
financed through private donations from individuals and 
corporations. It is expected to draw about 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor assured that Y2K computer glitches will not affect the  
celebration. The subway will work, the lights will work, Williams 
said. ``Our systems are going to work, both in the public and 
private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Smith, performers lined up for the gala include singer  
Aretha Franklin, former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and blues 
guitarist B.B. King. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars will perform along with a 100-piece orchestra and all  
of the U.S. military bands, choirs and marching units. 
</P>
<P>
	Other events include:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Millennium on the Mall: Traditions and Tomorrows,'' an  
exhibit by the Smithsonian Institution featuring family-oriented 
performances, lectures and demonstrations examining music, art, 
literature, sports, science and technology of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Main Street Millennium,'' a block party along Constitution  
Avenue featuring food from local restaurants and performances by 
local entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Millennium Around the World,'' a worldwide broadcast feed at  
the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center showing celebrations 
and events in other countries. Mrs. Clinton said U.S. residents 
from other countries can gather there to welcome the new millennium 
as it arrives in their respective homelands.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Will Add to Russia's Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Past fears of an errant Russian missile launch  
can probably be put to rest, but Y2K problems still threaten 
serious disruptions to the U.S.-Russia crisis hotlines, a Pentagon 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Defense Secretary Edward Warner, testifying before the  
special Senate panel on Y2K, said Y2K-related software problems 
could affect full operation of six of the seven direct 
communications links between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the schedule is tight,'' he said, ``we are confident  
that the fixes will be installed and tested by December,'' before 
the world confronts the Y2K problem on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, experts testified that while Russia is not so  
dependent on computers as other countries, the Y2K problem will 
deal another blow to the already reeling Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is likely to experience power and telecommunications  
disruptions that affect its financial, industrial and government 
sectors, said John Beyrle, a State Department adviser on Russia. 
But he added, ``At this time, we do not foresee severe, long-term 
disruptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is the worry among some scientists that with the  
arrival of the new year, computers designed to read only the last 
two digits of the year -- and not altered before Jan. 1, 2000 -- will 
mistake 2000 for 1900 and malfunction or break down. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusion that the Y2K situation in Russia was serious but  
not as desperate as once thought was shared by other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the two militaries have worked together closely and  
agree that the likelihood is ``extremely remote'' that Y2K computer 
failures will involve nuclear weapons, support command and control 
or early-warning systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Baker of the Energy Department said department experts  
``believe that there is not a significantly increased risk of a 
nuclear accident at Soviet-designed nuclear power plants due to a 
Y2K event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many nations lag well behind the United States in removing Y2K  
glitches from their computers. Russia, in economic and political 
turmoil, is regarded as one of the countries most vulnerable to 
serious repercussions. One report last March predicted that Russian 
utilities would operate at 40 percent capacity and hospitals would 
deal with nothing but emergencies for two months. 
</P>
<P>
	With fewer than 100 days left before the new year, experts  
acknowledged some improvements but also pointed to serious 
problems. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading authority on 
Russia, said there is almost no chance of an accidental missile 
launch. But Y2K could further deteriorate Russia's weakened missile 
early-warning system and expose its nuclear stockpile to security 
breaches, Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy's Baker said that while nuclear power plants are  
relatively safe, radiation monitoring, security access and fuel 
management systems are vulnerable to Y2K problems. Outages of power 
supplies from outside the plants could also cause unplanned 
shutdowns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who heads the Y2K panel with  
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, also noted that nuclear reactors can 
withstand a loss of power for only 90 to 120 minutes before they 
begin to experience core damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Russia announced this month they are  
setting up a Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability at Peterson 
Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. The two sides will be 
able to share missile launch detection information, ensuring 
against computer-generated misreadings of launches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's Warner said the Russians also have requested  
$15.5 million in Y2K-related equipment such as emergency 
generators, fire trucks and warhead-handling vehicles. The Defense 
Department considers the requests reasonable, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall As Stocks Gain / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell sharply Tuesday in a selloff  
driven by fund managers apparently looking to recover losses 
created by the sudden rise in the price of gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell a full  
point, or $10 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.08 percent from 6.01 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund managers, who had bet that gold would continue to decline  
in value, sold bonds Tuesday to cover their losses. Gold futures 
contracts climbed Tuesday to their highest level since April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, bond prices decreased as demand fell in the wake of  
a huge $5.25 billion debt issued by Fannie Mae, the federal 
government's mortgage agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 1/8 to 7/32 point, while intermediate maturities fell 11/32 
to 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
were unchanged at 4.85 percent, and the discount held steady at 
4.72 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.97 percent as the discount 
fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.78 percent. One-year yields rose to 
5.18 percent as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.92 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 5.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 11/32 to 112 3/4. The average yield to 
maturity of the index rose to 5.87 percent from 5.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fed Warns Banks on Easing Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning banks not to become lax in their  
lending, the Federal Reserve directed its examiners Tuesday to 
watch for signs that risky loans are piling up, something that 
could threaten the strength of the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's action came a day after Fed Gov. Laurence  
Meyer warned that some banks may be counting too much on the 
economic boom continuing. Meyer's remarks, in a speech to bankers, 
were the latest among recent warnings by government officials about 
bank lending standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed action came in a supervisory letter, the means by which  
it informs its examiners and the banking industry of key policy 
directives. 
</P>
<P>
	``While loan portfolios are currently sound at the vast majority  
of banks, any trends toward laxity need to be reversed ... to 
ensure that the banking system remains strong and vibrant and 
retains the ability to lend to sound borrowers in good times and in 
bad,'' wrote Richard Spillenkothen, director of the Fed's Division 
of Banking Supervision and Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	A few banks are extending credit to some borrowers ``based  
largely on the expectation that the current strong financial 
performance of these borrowers will continue indefinitely,'' the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that if examiners see signs of problems at banks, such  
as bank officials being slow to recognize problem loans, they 
should consider taking action and downgrading banks' federal 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech Monday to the Institute of International Bankers,  
Meyer cited ``a possible relaxation in credit discipline that our 
supervisory reviews have detected at some (U.S.) banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While noting that bank loans remain sound overall, he said  
numbers of questionable loans ``have been rising modestly at some 
banks'' in recent months, a trend the central bank director called 
``troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks sometimes have been failing to put proposed loans through  
``stress tests'' designed to predict whether borrowers could 
withstand unexpected financial shocks, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers  
Association, acknowledged Monday that potentially risky loans have 
been increasing but added, ``They're still extraordinarily low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators are paid to worry,'' Chessen said after Meyer's  
speech. He said bankers have been asking prospective borrowers more 
questions than they did a year or two ago because they realize that 
the economic boom may soon slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the bankers' group reported the number of Americans  
overdue on credit card bills fell in the April-June quarter to a 
four-year low. The delinquency rate -- the percentage of accounts 30 
or more days overdue -- declined to 3.33 percent in the second 
quarter from 3.58 percent in the first.

<HEADLINE> Phone Lines Flooded for Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Since beating breast cancer two years ago, Ellen  
Fewtrell has been adding to a file full of newspaper clippings 
about treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	She was excited Tuesday by news that volunteers have started  
signing up for the first human trials of endostatin, an 
experimental drug that has been shown to shrink tumors in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely gives us hope,'' said Ms. Fewtrell, 34. ``I am a  
survivor, but God forbid one day I go to the doctor and I'm out of 
remission. This gives me hope that there is a chance I'll have many 
more tomorrows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1,400 cancer patients called special phone numbers  
Tuesday to sign up for the treatment. Between 15 and 30 people will 
be selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are looking for volunteers over age 17 with solid  
tumors who have not benefited from other treatment. Patients with 
leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma or primary brain tumors are not 
eligible for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a great breakthrough to begin the clinical  
trials,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal, spokesman for the American 
Cancer Society New England Division and a professor of medicine at 
Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer patients are always eager and hopeful for new news,''  
Rosenthal said. ``This has been on the radar screen since almost a 
year and a half ago as one of the new major ways of treating 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research is being conducted by Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care,  
a collaboration of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts 
General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead researcher, Dr. Donald Kufe, cautioned that this is  
only the first phase -- to check for adverse side effects. However, 
researchers also will look for signs that the drug is halting 
progress of tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin and a sister protein, angiostatin, work by destroying  
a tumor's ability to sprout new blood vessels. In research done by 
Dr. Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital, cancer went dormant or 
disappeared altogether in animals treated with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubts cropped up last fall when it was reported that scientists  
from the National Cancer Institute had not been able to reproduce 
Folkman's results. Then, in February, an NCI team said it had 
duplicated Folkman's work by conducting the experiments at 
Folkman's laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial tests are being sponsored by EntreMed Inc., a  
Maryland-based company that licensed the right to develop 
endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trials will be conducted at the University of Texas M.D.  
Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Wisconsin 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Fewer than 100 people are expected to 
receive the drug at the three locations.

	Bradley Offers $65B Health Care Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
offered a $65 billion plan today for universal access to health 
insurance that would require coverage for all children, with 
subsidies for families that cannot afford it. Under Bradley's plan, 
individuals of all ages and incomes also would be able to exclude 
from their taxable income whatever they pay for health premiums. He 
also would require parents to obtain health insurance for their 
children -- much like drivers are required to buy auto insurance -- 
and would offer full or partial premium subsidies to low-income 
families. All adults would get the option of buying into the same 
health plan provided to members of Congress.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eyeing Friday's start of fiscal 2000, the  
House today approved a stopgap measure that will keep federal 
agencies functioning for three weeks as President Clinton and 
Republicans sort through spending disputes. Prior to the vote, 
Democrats blamed unyielding Republican demands for Congress' 
failure to complete most of the 13 spending bills on time, a 
failure that is nearly an annual event.

to impose peace in East Timor, according to accounts emerging 
Tuesday. Wailing and weeping, mourners in the town of Baucau 
clutched at photos of two Roman Catholic nuns and seven others who 
were on a mercy mission for refugees when they were ambushed and 
killed. The missionaries were killed Saturday after delivering 
medicine and food to refugees displaced by the violence that

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A new pneumonia vaccine designed for  
infants appears to reduce severe childhood cases of the disease and 
may save hundreds of thousands of lives. Results were released 
today from a major study of the vaccine's effect on childhood 
pneumonia. Around the world, pneumonia caused by pneumococcus 
results in an estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Dr. Steven Black, 
who presented the data at an infectious-disease meeting sponsored 
by the American Society for Microbiology, estimated that the 
vaccine could prevent 450,000 of them.

	Consumer Confidence Slips in Sept.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A report released today says consumer confidence  
weakened in September for the third consecutive month. The 
Conference Board's survey results gave Wall Street the jitters, as 
stocks tumbled in afternoon trading before recovering. It also 
suggested that Federal Reserve moves to raise interest rates are 
slowing the economy. The board said its index of consumer 
confidence, a measure of consumers' willingness to spend, dipped to 
134.2 in September, 1.8 percentage points lower than a revised 136 
reading in August.

to open the Grand Slam Cup. Williams, 17, blasted past the 
27-year-old Sanchez-Vicario, the oldest player in the eight-player 
women's field. Williams could meet her sister, Venus, in the final. 
Venus won the women's tournament last year. The tournament, which 
also includes 12 men, invites players with best records at the four 
Grand Slam events of the year. While Pete Sampras and Patrick 
Rafter are out with injuries, No. 1 Andre Agassi heads the men's 
section.

<HEADLINE> Woman in Gifford Scandal Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The woman whose romantic interlude  
with Frank Gifford found its way to the tabloid front pages has 
been arrested on a charge of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzen Johnson was arrested Sept. 7 after the car she was driving  
rear-ended a pickup truck, according to Boca Raton police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 48, had a 0.17 blood-alcohol level, nearly twice the  
legal limit, according to police. She was booked on a charge of 
driving while intoxicated, released and is due back in court 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Harold Johnson, told The Palm Beach Post that his  
wife, a flight attendant, was not drunk. She had been treated 
earlier in the day by an orthopedic surgeon for a swollen foot 
caused by a luggage spill at work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave her some pills,'' Johnson said. ``She simply had a  
couple glasses of wine. She doesn't drink that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzen Johnson has a $10 million lawsuit pending against the  
parent company of the Globe tabloid, claiming the paper 
choreographed the scandal with Gifford and pressured her into 
seducing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe has acknowledged paying her at least $75,000 for  
setting up the rendezvous in a New York hotel two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Drop; Dow Ends Off 27.86 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a stunning late-session rally  
Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrials rising nearly 200 points 
and finishing with only modest declines. The dollar's gains against 
the Japanese yen and computerized buying programs helped reverse 
the market's slide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow finished down 27.86 at 10,275.53 after having fallen  
more than 222 points early in the afternoon. It marked the Dow's 
fifth drop in six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also slipped slightly. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 1.11 at 1,282.20, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was off 5.50 at 2,756.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders became more positive when they saw the dollar make  
headway against the Japanese yen. The dollar's decline last week 
helped push the Dow down 524.30, its biggest weekly point loss 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw the dollar getting stronger against the yen and that's  
what turned things around,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market 
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``It was a huge psychological barrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged slightly higher against the yen Tuesday, rising  
to 106.10 yen from 106.00 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said computerized buying programs also kicked in after the  
Dow fell more than 200 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we come close to a 10 percent correction in the  
Dow, investors feel this is enough of a drop and they go back in 
and buy stocks,'' said Robert Freedman, executive vice president of 
the John Hancock Funds in Boston. ``That's what we saw happen 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now down 1,050.51, or 9 percent, from its record high  
of 11,326.04 set on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying was scarce for most of Tuesday amid a paucity of positive  
economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumer  
confidence dipped in September for a third consecutive month. The 
drop was larger than economists had expected, and may be a sign 
that consumer spending will slow. That could in turn influence the 
Federal Reserve against boosting interest rates to cool off the 
economy when its policy-setting Open Market Committee meets next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer confidence report did little to move the  
markets, which remained anxious and unsettled before the Fed 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is suffering from a vacuum of positive  
information,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist 
at Advest of Hartford, Conn. '' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, investors have to deal with concerns of rising  
interest rates and gold prices and uncertainty about the dollar. 
Although the surge in gold prices the past two days has helped gold 
mining concerns, it also may heighten fears of inflation and higher 
interest rates, Shaughnessy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a water-torture type of correction,'' said Alfred  
Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. 
Louis, of the market's recent performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while there is uncertainty about interest rates on  
Wall Street, most traders expect the Fed to leave interest rates 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron, down 1 9/16 at 87 5/8, and General Electric, down 1 5/32  
to 118 1/2, were among the Dow's biggest losers. But J.P. Morgan, up 2 
3/16 at 118, helped the index's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist rose 7 11/16 to 48 11/16, after  
Chase Manhattan said it would buy the brokerage operation, but 
Chase was off 5/16 at 73 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, the largest U.S. health insurer, fell 5 3/16 to 61 3/4 on  
concerns the company's profits will be hurt by its purchase of 
Prudential HealthCare earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated volume came to 1.05 billion shares, up from 943.54  
million shares in Mondays session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.37 to 418.49  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.0 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was down 2.30 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 1.17 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.15 percent.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The wife of Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa was  
admitted to a hospital emergency room with an undisclosed illness 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Sosa, 25, arrived at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital

<HEADLINE> Treatment OK'd for Aortic Aneurysm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of Americans with a time bomb in  
their abdomens -- a weak spot on the body's largest blood vessel 
like the one that killed actor George C. Scott last week -- may 
choose an easier treatment than grueling surgery that until now was 
the only option. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a weak  
bulge on the aorta that, if it breaks, can cause almost instantly 
fatal internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, patching these aneurysms has required slicing open  
the entire abdomen and moving aside delicate organs to reach the 
problem. The surgery itself kills up to 10 percent of patients, and 
even those who do well can require months of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved an  
alternative: Two patches that doctors can use to repair aneurysms 
through just a small incision in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies of more than 800 patients, the patches -- Guidant  
Corp.'s Ancure and Medtronic Inc.'s AneuRx -- successfully repaired 
aneurysms more than 90 percent of the time. The procedure cut 
surgical complications in half and let patients go home from the 
hospital in just two or three days instead of a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons involved in the studies say the patches could  
revolutionize care, especially for elderly patients who could not 
survive open surgery and thus have had no other option. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's made a huge difference in terms of patient discomfort and  
patient acceptance of aneurysm repair,'' said Dr. Wesley Moore of 
the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the patches are not risk-free, the FDA warned. Some people --  
particularly women, who often have smaller blood vessels -- may not 
be good candidates, and doctors must be specially trained to safely 
use the complex devices, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Guidant and Medtronic must continue studying the  
patches to prove they hold up over time like surgical repair does. 
</P>
<P>
	The aorta is the largest blood vessel, like a river running from  
the heart to the groin with tributaries that branch off, carrying 
blood around the body. An aneurysm is a weak bulge in the aorta's 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bulge gets big enough, the pressure from blood flowing  
past it can cause it to burst, which kills 15,000 Americans a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors estimate that 1.5 million older Americans have abdominal  
aortic aneurysms, called ``AAAs.'' But because AAAs often cause no 
symptoms until they break, only about 200,000 patients are aware of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to open surgery, Tuesday's approval allows doctors  
to slice an opening into an artery in the groin, thread an aortic 
patch up that artery until it meets the aorta, and then push the 
patch to the aneurysm spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidant's Ancure has metal hooks that grab onto a healthy  
section of aorta to form sort of a sleeve, providing a new path so 
blood doesn't pound on the aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
	Medtronic's AneuRx is a stent, a metal scaffolding that opens up  
until it has expanded against the aortic walls enough to hold the 
patch in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies began shipping the patches to surgeons  
immediately. Each device costs around $10,000, and Medtronic 
estimated the total cost of patch surgery to be $18,000 to $20,000. 
In contrast, regular AAA surgery costs about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the patches may prove more cost-effective, Medtronic  
insisted, because no one has yet estimated how much money they 
could save by preventing the complications -- and the further 
treatment those require -- that often plague receipients of 
open-abdominal surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the patches do have risks.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, even though fewer women than men get these  
aneurysms, women actually fared worse during experiments with the 
patches. The problem appeared to be size -- doctors didn't realize 
in advance which women had arteries too small to handle threading 
up a patch. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said a surgery team should always be available in case a  
patient failed the patch procedure and needed immediate 
open-abdomen surgery. Also troubling was that some patches leaked. 
It is unclear how risky that is, but the FDA urged proper follow-up 
monitoring of patients.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady, Giuliani Spar Over Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in Washington  
to start a fund-raising swing expected to rake in $300,000, said 
Tuesday he opposes raising the nation's minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's remarks came as his likely Democratic rival in New  
York's Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, appeared on Capitol 
Hill urging an increase in the $5.15 hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right that any person in our country works  
full time and brings home wages that leaves that person and that 
person's family in poverty,'' Mrs. Clinton said. She said the 
buying power of the minimum wage has decreased dramatically since 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, talking to reporters in a Washington hotel, said he  
worries that raising the minimum wage would hold down job creation, 
especially entry-level jobs that are allowing New Yorkers who have 
been on welfare to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I would not be in favor of it until I saw that  
it had no impact on reducing the number of jobs,'' the Republican 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a $1 increase  
in the minimum wage over two years would cost business roughly $16 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is pushing a proposal to increase  
the minimum wage by $1 in two installments, a 50-cent increase in 
January and another in the following year. Another proposal being 
floated in the House of Representatives would increase the rate by 
$1.30 over four years. In the still-evolving House proposal, such 
an increase would be coupled with tax breaks and other sweeteners 
for small businesses and the self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance of Mrs. Clinton on Capitol Hill brought in droves  
of reporters and staffers to what would have been a fairly 
commonplace news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she was technically there as first lady, Mrs. Clinton  
used the occasion to trumpet themes she is likely to stress should 
she enter the New York Senate race: a higher minimum wage to help 
the working poor and women's and children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said raising the minimum wage is particularly  
important to the nation's women working full-time jobs at the 
minimum wage. The Kennedy bill would raise their incomes by $2,000 
a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have met a lot of people, particular women, across our  
country who have detailed to me the difference $2,000 a year would 
make in their lives and the lives of their children, how that could 
mean seven months worth of groceries or five months worth of rent 
or 10 months worth of utility,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, she was flying to New York to receive the  
National Breast Cancer Coalition Leadership Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani was in Washington to raise money on the first day of a  
three-day fund-raising tour that will also take him to Las Vegas, 
Los Angeles and Bakersfield, Calif. Washington's fund-raiser was at 
the lobbying office of former Republican National Committee 
Chairman Haley Barbour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's campaign team has set a target of $25 million for  
the race. Giuliani's Senate exploratory committee has more than $3 
million in the bank already.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Colleges Get $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian tribal colleges struggling on  
campuses cobbled together from old Army barracks, double-wide 
trailers or decommissioned high schools are getting a $30 million 
donation to help with construction and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of the conditions at these tribal colleges, and  
felt that since we had the resources, we'd like to be able to help 
them,'' said Gretchen Wolfram of the Lilly Endowment Inc., which is 
making the gift to the American Indian College Fund. ``These are 
schools that are in remote places and in not very good condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was announcing the gift today to kick off a $120  
million campaign to raise money for improvements at 30 tribal 
colleges serving 26,000 students in 12 states. So far, the fund 
drive has taken in $43 million, including the Lilly gift, American 
Indian College Fund spokeswoman Suzette Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 30 schools are community colleges run by one or more  
tribes and located on reservations. Non-Indians also can take 
classes at the schools, but the colleges get federal per-student 
funding only for their Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
	While a few of the colleges have newer campuses, most hold  
classes in aging government-issue buildings or prefab ``portable'' 
classrooms. The gift from the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment 
and money raised by the fund drive will help ensure ``Indian 
students can go to schools in facilities that are as good as their 
white counterparts, where they don't have to worry about tiles 
falling on their heads,'' Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tribal colleges are located in some of the worst  
facilities in the country for education,'' said Brewer, an Oklahoma 
Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinary students at the Crownpoint Institute of Technology in  
New Mexico work in a metal shed built for a local uranium mine. The 
main classroom building at Cheyenne River Community College in 
South Dakota was condemned by inspectors. The Institute of American 
Indian Arts in Santa Fe, N.M., has spent the last two decades in 
converted World War II barracks at another college. 
</P>
<P>
	IAIA, a congressionally chartered school which has trained some  
of the most well-known contemporary Indian artists, broke ground 
this year on a new, 140-acre campus. The school has raised about $8 
million of the $14 million needed for the first phase of the 
project, said Robert Sutton, director of finance and 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to have a nice facility or one that's conducive  
to learning,'' Sutton said. ``We really look forward to having our 
own campus, someplace where IAIA can call home.''
