ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said here Wednesday that Greece would continue its
efforts for a speedy political solution to the Yugoslav crisis
through a series of contacts in Europe, the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Papandreou said that he would
visit Sofia Friday for a foreign ministers' meeting of Greece,
Romania and Bulgaria while next week he would also fly to the
countries such as Albania, Macedonia, France, Russia, the United
States and China.
</P>
<P>
As for the NATO's missiles attack on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia, the minister said that China's reactions were
understandable. The international community hoped China to
contribute towards a solution, within a relevant decision of the
United Nations Security Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is considering itself a major force to maintain
peace and stability in the Balkan region, has repeatedly said that
it favors a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis because a
military intervention will not solve any problems but worsen them.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey in New Diplomatic Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey run into a new round
of diplomatic row over the scarf issue in Turkey and the
mysterious death of seven Iranian citizens near the border between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Wednesday summoned Turkish Ambassador
to Tehran Sencar Ozsoy to lodge Iran's strong protest to Turkish
border guards' refusal to honor contracts for border cooperation,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Seven Iranians were found dead recently near the border with
Turkey and Turkish border guards refused to cooperate with Iran in
scrutinizing the case, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran accused the Turkish side of disrespecting provisions of
the formerly reached contract for border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian pro-conservative Kayhan daily said last Saturday that
Turkish troops crossed into Iranian territory and killed the
Iranians, an accusation firmly denied by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned Iranian
Ambassador to Ankara Hussein Lavasani to protest against Iran's
alleged support for a Turkish lawmaker who insisted on wearing
traditional Islamic headscarf in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but secular state, bans women
from entering university and public places wearing headscarves.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of Iranian university students held rallies
in Tehran on Saturday and Tuesday in support of the Turkish woman
lawmaker Merve Kavaci, who wore headscarf when attending
oath-taking ceremony in the parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government termed the rallies as "unacceptable"
and "an interference" in Turkish internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit also accused
Iran of trying to whip up Islamic extremism in secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the accusation, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said that "what is going on in Turkey has nothing to do
with Iran."

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Take Measures to Curb Angolan Rebels' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will take some
new measures to prevent the diamonds illegally exploited by
Angola's rebel movement UNITA from entering the international
market, Angolan Minister of Geology and Mines Manuel Bunjo said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bunjo disclosed this after his talks with visiting Chairman of
U.N. Sanction Commission Robert Foller in Angolan capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan minister said that the purpose of the possible
measures is to ban the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA)

from dealing with diamonds and using what it gains in fighting the
war.
</P>
<P>
He said that the details of the measures will be discussed by
the U.N. experts who will come to Luanda soon. But he noted that
the core of the measures is to prevent the UNITA from exporting
diamond with the licenses it got from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Bunjo accused some countries of providing Jonas Savimbi's UNITA
with convenience in selling diamond freely in the world market by
issuing licenses to the Angolan rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government insists on participating in the
panel to be established for curbing UNITA diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government's participation will ensure the
effective implementation of the U.N. sanctions on the UNITA so
that "our diamond will not be used for the war purpose."
</P>
<P>
Foller arrived here Tuesday to discuss with the Angolan
government over the problems in implementing the U.N. sanctions on
the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official will visit some other southern African
countries after his Luanda tour.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the U.N. Security Council has passed three
resolutions about imposing sanctions on the UNITA. The sanctions
include the ban on UNITA's export of diamond, embargo of petroleum
and arms, ban on visit abroad by UNITA leaders and closure of
overseas offices of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
However, the actions did not achieve anticipated results due to
some countries' ignorance of the U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> 040 taaKenya's Athlete Aims at 5,000 Meter World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Daniel Komen said here
Wednesday that he was determined to reclaim the 5,000 meters
world record from his Ethiopian rival Haile Gebrselassie this
season.
</P>
<P>
Komen, holder of the 3,000 meters world records outdoors and
indoors, said that although the task was hard but he was working
equally hard to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
Komen has been training at a high-altitude camp in Nyahururu,
near Mount Kenya, for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Experienced steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui is head coach at the
camp. Other members of the coaching team include Olympian Joseph
Chesire and Jimmy Beautah, a former high school coach in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Komen said he saw the 5,000 meters record tumbling during the
season, probably after the world championships in Spain in
August.
</P>
<P>
``I want to strike (the record) so hard,'' Komen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his aim was to put the record well beyond the
reach of Gebrselassie who set the mark of 12 minutes 39.36
seconds in June in Helsinki, Finland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Winter Wheat to Drop 14 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. winter wheat production
this year is expected to drop 14 percent as compared with last
year, partly due to a 9 percent decrease in harvest area, the
Agricultural Department reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly crop report, the department said that production
of winter wheat is forecast at 1.61 billion bushels. The area for
the 1999 grain harvest is forecast at 36.3 million acres, the
smallest winter wheat area since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The report also offered proof that the U.S. farm woes have
taken a toll on cotton. Final 1998 production numbers show a 26
percent drop from the previous year. The 13.9 million bales
produced last season, as many states endured drought and high
temperatures, was the smallest crop since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Orange production is also expected to take a hit, the report
said. Production this season is forecast at 9.84 million tons, 28
percent lower than last year's record 13.7 million ton crop.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, oilseed production is projected to increase nearly
6 percent to a record 89.7 million tons. Most of the increase is
in soybeans, which are expected to rise to a record 78.4 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
But soybean prices are expected to drop this season to 4.75
U.S. dollars a bushel, compared to 5.05 dollars last year and 6.47
dollars in 1997. Still, soybean prices have fared better than
wheat, which is projected to get around 2.60 dollars to 3.10
dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The low prices are a continuation of a farm crisis that last
year led Congress to pass a 6-billion-dollar aid deal for farmers.
With the price problem expected to continue much of this year,
some lawmakers are already discussing another bailout package for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Farm-state Democrats have even launched an effort to get 4.7
billion dollars in emergency aid attached to a supplemental
package now moving through Congress.

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Strobe Talbott will
be back in Moscow on Thursday for more work on broad range of
issues after Russian President Boris Yeltsin had fired Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Deputy Secretary
Talbott is now in Helsinki, Finland, to hold talks with Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari after having "a very good set of

He said his talks with Russian officials had resulted in the
setting up of two working groups, one on the military side and the
other on the civilian side.
</P>
<P>
"Deputy Secretary Talbott will be back in Moscow tomorrow" to
meet with Russian officials after the working groups have had a
full day of discussions, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin acknowledged that there are still wide gaps between
Russia and the United States on the Kosovo crisis, especially on
the composition of the international security force for the
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refutes US Statement, Defends Arrest of Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Foreign Office
Wednesday issued a press release to protest against a U.S.
statement which demands Pakistan end what it called a "press
crackdown."
</P>
<P>
The press release said the government of Pakistan has taken
strong exception to the statement made by the U.S. State
Department, which alleges Pakistan's mistreatment of journalists,
including Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times (TFT).
</P>
<P>
Sethi was arrested in Lahore last Saturday for his
"anti-Pakistan conduct and ridiculing the very foundations and the
ideology of the country," according to a statement made by a
Pakistani government spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of making anti-Pakistan remarks in a lecture he
delivered in India earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sethi's wife told a press conference Tuesday that he was
arrested because of an interview with a BBC team that is in
Pakistan preparing a documentary film on the issue of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement urged the Pakistani government to release
Sethi and others.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Foreign Office described the U.S. statement as
"unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"The statement is based on assumptions which are not supported
by facts. It also reflects total lack of objectivity and
understanding of the circumstances that led to the arrest of the
concerned individual," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The press release denied that Sethi had been physically
mistreated and said he will be afforded full opportunity to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the current Pakistani government "is fully
committed to the preservation of the freedom of the press and rule
of law."

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Iraqi civilians, including
two children, were killed and several others injured on Wednesday
in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civilian targets in
northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:00 (0600 GMT), 10 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Erbil, Dohuk and Neiveva provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy formations fired seven laser-guided bombs at two
civilian targets in Neineva province, killing 12 civilians,
including two children, and injuring several others, some of whom
are in critical conditions, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The brutal bombardment also killed 200 sheep, destroyed a
harvester and a truck used by farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
and repelled the enemy planes at 13:15 (0915 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes coming from Saudi,
Kuwaiti and Turkish bases have made 6,126 sorties over Iraqi
airspace, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi military and civilian facilities have almost become
daily targets of U.S. and British warplane attacks, which led to
severe casualties and property damage.

LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister,
Toco Diakenga Serao, expressed Wednesday his government deepest
sympathy and support to China, over the U.S.-led Nato's attack on
Chinese embassy to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Angola, Jiang Yuande, Serao
said that whatever the reason, the missile attack is "a serious
issue and a tragedy."
</P>

It is a violation to international laws and a violation to
China's sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Serao said that Chinese government's four-point demands are
reasonable and its a minimum requirement, adding that the demands
indicate that Chinese government is just and peace-loving, and the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Paper Accuses NATO of Blaspheming Human Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, has condemned the U.S.-led NATO's barbaric strikes
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as a wanton blasphemy against
human civilization.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO outrageously attacked the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade on May 7, killing three journalists and injuring more
than twenty people. The bloody atrocity created by the U.S.-led
NATO was a rare case in the history of international relations,
said the paper in a commentary to be carried in Thursday's issue.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Wanton Blaspheme Against Human
Civilization", said that it is widely acknowledged that
civilization is characterized by certain norms in certain
societies. Any acts that wantonly violate these social norms and
cause serious consequences will be deemed as crimes and be
condemned and punished by the societies.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the present world, the international community
has adopted a series of norms governing international relations,
one of which is the inviolableness of the embassy buildings. The
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations adopted in 1961 has
formally confirmed this principle.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Prevention of Crimes Against
Internationally Protected Persons including Diplomatic Persons
adopted in 1973 further stipulates that deliberate and violent
attacks against the public buildings and private residences of
internationally protected persons including diplomatic persons are
a crime against the international law and must be punished, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it pointed out, the Hague Convention enacted in
1899 and 1907, the 1949 Geneva Convention and 1977 Geneva
Convention have repeatedly confirmed in their appendixes a
principle of the law on war which provides that military
operations should not target and kill civilians.
</P>
<P>
In their barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia, however, the U.S.-led
NATO has outrageously trampled these international norms and the
consensus of mankind under the banner of "civilization", the
commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
"When NATO's precision-guided missiles attacked the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia from multiple angles and when NATO's
precision-guided bombs raided the refugees' trucks, the
international passenger trains and civilian residences, how can
the kind-hearted people rest at ease for a single day?" the
commentary questioned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities, however, denied they were barbaric acts.
The commentary asked: "If they were not barbaric acts, what are
barbaric acts?"
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "the U.S.-led NATO has stamped itself with
the brand of 'barbarism'. Although some people are still humming
and hawing and uttering self-contradictory prevarication which
they themselves do not quite understand, their image laden with a
guilty conscience will remain on historical videotapes forever."
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Western culture has its brilliant side which has
become a integral part of the outstanding cultural heritage of all
mankind, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It is also undeniable that Western culture has its dark and
villainous side, it said, citing the cultural genocide of Indians
on the American continent, the colonial rule by the West in Asia
and Africa, and the West's gunboat policies.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars with conscience in the West have criticized the
evil heritage of the Western culture, which is an endeavor
deserving of appreciation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mankind should move ceaselessly forward toward a more advanced
and higher-level of civilization. However, the U.S.-led NATO
willfully bombed innocent civilians and attacked the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia, increasingly demonstrating its lunatic
cruelty and fierceness, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO has become an heir to the evil heritage of the
Western culture and has added a shameful chapter to the history of
human civilization. Now it has nailed itself to the cross of shame
in the history of world civilizations by committing bloody
atrocities, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also pointed out that though the U.S-led NATO is
still making excuses to justify the raids, it is all in vain.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian President Writes to Milosevic on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
has written a letter to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
urging him to work for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the message, which was carried by the Macedonian news agency
MIA Tuesday, Gligorov said that it is still possible to find what
he called a mutually acceptable and democratic solution which will
respect the territorial integrity of all existing countries and
will not undermine the existing borders.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov said that Macedonia is firm in its position that no
offensive will be allowed to be launched from Macedonian soil
against its neighboring countries including Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Macedonia, and me personally, are trying to do
everything that is in our power and in the interest of the
friendship between our peoples to provide a peaceful life in the
region, in a unified and democratic Europe," the MIA quoted the
message as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that a number of opportunities for a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis had been missed, Gligorov appealed
to Milosevic to "do it now and without delay."
</P>
<P>
Gligorov expressed his hope for a swift end to the war in
Kosovo so that the countries in the region will "be able to deal
with the problems of peace, development and well-being of our
countries and peoples."

<HEADLINE> Joint Developers Named for West Africa Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of a two-day meeting held in Lome, the committee
comprising ministers from the four countries Wednesday named
Chevron, Shell as well as the gas companies of the four countries
as the joint developers to build a 600 kilometers pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The six known as the commercial group for the project provided
two million U.S. dollars for the feasibility study which concluded
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The study undertaken by a German company concluded that the 693
million dollars project was "feasible and viable" and recommended
its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee also endorsed a tax holiday for the
consortium including custom duty and royalty waiver from the four
countries to facilitate the execution of the project.
</P>
<P>
At present, natural gas from Nigeria's oil fields is mostly
flared and the project would enable it to be used as a substitute
for oil in power plants in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
First deliveries could start by 2002 with initial volume of
between 100 million and 150 million cubic feet a day but these
could increase fivefold within 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Commanders Accused of  Atrocities in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- As the war to topple the Democratic
republic of Congo (DRC) President Laurent Desire Kabila drags on,
the main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) is
accusing Ugandan commanders of seeking to break up the movement.
</P>
<P>
As Uganda is winding up to pull out of the Congolese conflict,
its top commanders, among whom brigadier James Kazini, are trying
to split the RCD they have been supporting, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the RCD has publicly charged Ugandans of
seeking to cripple the movement which started the rebellion
against Kabila on August 2, last year from Goma near the border
with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels feel betrayed by Uganda whose leaders have
clearly indicated that they will never support two rebel movements
in the DRC, but show inclination to causing the ruin of the RCD by
disarming its troops and forcing them to join the rival Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC) of business tycoon, Jean Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
"These are things we regret as military leaders of the
Congolese army," the RCD military commander, Jean Pierre Ondekane
said in Goma late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ondekane exposed a string of abuses committed by Ugandan
troops in northeastern DRC and pointed an accusatory finger at
Brigadier Kazini, who has reportedly installed a reign of terror
in the parts controlled by his men.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Kazini has claimed that he is helping Congolese
to form a force of their own and which would take over after the
Ugandan soldiers have pull out as stipulated by controversial
peace agreement signed in Sirte Libya last month by Congo's
Kabila, and Uganda's Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The agreement which failed to get the blessing of the main
rebel force (RCD) and one of its main ally, Rwanda, has remained a
non-starter and there are glimmer chances that it might lead to
solving the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kazini's move is said to have so far led to disarming about two
RCD battalions who were shifted to Bemba's command without
consulting the RCD command. These troops include some RCD top
commanders.
</P>
<P>
The RCD claims that Bemba is a creation of Kazini and his peers
who are said to have shoddy deals with millionaire Bemba, and
which have led to massive lootings of Congolese resources and a
thriving smuggling network which extends to some business people
in Kampala.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Primakov Ouster to Worsen Russia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
decision Wednesday to fire Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his
cabinet is expected to exacerbate the country's political
instability and further stunt the already feeble economy.
</P>
<P>
News of Primakov's demise, the third cabinet ouster in less
than a year, sparked widespread concern over the country's
political and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-led left opposition accused Yeltsin of
"deliberately staging a new government crisis." It urged the
Federation Council, or upper house of parliament, to convene an
emergency session to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Most other political movements also described the move as a
"mistake" that would bring further storm to Russia's political and
economic scene.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's dissatisfaction with the Primakov government and
rumors of an imminent government reshuffle have appeared in the
Russian media for a long time, but Yeltsin's announcement
Wednesday still came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
Although Primakov was fired for his failure to improve the
economy, any scholar with some knowledge of the Russian current
affairs would tell that the real reason was the impeachment
proceedings against Yeltsin in the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, scheduled to start Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since Primakov took over as prime minister last September,
Russia has achieved a relative stability in its political and
economic situation, but with the approaching of Duma elections at
the end of the year, the struggles between the left opposition and
President Yeltsin became increasingly acute.
</P>
<P>
The focus of such struggles centered round the State Duma's
efforts to impeach Yeltsin and the president's bid to hang on.
</P>
<P>
One can say that Primakov, who commands close ties with the
left opposition, has become a hostage to the standoff between
Yeltsin and the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's ouster will doubtlessly bring about a replay of the
political tension that followed the previous two governmental
crises, but this time around, President Yeltsin's strength is even
more weakened than before and the left opposition would no longer
budge easily at the last minute in its showdown with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
This scenario will inevitably intensify the struggles between
the two sides and impact on the political and economic
developments in both the short and long run.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, the future of the State Duma will bear
the brunt in such struggles. If the lower house rejects Yeltsin's
new candidate, current First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin, for three times, Yeltsin could disband
the parliament and call early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
This would further intensify the conflict between Yeltsin and
the left opposition and plunge Russia's political and economic
situation, which has just achieved a semibalance of stability,
into fresh chaos.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Primakov's dismissal could also prompt most Duma
deputies to consider saving themselves by supporting the
impeachment motion, as under the constitution, "the president
cannot dissolve the State Duma within three months as of the start
of the impeachment proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Such a turn of events could lead to the approval of the
impeachment motion, which had little hope of clearing the
parliament before.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the legal issues regarding the president and the
Duma will become very entangled and various political forces will
be pitted against each other in a more chaotic battle.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the government reshuffle could well
result in Russia's failure to secure its much-need loans from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Because of Primakov's departure, the bills on tax increase, one
of the key IMF requirements, would be very difficult to be
approved by the lower house of parliament. This would make it
unrealistic for the IMF to honor its promise to extend new loans
to Russia in June.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Russia's hope of securing new loans from other
sources and restoring its financial market would become even more
remote in the wake of the governmental crisis, which would spell
disaster for an economy that desperately needs foreign capital.

BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's former Mount Lebanon
Province governor Sohail Yamout and another two people were
formally charged Wednesday by the country's Magistrate with
embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor for Financial Fraud Ahmad Taqieddine filed
charges against Yamout who allegedly embezzled municipal funds
through the payment of forged and fictitious bills.
</P>
<P>
The other two suspects Abdel Qader Itani, an engineer at the
Ministry of Rural and Municipal Affairs, and Mohmmed Douani, the
ministry's contractor, faced the same charge.
</P>
<P>
Yamout is the third high-ranking official under the previous
government to be indicted in financial scandals since President
Emile Lahoud, who took office last November, launched an
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
Former Oil Minister Shahe Barsoumian and former
Director-General of Antiquities Camille Asmar have been charged
on squandering and embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Yamout, who was relieved of his post when former Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri left office last November, is overseeing a
Hariri real estate venture in Sao Paolo in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The judicial authorities has issued a search warrant for
Yamout after he refused to return for appearing before the court
on the ground that he was sick.

ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi Wednesday received a message from the Yemeni President, Ali
Abdullah Saleh, which focuses on the Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdullah Ganem, Yemen's legal and parliamentary affairs
head, delivered the message to the Ethiopian Prime Minister here,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Prime Minister Meles as saying that "Eritrea
must withdraw from all occupied Ethiopian territories for the
peaceful settlement of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The one-year border conflict remains no war and no peace now.
Although both Ethiopia and Eritrea have expressed their acceptance
of the framework agreement of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), they haven't so far agreed a cease fire on their border
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a press statement issued to mark the first
anniversary (May 12, 1998) of the occupation of Badme by Eritrean
troops, the office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome
Taddesse said Wednesday that 315, 936 Ethiopians have been
internally displaced from their homes and 79,000 students have
been unable to continue their education as schools have been
destroyed or have ceased to operate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With German Chancellor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder here today, emphasized
that an immediate halt to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is the
major precondition for getting the Kosovo negotiations back on
track, and remarked that, "There can never be peace with gunfire."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that any political settlement projects need to be
agreed to by Yugoslavia and that this is the Chinese government's
stand.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder expressed profound regret over the NATO missile
attack on the Chinese embassy and said, "As a member state of NATO
and one of the countries that bear responsibility for the attack,
Germany holds that NATO should apologize to the Chinese government
and people unconditionally." The Chinese government's demand for
an investigation is reasonable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he spoke with Premier Zhu Rongji this afternoon
about approaches to the Kosovo issue and that, in spite of
divergences, he still agrees with the Chinese that they should go
back to the United Nations Security Council to look for a
political settlement as quickly as possible.

<P>
People are on the verge of a new millennium, Jiang said, and
two world wars in the 20th century brought human beings
unprecedented calamities and enormous troubles. After World War II,
he said, the Germans stuck to a path of peaceful development and
this was an important factor for Germany's economic success.
</P>
<P>
"Past experiences, if not forgotten, are a guide for the future,
" he said, and that the Chinese people appreciate the fact that
the Germans and far-sighted statesmen bear this in mind and
treasure the peaceful environment that did not come easy.
</P>
<P>
No one expected at the end of the century that NATO would
launch a regional war in the Balkans and bring a tragic disaster
to the people of Yugoslavia, he said, "The world is shocked."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Chinese people have objected to
it from the beginning, he explained, and all over the world there
were anti-war demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Peace and security in Europe are closely related to peace in
the rest of the world, he said, and the war against Yugoslavia is
not only bad for stability in the Balkans but bad for peace and
development in Europe and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Neither a cold war nor a hot one should be introduced if world
peace is being pursued," he said.

Jiang said that each country's affairs must be handled by the
country itself, and that world affairs must be handled by the
people in the world.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to handle all the world's affairs or to dominate
the destiny of other countries will not work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was a
serious violation of Chinese sovereignty, he went on to say, and
triggered strong resentment among the 1.2 billion Chinese and
opposition to and condemnation of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to modern Chinese history, he said that China had been
invaded and its people insulted by many foreign powers and that
the Chinese people have a glorious tradition of resisting
aggression and safeguarding national sovereignty and dignity and
that today's China is not the old one.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wants to repeat history by insulting China and its
people will certainly be lifting a rock only to drop it on his own
toes," Jiang said, and added that there was no doubt that NATO's
bombing of the embassy would encounter indignation and protests
among the Chinese and that China is a nation with a long history.
</P>
<P>
China will continue with its domestic and foreign policies, he
said, and unswervingly carry out the reforms and opening-up and
modernization, unswervingly follow an independent foreign policy
of peace, and actively promote friendship and cooperation with the
rest of the world, in order to make a contribution to peace and
development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that the German and Chinese people are diligent
and clever and that Germany is an economic power and influential
in Europe and in the rest of the world and that China is keen to
promote cooperation with Germany for their mutual benefit and to
establish a closer relationship.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Parties Condemn NATO Missile Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Russian Communist
Party and the Bulgarian Socialist Party on Wednesday sent letters
to President Jiang Zemin condemning the U.S.-led NATO attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and expressing sympathy for the
Chinese victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, chairman of the central committee of the
Russian Communist Party, said in his letter to President Jiang
that the NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy was not only a
blow to the diplomatic institution of China, which is a great
country in the world, a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council and has made contributions to safeguarding world peace and
stability, but also an objectionable act to the entire
international community.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said the Russian Communist Party stands for China's
stance and its demand to punish those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Georgi Parvanov, chairman of the highest committee of the
Bulgarian Socialist Party, said the NATO missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy is immoral and unacceptable and runs counter to
international laws, and also encroaches upon Chinese national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mexican Popular Socialist Party, the Peruvian
Popular Christian Party and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party sent
letters to Chinese embassies in each country, saying the atrocious
act by NATO is a crime committed against China and its people.

<HEADLINE> Most S. African Whites Distrust Electoral Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Most registered white voters
in South Africa distrust the Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC), according to a poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council,
was completed in March. Its results were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 40 percent of whites did not regard the
body as trustworthy, compared with 28 percent giving it the nod.
</P>
<P>
The IEC won the approval of 74 percent of black voters and 28
percent of Indians. Only 10 percent of blacks said they distrusted
the IEC, compared to 33 percent of Indians. Among coloreds, 45
percent were for and 13 percent against the IEC.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 64 percent of voters expressed trust in the body
responsible for running the June 2 election. About 70 percent
believed the IEC was neutral and independent, while 16 percent
felt the body supported a political party.
</P>
<P>
Along political party lines, levels of trust in the IEC were
the lowest among supporters of the Freedom Front (17 percent), the
Democratic Party (30 percent) and the New National Party (35
percent).
</P>
<P>
All the three parties were traditionally white-based.
</P>
<P>
Parties of which more than 50 percent supporters expressed
trust in the IEC, were the United Democratic Movement (83
percent), the African National Congress (78 percent), the Inkatha
Freedom Party (51 percent) and the Pan Africanist Congress (also
51 percent).
</P>
<P>
All these parties except the newly founded United Democratic
Movement were traditionally black-based parties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Used-Home Prices Still Rise in the First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Prices of existing homes rose in
most metropolitan areas during the first quarter of this year, the
National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The median resale price of the used-homes was 131,600 dollars
during the January-March quarter, up 4.6 percent from the same
quarter a year earlier, the Association said.
</P>
<P>
However, inflation rose at a 1.7 percent annual rate last year
and has kept to an even lower 1.5 percent rate so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rise in home prices in all regions has been
fueled by a combination of buyers ready to move up to more
expensive homes and a growing number of first-time buyers in this
favorable economic environment.
</P>
<P>
They said low unemployment, rising incomes, continuing stock
market gains, and low mortgage rates helped fuel an unprecedented
home-buying boom last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes have continued to break records this
year, rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.88 million
units from January through March, the Association said, up 8.4
percent from the 5.24 million sales rate during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 120 metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group
reported median resale price increases of 10 percent or greater,
while 24 posted declines.
</P>
<P>
Median resale prices ranged from 65,700 dollars in Ocala, Fla.,
to 331,100 dollars in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West and the Northeast posted the largest
increases, 6.8 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. The South
lagged, with a 2.9 percent rise. In the Midwest, the median prices
advanced 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Seriously Affects Greek Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the businesses in northern
Greece have seen a dramatic drop in their turnover since NATO
started the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, a survey said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted by the National Confederation
of Hellenic Commerce, showed that 80 percent of businesses in the
northern part of the country reported a 60-70 percent drop in
their turnover in the last 40 days.
</P>
<P>
A total of 63 businesses, focusing in trade transactions with
Yugoslavia and other neighboring countries, are facing a dramatic
situation due to a complete freeze of trade, exports and payments.
</P>
<P>
Consumers in these regions were particularly cautious and
reluctant to spend because they wanted to save money in case of
the war expanding in the Balkan region, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also warned against the impact of the Yugoslavia
crisis on Greece's tourism, which each year can earn 6.3 billion
U.S. dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has admitted that the crisis could at
least cost the country around 200 billion drachmas (about 666
million U.S. dollars) and reduce Greece's economic growth by 0.5
percent.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder here today, emphasized that an
immediate halt to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is the major
precondition for getting the Kosovo negotiations back on track,
and remarked that, "There can never be peace with gunfire."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that any political settlement projects need to be
agreed to by Yugoslavia and that this is the Chinese government's
stand.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder expressed profound regret over the NATO missile
attack on the Chinese embassy and said, "As a member state of NATO
and one of the countries that bear responsibility for the attack,
Germany holds that NATO should apologize to the Chinese government
and people unconditionally." The Chinese government's demand for
an investigation is reasonable, he said.
</P>
<P>
People are on the verge of a new millennium, Jiang said, and
two world wars in the 20th century brought human beings
unprecedented calamities and enormous troubles. After World War II,
he said, the Germans stuck to a path of peaceful development and
this was an important factor for Germany's economic success.

 Chinese Premier Meets With German Chancellor
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji, in a meeting with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder here today, explained China's position on the Kosovo
issue and the Nato attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has noticed Schroeder's shock and worry about
the missile attack.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder explained the statement of the foreign ministers of
the seven industrialized nations and Russia last week and
reiterated that the Kosovo matter has been further complicated by
the attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
A political solution must be worked out as soon as possible
because there's no other choice, he said, expressing the hope
China would play a role in solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will maintain its policy towards
China and pursue the "One China" policy and develop bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
A political solution to the Kosovo issue can only be discussed
when NATO halts the bombing of Yugoslavia, Zhu said, and discussed
China's stand on the issue and on NATO's attack of the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
"We always hold that the Kosovo issue is an internal affair of
Yugoslavia," he said, and that, "conflicts between different
ethnic groups and different religions, which have long troubled
Yugoslavia, are so complicated that only peaceful means can be
used for a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China has consistently advocated a
peaceful settlement of the issue and objected to NATO's use of
force. It has also warned that external military interference will
not help resolve the issue but will only make things more
complicated, he said, and called the use of force extremely
dangerous.

Schroeder Expresses Unconditional Apology for Attack on
Chinese Embassy
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed here today an
unconditional apology for the missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, on behalf of Germany and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said the explanation given by NATO on the tragic incident
until now is far from enough, and the Chinese government has every
reason to demand a comprehensive, thorough and in-depth
investigation into the incident and affix the responsibility for
it.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan today.
</P>
<P>
Tang told Schroeder that the remains of the three Chinese
journalists and the wounded Chinese diplomats were just returned
to Beijing this morning. The wanton bombing against Yugoslavia
conducted by the U.S.-led NATO has caused a tremendous
humanitarian catastrophe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO campaign has gone so far recently as to
attack the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, infringing seriously
upon China's sovereignty and constituting an atrocity rarely seen
in international diplomatic history, Tang noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia aims to achieve
universal primary eduction by 2015, 100 percent of primary health
care service coverage by the year 2017, a rise in life expectancy
to 60 from the current 53 years, according to a human development
report issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Human Development Report -- Ethiopia 1998" issued by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) said that Ethiopia has
an ambitious human development program of the 20-year period
running up to the year 2017.
</P>
<P>
The report also sets a decline in infant mortality rate from
the current 115 to 50 per 1,000 live births, a decline in maternal
mortality rate from current 600 to 300 per 100,000 live births,
and a rise in immunization coverage to 90 percent by the end of
the period.
</P>
<P>
The overall performance of the economy will reach on the
average a six percent sustainable annual growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Christian Lehembre, deputy
Resident UNDP Representative, said at all levels of development
the three essential capabilities for human development are for
people to lead long and healthy lives, to be knowledge and to have
access to the resources needed for a decent standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Lehembre said the report calculates, for the first time at the
national level, the gender development index and the gender
empowerment measure, which captures respectively the gender
inequality within the human development index and indicates the
extent of women participation in political decision-making and
their empowerment.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the important role of private sector in human
development, saying that "the private sector can play a vital role
in enhancing human development and participate in the national
development of Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted "Global Human Development Report" of the UNDP
as saying that in 1997, Ethiopia was placed at the 170th position
from 175 countries and regions on the basis of the 1994 human
development index values.

PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac left
here Wednesday afternoon for Moscow for a one-day visit to Russia,
soon after Russian President Boris Yeltsin sacked his prime
minister, Yevgeni Primakov.
</P>
<P>
But the focus of Chirac's visit is the crisis in Yugoslavia, as
France wishes to seek Russian support to an eventual United
Nations resolution on this conflict.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia have insisted that NATO must stop bombing
Yugoslavia, before a political solution could become possible.

Chirac will meet with Yeltsin and his envoy for the Balkans,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, before giving a press conference at the
French embassy in Moscow, said officials of the French
presidential palace.

In a reaction to the sacking of Primakov by Yeltsin, French

Vedrine also said that he is convinced that Russia will
continue to participate in the search for a political solution to

<HEADLINE> UAE President Meets Bahraini Emir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan Wednesday met
with visiting Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa on
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways of strengthening bilateral
ties, enhancing joint action in dealing with Arab and
international issues, the official WAM news agency reported. But
it did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamad said Tuesday upon his arrival that the purpose
of his visit to the UAE was to bolster the collective action and
cooperation among member states of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
which groups Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, UAE and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit was also to affirm Bahrain's commitment to
further strengthening the deep-rooted relations between the two
countries in line with the policy of the late Emir Sheikh Isa bin
Sulman Al Khalifa of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Hamad was sworn in following his father's sudden death of a
heart attack on March 6.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here after attending an informal meeting of the GCC
leaders in Saudi Arabia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, which were attended by heads of states or
their representatives of the GCC member states, discussed recent
rapprochement of Gulf countries with Iran and the dispute between
the UAE and Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz visited
Iran last week, his first since Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution. The two former foes agreed to exchange military
attaches.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and the GCC improved after the 1997 election
of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who called for better ties
with Gulf neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But the UAE is not happy about the fast pace in improving ties
with Tehran, with whom it has a dispute over the islands of Abu
Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Election Preparations Hit Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's preparations for
next year's general election have hit a snag following a dispute
over the type of electoral model, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Political Authority, established in December last
year to prepare for a fresh general election, has announced April
8, 2000 as the provisional date for the election.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance Wednesday announced it favored the 100
percent proportional representation model as the best electoral
system suited for the country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy, however, proposed a
mixture of the proportional representation and the old
first-past-the-post system, used since independence more than 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
An IPA statement released at a press conference in Maseru said
the group of seven opposition parties reached the decision on a
proposed new system after five months of deliberations in IPA
committees and plenary sessions.
</P>
<P>
The IPA is trying to review the country's electoral system
according to its mandate.
</P>
<P>
Polls were held last May in which the ruling party won a
landslide victory, winning 79 of the 80 seats in the National
Assembly. The opposition parties accused the ruling party of fraud
and refused to accept the results.
</P>
<P>
The dispute sparked widespread unrest in Maseru and finally led
to the military intervention by South African and Botswana troops
in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the Southern African Development
Community, the Lesotho government and the opposition agreed to
hold new elections within 15 to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Romania Supports Bizonal Federation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian senior official
reiterated Wednesday that Romania supports a bizonal, bicommunal
federation on the Cyprus island.
</P>
<P>
Ghiorghi Prisacaru, chairman of the Standing Committee for
Foreign Policy in the Romanian Senate made the remarks after
his meeting with Cypriot Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Prisacaru said his country's parliament fully agrees to the
Cyprus' parliament on Cyprus issue and the situation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Yugoslavia, Prisacaru noted that a resolution
had been passed by the Romanian parliament, calling for an end to
NATO bombings against the country and for negotiations aimed at a
peaceful solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the stance of the Romanian parliament on oil
embargo against Yugoslavia, he said the Romanian government had
agreed with it, but it has not been discussed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
"If you would like a personal view, I believe embargoes have
never had any results because they do not aim at the leaders but
at the people," Prisacaru pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kyprianou said the parliaments of Cyprus and
Romania hold the same views on the Yugoslav issue and stressed
that "the problem can not be solved by the use of force" and that
"a peaceful solution should be found."

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Be United on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Third vice Chairman of the OAU commission on refugees and
displaced persons, Igodoe Assane, said on Wednesday that there was
need for African countries to show solidarity among themselves
over the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Assane made the remark on the occasion at which OAU gave Zambia
75,000 U. S. dollars to help it with the refugees from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, Valentine Kayope said Zambia
has shown a spirit of solidarity by taking in the refugees from
the DRC which should be followed by all countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kayope said the impact of the on-going conflict in the
DRC had opened the flood gates and a total of 27,648 refugees have
sought sanctuary in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to cope with the problem, transit centers have
been established in Kaputa, Nchelenge and Mpulungu, all in
Northern Province, which can accommodate 35,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kayope added Zambia has shouldered the burden of refugees on
behalf of the international community at a great cost.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Journalists Condemn NATO's Atrocity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A former senior editor of a
newspaper in Cambodia Wednesday strongly condemned the U.S.-led
NATO missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, saying it
is a flagrant infringement of China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The ex-senior editor, who declined to be further identified,
told Xinhua that he was very angry to hear the news that three
Chinese journalists were killed and more than 20 diplomats were
wounded in the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
"It is a flagrant infringement of China's sovereignty and
dignity and an open provocation to the 1.2 billion Chinese
people," he denounced.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old man stressed that "the U.S. and its like called
the missile attack 'a mistake.' Who will believe it? It can not
deceive anyone but only to completely unmask its hideous face of
hegemony or power politics."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and the people are fully justified in
making strong reaction to NATO's barbaric act," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO must meet the four demands put forward by
the Chinese government." Otherwise, he pointed out, "whoever plays
with the fire will perish by the fire."
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, many Cambodian journalists have also
expressed their deep shock at and sympathy over the death of three
Chinese journalists, including a Xinhua female correspondent.
</P>
<P>
They denounced the U.S. for brutally trampling on international
law. "The bloody incident brought home to me the hypocrisy of the
U.S.," a journalist said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO launched the missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia at midnight Friday, killing three
journalists and injuring more than 20 diplomatic staff.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers to Meet for DRC Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We expect very soon, or at least before the end of this month
that ministers of foreign affairs and defense to meet to prepare a
ground for a summit of heads of state. And we think we can make
headway," Chiluba told reporters shortly after a consultation with
Mozambican and Tanzanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The consultation talks, lasting nearly four hours at the State
House, have been a continuation of efforts to accelerate peace
process in the vast central African nation, said Chiluba, the
peace mediator of DRC crisis nominated by the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The closed-door talks were joined by Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa, the host, Mozambican President Joachim Chissano,
who also came for a working visit, as well as Tanzanian former
President Julius Nyerere, a veteran African statesman.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique "appreciate
tremendously the efforts" made in the five-country summit in Libya
last month.
</P>
<P>
He described the Libya summit as a "very significant
contribution" to last October's Lusaka meeting at which 14 African
countries adopted in principle a draft ceasefire agreement for DRC
war.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the peace process," said Chiluba, spokesman
for Wednesday's talks. Standing by him were the presidents of
Tanzania and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to do everything to get a cease-fire agreement
signed and that's what we'll stop the fighting," Chiluba said,
adding that "We are against fighting."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out African countries in the DRC war have been
"wasting resources instead of investing in development."
</P>
<P>
On the position of Rwanda, a key player in the war backing
rebels, Chiluba said, "Rwanda like all the countries are very
geared... they are ready to come with other states and all other
stakeholders... to sit down and signed an agreement."
</P>
<P>
"They haven't said 'No'. They are ready to meet with all of us
to finish their job," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda have been fighting to topple
the government of President Laurent Kabila since last August in
the DRC, the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops
to help Kabila to repulse the attacks of rebels who have so far
controlled more than 50 percent of the mineral-rich country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which has remained neutral in the DRC conflict, has
been pressed by other African countries to broker peace in the
nine-month war.
</P>
<P>
In late April, Uganda and Chad announced that they will stop
fighting. But other key players in the war, like Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia, have yet agreed to a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Eric Silwamba, Zambia's Minister for Presidential Affairs, told
 reporters here later that the three countries are actually "very
committed" to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
But he said the difficulties facing peace talks have been the
"security concerns" of some countries involved in the war and "the
modalities to implement the cease fire."
</P>
<P>
Silwamba revealed that the meeting of African foreign and
defense ministers for DRC peace process will be held in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to give the date. "It's almost there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said DRC government and rebels will
meet in Nairobi, Kenya for a national debt on reforms of the
constitution, among others.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up Human Rights Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to set up a separate human rights institute in the
country, the national official news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed human rights institute will sensitize and educate
law enforcing agency personnel, particularly members of the police
force on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
It will also educate and impart training to human rights
activists, government officials, magistrates and members of the
other professions about human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up a human rights institute is a
significant move by the government in the backdrop of steps taken
by the government to establish an independent national human
rights commission in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program has agreed in principle
to provide financial support to the establishment of the
institute, the report said.

KAMPALA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Wednesday urged people living in the northern districts of Gulu
and Kitgum to consolidate constitutional governance in order to
ensure permanent peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing a public rally in Kitgum
district, a press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the people there have suffered mainly
because of lack of respect for constitutionalism which began in
1966 when former President Apollo Milton Obote abrogated the 1962
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president noted the government's peace program for the
region has involved fighting and capturing the rebels there,
rescuing captives from the rebels and building roads along the
border.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to strengthen the army in the region to restore peace
to the two districts which are often subject to attacks from the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is currently on an inspection tour of
northern Uganda, also pledged to support the people economically
and to improve the educational facilities there.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Drops Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate fell
insignificantly by 0.1 percentage point to 52.7 percent last month
from the previous level of 52.8 percent, the Central Statistical
Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly report, the statistical office said the
inflation rate of 52.7 percent reflected one of the highest
increases in the history of price increases in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained a serious problem to both households and
businesses, it said.
</P>
<P>
Food inflation, which stood at 55.5 percent in January, went up
to 65.7 percent in February and declined to 60.9 percent in March
and eventually settled at 60.2 percent in April, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce,
John Makamure has forecasted that the inflation rate would rise to
around 55 percent if the foreign currency exchange rate remained
at current levels.

<HEADLINE> Romania Loses 803 Million Dollars Due to Yugoslavia's War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The current losses in Romania's
economy because of NATO's intervention in Yugoslav amount to
802.9 million U.S. dollars, the official Rompres news agency
reported on Wednesday citing sources of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, commercial exchanges with
Yugoslavia, are entirely affected. Romania's exports to
Yugoslavia, 119 million U.S. dollars in 1998, mostly cover
ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgic products, oil products as well
as products of the machine building industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the failure in carrying out significant
imports of raw material, fuel, metals, chemical raw materials,
ores from Yugoslavia affected the Romanian industrial output for
the domestic use and the exports to third markets.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the war in Yugoslavia, commercial exchanges with
ex-Yugoslav countries are also affected. They amounted to 136.4
million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian product exports to Hungary, Austria and Germany,
whose transportation has been carried out on the Danube, is
diminished by 300 million U.S. dollars. If the merchandise
delivery will not be carried out on a river, the cost of
merchandise transportation on a railroad is 4-5 times higher than
on the Danube. This is going to be detrimental to the Romanian
products because they will not be delivered to the markets in
Austria and Germany, being not competitive anymore.
</P>
<P>
A number of 16 Romanian companies register losses of 107
million U.S. dollars. The biggest losses can be found in the
Oltenita Ship Yard - 48.5 million U.S. dollars, Electroputere
Craiova - 13 million U.S. dollars, the Constanta Ship Yard - 11.5
million U.S. dollars, the National Oil Company Petrom - 10.2
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport is mostly losing because of NATO's
intervention in Yugoslavia. Its losses amount to 48.5 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Rwandan Army Officer in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Wednesday failed to
decide whether to extradite Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former Rwandan
army officer who were charged with genocide, to Rwanda or Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam-based Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court
failed to hear the extradition case because the accused claimed
that he has language problem in communication.
</P>
<P>
The court has found Ntuyahaga an interpreter who speaks both
Rwandan and Kiswahili languages, while the accused said he needs
an interpreter who speaks English, French and Rwandan languages.
</P>
<P>
The language problem made the court unable to conduct normal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus Rugazia
adjourned the case until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The court asked the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation to find an interpreter who could speak
languages demanded by the accused.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, who allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium soldiers in the 1994 Rwandan
genocide, is wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for extradition and
trial.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have filed applications requesting the Tanzanian
 government to hand over the accused to their countries for trial.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government said that it will abide by court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, was handed to Tanzania on March 29 this year
after the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based
in Arusha, north Tanzania, dropped charges of genocide and crimes
against humanity against him and set him free.
</P>
<P>
The accused, however, was rearrested shortly after he was
released. The Tanzanian police caught him in the name of illegal
entry into the country as he came into the country without going
through immigration procedures.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missile Attack on Chinese Embassy Condemned in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Political parties and various groups
of Greece Wednesday strongly condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and expressing sympathy for the
Chinese victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to the Chinese Communist Party, the
Communist Party of Greece (KKE) described NATO's missile attack on
the Chinese embassy as not an accident, but a premeditated one,
saying that the KKE condemned such barbarous acts, which violated
the international law and the norms of the international
relations.
</P>
<P>
The bombing incident was a symbol of expansionism of the United
States and NATO, the party said.
</P>
<P>
In a press communique issued Wednesday, the Coalition of the
Left slammed NATO's attack as "war crimes", saying that the
alliance's acts undermined the world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Journalists' Union of the Athens Daily Newspapers said in a
press release that the organization condemned NATO's bombing of
the Chinese embassy and called for an immediate end to NATO's
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Chinese Friendship Association said in a statement
that being shocked and indignated by the barbaric action against
the Chinese embassy, they expressed deepest condolences to the
Chinese government as well as to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The Greek people from the very beginning of NATO's bombing in
Yugoslavia has been strongly opposed to this kind of war and
supported wholeheartedly a peaceful solution, the association
said.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Chinese Center for Research and Development said that
the barbarous bombardment by NATO of the Chinese embassy did not
serve the purpose of peace.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Overseas Chinese in Greece Wednesday also
said in a statement that on behalf of all the Chinese residents in
Greece, they strongly condemned NATO's brutal action and urged
NATO to stop immediately its military operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Accusing NATO of trampling on the human rights of ordinary
people, the association said that NATO was destabilizing the
Balkan region and the world as a whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The official observance of
the International Day of Families, which falls on May 15, is
expected to take place at the U.N. headquarters on Thursday, U.N.
officials said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the 1999 observance, "Families for All Ages," was
suggested in the context of the International Year of Older
Persons, and provides the opportunity to celebrate the
contribution of older persons to families and societies, and to
highlight their role and the intergenerational dimensions of
families in the context of demographic aging.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan First Lady Marisabel Rodriguez de Chavez, who is
also president of the non-governmental speaker at the event, will
be the keynote speaker at the ceremony, sponsored by the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the Department of
Public Information and the New York NGO Committee on the Family.
</P>
<P>
The International Day of Families was proclaimed by a General
Assembly resolution on September 20, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Didier Opertti, president of the 53rd General Assembly, and
Nitin Desai, U.N. under-secretary-general for economic and social
affairs, are expected to attend the ceremony, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Output Expected Up by 60% in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production is
expected to jump by about 60 percent to 75,000 tons in 1999/2000
from 47,000 in 1998/99, the Coffee Board of Kenya said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Board spokesman Paul Kivila said the crop would increase due to
good weather in the past few months after drought in 1998 and
destructive heavy El Nino rains in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Production will rise to 75,000 tons in 1999/2000 and it could
be more," Kivila said. "The rains have been very useful and the
crop is looking up right now."
</P>
<P>
But the good news on production was tempered by rather low
global prices, senior commodity analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's coffee production has been down in the past few years,
reaching a floor of 47,000 tons this crop season. The rains of
1997 and last year's drought have been blamed for the fall.
</P>
<P>
Crop analysts also cite poor management of the sector,
resulting in widespread low morale among the small growers who
produce half of Kenya's coffee.
</P>
<P>
But Kivila suggested that farmers were relatively pleased with
how the sector was run and their efforts, helped by improved
weather, would be reflected in the 1999/2000 crop. Kenyan
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi has said that he will
probably license the coffee board only as a marketing agency and
hand its regulatory role to a yet-to-be-formed Kenya Coffee
Authority as part of his ministry's drive to streamline the
sector.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Progress on Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- All 15 members of the U.N.
Security Council Wednesday welcomed the acceptance by Morocco and
the Polisario Front of revised arrangements for completing the
identification of voters, and an appeals process, which paves the
way for a referendum on the future of Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon, said, "The members
of the Security Council welcomed the formal acceptance by the two
parties of the package of measures on the identification and
appeals Protocols."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council called on the parties to
cooperate fully" with the U.N. mission, known as MINURSO, in
implementing all these modalities, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council reiterated their support to the
Secretary-General for his tireless efforts and encouraged him to
continue on that course," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, originally slated for January 1992, is designed
to decide whether the former Spanish colony should be incorporated
into Morocco, which controls most of the phosphate-rich territory,
or become independent, as called for by the Algeria-based
Polisario.
</P>
<P>
A U.N.-monitored ceasefire between the two sides has been in
force since September 1991 but the vote has been repeatedly
postponed because of differences over who should be eligible to
vote, with Morocco and Polisario accusing each other of trying to
manipulate the electoral rolls.
</P>
<P>
By late last year more than 147,000 voters had been registered
but problems arose over three disputed tribal groupings. The
latest target date for the referendum is now the end of July 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretariat briefed Security Council members on recent
developments during closed-door consultations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Council president Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon later told
reporters that members "welcomed the formal acceptance by the two
parties of the package of measures on the identification and
appeals protocols."
</P>
<P>
They called on the parties to cooperate fully with the
250-member U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) in implementing those arrangements, he said.
</P>
<P>
MINURSO's latest mandate, which was only for two weeks, to
enable the council to keep a close watch on developments, expires
on Friday and will have to be renewed by then.

<HEADLINE> Firing of Russian PM and Resignation of Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 12 (Xinhua) - Europe's markets were hit Wednesday by
the shock sacking of Russia's Prime Minister and the resignation
of the US Treasury Secretary.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 closed down 35 points at 6343.1, a drop of
0.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
But much of this fall was accounted for by the weakness of its
two heavy-weight oil stocks, which lost ground as the oil price
slipped 43 cents to 15.53 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the clutch of disappointing earnings figures from
British companies were of greater concern than Rubin's departure.
</P>
<P>
The release of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report
failed to lift London's mood despite forecasts of a
faster-than-expected recovery for the economy.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically traded Xetra DAX closed down 48.25
points, or 0.91 percent, at 5249.24 points. The floor DAX was
little changed at 5248.02.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris bucked the trend and staged a late rally to
finish just in the black amid strong buying of some selected blue
chips.
</P>
<P>
The leading index finished up almost 5 points at 4354.79, a
rise of 0.11 percent. Total volume was a modest 2.2 billion euros.

NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Indian

ATHENS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis and visiting Bundestag Speaker Wolfgang Thierse
Thursday called for a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis
while expressing their opposition to the ongoing NATO bombing in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Kaklamanis said that Greece

military means because it would have catastrophic repercussions
for the entire Balkan region, the semi-official Athens News Agency

<P>
Hopes for a peaceful settlement which were recently boosted by
the G8 draft agreement now appeared to be waning, Kaklamanis said,
adding that this was a fact of grave concern to the Greek people.
</P>
<P>
Describing the war in Yugoslavia as "a defeat for European
policy," Thierse urged the European Union (EU) to adopt a common
foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis and Thierse also stressed the need for the safe
return of refugees to their homes, preventing any spread of the
conflict to neighboring countries and international assistance in
rebuilding the region.

<P>
BERLIN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Serena Williams turned out to be
stronger in a battle between new generation of players as she
powered past compatriot Jennifer Capriati in straight sets
Thursday to march into the third round of the German Open.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 17, rolled to a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 victory over the 23-
year-old Capriati who once again couldn't survive beyond the final
16 of a tournament this season.
</P>
<P>
Williams's power proved too much for the former Olympic
champion as she jumped to a 4-0 lead in the second set. Capriati's
attempts to match power often ended with her shots sailing long.
</P>
<P>
Capriati then began to slam some winners, closing to 4-2, but
Williams held two service games easily. She blasted two aces and
claimed her first match point when Capriati backhanded a return.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Steffi Graf also advanced but take a different
route as she struggled to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win against Zimbabwe's
Cara Black.
</P>
<P>
Graf, coming back from a three-week injury layoff, needed more
than an hour just to grab the first set against the talented 20-
year-old Black.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, before the new generation of players emerged,
Graf usually swept aside early round opponents in less than an
hour.

In other actions, No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario ousted fellow
Spaniard and defending champion, Conchita Martinez, 6-1, 0-6, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wheat Production Estimated at 18.6 Mln Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's wheat production in
the current fiscal year ending June 30 has been estimated at 18.6
million tons as against the target of 19 million tons, official
sources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Food and Agriculture estimated that wheat
production in Punjab province would be about 13.8 million tons
against the target of 14 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Output in Sindh province was estimated at 2.7 million tons
against the target of 2.6 million tons, in North West Frontier
Province at 1.3 million tons against the target of 1.4 million
tons and in Balochistan province at 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the main reason for failing to meet the target
included long dry weather and the low support price of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's consumption of wheat is about 16.1 million tons but
the total wheat requirement stands at about 20.1 million tons, as
the country needs about four million tons for Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir, defense, the Northern Areas, seeds and animals and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that if the wheat support price is not
increased immediately, it would become difficult for the federal
government to achieve the target in 1999-2000 starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
The government may set a target of 20 million tons of
indigenous wheat production for 1999-2000, four percent higher
than the target of the current year, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
They said the Ministry of Food and Agriculture had sent a
summary to the cabinet asking to increase the support price from
240 rupees (5.21 U.S. dollars) per 40 kilograms to 300 rupees
(6.52 dollars).

<HEADLINE> 8 Lebanese Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- At least eight Lebanese were killed
and another was wounded Thursday in south Lebanon, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese civilians were killed when rockets unleashed by
Israeli warplanes hit their house in the village of Majdal Silim,
north of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
Another villager was injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Lebanese woman was killed in Israeli
shelling on the village of Houla in the central sector of the
border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli assaults came as a retaliation for overnight
attacks by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on its two
positions inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a roadside bomb was detonated on a
road in Jezzine, just north of the border zone, when a car passed
by.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed the driver, who is reported to be a militiaman
of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army(SLA), and his wife, child
and his two female relatives.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but
Hezbollah guerrillas always staged such attacks on SLA members in
Jezzone in the past.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Protest Against NATO's Attack on China Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 demonstrators from
different walks of life in Nepal Thursday protested against the
U.S.-led NATO's war on Yugoslavia and the "unwarranted and
provocative bombing" of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In front of the U.S. Embassy here, they shouted slogans like
"Down With American Imperialism," "We Condemn the Bombing of the
Chinese Embassy" and "NATO, U.S., Stop Bombing."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held posters which read "We Condemn Missile
Attack on Chinese Embassy," "U.S. and NATO, Greatest Evil of the
World" and "U.S. and NATO, Stop War in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
They handed over a letter addressed to U.S. President Bill
Clinton to the U.S. embassy. The letter was signed by 132 persons
including professors, party workers, teachers, journalists,
students, writers and representatives of non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We, the undersigned, representing and supporting a much larger
body of people from Nepal, are here to express our vehement
protest against the war being waged by you and your NATO allies
against the government and people of Yugoslavia, including the
Kosovar people," the letter read.
</P>
<P>
"We also strongly protest against the absolutely unwarranted
and provocative bombing of the Embassy of the People's Republic of
China in Belgrade," the letter stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the war you are waging is, in the first
instance, barbaric and inhuman," the letter observed. "The war
also flagrantly violates the Charter of the United Nations and
irremediably diminishes it."
</P>
<P>
"It usurps the rights of the United Nations General Assembly
and Security Council and instead foists the war-making NATO
oligarchy as the overlord of all peoples of the world," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the war goes against all other relevant
international laws, conventions and norms and it utterly violates
the sovereignty of the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
"Symbolically, it expresses contempt for all those peoples and
cultures who/which cannot, or do not wish to, bomb out innocent
human beings and their creations. The war celebrates brute force,
not peace and democracy," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Thursday marked the 50th day of the ceaseless and
murderous NATO war campaign against the people of Yugoslavia. "On
this day, we again warn you to desist from any further bombing in
Yugoslavia. Continuation of the bombing campaign, at the very
least, will decisively isolate the U.S. and other NATO countries
from public opinion in Nepal and in the world as a whole," It
warned.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think we need to remind you that the eventual costs
the U.S. and NATO may be called upon to bear may be much larger,"
the letter added.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Xinhua, Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the National
Anti-Imperialist Front, Nepal which organized the protest rally,
said that "we feel that the U.S. is working just like
international police."
</P>
<P>
He denounced NATO's missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade as "provocative and barbaric." "We feel it's not simply a
technical error on their part, but it's a provocative attack," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the protest rally was just the beginning of a series of
programs to be organized by his organization, which "represents
all the progressive anti-imperialist forces of Nepal."

<HEADLINE> Anti-War Sentiments Prevail in German Greens Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua)-- An anti-war mood prevailed during the
German Greens Party's special congress on Kosovo Thursday in the
northern city of Bielefeld, where several hundred protesters held
an anti-NATO rally outside the congress venue.
</P>
<P>
The party's left wing submitted a draft calling for an
immediate end to NATO's air war against Yugoslavia. A more
moderate resolution formulated by the party leadership also
demanded a 48-hour halt to air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The congress was expected to decide the future of Greens'
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who has said he would quit the
party if it could not support Bonn's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, a tough advocate of NATO's air strikes, said he had
done everything in his power to avert the war.
</P>
<P>
When the delegates were debating, a demonstrator rushed into
the congress venue and threw a paint bottle on Fischer's face. The
minister was later sent to hospital with minor injures.
</P>
<P>
A Wednesday poll among the delegates showed an overwhelming
majority among the Greens' members were against Bonn's
participation in the NATO war.
</P>
<P>
Whistles, boos, shouts and anti-NATO slogans were heard when
Fischer gave a speech defending his policy on the Kosovo crisis.
Left wing critics called Fischer a "war monger" and demanded his
resignation.

<HEADLINE> Six Chinese Get Death Sentence For Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Five courts in south China's
Guangdong Province sentenced six people who were found guilty of
smuggling and bribery to death on Wednesday and deprived them of
political rights for life.
</P>
<P>
The case is regarded as the biggest smuggling case since the
founding of the People's Republic of China 50 years ago. An
investigation revealed that four people from Hong Kong and three
from the mainland had cooperated in smuggling large amount of cars,
steel products, and diesel oil into China by bribing customs
officials and falsifying documents to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
The persons who got the death sentence included Cao Xiukang,
the head of customs in the Guangdong city of Zhanjiang, and Zhu
Xiangcheng, the head of Zhanjiang's customs inspection section.
Cao was convicted of taking 2.4 million yuan (289,000 U.S. dollars)
in bribes and Zhu was found guilty of taking 2.8 million yuan to
turn a blind eye to the smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five other persons involved in the case were given
various sentences. The most severe were for eight who were given
death sentences with two years probation. They included Chen
Tongqing, the secretary of Zhanjiang city Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, Vice-mayor Yang Quqing, and the city's border
police chief, Deng Ye.

<HEADLINE> India's Software Exports Rise 84 Percent in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- India's software exports in
1998-99 registered an 84 percent growth, surpassing the three
billion U.S. dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in India's exports of software and services
last year was mainly attributed to the year 2000 opportunity and
through new markets the world over, said Director of Electronics
and Software Export Promotion Council R. H. Naqvi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth was 66 percent in U.S. dollar terms with total
exports reaching 3.01 billion U.S. dollars as compared with 1.81
billion U.S. dollars in 1997-98, he said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in computer software and services exports could also be
attributed to reduction of international telecom and leased line
tariff, he said.
</P>
<P>
The council anticipated an increased challenge to Indian
software exporters from their Chinese counterparts as China would
emerge as a major player in the world market in another two years,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Presidential Election May Clear Way for Political Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi's election as Italy's 10th post-war president
Thursday may pave the way for a revitalized season of reforms,
said Italian senators and deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House floor leader for D'Alema's Democratic Left,
Fabio Mussi, said,"We will immediately grab the initiative to
start up the engine and bring it up to power to re-launch reforms.
"
</P>
<P>
Mussi said before the voting that the election of Ciampi would
have great "institutional value" in clearing the way for coalition
dealings with the opposition to "achieve the nucleus of essential
reforms before the end of the legislature."
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Ciampi was elected by the Italian "grand
electors" as the successor of the current president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, and will hold this ceremonial and honorable position for
7 years.
</P>
<P>
Italian opposition party leader Silvio Berlusconi said that the
political reforms, following Thursday's vote, could be attacked "
by degrees, beginning with the direct election of the president."
</P>
<P>
His chief ally, Gianfranco Fini, the head of the post-fascist
National Alliance, said," The election of the president is an
important political event, for achieving reforms, the political
climate had to change and the vote for Ciampi for the president
certainly changes the Italian political climate."
</P>
<P>
More cautiously, Fini added that "it's not been said that the
reforms will automatically take off. At least, in the meantime the
one for the direct election of the head of state has been put on
the Lower House calendar."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The soaring energy costs pushed
the producer prices up 0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department
said thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rise in the Department's Producer Price
Index for finished goods brought the annual rate of inflation at
the wholesale level to 1.1 percent so far in 1999. There was a
smaller 0.2 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
producer prices increased only a mild 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Economists worry that inflation could become a danger if U.S.
consumers, secure in their jobs, continue to spend briskly as
price-containing pressures caused by recent low demand for U.S.
products overseas begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
In April, energy prices rose 5.1 percent, the most in nearly
nine years. Gasoline prices posted the largest gain, an
unprecedented 29.1 percent rise, breaking the record set in
January 1990, during the Persian Gulf crisis. Fuel oil prices
jumped 14.3 percent, the most in five years.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been expecting energy prices to rise because,
after global economic turmoil pulled them down sharply last year,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed this
Spring to limit production.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell 0.9 percent in April. Fish prices dropped 7.1
percent, the most in five years, after rising sharply in March.
Dairy, egg and pork prices also fell.
</P>
<P>
That helped offset a 15.8 percent increase in vegetable prices,
led by a huge 85.5 percent increase in the cost of lettuce. The
cost of fresh fruit also rose, by 0.9 percent, with citrus fruits
leading the way as Florida suffers Droughts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, competition from low priced imports flooding
into the United States from economically distressed countries is
keeping most prices here low.
</P>
<P>
In April, for example, the cost of computers fell 3.9 percent,
prices for children's clothing fell 0.8 percent and home
electronic equipment prices fell 0.1 percent.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated Thursday that Moscow will reconsider its stance on the
Kosovo issue if NATO continues its air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the statement during his talks with visiting
French President Jacques Chirac, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told
reporters after the two presidents' meeting in the Kremlin.

<P>
There were major differences between the two sides but Yeltsin
and Chirac agreed to set up a joint working group to tackle the
differences.

the U.N. Security Council should be strengthened in reinforcing
world and European security.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Guangming Daily Mourns Journalist Martyrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- On a desk in Guangming Daily's
International News Department, where Xu Xinghu used to write news
stories, is a red ribbon with the words of seven young reporters
from China Teenagers Daily: "To our heroes who have devoted their
lives to justice."
</P>
<P>
At Guangming Daily's gate, people gathered without arrangement
Wednesday afternoon, waiting to pay their last respects to Xu and
his 28-year-old wife Zhu Ying and many flower arrangements were
taken into a mourning hall. At 4:30 p.m., their colleagues and
friends entered the mourning hall one by one with white paper
flowers on their chests and red roses in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's father Zhu Fulai wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton,
asking him to try to imagine what a father will feel like being
deprived of his only daughter by a brutal bombing. Zhu loved
babies and dreamed of becoming a mother when she returned home.
The bombing destroyed this dream on the eve of the Mother Day.
</P>
<P>
"Let me have another look at my poor babies. I just want to
stay longer with them, they are home now!" Zhu's mother Guo Guiqi
said as she touched the boxes of ashes with her trembling hands.
</P>
<P>
Xu sent a series of battlefield diaries from Yugoslavia of more
than 30,000 characters and his last diary appeared in Guangming
Daily on May 8, when the news of his death came. Phone calls and
telegraphs poured in from around the nation expressing anger over
the deaths of the two reporters. An old lady sobbed over the phone,
saying she was a fan of Xu's wartime diaries, according to Liu Xin,
Xu's colleague at Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
Wei Luming, Zhu Ying's colleague in the advertising department,
wept like a child when he heard the news on May 8 and said that he
just simply wanted to forget about it as if it were an April
Fool's joke. He and his daughter had just sent an E-mail to Zhu
and the girl asked: "Aunt Zhu, are you okay? Is it scary there?"
</P>
<P>
Wu Yun, a long-time co-worker of Xu's on night shift, says that,
whenever the shift ended, Xu would drive her home and would not
leave until he saw the lights in Wu's flat come on.
</P>
<P>
"He will always remind me of light, and his war-time diaries
just lit a light in the dark shadows of war," commented Hu Meng,
another colleague.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy Condemned in Auckland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 Overseas
Chinese and Chinese students and scholars in Auckland, the biggest
city of New Zealand, held a protest march and a rally Thursday,
strongly condemning the U.S.-led NATO's barbaric bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
During the protest, organized by the Chinese Associations New
Zealand, demonstrators marched through the downtown to the U.S.
Consulate General, singing China's National Anthem and shouting
slogans: "Down with hegemony," "NATO killer," "Stop the bombing"
and "Punish the murderers." to express their utmost angry at the
U.S.-led NATO's brutal attack on the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate General
and held a rally. They observed three minutes' silence to mourn
the death of the three Chinese journalists, and burned mini U.S.
national flags.
</P>
<P>
A protest letter was read at the rally, strongly condemning the
U.S.-led NATO for severely violating human rights and the basic
norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that NATO and the United States allow a United
Nations special committee to carry out a complete and thorough
investigation of their missile attack on the Chinese Embassy. The
letter also demanded the trial of those responsible for the attack
in an international criminal court and an immediate end to the
bloody military operation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The letter also called for peaceful means to solve the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the demonstrators went into the building and
handed the protest letter over to the U.S. Consul General, who
promised to convey it to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
A number of New Zealanders and immigrants from Yugoslavia also
took part in the protest. In their interviews with Xinhua, they
said they wanted to express their strongest condemnation of the
U.S. and its NATO allies' attack on the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous for the U.S. to excuse the criminal act as
an accident. They were definitely on purpose," a 70-year-old New
Zealander said.
</P>
<P>
The protest lasted more than two hours.

<HEADLINE> Honoring The Chinese Embassy Staff, Journalists In Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council held a meeting in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People today to honor the embassy staff and
journalists in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Li Peng, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress.
President Jiang Zemin spoke and Premier Zhu Rongji announced that
the three journalists killed during the Nato attack on the Chinese
embassy will be honored as "revolutionary martyrs" and embassy
staff and journalists working in Yugoslavia will be honored as
well.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, and Li
Lanqing, who said that Jiang's speech demonstrated the Chinese
government's solemn stance, represented the will of the Chinese
people, gave a profound analysis of the present domestic and
international situation, and outlined various tasks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people should earnestly study Jiang's speech, he
said, and put it into practice and turn their indignation over the
US hegemony and feelings for the deceased into actions to
safeguard and invigorate the nation and should try every way to do
a good job and strive to push the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics forward into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese embassy spokesman explained the work of the embassy
and the journalists during the Nato missile attack and said that
they learned a great deal from the experience and through the
baptism by fire that the nation's and the people's interest are
more important than anything else and that it is only when a
country is powerful enough that it can avoid insults and that it
is only by increasing national strength that peace can be
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"We should turn our grievances into strength, cherish the
national stability and development, closely rally around the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core, hold Deng Xiaoping Theory high, invigorate our spirit, work
and study hard, and contribute to the diplomatic work of the new
century and the nation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Procedures of PM Elections in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Under the legislation enacted by
the Israeli Knesset (parliament) in 1992, Israel's prime minister
will be elected directly in national general elections.
</P>
<P>
Under this legislation, Israeli voters will, in the upcoming
national general elections on May 17, cast two separate ballots
simultaneously, one for Knesset members, and the other for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for prime minister may be nominated by a party, or
parties, with at least 10 seats in the outgoing Knesset, or by
50,000 enfranchised persons.
</P>
<P>
The candidate must be a citizen at least 30 years of age, and
must head his/her party's list of candidates for the Knesset. If
the outgoing prime minister has served for seven consecutive
years, he/she can not stand for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The results of the election for prime minister shall be
announced within 14 days from the election day. Upon publication
of the results, the candidate who receives more than half of the
valid votes becomes the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Should no candidate receive more than half of the valid votes, a
run-off election will be held between the two candidates with the
most votes 14 days after the first round of election. In the
return elections, the candidate receiving the larger number of
valid votes will become the prime minister.

in the run-off elections for health reasons, his/her party can
nominate another candidate, no later than 96 hours before the
scheduled elections.
</P>
<P>
In case there is only one candidate for prime minister, in
either round of elections, the votes shall be cast in a
for-or-against form. If the number of valid votes for the
candidate exceeds the unfavorable votes, the candidate is elected.
</P>
<P>
Should no candidate be elected in this voting, new elections
will be held for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Within 45 days of the publication of the election results, the
prime-minister-elected will present his/her list of ministers and
basic policy guidelines before the Knesset pending its confidence.
</P>
<P>
The number of ministers, including the prime minister, may not
exceed 18, nor be less than eight. At least half of the ministers
must be Knesset members, and all must be eligible for Knesset
membership.
</P>
<P>

the Knesset, special elections for prime minister will be held
within 60 days. If the same candidate is elected again and fails
again to present a government within 45 days, he/she can not stand
for election in a third round of elections for the post.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denounces Israeli Decision on Orient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Thursday denounced as an act
of aggression the decision by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to close the offices in the Orient House, the
headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Xinhua, Secretary-General of the Jordanian
Royal Committee for Jerusalem Affairs Abdullah Kanaan said
Netanyahu's election-motivated order to close the Orient House
stands in flagrant contradiction to relevant international
resolutions on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move is null and void and has no legal and
sovereignty bearing on the future of Jerusalem, Kanaan said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman said that Netanyahu tried to make up an
alleged Palestinian threat to the Israeli-occupied parts of
Jerusalem to rally support from Israeli hardliners during the
upcoming May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Kanaan described Netanyahu's policies as
"aggressive, expansionist and Judaization," which contradict
the agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time for Arab and Islamic leaders to meet in an
Arab summit and Islamic summit to discuss the developments
affecting Jerusalem," the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU-China WTO Talks Should Not Be Affected: Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- European Commission Vice-
President Leon Brittan Thursday expressed the hope that the
European Union-China talks on the World Trade Organization (WTO)
would not be affected after the U.S.-led NATO missile attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who arrived here Thursday for a brief visit, told a
press conference he hoped there would not be setbacks in the
scheduled timetable for the talks and the issue be resolved by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions concerning the consequences of the U.S.-
led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy, Brittan said negotiations
"have never been closed," and EU negotiators had been sent to
Beijing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Brittan and Hong Kong's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang signed a customs cooperation agreement between the
Special Administrative Region Government and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the agreement is "extremely important" because it
is the first such agreement signed by Hong Kong after its return
to China in 1997 and demonstrates "Hong Kong is able to, and ready
to sign international agreements," bringing to reality the concept
of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said after the signing ceremony that the agreement would
facilitate exchange of information and coordination between
customs authorities of Hong Kong and the EU to ensure the
effective application of their respective customs legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates the strong commitment of both sides to
enhancing cooperation in customs matters... and underlines the
close economic ties between the HKSAR and the EU," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival, Brittan had meetings with Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa and discussed China-EU relations and the EU-China
negotiations on China's entry to the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Court Declares Strike "Cognizable Offense" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court on Thursday
declared any activity for and against hartal (destructive strike)
as a "cognizable offense" and directed the criminal courts and the
police to act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
A High Court Division pronounced the unprecedented judgment
after a nine-day hearing on the suo moto rule, which the court
issued on February 15 asking the ruling Bangladeshi Awami League
(BAL), the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
and the government to show cause as to why the activities for and
against hartal should not be declared as a "cognizable offense."
</P>
<P>
Suo moto, a legal term, means "acting on its own."
</P>
<P>
The suo moto rule was issued under section 561A of the Criminal
Procedure Code after a 60-hour countrywide hartal was observed
from February 9 to 11 this year at the call of the opposition
parties, including the BNP, the first time in the history of the
country that the highest court issued a suo moto rule on the
hartal issue.
</P>
<P>
The court had also asked BAL General Secretary Zillur Rahman,
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and the government to
explain why police should not be directed to take action
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In their judgment on Thursday, the judges made the rule
"absolute" with observations.
</P>
<P>
The judges observed that "true, hartal, gherao... are the
expressions of dissent against any action of the government or any
authority, but at the same time these have an in-built
potentiality for threatening or disturbing public tranquillity.
These forms of dissent are expected to originate in moral force,
but the line between the cession of moral force and emergence of
criminal force is very thin."
</P>
<P>
If an assembly of five or more persons takes the decision to
observe hartal to be participated by the people at large so that
their common object is to compel others obviously by show of
criminal force to do what they are not legally bound to do, then
the said assembly must be an unlawful assembly punishable under
the Penal Code, they remarked.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the processions or other activities in support of
or to force such hartal shall be unlawful assemblies, they
declared.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, every assembly of five persons or more to protest or
to oppose hartal shall be unlawful, they said, adding that

About the jurisdiction of the Criminal Bench for issuing the

under the inherent power affirmed in the section 561 of the code."
</P>
<P>
The hearing began on May 1 and concluded on May 10 after nine

Hartal is a special political phenomenon in this South Asian
country, where opposition parties frequently call hartals to
oppose the ruling party while the latter adopts anti-hartal
activities, resulting in clashes and bringing almost all economic
activities across the country to a standstill during the shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Canada Stage Protest Against NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 Chinese Canadians,
Overseas Chinese and Chinese students in Montreal city, staged a
demonstration Wednesday against the barbaric attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Carrying large Chinese flags and banners with slogans such as "
Chinese cannot tolerate aggression," the demonstrators stood
outside the front doors of the U.S. Consulate in the city and
chanted "Peace, Peace, Peace," "U.S. stop" and "NATO go home."
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by the Chinese Freemasons, the oldest
organization of Chinese people in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Man Wai Yee, the Chairman of the organization handed over a
protest letter to the U.S. Consul.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Christan Samfat said the Chinese want an official
apology from the United States. He said he wasn't satisfied with
the "phone call President Clinton made" to Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. "What would have happened if it had been the Chinese who
had bombed the American embassy by mistake? A simple excuse by
telephone is not enough. We want a resolution in Congress that it
was wrong."
</P>
<P>
A protester told local reporters that he could not believe the
Chinese Embassy was hit by mistake. He wants a full investigation
to determine why and how the bombing happened.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Supreme Court Stays High Court Judgment on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Bangladesh on
Thursday stayed for two weeks the operation of the High Court
judgment, which was announced earlier in the day and declared pro-
and anti- hartal activities (strike) as a "cognizable offense."
</P>
<P>
The stay order was passed by Appellate Division Judge Bimalendu
Bikash Roy Chowdhury, following a stay petition by Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan, general secretary of the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
A High Court Division issued a suo moto rule relating to hartal
activities in February this year, directing the ruling Bangladeshi
Awami League, the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
and the government to explain why the activities for and against
hartal should not be declared as a "cognizable offense." Suo
moto, a legal term, means "acting on its own."
</P>
<P>
The High Court judges, after nine days of hearing, declared the
judgment Thursday, in which they made the rule "absolute" and
directed the Criminal Courts and the police to act accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Houghton Lists DPR Korea as Biggest Hurdle at Olympic Qualifer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's English manager Bob
Houghton singled out People's Democratic Republic of Korea (DPR
Korea) as the biggest obstacle for Chinese Olympic soccer squad
although the DPR Korean side have been long left cold in
international wildness.
</P>
<P>
China will begin their first-round Olympic qualifying campaign
on May 20 in Hanoi, where China will take on the host side, lowly
Burma and the DPR Korea in the group stage.
</P>
<P>
The Englishman did not think much of the host, the first hurdle
for the Chinese Olympic squad, saying that China, who soundly
thrashed Vietnam 4-1 in the Dunhill Cup International Tournament
early on February, will take the upper-hand in psychology.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese is soccer-crazy, and the host have the homecourt
advantage, but our confidence are boosted by the 4-1 victory." he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Though they made a small change in tactics, we also made some
adjustment accordingly." he added.
</P>
<P>
But the coach turned to be circumspect when referring to DPR
Korea, who he said will cause the biggest trouble for China
despite long-time absence from international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said China cannot afford to ignore the challenge posed
by the mysterious squad who he said was a hot nut in terms of
their aggressiveness and speed.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20-strong DPR Korea Olympic team, 14 players have
participated in the King's Cup tournament early this year where
DPR Korea beat the host and tied with Hungarian under-21 side.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, who ever said his youth side was among the best in
Asia, held a rosy picture for the group stage competition.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Chinese youth could gave a normal display, they
will have no problem beating the DPR Korean side." said the coach
who have guided the Olympic squad to bronze medal at last year's
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said that his youth side, currently undergoing a
training session at Guangzhou, south China, which is similar to
Vietnam in weather, will focus on improving all-attack tactics and
enhancing their mental toughness.
</P>
<P>
The second leg of the round robin Olympic qualifying matches
will be held in Shanghai, China, in June with the best team to
join eight other top sides in a knock-out tournament to decide
three Asian representatives to Sydney.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Wednesday after eight months in the job, arousing new

collision with the legislature on the eve of a debate on
impeachment charges against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, whose steely
stewardship of U.S. economic policy commanded admiration on both
Wall Street and Capitol Hill, announced Wednesday that he will
resign. On the same day, President Bill Clinton nominated Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to succeed Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's top air-war commander said Wednesday that the

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Killed in Israeli Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- At least two Lebanese civilians
were killed and two others wounded Thursday in an Israeli air raid
on a village in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were inflicted when rockets unleased by Israeli
warplanes hit a house in the village of Majdal Silim north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon. Another two
villagers were injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Lebanese woman had been killed in Israeli
shelling on the village of Houla in the central sector of the
border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli offensives came as a retaliation for overnight
attacks by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on its two
positions inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties raised to four the number of Lebanese
civilians killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
Another 39 civilians were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli
forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Journalist Condemns NATO's Power Policy </HEADLINE>

<P>
MAPUTO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Hilario Matusse, General Secretary
of All- Mozambique Journalists Association, said Thursday that
the power policy which is embodied by the logic of "might is
right" can not be tolerated in this world.
</P>
<P>
Matusse said in an interview with Xinhua that "we should
never return to the times of 'the law of jungles'," he also urged
NATO to respect truth, justice, sovereignty and international laws
in the issue of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his indignation and condemnation against the
U.S.-led Nato attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Matusse expressed his condolences to the three Chinese
reporters who were killed during the NATO missile attack. He said
the Chinese reporters have contributed their lives for the freedom
of press and devoted to their duties.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavian TV station, and the killing of
three Chinese correspondents, have violated the basic human
rights, the freedom of press, the people's right to be informed
and the principle of media pluralization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn violences, aggression and bombing of any civilian
targets. The bombing can never help to solve the problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Matusse said that "we advocate that the Yugoslav issue should
be solved through dialog and peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Romania Suffers Economic Losses due to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Romania is suffering huge economic
losses due to the Kosovo crisis, because communications on the
Danube have been cut off, a senior Romanian official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ghiorghi Prisacaru, chairman of the Standing Committee for
Foreign Policy in the Romanian Senate, made the remarks after his
meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Prisacaru, who is here on a three-day visit, said he and
Clerdes agreed that "the bombings must stop immediately and that
both sides must return to the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization began air strikes
against Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24 after the Serb-led
government refused to accept a peace agreement to grant great
autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in the
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Prisacaru said the bombings are affecting the whole area,
adding that they have "negative consequences on Romania," as it
looses over 50 million U.S. dollars a week "due to the
destruction of bridges over the Danube and the interruption of
transportation, as well as the embargo."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the refugees must return to their homes
safely, and to this end a force must be present in the country,
under the auspices of the United Nations and the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Prisacaru noted that he discussed with the Cypriot president
the relations between Romania and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cyprus and Romania have "excellent relations,"
adding that there is room for further development of these
relations.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM to Attend Hague Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) --At the invitation of the Hague Peace
Conference, Bangladeshi prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will leave
for the Netherlands Friday to attend the concluding session of the
centenary celebrations of the first Hague Peace Conference,
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The acceptability of Bangladesh among the countries of the
North and the South and Hasina's initiative to act on the regional
and global levels" had encouraged the organizers to "have our
prime minister amidst them," Azad told a weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, who was awarded UNESCO Houphouet-Boigny Peace Prize on
April 1 for signing a peace deal with the tribal leaders of the
Chittagong Hill Tracts on December 2, 1997, ending a 22-year
tribal insurgency in the region, will address the Citizens' Peace
Conference on the concluding day on May 15.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the U.S.-led NATO's missile attack
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Azad expressed sympathy for
the Chinese people, saying "It was a very unfortunate incident."
</P>
<P>
"We hope negotiations will be resumed soon involving all sides
including the U.N. Secretary General for a comprehensive and
lasting solution to the Kosovo crisis," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Banking Reform Yields Results: IFC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's banking reforms are
beginning to show results, with state-owned banks starting to act
as commercial entities, a senior official of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Davin Mackenzie, the IFC's chief representative in China, made
the remarks at the ongoing '99 China Forum jointly organized by
the Economic Restructuring Office of the State Council, and Credit
Lyonnais Securities Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie said the establishment of Cinda Asset Management
Corporation to take over the non-performing loans of the China
Construction Bank (CCB) is a big step forward taken by the
government to tackle the huge bad loans of China's state-owned
banks.
</P>
<P>
The move took CCB's bad loans off its books, freeing it to
concentrate on better quality assets and to issue loans on a
commercial basis rather than engage in government policy-directed
lending, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to see a transformation and the banks are
beginning to act as commercial as they can. They are looking for
good assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFC official noted that now local governments no long
decide who should be appointed as senior officials of the banks'
local branches; instead, the head offices of the banks now make
these decisions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the banks are reporting less
administrative intervention in their lending activities.

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine 1st Family Ask for Gold Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The family of the late Philippine
President Ferdenand Marcos challenged former Solicitor General
Francisco Chavez Thursday to go to Switzerland and help bring back
the alleged billions and bullion of the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
"If Chavez really has any new, fresh evidence that can stand up
in court, he should bring it out in the open and help recover
anything he can," former First Lady Imelda Marcos said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Imelda welcomed investigation to be
undertaken by the Senate Accountability of Public Officers and
Investigations (Blue Ribbon) Committee into Chavez's allegations
as announced by Senator Franklin Drilon.
</P>
<P>
"This should settle the issue once and for all," she said. "If
they find sufficient evidence (of the existence of the so-called
numbered account and the gold hoard), then by all means, the
government should retrieve it. But if not, then we should close
this issue and move forward to more important and productive
tasks," she added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by George Balagtas, media consultant of
the Marcos family, Imelda, however, expressed apprehensions about
the alleged "verified and verifiable" evidence of Chavez on the
supposed 13.4 billion U.S. dollar bank account and 1,241-ton gold
hoard of the Marcoses in Switzerland, based on information the
family received from their Swiss lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"If Chavez has no new evidence, I'm afraid it will be another
exercise in futility," Imelda stressed. She pointed out that
Chavez has been talking about all kinds of evidence and documents
about supposed Marcos ill-gotten wealth, including the massive
13.4 billion U.S. dollar deposits and gold bullion hoard since he
became solicitor general in 1987.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Italian Treasury Minister Ciampi Elected as President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi was elected Thursday by the Italian "grand electors
" as the country's 10th post-war president.
</P>
<P>
The "grand electors" comprising the present 627 members of the
Lower House, 319 senators and the 58 regional representatives
gathered Thursday at 9:00 am local time in the Chamber of Deputies
to ballot the successor of the curent president Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's first ballot, when Ciampi gained 707 votes, the
needed two-thirds majority of votes announced by the Italian Lower
House Speaker Luciano Violante, the "grand electors" applauded for
the Ciampi's election.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old minister will serve this ceremonial and
honorable place for 7 years.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, Ciampi who enjoys widespread support from
Italian parties, emerged as the most likely candidate to become
Italy's next president, with both the governing majority and the
opposition Freedom Front rallying around his candidature.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said that the treasury
minister's election would represent "a positive event for both the
institutions of this country and the country itself."
</P>
<P>
Ciampi is generally recognized as the key architect of the
consolidation of Italy's public finances.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, he was named head of the International
Monetary Fund's true executive board of Interim Committee, making
him the first Italian to hold the powerful post in IMF history.
</P>
<P>
The minister also served as governer of the Bank of Italy from
1979 to 1983, prime minister from 1993 to 1994, and deputy
chairman of the Bank for International Settlements from 1994 to
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman David Ginola signed
Thursday a new three-year contract with his English Premiership
club Tottenham, putting an end to the uncertainty over his future.
</P>
<P>
The French forward, 32, who was left off France's winner World
Cup team last summer, was widely expected to be the first casualty
when George Graham took over the club early in the season.
</P>
<P>
But Ginola, voted player of the year by the Professional
Footballers' Association and the Football Writers' Association,
has flourished under the former Arsenal and Leeds manager and
helped Tottenham to the League Cup in March.
</P>
<P>
Ginola had indicated earlier this week that he might leave the
north London club, with his wages being a possible sticking point.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Newcastle star was believed to be earning 16,000 pounds
(24,000 dollars) a week on the four-year contract he signed when
joining Spurs in the summer of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Election Campaigns Enter Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- As the May 17 elections approach,
all 32 Israeli political parties have doubled their campaign
efforts for the seats of Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prime ministerial candidates, such as the incumbent
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor party leader Ehud
Barak, have also intensified their campaign activities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The fierce battle between Netanyahu and Barak, two major rivals
for the premiership, drew the most attention.
</P>
<P>
As recent polls suggested that Barak leads Netanyahu by 6 to 8
percentage points and will have an advantage of 10 to 12 points if
he is to face Netanyahu in a run-off, Netanyahu has revised his
campaign strategy by halting a variety of broadcast messages and
appealing directly to voters to "come home."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu simultaneously enlisted his Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon to make a campaign spot extolling his record in an elite
army unit, intending to offset similar commercials on behalf of
Barak.
</P>
<P>
His campaign also ran ads featuring images of exploded buses
and burned bodies in the streets caused by the Palestinians in the
past, to tell voters what they should expect under the "soft"
leadership of Barak.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the poll results, Barak and his campaigners are
continuing to center their campaign activities at educational
insitutions, residential areas of Israeli Arabs and Russian
immigrants, asking them to vote for One Israel headed by Barak.
</P>
<P>
With the election campaigns being at the crucial stage, the
right and left camps have become so clear as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spiritual leaders of the powerful ultra-orthodox party Shas on
Wednesday announced their endorsement of Netanyahu for reelection,
giving go-ahead for Shas activists to take in the campaign on
Netanyahu's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the communist party Hadash and the United Arab List
party representing the Israeli Arabs, which announced their
support for Barak earlier this week, are launching separate
campaigns aimed at persuading one million Arab voters to vote for
Barak.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Bishara, the first Arab to run for prime minister and
under pressure from Arab politicians and One Israel to pull out of
the race to help Barak to win in the first round, said Wednesday
he plans a weekend announcement about his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Center party leader Yitzhak Mordechai, another candidate for
prime minister, still refused to pull out of the race despite
pressures from One Israel and his key party members.
</P>
<P>
The voting of about one million Russian immigrants has become a
crucial decisive factor in the upcoming elections. Those
Russian-speaking immigrants supported Netanyahu in the 1996
election, but now are reportededly to be deserting him due to his
special ties with the religious Jews of North African and Middle
Eastern decent.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls showed that Barak, with the support of
the Arab and Russian-speaking voters, could have a chance to
defeat Netanyahu in the first round.

has caused the utmost indignation among the Chinese people, but
normal tourist activities in China are not at all affected, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, the U.S. State Department issued a statement warning
Americans to postpone travel to China. The statement said there
had been incidents of harassment of private Americans and damage
to U.S. business in China, and warned of the possibility of more
demonstrations and reaction against Americans and U.S. interests
in China.
</P>
<P>
"This is aimed at misguiding the U.S. citizens, and there have
been no incidents in which U.S. tourists were hurt," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address last Sunday, Vice President Hu Jintao
said that China will uphold the policy of reform and opening up to
the outside world and will protect, in accordance with relevant
international laws and norms of international relations as well as
relevant laws of China, foreign diplomatic organs and personnel,
foreign nationals in China and those who have come to China to
engage in trade, economic, educational and cultural undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that Hu's address fully demonstrates that the personal
safety of foreign tourists and the safety of their property will
be effectively protected.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's international tourism income reached 12.6
billion U.S. dollars, up 4.37 percent over the previous year,
despite grave difficulties in the international tourist market,
and the floods that ravaged China.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months this year, China's international
tourism continued to rise, with more than 16 million tourists
coming to China, up 15.5 percent over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students in Iran Condemns NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Chinese Students
in Iran on Thursday condemned NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to Xinhua office in Tehran, the Chinese
students said the attack on the embassy by the U.S.-led NATO has
trampled on international laws and the 1961 Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
The attack was a gross violation of China's sovereignty since
the embassy is part of the Chinese land under the Vienna
Convention, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and all the Chinese people can not
remain indifferent toward such atrocity," it said, accusing the
U.S.-led NATO of abusing human rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that though the U.S. claimed the aim of
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia is to solve the Kosovo
crisis, tens of thousands of Kosovo people have been forced to
flee their homelands as a result of the airstrikes which started
on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students announced their support for the stance of
the Chinese government and urged the NATO to immediately stop
military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their condolences to the families of the
victims of the NATO attack, which killed three Chinese journalists
and injured over 20 embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Chinese students are currently studying in
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Calm Despite Bomb Blasts: Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Inspector General of Police
John Kisembo said that the security situation in the country has
been relatively calm despite the recent spate of bomb blasts in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The police chief made the remarks when opening the eighth
police council meeting at Kibuli police training school here
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation has remained relatively calm and
containable with the exception of some parts of northern and
western Uganda where rebel remnants continue to terrorize people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), together with police
forces, are still pursuing the rebels of the Lord Resistance Army
in the north and those of the Allied Democratic Forces in the
west.
</P>
<P>
As to the recent bomb blast which killed more than 10 people
and injured dozens of others in Kampala this year, he urged police
to conduct thorough investigations and to exercise vigilance in
police units.
</P>
<P>
Kisembo also called for renewed efforts to stop child
abductions and subsequent mutilations in Kampala district and
neighboring districts.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that there were some serious cases of indiscipline
in some units and that it is these people who tarnished the image
of the police in general.
</P>
<P>
Some police officers were dismissed for that. This trend needs
to be addressed by enhancing supervision of the subordinates and
supervisors should be exemplary, he added.

<HEADLINE> Likud Blames Local Media for Biased Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ruling Likud Party
Thursday accused the local media of mobilizing against Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
During a campaign meeting at the Likud headquarters, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon said the media is maneuvering to bring
victory to the left in the elections to be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Likud officials complained the media is trying to present an
image of dissension and despair in the Likud after a recent public
opinion poll showed Netanyahu is trailing Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll published by the local media last
weekend, if the election for the premiership was held that time,
Barak would win 50 percent of the votes while Netanyahu would get
only 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
In response to the poll, Netanyahu declared that he will get a
surprise victory in the election "despite massive brainwashing by
the press and its attempt at demoralization."
</P>
<P>
"The press fears a repeat of 1996," Netanyahu said, referring
to the victory against then prime minister Shimon Peres which the
press and polls failed to predict.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate can get 50 percent of the votes, a second
round of voting will be held in early June.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Assures Public of No Fare Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the commuting public Thursday that no fare hike will be imposed
despite an earlier call for transportation fare adjustment as a
result of the recent round of oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican told a press briefing
that the commitment was given by various transport groups when
they met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board
(LTFRB) chairman Dante Lantin.
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the transport groups asked Lantin to
relay to Philippine President Joseph Estrada their commitment not
to move for any fare increase at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The recent round of oil price hikes imposed by Caltex
Philippines, Pilipinas Shell and Petron Corp. fueled speculation
that the movement in the cost of petroleum products would have a
chain effect on the prices of commodities and services, including
transport cost.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the transport groups assured President Estrada
that they will not petition the LTFRB for any fare hike, "as a
manifestation of their support to the government."
</P>
<P>
To ensure that no bus driver would break the commitment of the
transport groups, Barican called on commuters to report to the
LTFRB "acts of overcharging by drivers by identifying the plate
numbers and trade names of the vehicle."
</P>
<P>
He said bus commuters should submit their tickets to the LTFRB,
a proof of overcharging "for the Board' s appropriate action."

<HEADLINE> Former Agent Says On-line UK Spy Names Damage "Exaggerated" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A former British intelligence agent,
Richard Tomlinson, said on Thursday the British government
exaggerated the damage done by his act of posting the names of
more than 100 MI6 spies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said in a statement that the information on his
Website was already in the public domain and added: "Her Majesty's
government is over-reacting for public effect to stigmatize my
efforts."
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), formerly known
as MI6, have been named in a list published on the US-based site.
</P>
<P>
"The names of MI6 officers are the ones I cited in my affidavit
on MI6 and Princess Diana," BBC quoted Tomlinson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The British government has succeeded in closing down at least
one Website which Tomlinson was using to publish the information.
It claimed the lives of British intelligence agents were being put
at risk by publishing their names.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's Defense Advisory Notice Secretary,
Rear Admiral David Pulvertaft, issued a notice to the British
media urging editors not to publish the address of the Website or
details of its contents without first contacting him.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to shut down the Websites set up
by Tomlinson since the end of last month. He was sacked by MI6 in
1995 and jailed in December 1997 for breaking the country's
Official Secrets Act.
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson was released on probation after six months of his one-
year sentence and has been pursued around the world since by the
British government injunctions.

<HEADLINE> PNA Arrests Militants Before Israeli Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) - The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has arrested 10 Palestinian activists connected to
the Islamic Jihad and Hamas' militant groups over the past week,
Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A PNA spokesman was quoted by the radio as saying that these
activists were arrested in northern West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, six Palestinians were detained by
Palestinian police in the southern West Bank town of
Bethlehem. They were suspected of planting explosive devices on
the road to Har Homa, a controversial site in the outskirts of
Jerusalem, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has stepped up its efforts to fight terrorism since
Israel and the Palestinians signed the Wye agreement last
October. Washington has praised the PNA for its security
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrests were also regarded as a PNA move to prevent
terror attacks in the run-up to the Israeli elections, which is
due to be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the PNA fears such attacks might drive
jittery Israeli voters to elect a hard-line government into power
as they did in the previous election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the 1996 election, a series of suicide bombings staged
by Palestinian militants seriously eroded the support among
Israeli voters for the then Labor prime minister Shimon Peres. He
lost to Benjamin Netanyahu by a narrow margin in the voting.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin asked
the PNA to halt security cooperation with Israel and the U.S.,
saying the future Palestinian generations should be given an
opportunity to resist Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Shows Signs of Turning Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry showed
signs of turning around in the first three months of the year, as
production, sales, and profits grew.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Machinery Industry (
SAMI), industry output value stood at 124.49 billion yuan for the
period, an increase of 10.8 percent over the same period of last
year, and 21.8 percent of the country's planned machinery output
value this year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery sales were up 12.4 billion yuan, or 8.9 percent, from
the same period of last year, and the sales-production ratio was
93.9 percent. Profits were up 0.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
An official of the SAMI said that the industry has been
reversing the losing streak in the first three to four months of
each of the last three years and had profits of 560 million yuan
in March and cut losses by 776 million yuan in the first quarter
of this year, compared with one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jianping, director general of the SAMI's Industrial
Management Department, said that improving the economy and the
operation environment were the main reasons for the upturn. Since
the latter half of last year, the industry has been helped by the
government's increasing investment in infrastructure and export
tariff rebates for machinery. Mergers and consolidations in the
industry have also helped.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou said, about 51.6 percent of the state-owned
machinery enterprises are still losing money and have heavy costs.
At the end of March, the industry had 128.4 billion yuan worth of
stockpiled goods, with overdue payments costing the industry some
13 billion yuan in interest every year. In contrast, the profit
goal of the industry is only 850 million yuan this year.

<HEADLINE> China Establishing Non-Commercial Export Credit Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a non-
commercial export credit insurer to help exports that have slumped
as a result of the Asian financial crisis, industry sources say.
</P>
<P>
They say that a feasibility study has been completed and that
the insurer may become a reality this year, if all goes well.
Export credit insurance is used by various governments to
encourage exports by providing protection against losses.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, in an effort to boost exports,
especially of electrical products and machinery, told the People's
Insurance Company of China (PICC) to start an export credit
insurance business in October 1989, and that the government would
provide the capital.
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the PICC has signed more than 200,000 short-
term insurance contracts and over 50 longer-term contracts worth
more than 14 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources say, only about one percent of China's
exports were insured in 1997, compared with 39 percent in Japan
and 21 percent in France and PICC's role as a commercial insurer
has prevented it from giving full support.
</P>
<P>
They say that the solution is to establish a non-commercial
institution that would be solely devoted to export credit
insurance that would serve China's exports, which recorded the
first negative growth in 1998, after years of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that if governments do not use export credit
insurance to boost exports they use one of three means: rebates,
the exchange rate, and the interest rate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government's ability to use these three
means is very limited, hence the export credit insurance. In
addition, export credit insurance functions as a fund raiser. For
example, the PICC has, in the last 10 years, helped raise five
billion dollars for Chinese enterprises that might not otherwise
have been able to honor their export contracts.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, with the reform of China's foreign trade
system, more small and medium-sized enterprises are able to export
directly, which may put them at greater risk, and the export
credit insurance would not only protect them against risks, but it
would also make it much easier for them to get bank loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian firms and businessmen will
attend the 24th Cypriot International Trade Exhibition due to open
on Friday in Nicosia, Cyprus ambassador in Cairo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kapsos Charalambos told Egypt's Middle East News
Agency that the exhibition "will afford a good opportunity for"
seeking ways of bolstering trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two countries' chambers of commerce will
hold trade and economic talks on the sidelines of the 10-day
exhibition, Charalambos said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will hold talks to explore more opportunities for
bilateral cooperation in the economic and trade areas, the Cypriot
diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
The talks will come under an accord reached between the two
countries in Cairo last February during a visit by Cypriot
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis, said
the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus sees Egypt as a gate for exports to the Middle East and
North Africa and views itself as a bridge for Egyptian exports to
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island state is keen on stepping up
efforts to increase the bilateral trade volume, which stood at 72
million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Cyprus include cotton products, edible oil,
oil by-products, iron, furniture, aluminum products, clothes, fish
and leather and imports include paper, shoes, filters and water
turbines.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zou Jiahua, the Vice-Chairman of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,
visited Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, from May 8 to 12
to have a look at the air pollution situation.
</P>
<P>
After visiting a number of factories and projects, Zou praised
Xi'an for the progress it had made in controlling air pollution
and attributed the progress to the work of officials and their
methods and for the greening efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, Zou said, there are still air pollution problems in
Xi'an and further action needs to be taken and that this is very
important.
</P>
<P>
To have a cleaner sky, the city government needs to increase
air pollution awareness among the people and to further monitor
the situation and make full use of new technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zou's visit was part of an air pollution control and law-
enforcement effort that focuses on the prevention and control of
air pollution caused by coal and motor vehicles in urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Decline on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday on profit-taking amid fears of
further price erosion on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index fell by 20.19 points to close
at 1,868.83.
</P>
<P>
Total volume dropped to 443.68 million shares worth 567.71
million Singapore dollars (333.28 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outnumbered gainers by 289 to 53 with 102 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was an 8.22 million stock parcel by Allgreen
which was transacted at 1.71 Singapore dollars per share. It was
followed by PSC which had 8.21 million units done. Van DH was the
next which saw 7.93 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Venture headed the ascent of the day running up 50 cents to
close at 9.65 Singapore dollars. NatElec picked up 40 cents to
finish at 5.65 Singapore dollars. NatStl was up 19 cents to end at
2.79 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, OCBC was the biggest loser of the day,
incurring a loss of 70 cents to close at 15.7 Singapore dollars.
SPH and SPH 100 sank 50 cents each and both ended at 25 Singapore
dollars. C&AMP;C and CityDev contracted by 40 cents to close at 10.1
and 10.5 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the overnight sharp slump on Wall Street dampened
market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the sentiment was pretty nervous as the
movement of the DOW Jones Industrial Average on chart signaled a
key trend reversal on Wall Street over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the massive run-up in the last several weeks has
triggered concerns that the market is becoming overvalued and is
stretched beyond what the fundamentals can support.
</P>
<P>
They also said the market was also dampened by concerns over
higher interest rates with property and banking stocks leading the
decline.

<HEADLINE> Canada Urges Pakistan to Sign CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Canadian diplomat
Thursday reiterated his country's concern over Pakistan's nuclear
tests last year and urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Asia Pacific affairs of Canada Raymond
Chan, during his meetings with Pakistani ministers in Islamabad,
renewed the call for signing the CTBT and the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) by Pakistan, according to a Canadian High Commission
press release on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that Canada welcomed the recent warming of Indo-Pak
relations as exemplified in the Lahore Declaration issued by the
two countries' prime ministers in February.
</P>
<P>
He added that this will lead to an improvement in the overall
security situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Islamabad, Chan held meetings respectively
with Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan
Kanju, Minister of Law Khalid Anwar and Minister of Finance Ishaq
Dar.
</P>
<P>
They had a frank and free exchange on the state of Pakistan's
economy and the prospects for strengthening bilateral trade ties,
said the press release.
</P>
<P>
In the course of each of the meetings, Chan noted the Canadian
government's commitment to its development assistance partnership
with Pakistan while indicating Canada's interest in enhancing ties
with Pakistan as differences on nuclear policy and other issues
are progressively settled, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks to Increase Its Share of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- African governments have a riddle
to solve -- how to reap its fair share of the big global tourism
trade.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended 33rd World Tourism Organization (WTO) and
Convocation of African Ministers of Tourism in Accra, Ghana,
sought to find reasons for the inability of African states to
attract a bigger share of the world's tourists and generate high
revenues from the industry.
</P>
<P>
The forum attended by about 1,500 delegates from over 40
countries around the world and representatives of multilateral
bodies was held under the theme "Africa: Tourist Destination for
the Next Millennium," the Ghana News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Madrid-based WTO have indicated that out
of global current and projected earnings from the tourism
industry, 60 percent remains within Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Africa's benefits from the tourism industry, however, account
for only two percent of the financial receipts in the whole world
and four percent of tourist arrivals, although the continent's
tourism sector is the fastest growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
Research has proved that Africa has the greatest potential to
be the leader in the global tourism industry, yet it is the lowest
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the conference was to find ways and means to move
the tourism industry in Africa out of it present state and make
it what it should be, given the existing potential and resources.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda were the issues of human resource
development and availability of funds and a reliable information
base needed to facilitate the development and promotion of the
African tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Another significant issue on the agenda was safety in terms of
socio- political and environmental atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that too many barriers exist in the African
transport sector which tourists find very cumbersome. They thus
choose to spend their money at destinations where viable and less
cumbersome transport sectors exist.
</P>
<P>
High air fares, long processes in clearing tourists and their
luggage at entry points, poor roads, lack of an efficient rail
system and water transport, were the main transport barriers
identified.
</P>
<P>
African countries at the forum saw the necessity to consolidate
their strengths and collaborate with each other to develop their
tourism industry with emphasis on promoting cultural and
eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
They also saw the necessity to adopt a system of
multi-destination tourism, where tourists who enter the continent
at one point could continue to other countries with a single visa.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to reduce air fares, construct access routes to
tourists centers in their various countries, relax immigration and
customs regulations and checks, provide rail and water transport
facilities and ensure safety and sound security services.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer Thursday reiterated Australia's support for Thai
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi in the bitter fight to
become the new head of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also trade minister, warned that the six-month
dispute over whether Supachai Panitchpakdi or former New Zealand
Prime Minister Mike Moore should become the head was harming trade
liberalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will be resolved sooner rather than later," Fischer
told reporters before embarking on a two-week overseas trip,
including China.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia had been working through the leadership
issue with Geneva but would not say whether a compromise position
on the leadership was likely.
</P>
<P>
"There are one or two developments, I don't dwell on them,
negotiations are going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a win-win situation whether at the end of the day
it is Dr. Supachai or Mr. Moore but Australia is in full support
of Dr. Supachai for that position."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council have decided
to commend the staff of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and
journalists stationed in Yugoslavia, Premier Zhu Rongji announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said at a meeting welcoming the returned embassy staff
members that the diplomats of the embassy and the Chinese
journalists in Yugoslavia have, with their work, demonstrated the
well-established spiritual highness of Chinese diplomats and
journalists in the new era.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC Central Committee and the State Council call upon all
people across the nation to learn from their outstanding morality
of loving the motherland, fulfilling responsibility, behaving
bravely, unselfishness and dedication," he said.
</P>
<P>
The people of the whole country should unite more closely
around the Party Central committee with Jiang Zemin at the core,
hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, maintain the
country's social stability, do a good job of reform and opening-up
and modernization construction, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three Chinese journalists, who were killed in the U.S.-led
NATO missile attack at the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday,
Shao Yunhuan from the Xinhua News Agency and the young couple Xu
Xinghu and Zhu Ying from the Guangming Daily, were awarded the
title of "Revolutionary Martyrs" at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that during the 50-plus days and nights of U.
S.-led NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, all embassy staff have
honestly carried out China's foreign policy, and successfully
accomplished their tasks.
</P>
<P>
Chinese journalists in Yugoslavia have braved great
difficulties and have timely, objectively, and justly reported the
latest developments and truth of the Kosovo crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade killed the
three journalists and wounded more than 20 others, many of whom
continued with their work despite their injuries, he said.

in Belgrade.
</P>

According to Jiang, governments, political parties, social
organizations and all peace-loving people worldwide also expressed
their condemnation of NATO's brutal act in support of the just
struggle of the Chinese people. "On behalf of the Chinese
government, I would like to extend sincere gratitude to them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been firmly opposed to the military
strike launched by U.S.-led NATO against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, a move dodging the U.N. Security Council, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The war has caused great catastrophe for the Yugoslav people
and posed a serious threat to European stability and world peace,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time to end such a war," he said, adding that "no
political solution can be discussed in the United Nations amidst
NATO's continuous wanton bombing. This is the principled stance of
the Chinese government and people."

<HEADLINE> 1 in 5 Australian School Starters Wet Themselves: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- One in five Australian children
starting school wet themselves during the day, a survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The study of 2,000 children at 30 different Sydney primary
schools found a surprisingly high prevalence of urinary
incontinence and a worrying lack of concern about it by parents
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire results, presented to the annual scientific
meeting of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in West
Australia's coastal city of Perth, found that 19 percent of school
starters had experienced one or more episodes of wetting in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the children in the survey pool was 5.6
years.
</P>
<P>
Premala Sureshkumar, from the Center for Kidney Research at
Sydney's New Children's Hospital, said the findings indicated that
12,000 children starting school in Australia's premier New South
Wales each year would have problems and 400 would be wet every
day.
</P>
<P>
The survey found teachers recognize only one in six children
who have the problem.
</P>
<P>
Only 16 percent of children who wet themselves had been taken
to see a doctor about it.
</P>
<P>
Sureshkumar said interventions could include counseling and
bladder training exercises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Organizations Send Open Letter to U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The barbarous act violated the Chinese sovereignty and
trampled grossly the Vienna Convention (on Diplomatic Relations),"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent by the China International Association for
Promotion of Science and Peace and the China Organizing Committee
of the International Week of Science and Peace.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the China International Association for
promotion of Science and peace expressed their utmost indignation
and strong condemnation," it said.
</P>
<P>
The letter, entitled "A Just Cause Enjoys Abundant Support
while an Unjust One Finds Little Support", said the Chinese
scientists and people from all walks of life have all along loved
peace and worked for the maintenance of peace, uphold the view
that scientific and technical progress should benefit mankind and
promote social progress, and firmly oppose application of
scientific and technical advantage to launch war.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-led NATO acted in an opposite way, having
willfully invaded a sovereign country by relying on high
technology and killed defenseless innocent people. Its ferocious
feature to seek world hegemony is thus completely unmasked, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the criminal act of NATO has met with
strong protest by peace-loving people of many countries.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is doomed to an ignominious fate of 'lifting a rock only
to drop it on its own toes,'" it added.
</P>
<P>
The letter demands that the United Nations uphold fairness,
stand for justice and oppose power politics and hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to all the peace-loving people in the world to work
together to stop the unjust war against Yugoslavia and triumph
over "the evil forces" to embrace the dawn of peace for Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Boy Writes Letter to Bill Clinton Calling for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese boy who presented a scroll
saying "Long Live Peace" to U.S. President Bill Clinton last June,
on Wednesday wrote a letter to the U.S. president calling for
peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shuyan, a seven-year-old pupil from Xi'an Airport Primary
School in the city of Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
said in the letter that the recent words and deeds of the U.S.
president smashed the good impression left on the little Chinese
boy.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Xi'an last year,
Chen Shuyan was among a group of small calligraphers who were
arranged to demonstrate their skills to the U.S. president and his
mission at the southern city gate on June 25.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton stopped before the little boy and asked what he
wrote, the Chinese boy answered loudly: "Long Live Peace." "Could
you send the scroll to me?" asked President Clinton. "Certainly,"
answered the boy who said he was then quite excited.
</P>
<P>
While reminding Clinton of last year's experience, Chen said he
never expected that in less than one year's time, U.S.-led NATO
would launch random airstrikes in the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia, making tens of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much saddened to learn that on the night of May 7, U.
S.-led NATO fired missiles on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
killing three journalists, injuring 20 others and destroying the
embassy building," said Chen in the letter. "Your acts destroyed
the fine impression you left on my mind, and broke the hearts of
us Chinese children."
</P>
<P>
"I hereby write you another scroll saying 'We love peace,
oppose war'," said Chen, "It is my wish, as well as the wish of
all Chinese children. We all expect an earlier arrival of peaceful
days."
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Chen's letter will be transferred to the U.
S. embassy in Beijing via the Xi'an City Bureau of Education.

<HEADLINE> First Spring Rain Falls in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China, received its first spring
rain early this morning.
</P>
<P>
By 8:00 am, the Tibet Autonomous Regional Meteorological Bureau
had recorded precipitation of 5.6 mm in the Lhasa region. Moderate
rainfall was also reported in farming areas along the Yarlung
Zangbo River and pastures in northern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa residents seem very pleased with the moisture and
freshness of the morning air after the rain, while the mountains
around the city were again capped with light snow as a result of
the slight temperature drop.
</P>
<P>
"The rain will help relieve the spring drought haunting many
agricultural areas in Tibet and promote the growth of grass in the
pastures," said a local meteorologist. "It is also conducive to
purifying the air in Lhasa and preventing the spread of spring
diseases in the city."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the rain was caused by the junction of cold
air from northern Tibet and warm, moist air currents from the
south. He also predicted that Lhasa will see many similar
overnight rainfalls for the rest of the month.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the real rainy season in Tibet won't
come until June.

<HEADLINE> Bhutto Asked to Surrender Before Challenging Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- With the deadline of May 17 for
filing an appeal approaching, Pakistan's Supreme Court Thursday
asked exiled opposition leader Benazir Bhutto to surrender to
police if she wants to appeal against her conviction in a
corruption case.
</P>
<P>
The court office has recorded its objections to an appeal
against a judgment by a Lahore High Court Ehtesab (Accountability)
Bench, filed by Bhutto's counsels.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto is currently in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates and the
last date for her to file an appeal is May 17. After that any
appeal by her will be dismissed as time barred in the absence of
special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto and her jailed husband, Senator Asif Ali Zardari, were
disqualified from membership in the parliament and any public
office besides being awarded five years' imprisonment and fined
8.6 million U.S. dollars in the SGS-Contecna case.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister, and her husband were
found guilty of receiving illegal gratification from the SGS and
Cotecna, two Swiss companies, against the award of a contract for
pre-shipment inspection.
</P>
<P>
The apex court has stayed the follow-up disqualification
process of Zardari at the office of Chief Election Commissioner
(CEC) observing that the CEC should wait for an appeal by Zardari,
too.
</P>
<P>
Under the Supreme Court rules in Pakistan, the court office can
return an appeal if not found in accordance with the law which
clearly states that an accused convicted in a criminal case has to
first surrender to the police before moving to the apex court.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto can challenge the decision of the court office before a
single judge of the Supreme Court, but she has not yet done so.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Unhappy with US Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith said here Thursday that he is
frustrated by a U.S. decision to "roll over" export subsidies for
some dairy products.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, he said the United States has announced
that it will "roll over" unused subsidies under its Dairy Export
Incentive Program into the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past month I have made strong representations, both
written and in person during my recent visit to Washington, urging
the U.S. administration to ensure that these subsidies were
handled in a way that minimized the damage to the market," Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision is taken at a time when agricultural
producers around the world are saddled with low commodity prices,
he said, adding, "It's frustrating to see a significant economy
like the United States follow a policy which is far from aligned
with its stated commitments to foster open markets and undistorted
trade."

Conference (CPPCC), the top advisory body of the regional
government, convened its second annual session in the regional
capital of Lhasa today.
</P>

mourn the three victims in the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia.

the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China,
the 40th anniversary of the Democratic Reform in Tibet, and
Macao's return to its motherland," noted Pagbalha, also vice-

"The splittist activities of the Dalai clique have been the
main sources of instability in Tibet," said Gjinzom in his report.
"The Dalai clique's attempt to split the motherland is against the
historical tides and can by no means win the Tibetan people's
support."
</P>

The session is scheduled to close on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cuts Governmental Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq
Dar Thursday announced a downward revision of interest rates for
all National Savings Schemes and Accounts by two percentage
points, applicable on future investments only.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for savings account will be cut from 13
percent to 11 percent per annum, Special Saving
Certificates/Account from 16 to 14 percent, Regular Income
Certificates from 18 to 16 percent and the compound rate for
Defense Saving Certificates from 18 to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the reduced rates of profit will be
applicable on future investment only.
</P>
<P>
The present investment of the existing investors shall continue
to get the benefit of existing rates till the time of its maturity
or withdrawal, he added.
</P>
<P>
National Savings Schemes and Accounts, different from
commercial banking systems, are set up by the Pakistani government
to absorb savings from investors to carry out its development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have reduced their rate of return on the
deposits with them by 2-3 percentage points earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The rates of return offered by the banks and those offered by
the government on savings are somewhat inter-linked. Pegging one
at a higher rate also pushes the other up, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
While the government attaches every importance to the investors
who have made available their savings to the government, the
government cannot remain oblivious of other factors happening in
this regard, the minister observed.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation in Pakistan has come down from 13 percent
in 1994-95 (July-June) to 7.8 percent in 1997-98 and is expected
to fall to around 6 percent by the end of the current financial
year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Hits 10.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate rose beyond
the official single digit target for the second consecutive month
to 10.9 percent this February with 10.4 percent recording in the
preceding month.
</P>
<P>
In this year's budget speech, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar listed sustenance of "the single digit
inflation rate as one of the policy thrusts of the current
economic plan."
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Nigeria has consistently focused itself on
liquidity level management in the economy including introducing
mandatory Special Treasury Bill worth 40 billion naira (about 421
million U.S. dollars) to curtail the upsurge in the potential
inflationary trend.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the regulatory authorities have also reviewed the
Treasury Bills Rates and Minimum Rediscount Rate upward, as direct
control instruments for mopping up excess funds from the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Federal Office of Statistics, these
measures have failed to address the upward growth in the inflation
rate level as the three months from last December to February this
year have consistently been recording increases of about 0.5
percentage points every month.
</P>
<P>
Considering the consistent growth of the inflation rate in
three successive months and the general performance of the
economy, analysts doubt the capacity of the economy to revert the
rate back to the single digit level recorded in most time of last
year.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Maldivian government now allows
Sri Lankan fishing boats to pass through its territorial waters on
their way to international fishing grounds, a Sri Lankan official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was made possible following negotiations between
governments of the two countries, advisor to the Sri Lankan
Ministry of Fisheries Henry Gunawardena said.
</P>
<P>
However, 48 hours prior to entering the Maldivian Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ), Sri Lankan fishing companies have to notify
the Maldivian authorities of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
They have to supply the name of the fishing craft, its
contents, names of the crew, the time of its re-entry into the
Maldivian EEZ on its way home and other details.
</P>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania ranks fifth in
Africa for its 431-million-U.S. -dollar tourism income last year
according to the World Tourism Organization (WTO) records, local
media said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia
Meghji told a press conference here Wednesday that Tanzania is
second to South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritius for
attracting tourists.
</P>
<P>
Meghji, who returned the same day from the annual conference of
Africa Travel Association (ATA) held in Accra, Ghana, said that
for the first time Tanzania has earned more than Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The WTO statistics show that South Africa earned 2,366 million
dollars, Morocco 1,600 million dollars, Tunisia 1,550 million
dollars and Mauritius 502 million.
</P>
<P>
Kenya ranked sixth in the WTO list of top twenty tourism

<P>
Others are Namibia, Ghana, Reunion, Zimbabwe, Botswana,
Senegal, Uganda and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Laos Takes Steps to Start Process of Joining WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government has taken a major
step to start the process of joining the World Trade Organization
(WTO) by signing the first document of a project which helps the
country enter the WTO, Lao official news agency KPL reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday officials of the Lao Ministry of Commerce and
Tourism signed the first document of a project which aims to bring
Laos into the WTO, said KPL.
</P>
<P>
The project will be coordinated by the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP), with funding of the initial component provided by
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Signing the project document were Siaosavath Savengsuksa, Lao
Vice-Minister of Commerce and Tourism, and Kari Nordheim Larsen,
resident representative of UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Phoumy Thipphavone, Lao minister of commerce and tourism, said,
"We hope that our cooperation in this project will help Laos get
fully prepared to integrate into the international trading system,
which will benefit Laos."
</P>
<P>
Australia's contribution of 448,800 U.S. dollars over three
years will fully fund the first component of the project,
providing important assistance to Laos accession to the World
Trade Organization. During the first and most crucial stage of the
WTO project, the Australian funds will help the Lao government
meet WTO rules and preconditions, said KPL.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaians in Netherlands Decry Bad Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Some Ghanaians living in the
Netherlands said Wednesday that the Dutch government had adopted a
policy to make conditions difficult for nationals of Ghana,
Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Dominican Republic living in that
country.
</P>
<P>
They said this policy had made it difficult for them to
legalize and process their documents because their countries have
been singled out as "problem countries", the Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sam Owusu, vice-chairman of Sikaman Foundation and coordinator
of the Ghana-Nigeria Platform who made these known to newsmen at
a press conference in Accra, capital of Ghana, appealed to
President Jerry Rawlings to come to the aid of Ghanaians living in
that country.
</P>
<P>
The Platform that serves as a forum to fight for the rights of
nationals of Ghana and Nigeria is made up of the Council of
Churches and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Owusu said they have contacted Amnesty International, the Dutch
Justice Ministry and Ombudsman for redress.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had failed to step in
to save the situation despite numerous complaints made by
Ghanaians living in the Netherlands to the government of Ghana to
take the matter up with the Dutch embassy in Accra, he said.
</P>
<P>
Owusu said Ghanaian or Nigerian applicants are subjected to
hardships, inhuman and unacceptable conditions by the Dutch
police.
</P>
<P>
According to him, applicants are forced to sign and agree to
verifications as part of their requirements for legalization.
This verification sometimes includes interrogating relatives back
home.
</P>
<P>
Owusu recounted the many instances where Nigerian and Ghanaian
nationals have suffered a lot of brutalities that sometimes result
in deaths.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Born Portuguese: Macao is Our Home (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- As indicated by the name of "Roots in
Macao," an organization of Macao-born Portuguese, the overwhelming
majority of this group of people have a strong sense of linkage
with Macao.
</P>
<P>
In face of Macao's return to China on December 20 this year,
most Macao-born Portuguese have chosen to stay.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Pereira Coutinho, a Macao-born Portuguese who is
vice president of the Association of Public Servants in Macao,
said Macao will continue to be his home after it returns to China.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we do, we should do out of the consideration of how
to build our home into a better place," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Macao-born Portuguese refer to those born in
Macao with Portuguese extraction, including the descendants from
the intermarriage between Portuguese and Chinese, or Portuguese
and other ethnic groups. Currently, there are more than 10,000
such people in Macao and many of them are civil servants of the
Macao government. And many others are employed in law, accounting
and the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, some Macao-born Portuguese used to feel
confused about Macao's return to China. However, their doubts and
misgivings have been eliminated by the clear stipulation in the
Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region that the
social system and life-style in Macao will remain unchanged and
Portuguese culture and customs will be respected.
</P>
<P>
Today, the overwhelming majority of the Macao-born Portuguese
said they are optimistic about China's resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
The return of Macao to China is a historical change and no one,
be him a Chinese, a Macao-born Portuguese or a Portuguese, should
worry about the future, said Helena S. Fernandes, a Macao-born
Portuguese who is deputy director of the Tourism Office of the
Macao government.
</P>
<P>
Maria Edith da Silva, member of the Macao Legislative Assembly,
who married a native Chinese 20 years ago, said, "My personal
experience has shown that though more than 90 percent of the Macao
residents are Chinese, it is not difficult for the Macao-born
Portuguese to mix together with the Chinese society."
</P>
<P>
Rita Botelho dos Santos, another Macao-born Portuguese who is
president of the Association of Public Servants in Macao, said she
has seen with her own eyes how China has earnestly implemented the
policy of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to Macao's return and I believe that the
economy and social order of Macao will improve after its return to
China," she said.
</P>
<P>
"What's more important is that by then there will be the true
realization of 'Macao people governing Macao' and we can
eventually run our own home," Santos said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that she was called a "Chinese girl" during a
business trip to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"I like this address, as I was born and brought up in Macao and
I consider myself one of the Chinese," she said.
</P>
<P>
Being a member of the 199-member Selection Committee for the
first government of the future Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Santos will cast her sacred vote in the selection of the
first chief executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Like Santos, a large number of Macao-born Portuguese have
participated directly in work related to Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Leonel Alberto Alves, a noted lawyer and a member of the
Selection Committee, said Macao-born Portuguese are ready to
contribute to Macao's smooth transfer and to its long-term
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Dias Azedo, a lawyer, said, "The return of Macao to
China represents the opening of a new page in the history of Macao
and a new age for all people in Macao."
</P>
<P>
In response to Macao's return to China, learning Chinese has
become the fashion of the day in Macao and "No matter who you are,
together we work hard to build Macao into a better place" has
become a motto among people of all ethnic origins in Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua)-- President Jiang Zemin today praised
the three journalists killed in the U.S.-led NATO missile attack
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade for their loyalty and devotion
to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government awarded Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu, and Zhu
Ying, all killed in the attack last Friday, the title of "
Revolutionary Martyrs" at a ceremony held in the Great Hall of the
People.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the State Council,
and all ethnic nationalities of the country, Jiang expressed
condolences for the three martyrs, conveyed regards to the injured,
and extended tribute to those still working in the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO must bear all responsibilities for the incident
and must meet all demands put forward by the Chinese government,
otherwise the Chinese people will never let the matter go at that,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, China will unswervingly continue to
stick to economic construction, the core work of the country. Also,
China will continue to push forward reform and opening-up, keep
social stability, and unswervingly implement its independent
foreign policy for peace.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updated with Details U.S. Should Take Immediate Action on China's Demand: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today at his regular press conference that the
United States should take immediate concrete action in response to
China's just and solemn demand concerning NATO's attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. must not shirk responsibilities and make irresponsible
remarks on the just action of the Chinese people; otherwise it
will face stronger protests from the Chinese people, the spokesman
said, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of defense said during a Senate hearing that
the Chinese people's outrage over the bombing of their embassy in
Belgrade is understandable, but that to express justifiable angry
is different from intentionally making use of (the incident), and
the U.S. is concerned about this.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the various protests of the Chinese people during
the past few days over the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade showed their great indignation. Their acts have fully
demonstrated their solemn and justified stand and their firm
determination in safeguarding national sovereignty and maintaining
national dignity.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of course and beyond reproach of any kind," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government firmly supports and protects in
accordance with law all legal protest activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. secretary of defense, regardless of facts, described
the justified actions of the Chinese people as 'intentional
utilization,' and has therefore confused right from wrong," he
said. "China has lodged a strong protest over this."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
embassy was a brutal act that seriously infringed upon China's
sovereignty and constituted a clear challenge to 1.2 billion
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO must take the whole responsibility for its
brutal attack," he stressed.

BAGHDAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Oil Ministry has accused
the United Nations Sanctions Committee of blocking Iraq from
purchasing equipment used to tackle oil wastes and environmental
pollution, a weekly newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawra weekly quoted Ali Hamid Mohammed, director-general of
the Northern Refinery Company of Iraq, as saying Iraq has
signed contracts to purchase equipment and materials used in the
disposal of industrial water under the oil-for-food program
between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
However, those equipment and materials, signed under the fourth
phase of the program, have not reached Iraq after the fifth phase
of the program went into effect five months ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused representatives of the United States and
Britain at the Sanctions Committee of obstructing contracts it
concluded with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said his company is facing serious problems in getting
rid of waste industrial water which mounts to 600 cubic meters per
hour.

(external borrowing by the government) debt declined to 5.03
billion dollars at the end of March compared to 5.6 billion in

"Stop killing," " Severely punish murderers" and "We want peace,

Los Angeles, University of Southern California, California
Technology Institute as well as organizations in local Chinese

The protesters demanded the U.S. and NATO make formal apologies

</P>
<P>
"For bombing an embassy," one protester said, "only verbal
apologies are far from enough, and at least official written
apologies are needed."

<P>
The demonstrators also demanded that the U.S.-led NATO conduct
a thorough investigation into the bombing, make public the
investigation results immediately and severely punish those
responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Severe punishment is needed "because the loss of lives and
consequences are global and far-reaching," they said.
</P>

Meanwhile, they expressed the hope that the U.S. government
will take appropriate measures in the above-mentioned three
aspects and make efforts to maintain Sino-American relations on a

The U.S.-led NATO has the most advanced weapons, satellites and
the most sophisticated intelligence system, and the target must be
checked time and time again before the bombing was carried out, he
said.

"It is ridiculous to say that they don't know the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade as it maintains normal relations with the
embassies of the NATO countries there," he said. "It is a separate
building with no military targets around." (US-China-Embassy

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zambia Walk out of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Talks to ease tension between
Angola and Zambia broke down this week, with Zambia accusing
Angola of failing to back up claims that Lusaka supports UNITA
rebels, South African media quoted Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid the talks have collapsed mainly because Angola
failed to come up with the much touted evidence that we are
supporting UNITA," said an aide to Zambia security chief Frank
Chungu.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters report did not say when the official made the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of defense ministers and intelligence chiefs began
in Swaziland's capital Mbabane early Tuesday, but quickly got
bogged down over the issue of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"The Swaziland government concluded it would be pointless to
continue the meeting in the absence of evidence from Angola," said
another Zambian official.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was accordingly brought to an abrupt end and we
are going back home tomorrow," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were designed to ease tension between the two
neighbors by clearing up misunderstanding on the UNITA issue.
</P>
<P>
Angola claims that Zambia provides military and logistical
support for the UNITA movement and that diamonds mined by the
rebel group make their way to international markets through
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has repeatedly denied the allegations and has openly
challenged Angola to substantiate the claims or subject any
evidence to international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has been fighting the government since independence
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia's Information Minister said Wednesday the
two-day meeting "is successful" since Zambia and Angola have
resolved the misunderstanding, Zambia's Daily Mail reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was hosted by Swazi King Mswati III.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankans March Against NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Sri Lankans, mostly
youths, Thursday held a protest march outside the U.S. Embassy
here against the U.S.-led NATO air attack on the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade last week.
</P>
<P>
The marchers walked about one kilometer before reaching the
U.S. Embassy by the Galle Road, the major highway in the city.
</P>
<P>
They shouted slogans, denouncing the NATO attack and demanding
an immediate stop to the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The march lasted about one hour from 10:30 a.m. to 11:35 a.m.
local time, attracting a large crowd of onlookers and disrupting
the normal traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Sri Lankan policemen kept order outside the U.S.
Embassy as the protesters were demonstrating.
</P>
<P>
The gate of the U.S. Embassy was closed and some embassy
personnel were standing on the roof of the embassy building to
watch the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
A travel agent, whose company is located opposite the U.S.
Embassy across the road, said, "The demonstration was a necessary
measure to show the support of Sri Lanka for China against the war
action of the NATO."
</P>
<P>
The protesters were possibly organized by the leftist Janatha
Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), or the People's Liberation Front, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The JVP, the third largest party in Sri Lanka, has staged a
comeback in the mainstream of the country's politics by obtaining
15 seats in the five provincial elections early last month.

the chairmanship of Swaziland and with the participation of the
Inter-State Defense and Security Committee of the Southern African

the "most barbarian act" and it is exceptionally seldom in the
contemporary history.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NATO claimed to have the most sophisticated
technology and weaponry system, how could they have hit the
Chinese Embassy by "a mistake"?
</P>
<P>
Hussain pointed out that the NATO did this "deliberately and
intentionally" and it should be condemned by the Chinese
government and the people and all the peace-loving people in the

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Botswana defense force has
announced that the military intervention to Lesotho by South
Africa and his country under the banner of the Southern African
Development Community will end Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operation will give way to another operation, which will
constitute assistance to the Lesotho defense force with
reconstruction and training.
</P>
<P>
The latter operation will be mounted by instructors from
military forces of Botswana and South Africa, a combined
protection force and support personnel, the Botswana defense force
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The last batch of troops from the two SADC countries is due to
leave Lesotho Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Botswana defense force stressed, the troops which
participated in military operation in Lesotho would be on standby
in their home countries should the government of Lesotho require
any further assistance.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Lesotho government, South Africa and
Botswana sent their troops to Lesotho to help restore order and
stability last September when the mountain kingdom fell into
political and social crisis.

JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on
Wednesday he will win in the coming elections despite public
opinion polls that show him trailing Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to Netanyahu said his campaign adviser,
Arthur Finkelstein, warned on Wednesday that if elections were
held today, he would definitely lose.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens is under pressure
from Israel's defense industry to place an order for new F-15
fighter bomber jets from Boeing Company, while the Israeli army
wants to buy less expensive F-16s from Lockheed-Martin
Company.
</P>
<P>
One possible compromise would be to make a combined purchase,
enabling the Israeli Air Force to rejuvenate its existing
squadrons of F-15s while expanding its F-16 fleet.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An officer of the Israeli army was killed and two soldiers
were injured when a hand grenade accidentally blew up during a
training in the Jordan Valley on Wednesday. The army has
appointed a commission of inquiry to probe the cause of the
accident.

<HEADLINE> China Rolled Steel Oversupplied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese rolled-steel market is
now oversupplied, while imports continue to be allowed entry into
an already-weak market, according to a recent issue of the
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for rolled steel in the first quarter this year
was over 29 million tons, up nearly ten percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the supply increased by 17.7 percent, to 30.
75 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted officials at the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry as saying that half of the rolled steel
being imported is unnecessary because of the abundant domestic
supply.
</P>
<P>
The price of rolled steel went down by 4.1 percent in the first
quarter this year compared with that of last December.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cement Production Outstrips Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China sold 106 million tons of
cement in the first quarter this year, up 10.2 percent over a year
earlier, according to the State Administration of Building
Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China produced 107 million tons of cement, up
19.7 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Oversupply has brought about falling prices in the cement
market, the report said, adding that prices in the first quarter
decreased by six percent from last December.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that although capital construction will
obviously gain momentum during the second quarter, it is unlikely
to stop the price decline, as many cement manufacturers have
failed to effectively scale down production.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature to Inspect Enforcement of Product-Quality Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indignant at exploding beer bottles
and TV sets, crumbling motors, flimsy building materials and
poisonous foods that are killing and injuring a large number of
consumers, Chinese legislators today decided to launch an
inspection campaign later this month to check how the 1993 law on
product quality is being enforced.
</P>
<P>
The inspection tours will include the provinces of Zhejiang,
Shandong, Guangdong, Henan, and Chongqing Municipality, said Tian
Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, here today at the installation of the inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Tian will act as the overall director of the teams.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC Standing Committee attaches great importance to the
product-quality law, and has made nationwide inspections on its
implementation in 1994 and 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the general product quality in China remains low,
with the rate of qualified products in nationwide sample surveys
lingering below 80 percent over the past six years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian also cited several major incidents this year in which poor
product quality led to property damage and even loss of life.
</P>
<P>
"Such incidents expose the deep roots of institutional
loopholes and lax law-enforcement efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The quality issue must be treated as relevant to social
stability, as well as vital to the welfare of the country's
economic development," he warned.
</P>
<P>
As China actively pursues membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Chinese products will eventually lose much of
their government protection, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
In order to be successful in volatile international economic
competition, Chinese companies must constantly strive to rely on
innovations in science and technology, product quality, and after-
sale services, Tian added.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Consumers Association, its branch
organizations nationwide handled 3,400 major quality disputes from
1995 through the first quarter of this year, in which 71 people
were killed, 165 handicapped, 3,106 wounded, and 6.82 million yuan
in property losses incurred.
</P>
<P>
The legislative inspections will target food, home appliances,
and building and farm materials.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Group Denounces NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Arniko Society in Nepal
Thursday denounced the U.S.-led NATO's air attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade as "a heinous crime."
</P>
<P>
The group said in a statement that the act violates China's
sovereignty, the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and
the norms of international relations and also tramples on the
rights of journalists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese journalists were killed and more than 20
diplomats injured in the NATO's air raids on the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We express deep sympathy and condolence to the People's
Republic of China over the casualties and damage to the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade caused by the NATO missile attack and lodge
the strongest protest against the inhuman atrocity of NATO," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that more disaster will result if NATO
continues air raids on Yugoslavia. It demanded an immediate
cessation of NATO's aggression and bombing against Yugoslavia in
order to bring the Kosovo issue back to the track of political
solution.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Condemns Coup in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- President Joaquim Chissano has
condemned the armed coup overthrowing Guinea Bissau President Joao
Bernardo Vieira last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is against seizure of power by armed forces,
especially in a country which has already been undergoing
democratic process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the remarks Wednesday upon his return from
Tanzanian capital Dar res Salaam where he had held consultations
with his Tanzanian and Zambian counterparts on the situation in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president hoped that normal order be restored
soon in Guinea Bissau and that the west African country could
resolve its problems through democratic means in respect of the
law.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the people in Guinea Bissau could find a proper
way to ensure the continuation of the democratic process, with no
more violence, no more bloodshed and no more losses to properties.
 We hope people in the country could once again live and work in
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rebels led by the dismissed army chief General Ansumane Mane
attacked the presidential palace in Bissau Friday, forcing
President Vieira to seek shelter in Portuguese embassy after some
600 guards in the palace surrendered to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
On the DRC issue, Chissano said he, along with Zambian President
 Frederick Chiluba and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, has
decided that Chiluba should continue his mediation efforts aimed
at cease-fire in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano admitted that the war in the DRC is till going on,
but he believed that it will not affect the efforts to solve the
crisis made by the Southern African Development Community.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Refutes U.S. Argument on Embassy Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"China will never accept any cover-up," said He Yafei, Minister
of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, at a seminar held by
the International Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO has the most advanced weapons, satellites and
the most sophisticated intelligence system, and the target must be
checked time and time again before the bombing was carried out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is ridiculous to say that they don't know the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade as it maintains normal relations with the
embassies of the NATO countries there," he said. "It is a separate
building with no military targets around."
</P>
<P>
"When you bomb a city, diplomatic institutions have to be ruled
out of the target list," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO wantonly attacked the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade with satellite-guided missiles at midnight on May 7,
killing three Chinese journalists and injuring more than 20 others
and devastating the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of missile attack on diplomatic institutions is
unprecedented in the history of diplomacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the "outdated map" that NATO alleged to cause the
mistargeting, the Chinese diplomatic said that a map showing the
locations of all embassies in Belgrade is "easily available
everywhere" with a price of "3 or 4 dollars."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters on May 10
that the Central Intelligence Agency used a 1992 map for proposing
the bombing of the target, causing "the tragic mistake."
</P>
<P>
"Don't give a casual answer before a thorough and complete
investigation is carried out," He Yafei cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has put forward four demands to the U.S.-
led NATO -- an open and formal apology, a complete and thorough
investigation, prompt publication of the detailed results of the
investigation and severe punishment of those responsible for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have not seen any formal response to the four
demands," said He Yafei, adding that "The apology of the United
States is not enough," he added.

<HEADLINE> Govt Calls Philippines Only Venue for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora reiterated Thursday the government's position to
hold formal peace talks with rebels only in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Zamora made this clear following reports that the National
Democratic Front (NDF) insurgents and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) rebels have separately called for the holding of
peace negotiations with the government abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is here, why bring it abroad? We have always said
the talks should take place here. When has it been a condition
that issues concerning the Philippines should be held abroad?"
Zamora said in a radio interview this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is standing put on its position to
finish formal peace talks with the NDF before the end of this
year. NDF rebels have been holding negotiations with the
government since the administration of former President Corazon C.
Aquino.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, on the other hand, will meet with government peace
negotiators soon to set the agenda of their formal negotiations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the NDF insisted on holding peace talks in Belgium
while the MILF has reportedly said it wants to hold its
negotiations outside the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Zamora pointed out that there is no point in holding talks in
Belgium or in any other place abroad, because the peace problem is
an internal matter among Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said the condition set by the government to finish
the peace talks before this year ends is reasonable as the people
have long waited for total and lasting peace.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Basic Law Vital for Success of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will play a key role in the
construction and effective operation of the Macao SAR to be set up
on December 20 this year, a renowned law professor in Macao said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance of the Basic Law, Macao is going through
historic changes from colonial rule to a new era of Macao people
governing Macao and a high degree of autonomy," Ieong Wan Chong, a
law professor of the University of Macao, told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
The law was approved by the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China on March 31, 1993, following thorough discussions among
scholars from both Macao and the mainland areas of China. It
outlines the overall outlook of the SAR in political, economic,
cultural and social aspects.
</P>
<P>
On that same date, the NPC passed several decisions on handling
affairs related to the preparations for the establishment of the
Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Acting as vice-chairman of the Macao Basic Law Promotion
Association, Ieong said that in recent years he has been paying
special attention to publicizing the law and ensuring its full
implementation in the future Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see that the law and certain regulations have been
well observed in forming the Selection Committee for the first
government of the Macao SAR and nominating candidates for the
first chief executive of the SAR," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Between January 26 and February 14 this year, 2,291 Macao
residents applied to enter the 200-member Selection Committee. The
participation rate was high in view of the fact that Macao has a
population of 450,000.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee was formed on April 10 and has convened
two plenary meetings. At the second plenary meeting on May 7 and 8,
committee members raised scores of questions for each of the two
candidates for the first chief executive to answer.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates have been paying visits to social groups and
communities in Macao over the past weeks to promote their policies
to govern Macao if selected.
</P>
<P>
"It is unprecedented that local residents have such widespread
and enthusiastic participation in the affairs of Macao," Ieong
said, noting that the public appeal for impartiality, justice,
openness, democracy and honesty has been fully carried out in the
whole process of selecting the first chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, both the central government and the masses of
Macao residents have acquired a high sense of doing things
strictly in accordance with the Basic Law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The professor added that the smooth selection process will lay
a good foundation for the future chief executive to win trust from
the residents and deal with administrative affairs in accordance
with the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Although the two candidates have different blueprints for the
SAR if selected, both have stressed the importance of the Basic

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman was killed and four
other civilians wounded Thursday morning in an Israeli shelling on
a village in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The woman was killed when some 20 shells fired by Israeli
forces landed in the village of Houla in the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon. Another four villagers were injured
by the fragment of classes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli shelling came as a retaliation for previous attacks
by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on its two positions
inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties raised to two the number of Lebanese
civilians killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Another 37 civilians were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli
forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- One person has died while three
suspected cases of the viral haemorragic fever, a disease almost
identical to the Ebola virus, have been reported in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare of
Zimbabwe, all three cases had reported a history of having
recently travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the
Herald newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement Wednesday night that one of
the sick people died Wednesday morning while the other two were
alive but in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The disease has also been reported in neighboring Namibia which
has confirmed the emergence of the bubonic plague in the north of
the country bordering with Angola.
</P>
<P>
Three people have died and at least another seven are in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The first case of the fever was reported in January and a total
of 68 cases have been reported from Durba in the Watsa Province in
the northeastern part of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three of the 68 people suspected to have had the disease
have died.
</P>
<P>
The signs and symptoms include headache, high fever, chills,
vomiting, diarrhoea, and internal and external bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Transmission is person-to-person by direct contact with
infected blood, secretions, organs or semen while there is no
treatment or vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has recommended that should one suspect any of the
signs and symptoms of the disease, all patients should be isolated
and strict barrier nursing methods must be practised.
</P>
<P>
"All people travelling to and from the DRC are requested to be
on the alert," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry has put all health centers on the alert
while the army medical directorate has been informed and put on

URUMQI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living below
the poverty line in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region has dropped from 1.43 million in 1994 to 520,000, according
to the latest statistics.

Increased agricultural production remains the most realistic
method of helping the people of Xinjiang to a better life, and
efforts have also been made to develop the sales of agricultural
and sideline products and improve markets in the region.

The local government has given preference to poverty-stricken
counties in arranging investment in the sectors of water control,
electricity, and roads, an official said.

New technology has been widely used to promote production,
including the planting of high-yield cotton and the renovation of
old fruit orchards, and about 600,000 people have received
technical training annually over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have been paid off. Statistics show that the

<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- AIDS has killed 69 Sri Lankans so
far since the first detection of an AIDS patient in the country in
1986, said the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were issued by the National Sexually Transmitted

Swarna Kodagoda, executive director of Alliance Lanka, said Sri
Lanka still appeared to be a slow prevalence country but is made
vulnerable by the protracted civil war and widespread circular
migration both inside the country and internationally.

Sri Lanka has been plagued by a civil war since 1983 between
the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
rebels who demand a Tamil homeland in the north and east of the
country.

Sri Lanka is also a tourist paradise, attracting tens of
thousands of visitors each year.

International HIV/AIDS Alliance based in London, is scheduled to
hold a candle light memorial Thursday to commemorate the lives
lost to AIDS.

<HEADLINE> "I Do Not Intend to Retire Yet": Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe has said he
does not intend to retire yet and dispelled reports that the
ruling party ZANU-PF politburo had agreed that he will not contest
the next presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
He will decide on his own when to retire and no one should
design the way he should leave politics and the government, he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I know the door through which I came into politics and I know
the door I should use to go out of politics," Mugabe told
reporters at a press conference in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to recent press reports that the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)
politburo had agreed to a comprehensive plan for his retirement
which was expected to see him announce at the end of this year
that he will not contest the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, 75, told the reporters he was not aware of such a plan
and that no one should dictate the way he should retire.
</P>
<P>
When told that the politburo plan envisaged the same exit for
him as the one taken by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere,
Mugabe said, "I thought I was Robert Mugabe and not Julius
Nyerere. I do things in my own way, the Robert Mugabe way."

<HEADLINE> China Develops Long-Lasting Luminous Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
new luminous material which can give off light for more than 12
hours.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the
new material is being used at the ongoing '99 World Horticulture
Exposition in Kunming, capital of southwestern China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Experiments have shown that after the material absorbs daylight
for ten minutes, it can give off light for more than 12 hours at
night, much longer than other luminous materials.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say this process of absorbing and emitting light can
be constantly repeated, and the material has a life expectancy of
more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The special luminous material was jointly developed by
scientists at Qinghua University in Beijing and the Xinli Group
Company in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the new energy-saving material emits no radiation,
is environmentally safe, and has passed examination by the Sichuan
Environmental Management and Monitoring Center.

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have finished
repairing the eastern section of the Great Wall after more than
six months of effort.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the gate tower of Shanhaiguan Pass,
and a score of other structures distributed along the 26 kilometer
eastern section of the Great Wall were repaired during the
reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Consumption in Northeast China Province Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The sales volume of social
consumption goods in northeast China's Liaoning Province rose 8
percent, reaching 38.5 billion yuan (4.6 billion U.S. dollars) for
the first quarter, six percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics
said the main reason for the increase can be attributed to the
private economy, rather than the public economy. The sales volume
of consumption goods for the public and collective economies in
the first quarter were 5.55 billion and 3.45 billion yuan, down 6.
4 percent and 12.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the private economy rose by 27 percent, and
the Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan invested economy rose by 92
percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said that high-quality and new products still have
great potential. For example, the sales of shoes fell by 1.7
percent, while those of the brand-name sports shoes increased by
31 percent.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a growing demand for newly developed
electrical appliances, while the demand for VCD equipment
increased by 30 percent, and microwave ovens by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, business at chain stores and supermarkets has been
extremely good due to their large stock of consumer goods and
competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that the decrease of the retail price indexes by
3.5 percent in the first quarter has made it more difficult for
the provincial government to promote marketing. However, a further
rise in domestic demand will maintain a stable and sustained
increase.

<HEADLINE> American Author Mourns over 3 Chinese Journalists' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ron Kovic, an American author
and Vietnam War veteran, said here Wednesday that President Bill
Clinton should express contrition and promise stop bombing
Yugoslavia in his apology for the attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia that killed three Chinese correspondents and wounded 20
other persons.
</P>
<P>
"Without this contrition and ending of the bombing, there is no
formal apology," said Ron Kovic, author of the non-fiction "Born
on the Fourth of July," which was made into a famous motion
picture in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who was paralyzed during the Vietnam War and has been in
wheelchair for 30 years, made these remarks in a brief meeting
with diplomats at the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles,
when he called to express his condolences with the families of
those killed in the embassy attack.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make a formal apology that our government doesn't
seem to do," he said. "I want to make this heartfelt apology to
the people of China in the name of the American people."
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know that many Americans oppose the bombing
policy of their government," he told Chinese reporters. "Our
voices may not be as loud as the bombs in Belgrade, the NATO
military commanders, the U.S. president and (Secretary of State)
Madeleine Albright, or those on television, but we do deeply care
about peace and we're strongly opposed to the use of force and
violence, and we want to live in a peaceful world and make friends
with the people in China."
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy of the U.S. government in bombing
Yugoslavia is detrimental to world peace. "We want a new century
of peace and not of war," he said. "We want our leaders to be
peace-makers and not war-makers. Stop bombing in Yugoslavia and
we've got to become civilized members of the community of nations.
"
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who now lives in Los Angeles working on a new book, said
he plans to travel to Washington and the United Nations to push
forward his peace mission.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sets Aside Budget to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has allocated
1.5 billion baht (41.1 million U.S. dollars) to boost its fight
against AIDS in the next fiscal year, a source from the Public
Health Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on AIDS, chaired by Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, approved the budget for 2000, the same amount as in
the current year.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry doubted whether this amount of money
will be enough, an aide to Deputy Public Health Minister Khamron
Na Lamphoon said.
</P>
<P>
A recent report on the AIDS situation in Thailand has revealed
that men still face far greater risks, or four times as likely as
women, to get infected by the HIV virus and die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent people with AIDS were infected by the HIV virus
through sexual intercourse, with the rest getting the disease
because of drug addiction and other causes.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.5-billion-baht budget, some 54 percent would be spent
on patients currently suffering from HIV and the rest would go to
try and prevent those infected with HIV from developing symptoms,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hoped to cut costs in non-core projects to boost
efficiency in the battle against AIDS and the HIV virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the government budget, the World Bank has also
provided 90 million baht (2.46 million dollars) to Thai
non-governmental organizations in six regions badly hit by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Since AIDS was first detected in Thailand in 1984, some 30,008
people have died of the fatal disease, while 109,000 are infected.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is to appoint committees to probe the alleged
financial mismanagement in former Provincial Councils administered
by the main opposition United National Party, the official Daily
news reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Provincial Councils Alavi Moulana told the paper
Wednesday evening that the five provincial councils are North
Western, North Central, Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa.
</P>
<P>
These provinces are under the control of the ruling People's
Alliance (PA) following its victory in elections early last month.
</P>
<P>
These committees will comprise three members, each two of whom
will be lawyers and the third the secretary to the committee, the

He alleged that there had been large scale politicization of
these five Provincial Councils which had resulted in willful
detention of funds which ought to have been disbursed for the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Trade Exhibition in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is planning to hold a
single country trade exhibition in Perth, Australia, to further
bilateral trade ties, trade officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has increased remarkably in
recent years and this trend should be continued in favor of Sri
Lanka in the future, they said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Sri Lanka's exports to Australia were a mere 2,398
million rupees (53.29 million U.S. dollars) but by 1997 it had
amounted to 11,725 million rupees (195 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was because the Australian business community had realized
that Sri Lanka was the gateway to South Asia and that establishing
ventures in Sri Lanka was important, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the second largest investor in Sri Lanka after
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Perth show would be an ideal
opportunity for Sri Lankan exporters to explore new markets in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Business meetings between delegations of the two countries are
also being planned to promote business links.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Ouster Sparks Concern Among Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
on Wednesday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's move to
dismiss the government of Yevgeny Primakov might bring new tension
to the country's already unstable political situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ukraine Interfax News Agency, Kuchma also
expressed his regret over Primakov's dismissal, saying that
Primakov's ouster would cause negative impact on the Russian
political situation and the relations between the two countries..
</P>
<P>
Primakov's dismissal and the impeachment against Yeltsin in the
State Duma would make the political situation more acute in Russia,
added the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's move to sack the entire government early Wednesday
also reportedly sparked widespread concern among its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstani Deputy Prime Minister Alievich Djandosov described
on Wednesday the Russian government's ouster as "a serious event,"
saying that Kazakhstan would respond with flexibility by closely
following the Russian situation.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistani presidential press secretary Sayadov said that no
matter how the political situation in Russia developed, Moscow
would always be an important strategic partner and ally of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistani government officials also regarded the Primakov's
departure as a "Russian internal affair," hoping that the newly-
formed government would be a "successful" one.

PHNOM PENH, May 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 overseas Chinese
and Chinese nationals living in Cambodia on Thursday morning held
a demonstration in Phnom Penh strongly protesting the missile
attack by the U.S.-led NATO on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and

Atlantic "terrorists" organization.

It pointed out that "Such kind of attack is a gross violation
of Chinese sovereignty and basic norms of international relations.

<HEADLINE> Leading Thai Companies Believe Economy Bottoming-Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A majority of leading companies in
Thailand believed that the Thai economy will stay the same or
improve over the next six months, The Nation Thursday published
the result of its own survey.
</P>
<P>
While there were no absolute majority of respondents to the
survey, which was co-conducted by Capital Nomura Securities Plc
and The Nation in April, that expected either an improvement or a
deterioration in the economy, it was clear that the majority
believed the economy has bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 percent of the respondents of the survey, which covered
200 of the 500 top companies by revenue in Thailand, envisaged a
deterioration in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Asked what is the appropriate level for the baht against the
U.S. dollar, the response was strong but broad, with answers
ranging from 25 baht to 50 baht to one dollar. The most common
answer was 40 baht, a small depreciation from the current level.
</P>
<P>
About 46 percent of the companies that responded expected the
economy to improve in the next six months, with about 43 percent
anticipating it will stay the same.
</P>
<P>
"The results indicated widespread confidence that the outlook
is, at least, stable," The Nation commented.
</P>
<P>
Chemical companies were the most optimistic, followed by banks
and finance firms. No individual group had a net expectation that
the economy will deteriorate, but the property and construction
sector was the most bearish, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of companies also expected prime lending rates and
the average selling price of goods and services to be unchanged
over the next two quarters.

YANGON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop on precursor
control for the chemical industry is being held here under a
six-country (China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam)
memorandum of understanding on cooperation in drug control in the

He said his party always supports China's position on solving
the Kosovo crisis which calls for an end to NATO bombing against
Yugoslavia as precondition.

<P>
TIRANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said here Wednesday that the military alliance would
continue its airstrikes on Yugoslavia until NATO demands were met.
</P>
<P>
NATO demanded the full withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces
from Kosovo, a Serb province mostly populated by ethnic Albanians
seeking for independence, and deployment of NATO-dominated
international troops in the troubled province.

<P>
Solana, who is on a brief visit to Albania and Macedonia, said
that NATO's air raids on Tuesday were the fiercest since it
started the military operation on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The bombing had cut electrical supplies to 16 Yugoslav cities
and destroyed many military targets, television stations and other
industrial establishments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said the military bloc will soon attack
Yugoslavia with Apache helicopters.
</P>
<P>
NATO has already deployed more than 20 Apache helicopters in
Albania aimed at destroying ground targets such as tanks.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Socialist Party Leader Condemns NATO's Attack on Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Romanian
Socialist Party Tudor Mohora on Wednesday strongly condemned
NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in which three
people were killed and over 20 injured.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the party leader said
NATO's act was a blatant aggression on China and the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's bombing on sovereign Yugoslavia has already
violated the fundamental norms of international law and upset the
world order established by worldwide joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy is unprecedented in the
history of international diplomacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
More and more countries and people in the world have realized
the true nature of the military alliance, he said, adding that
NATO's prestige has now lowered to a historical low.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that NATO is an immoral aggressor organization
showing total disrespect for human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said China's position on the Kosovo crisis is righteous and
has won widespread appreciation of the peace-loving people.
</P>
<P>
Mohora urged NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia immediately, take
all responsibility for the attack on the Chinese Embassy and
punish the perpetrators.

<P>
HEFEI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a program to
cultivate environmental protection awareness among 150,000 pupils
in several provinces of the country by encouraging each of them to
grow trees with seedlings they breed themselves.

The program makes it possible for the pupils go through the
entire process of tree growth, from seed to full-grown tree, as a
way for them to develop an understanding of the importance of
protecting trees.

The trees grown by the pupils are being called "trees of life."
The seeds of the trees are provided by a Canada-based company. The
activity is being staged in several Chinese cities including
Beijing and this capital of Anhui Province.

This activity is part of the country's diversified
environmental protection campaign, which includes projects such as
pollution control in lakes and rivers and limiting engine exhaust
emissions.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua's SNLF Condemns Air Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's Sandinist National
Liberation Front (SNLF), the country's leading opposition party,
on Wednesday condemned NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The SNLF strongly condemns the criminal bombing of Yugoslavia,
committed by the military forces of NATO, under the visible and
indisputable leadership of the United States", said a statement
from the party.
</P>
<P>
The bombings of Yugoslavia are being performed in an
indiscriminate manner, hitting the civil population and non-
military targets, including diplomatic headquarters, such as that
of China, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Sandinist Front "supports the measures taken
by the Chinese government within the framework of the United
Nations and, on a bilateral level," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The SNLF said it considered the bombing to be criminal for
three reasons. Firstly, it flagrantly violated the United Nations'
Charter. Secondly, it flagrantly violated the statutes of NATO
itself, in which it states that NATO is an organization
subordinate to the U.N. And thirdly, it flagrantly violated its
own constitution which states that it is an organization of
defense, stressed the SNLF
</P>
<P>
"The SNLF condemns, once again, the use of force by any power
or military organization under whatever reason put forward,
including the so-called 'humanitarian reasons' which is now being
used by NATO in its campaign against Yugoslavia," added the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinist Front also put forward a statement to the
governments of the U.N. Security Council members, demanding an
immediate halt to the military aggression and the bombing of
Yugoslavia, and calling for dialogue among parties concerned to
find a political solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy Condemned in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Several organizations in Cuba on
Wednesday joined the world-wide wave of condemnation of NATO's
missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on the night
of May 7, which left three dead and more than 20 injured.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of Cuban Workers, representing some three
million members, sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy here,
denouncing the U.S.-led NATO and affirming support and respect for
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression demonstrated the disrespect and the violation
of the international law and the U.N. Charter by the Western
powers headed by the United States," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The American Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade
Unions also sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Havana,
condemning the NATO raid and expressing solidarity with the
Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
"We unite our voice with the voices of the workers of the world
whom we represent, to strongly condemn this barbarous and inhumane
attack," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the NATO governments, especially
Washington, are committing genocide in Yugoslavia, urging the U.N.
not to convert itself into "an entity that is being used by the
arms race of the United States and other powers."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Cuban Organization of Solidarity with
Africa, Asia and Latin America issued a public statement here in
stern condemnation of the NATO act, which it said constituted a
new scale in the systematic violation of the basic norms of
international law by NATO and its leader, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"No pretext can justify the uncivilized and inhumane actions of
NATO," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Italian "Grand Electors" to Elect New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian senators, deputies and
delegates from all the regions of Italy will begin Thursday
morning to vote for electing the country's 10th post-war president
who will succeed current president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
The 1,010 "grand electors" comprising 630 members of the Lower
House, 322 senators and the regional representatives will gather
Thursday at 9:00 am local time in the Chamber of Deputies for the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the proceedings will be the Italian Lower House
Speaker Luciano Violante, together with Senate Speaker Nicola
Mancino.
</P>
<P>
The Italian constitution states that on the first or second
ballots for electing the new president, a two-thirds majority of
673 votes will be needed. If two rounds of ballot failed to elect
the new president who will serve in this ceremonial and honorable
post for 7 years, the last third ballot will be lowered to the
simple majority of 505 votes.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi emerged as the most likely candidate to become Italy's next
president, with both the governing majority and the opposition
Freedom Front rallying around his candidature.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said at a press conference
Wednesday evening that "extensive and significant agreement is
emerging on the candidature of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, he enjoys
widespread support."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the treasury minister's election would
represent "a positive event for both the institutions of this
country and the country itself."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that the opposition's willingness to "vote
together with the governing center-left majority on the new
president was a very important political fact and a novelty."
</P>
<P>
His comments came soon after opposition chiefs said that during
Thursday's first round of voting, they would be backing the 78-
year-old minister.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi is generally recognized as the key architect of the
consolidation of Italy's public finances, enabling the country to
qualify for Economic and Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, he was named head of the International
Monetary Fund's actual executive board of Interim Committee,
making him the first Italian to hold the second powerful post in
IMF history.
</P>
<P>
The minister also served as Bank of Italy Governor from 1979 to
1983, Premier from 1993 to 1994, and Deputy Chairman of the Bank
for International Settlements from 1994 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> 1.8 Million Disabled Chinese Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China helped 1.8 million poor
disabled people get basic means of subsistence through special
projects last year, further approaching a 2000-year goal of
poverty elimination among the disabled across the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, loans of up to 500 million yuan (60 million U.S.
dollars) were granted directly to 2.07 million poor disabled
people in 29 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 counties, cities and districts have established
special funds and projects for helping 1.32 million handicapped
people out of poverty, today's China Daily quoted Deng Pufang,
chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation and the China
Fund for the Handicapped, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deng told the 15th council meeting of the fund in Beijing
yesterday that the country has been implementing regulations for
helping disabled people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
About 170,000 disabled people in the country got jobs under the
regulations last year, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Among 60 million disabled people in China, some are still
struggling against poverty mainly due to inadequate employment
opportunities and meager incomes.

<HEADLINE> Merger to Create No.2 Bank in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Equitable Banking
Corp. and two state-run pension and benefits funds acquired
Wednesday for 31.8 billion pesos (795 million U.S. dollars) 72
percent share holdings in Philippine Commercial International Bank
(PCIBank), Business World reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, after the merger, a PCIBank-Equitable
Bank combination will form the second largest local bank in the
country, next only to Metrobank, both in terms of assets and
capital.
</P>
<P>
A stock purchase agreement was signed Wednesday by officials of
the four financial institutions involved -- Equitable, PCIBank,
Government Service Insurance System and Social Security System.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson witnessed the
formalization of what is considered the biggest merger ever in the
local banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Based on first quarter statements of condition, Equitable Bank
ranks 11th in terms of assets with 103.786 billion pesos (2.595
billion U.S. dollars) and fifth in terms of capital with 16.342
billion pesos (409 million U.S. dollars).
</P>

biggest in terms of capital with 24.524 billion pesos (613 million
U.S. dollars).

<P>
The paper quoted analysts as saying that Equitable Bank's
acquisition will put pressure on other banks to engage in a
similar size-enhancing merger and acquisition activities.

<HEADLINE> Gold-Ornaments Sell Well in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ten tons of gold ornaments such as
necklaces, rings and earrings are expected to be sold in Shanghai
this year, nearly the same level as in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had been seeing a rise in the sales of gold pieces
since 1982, when the country started to open the market for such
items.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume set a record high of 22 tons in 1993, and then
decreasing gradually until 1995. Over the past four years the
volume has remained around 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has been making efforts to bring its sales systems and
services in this sector in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The market price in Shanghai is 118 yuan for one gram of gold,
slightly higher than overseas prices because of increased taxes.
</P>
<P>
Varieties of traditional items like necklaces and rings have
been substantially increased in the Shanghai market, where
platinum pieces, including those inlaid with diamonds, are new
favorites among the local people.
</P>
<P>
The people's growing interest in gold pieces and mementos is
attributed to latest consumption fashion and gradually increasing
living standards.
</P>
<P>
Insiders are optimistic about the prospect for sales of these
items in Shanghai, one of the country's top ten gold-ornament
consumers, though annual per capita gold consumption is only 0.2
grams in Shanghai, much lower than the 9.21 grams in Hong Kong and
9.96 grams in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Moves Towards Premier Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A scoreless draw has enabled the
Manchester United to strengthen their grip on the English premier
league, but the defeated Blackburn Rovers were relegated on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 0-0 draw at Ewood Park leaves the United going into the
final game of the season against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford
with a single point advantage over Arsenal who play Aston Villa at
Highbury.
</P>
<P>
United have 76 points against Arsenal's 75 with better goal
difference of plus one.
</P>
<P>
The irony on the night was that Rovers, champions in 1995, were
relegated at home turf by United.
</P>
<P>
In a game of few incidents Ryan Giggs came closest to scoring
in the 10th minute with a header that came back off the post.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cole also forced Rovers goalkeeper John Filan into a good
save with a low 34th minute effort.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Crashed in Italian Open Second-rounder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras suffered a surprising
defeat against a qualifier from Brazil as he bowed out the Italian
Open in the second round on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras who surrendered his top ranking last week, was beaten 6-
3, 6-1 by Brazilian qualifier Fernando Meligeni on Rome's slow red
clay, after dropping his serve in the opening game of the first
set and then again in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
The American pulled a game back immediately but Meligeni again
broke serve in the ninth, clinching the set after 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost the first seven points of the second set as the
world number 58 raced into a 3-0 lead and then squandered two
break points in the fifth to trail 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Meligeni broke serve in the sixth game to wrapp up his biggest
victory to date after one hour and six minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sitting here disgusted with the way I played,"
Sampras said. "I don't know what my first serve percentage was but
it must have been in the thirties (30 percent) or less and that's
my best shot."
</P>
<P>
Meligeni, whose best grand slam performance was reaching the
fourth round of last year's French Open, said he was surprised how
easily Sampras crumbled.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning he made a lot of mistakes on the first serve
and I started returning very well," the Brazilian said. "To beat
the world number two, who for me is still the world number one, is
amazing."
</P>
<P>
Current number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov and former world number
one Andre Agassi both underlined their return to form with
impressive 6-1 6-2 victories earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> NATO Feels Hard to Go in War Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- As the NATO's air strike against
Yugoslavia entered into the 50th day on Wednesday, A NATO
spokesman said here that the alliance needs to show perseverance
and patience since the Yugoslav forces still demonstrate strong
enough in its resistance operations.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, told a daily news briefing that
the air war "would not be an overnight wonder. "This is not
instant coffee. We knew that we were up against a very cinycal
person, a very strong military machine, well dug in Kosovo and
with a great array of forces, paramilitaries, military police and
so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why NATO could not make significant progress in its
air campaign, the spokesman said the alliance decided from the
outset that it was not going to use all of the means at its
proposal in order to avoid collateral damage. "We would have to
demonstrate a little bit of perseverance, a little bit of
patience," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea also said the NATO's first objective is to degrade
capacity of the Yugoslav forces. "First of all we had to start
with the air defence system, clearly that was important."
</P>
<P>
"NATO military commanders always made it clear that that have
to be severely degraded and diminished so that we could operate
with relative safety over the skies of Yugoslavia and we never
underrated the capacity of the Yugoslav air defence system," Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
The 50-day air war has seen so far many civilian casualties,
which is termed by NATO as collateral damage, and the worst
refugee situation during 50 years of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
In terms of international law, particularly The Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations, NATO's attack of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade last Friday was the most serious event so far
during the war against Yugoslavia, in which three Chinese
journalist who stayed there for safety were killed when three NATO
missiles precisely hit the diplomatic mission.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Athlete Aims at 5,000 Meter World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Daniel Komen said here
Wednesday that he was determined to reclaim the 5,000 meters world
record from his Ethiopian rival Haile Gebrselassie this season.
</P>
<P>
Komen, holder of the 3,000 meters world outdoor and indoor
records, said that although the task was hard but he was working
equally hard to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
Komen has been training at a high-altitude camp in Nyahururu,
near Mount Kenya, for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Experienced steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui is head coach at the
camp. Other members of the coaching team include Olympian Joseph
Chesire and Jimmy Beautah, a former high school coach in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Komen said he saw the 5,000 meters record tumbling during the
season, probably after the world championships in Spain in August.
</P>
<P>
"I want to strike (the record) so hard," Komen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his aim was to put the record well beyond the
reach of Gebrselassie who set the mark of 12 minutes 39.36 seconds
in June in Helsinki, Finland.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling while
broader stock indexes rising in reaction to resignation of
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 25.78 at 11,000.37. The index rose 18.90 at
11,026.15 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plunged after word of Rubin's resignation crossed news
wires, falling as much as 213 points. Rubin is seen as a key
player in the stock market's historic eight-year advance.
</P>
<P>
The index regained the ground but could not move out the
negative territory at the closing session after senior Clinton
administration officials said Lawrence Summers, Rubin's deputy,
would be nominated to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's resignation also pushed broader stock indexes down but
the immediate appointment of Summers helped the indexes to climb
into positive territory. The technology heavy Nasdaq index closed
up 39.86 at 2,606.54 while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose
8.39 at 1,364.00.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.91 at 647.68 and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 9.06 to 798.35. The Russell 2000
index of smaller companies rose 2.45 at 449.26
</P>

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,377 up, 1,657 down and 528
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Secretary Rubin Resigns and Summers Succeeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin is stepping down and President Clinton nominated Rubin's
deputy, Lawrence Summers, to succeed him on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a Rose Garden ceremony, said Rubin has been
acclaimed as the most effective treasury secretary since Alexander
Hamilton, the first man to hold the job. "I will miss his cool
head and steady hand," Clinton said. "He cares very deeply about
the impact of abstract economics on ordinary people."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton also lavished praise on Summers, a former
Harvard University professor who oversaw the administration's
efforts to stem the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president announced the changes at a ceremony attended by
members of his Cabinet and the Congress, including Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was hard for him to leave, because of his
commitment to the administration. But he said his 6 and half years
in Washington had been "all consuming" and that it was time to
return to his home in New York. He said he would leave his job
around July 4.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department,
was chosen by Clinton to replace Summers as second in command at
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, a former investment banker, and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan were widely credited by Wall Street and business
leaders with the policies that set the U.S. economy on its longest
peacetime expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton took office, unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the
nation's budget deficit was at 255 billion dollars and the Dow
Jones industrial average was below 4,000.
</P>
<P>
But Unemployment now is at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a
budget surplus this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's departure was not unexpected. It has long been rumored
that the former investment banker, who made 26 million dollars in
private life with the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. the
year before joining the administration in 1993, wanted to return
to private life.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration officials said Rubin, 60, discussed his
decision with Clinton "within the past week" and said Rubin's
decision was fueled solely by his desire to return to private
life.
