<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Reform Package Meant to Rescue Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Struggling in the mire of
financial crisis, Thailand made a fresh move to stimulate its
economy by announcing a package of bank reform measures Friday.
Some analysts said it is the last hope of the government to rescue
the once roaring tiger of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the Bank of Thailand, the country's central
bank, took over two more commercial banks, which failed to
recapitalize before the deadline of August 14 as agreed by the
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Five more financial companies were also taken over by the
central bank as they "become insolvent and cannot carry on their
normal operation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government had already taken over four
commercial banks and seven financial companies.
</P>
<P>
More than 14.8 billion baht (370 million U.S. dollars) in
shareholders' equity for the seven institutions was written down
against bad loans, with par value of shares reduced from 10 baht
(0.25 dollar) to one satang (0.00025 dollar).
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, these institutions must recapitalize to meet legal
adequacy requirements. The process is expected to be completed in
20 days.
</P>
<P>
As part of the package, the government will also inject 300
billion baht (7.5 billion dollars) into the banking system for the
recapitalization of commercial banks which would create liquidity
in the cash-strapped economy of at least 3.6 trillion baht (90
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive reform package will also change the landscape
of the country's banking sector, reducing the number of banks from
16 to 12 through mergers and selling.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, the main architect of
the package, said it is the best he can get for the banking
system. The whole cabinet is counting on the package, hoping it
will solve the liquidity problems of the sector and finally ease
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The package is the latest of a series of measures introduced by
the Chuan Leekpai government to solve the problems of the finance
sector, which triggered the so-called financial crisis in July
last year.
</P>
<P>
The government permanently closed down 56 financial companies
last year, took over four banks and seven financial institutions
earlier this year and obtained support from Parliament to issue
domestic and international bonds.
</P>
<P>
However, all these measures failed to stop the deterioration of
the economy. Instead, the financial crisis showed its teeth,
dragging Thailand deeper into the mire.
</P>
<P>
As the government predicted recently, the country's economy is
expected to see a contraction of 6-7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the worsening economic situation has forced the
government to keep lowering its target for this year's economic
growth from one percent, minus three percent and minus 4-5.5
percent, to the present minus 6-7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Used to be one of the pillars of economic development during
the booming years, the export industry is now on the verge of
collapse, with the total value in dollar term down 4.1 percent in
the first half of this year compared to the same period last year,
despite a sharp depreciation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demands and purchasing power kept falling, which can
be seen from the sharp drop of imports of 38.1 percent during the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agreed that the ailing financial sector is the root of
all problems. With high non-performing loans, which require high
proportions of provisions, commercial banks are unable and
unwilling to extend loans to enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Friday's package is designed to address the key issues of the
financial sector, enabling banks to separate their good and bad
debts and allowing them to set up subsidiary companies to manage
the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
Once announced, the package received applause from local and
foreign bankers.
</P>
<P>
David Proctor, chairman of the Foreign Banks' Association, said
the package clarified the position of the local banks, which have
been taken over, resolved the uncertainty surrounding other small
banks and weak finance companies, supported an increase in capital
at the larger banks and enabled a quicker restructuring of
corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
The IMF praised Thailand's move, which is seen as one of the
region's most comprehensive financial restructuring programs,
saying the country is on the threshold of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The local markets also welcomed the package. The Stock Exchange
of Thailand index Friday jumped 12.75 points, or 5.5 percent,
while the baht also strengthened to 41.75 against the dollar from
42 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the implementation of the package
may kick-start the economy in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still too early to tell how effective the
package will be. Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai also warned shortly
after the package was announced that it is no wonder cure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said whether the package will rescue the
country's economy as the government expected depends on how well
it is implemented.

<HEADLINE> China Beats U.S. in U-18 Basketball Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, Northern China, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The more
determined Chinese Under-18 girls national team won an impressive
and hard fighting exhibition game in overtime against the
visiting national junior team of the United States here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Center Chen Lisha made a last-second layup to tied the scores
at 68-68 for China at the end of the regular time, and led her
Chinese teammates to a come-from-behind win of 81-77 in the extra
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Chen sunk two free-throws and made a crucial steal late in the
overtime to give China a 79-75 lead.
</P>
<P>
The home team jumped to a 7-0 lead early in the game but soon
blew their lead as the tough American girls took over the lead
and led 32-31 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
It was the first game after the Chinese girls came back from a
36-day tour in the United States, where they finished with a 19-2
record in matches against high school and college teams.
</P>
<P>
"We're as good as we were in the U.S.," said Chinese head
coach Xiong Yan, "We played good defense tonight."
</P>
<P>
It was a hard-fighting game as players scrambled on the floor
for the loss ball time to time.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed as we lost," said the American head coach
Nell Fortner, who coached the Americans national team to win the
title at the World Women's Basketball Championship last May in
Berlin of Germany.
</P>
<P>
"They have some good three-pointer shooters, they are younger
and talented." Fortner added.
</P>
<P>
The American team will face the Chinese Women's national side
on Monday before they are heading to Chinese Taipei for the
annual Dr. William Jones Cup tournament there.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Hungarian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher of Germany
won the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday and closed the gap with
Mika Hakkinen in the Formula One championship.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, cheering by thousands of German and Ferrari fans
blowing horns and setting off fire crackers. took the lead nearly
two-thirds into the 77-lap race, after all leading drivers went
into the pits for the second time.
</P>
<P>
But Schumacher was using a three-stop strategy. With less fuel
to weigh it down, Schumacher's Ferrari gained more than a second
per lap over all the rivals.
</P>
<P>
By the time Schumacher went in for his third pit stop, he was
far ahead that he easily went out again before he could be
overtaken.
</P>
<P>
"Today's race was ideal for the championship, at least from my
point of view," said Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's fifth victory of the season gave him 10 points
and left him trailing Hakkinen by only seven points with four
races left in the year.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen, the McLaren-Mercedes driver who led from the pole
until lap 46 when he went to the pit and Schumacher took over,
dropped back to sixth, one lap behind Schumacher, and collected
only one point.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher now has 70 points, while Hakkinen has 77.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard was second, while
Jacques Villeneuve, last year's winner here and Formula One
champion, finished third for the second race in a row in a
Williams.

<HEADLINE> Rebels in Congo (K) Form Anti-govt Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- As Congolese rebels continue
their advance in eastern and western fronts, they launched a
coalition movement Sunday called the Congolese Democratic
Coalition (CDC), Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The movement was created at the rebel headquarters in Goma in
eastern Congo (K) where an army mutiny was staged two weeks ago,
in an aim to topple President Laurent Kabila, Jacques Deplace,
CDC's Secretary, told RNA, which sent a dispatch to Xinhua based
in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
the movement has a nine-member Executive Council headed by a
coordinator, and it has four military commanders and four
civilians. Their names will be made public soon, Deplace was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Deplace, the movement has created seven
departments under it, which include those for External Relations,
Internal Administration and Finance.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the movement followed a meeting by more than
20 politicians and military leaders who have been regrouped into
the CDC, said Deplace, who added that the movement remains open
and others could join it.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Banyamulenge Tutsis rebelled on August 2 in
Kinshasa and the east, and they now have launched offensives from
two fronts in the east and the west, vowing to depose President
Kabila, accusing him of mismanagement, corruption and nepotism.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Sunday Urged the parties involved in the Northern
Ireland peace agreement signed in April to continue to pursue
peace and stability there following a huge bomb blast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on his behalf by the Foreign Ministry,
Mandela expressed his "profound shock and utter dismay" at the
bomb blast in the Northern Irish town of Omagh Saturday
afternoon, in which at least 28 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge the people of the United Kingdom and Ireland and
the leaders and parties involved in the Good Friday agreement to
continue to pursue its aims for peace and stability even more
steadfastly and not allow this repulsive act to deter them,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming positive results in the recent Irish
referendums showed a determined desire for peace rather than
conflict and violence. So much goodwill and faith should not be
lost to the mindless violence of a few," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela expressed sympathy on behalf of all South Africans to
the families of those who were killed and wished the injured a
speedy recovery.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Zimbabweans Deported from S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Close to 10,000 Zimbabweans who
illegally settled in South Africa were deported between February
and July this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency over the
weekend, chief inspector of Matabeleland South Police in southern
Zimbabwe Helmand Shoko said there was an increase in this year's
figures compared to the same period last year in which 8,745
Zimbabweans were deported from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, he attributed the increase to the availability of
many crossing points along the 230-kilometer stretch of the
Limpopo River which had very little water due to erratic rains.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been an increase in the number of deportees,
with an average of 100 to 200 being ejected daily.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of border jumpers is really a vicious circle
because as some of them walk home, some cross the border back
into South Africa and the circle continues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Boosts Morale of Anti-Flood Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The recent tour by President Jiang
Zemin to central China's Hubei Province, one of the worst-hit
areas, provided a morale boost for the people fighting against
surging floods on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Jiang came to the city of Shashi, a dangerous section upriver
from Wuhan on the Yangtze River, on August 13 and issued a general
mobilization order for the whole party, the whole army and the
people of China soon after he arrived.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended cordial regards to workers reinforcing or
patroling the main embankment of the Yangtze and asked details
about anti-flood efforts in the blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
Then Jiang went to Guanyinji, a key point on the Yangtze River
at the Jingjiang section, encouraging repair crews to redouble
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, he mounted the dike made of sand-filled bags near
Longwang Temple where the Yangtze and Hanjiang rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
Before Jiang's arrival, Wen Jiabao, vice-premier and head of
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters came to
Hubei to direct rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
In the days of combating devastating floods, Jiang called Wen
every day to inquire about the flood situation and to direct the
anti-flood fight.
</P>
<P>
When the fourth flood crest rushed downstream on Aug. 7, Jiang
held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee to hear reports of the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the three generations
of the Party Central leadership have concerned themselves with the
taming of China's major rivers, and the third generation of the
CPC leadership have, too, taken safety along the Yangtze River to
heart and attached great importance to harnessing the major rivers
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Hikes to Result in Hardships in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) Sunday expressed concern at the rise in the price of
fuel, saying it was going to trigger price increases of basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
UP spokesman Isaac Manyemba told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
the price hike was going to have such a knock-on effect on prices
of all goods and services to the extent that even salary
increments already awarded or those still going to be awarded
would be submerged by triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the price of leaded petrol went up by 13.5 percent
and diesel rose by 20.5 percent in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Manyemba said, ''it is clear that some workers are going to
find themselves worse off. The net result is that most families
in the low income bracket are going to be unable to afford basic
needs like education, health and food.''
</P>
<P>
He said the devaluation of the Zimbabwean Dollar had also made
life very difficult for many.
</P>
<P>
Pressure had been mounting on the government to review the
fuel pricing system which was weighing heavily against the
national oil company of Zimbabwe which was selling both petrol
and diesel to traders below cost, resulting in the company
accumulating losses of about 150 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Media Vow Omagh Bomb Not to Derail Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- British newspapers Sunday
unanimously condemned the Omagh bomb which killed 28 and injured
220, declaring that renegade republicans blamed for the blast must
be hunted down while Northern Ireland's peace process must not be
rederailed.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times called on British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern to crack down on the "Real
IRA," the dissident republican group being blamed for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called Real IRA, which lives in an unreal world that no
sane person would want to share, must be crushed.
</P>
<P>
"If emergency laws are needed, let them be introduced. If
internment is judged necessary, let the suspects be rounded up
without delay," the Sunday Times said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph struck a warning note, saying that "after
Omagh it can never be doubted that those opposed to a settlement
have the means and organization to kill and maim in the name of
their deranged objectives."
</P>
<P>
"Savage and Evil," was the headline in the Sunday Mirror.
"Bloody Saturday" was the verdict of the Mail Sunday. The News of
the World said it was "time to stop the evil bombers."
</P>
<P>
There were calls for the Northern Ireland peace process,
overwhelmingly approved this past May by referendums on both sides
of the Irish border, "not to be allowed to become a casualty of
the bomb."
</P>
<P>
"What happened at Omagh will not weaken the peace process,"
declared the Sunday Mirror. "On the contrary, it must strengthen
the determination of everyone on both sides to make it work."
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday stated, "The killings will continue,
but so will the peace process. The virtue of hope will ultimately
triumph over the vice of despair."
</P>
<P>
The Express Sunday had a message for Northern Ireland's
Protestant first minister and his Catholic deputy. "We urge David
Trimble and Seamus Mallon... to seize the political initiative and
show there is a path back from the brink of hell."

<HEADLINE> UK's Small Businesses Show Low Morale for Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Confidence among Britain's small
businesses has tumbled in the past three months, highlighting
further evidence of a slowing economy, according to a Sunday Times
poll.
</P>
<P>
Among firms with between 20 and 49 workers, the percentage that
are more optimistic than three months ago has fallen from 62
percent to 43 percent while those that are less optimistic has
grown from 5 percent to 22 percent. This means the positive
balance in favor of optimism has collapsed from 57 to 21.
</P>
<P>
While the change in sentiment among micro firms is less
extreme, the positive balance in favor of optimism has fallen from
18 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times quoted Dr Stephan Buck, who did the research,
as saying, "The important thing is the trend. In April the larger
end of the sector was more optimistic than its smaller
counterparts. Now there is little difference."
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,000 small firms employing up to 50 full-time
workers was done by Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research
company. It was published in Taylor Nelson's quarterly Business
Line.
</P>
<P>
Confidence has fallen across industry, but particularly in
manufacturing, where 32 percent of those polled are less
optimistic compared with 17 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Further signs of gloom for small firms come in Euler Trade
Indemnity's quarterly Financial Trends survey, which revealed a
sharp increase in late payment. Small firms have six times the
number of overdue invoices than larger counterparts.
</P>
<P>
William Simpson, a Euler Trade Indemnity economist, said, "The
proportion of overdue invoices is a shocker. It could be that the
people they are doing business with are facing pressures and
palming them off to improve their own situation."
</P>
<P>
Simpson's research highlighted an increase in canceled orders,
a sign of recession, and revealed overall activity is at its
lowest point since the last recession, while export payment delays
are at their highest since 1993.

<HEADLINE> UK' Rats Outnumber Humans to Cause More Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Rats now outnumber the human
population in Britain, a problem that has resulted in an
increasing number of complaints, according to a recent survey
published by the Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that there are more than 60 million rats
across the country, and they are crawling out of the sewers to
enjoy life above ground. The survey of local authorities in
England and Wales, carried out at the University of Surrey, showed
that there had been 40,000 extra complaints of domestic
infestation in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Local councils generally reported a substantial increase in
calls to people's homes. Mild winters and increased litter from
fast food outlets are thought to have contributed to the rise of
the rat, but primary blame is leveled at a crumbling sewerage
system which is allowing the rodents an escape route, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Battersby, the author of the report and founder of a
campaign to renew sewerage systems, said the problem stemmed from
lack of coordination between local authorities and water
companies. Between them they are responsible for rat baiting in
sewers, which has traditionally kept numbers down. Battersby's
survey found that one in 10 local authorities reported that there
was no rat culling going on.

<HEADLINE> Floods Endanger China's Largest Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Officers and soldiers of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were busy late today
building a third dam here to protect China's largest oilfield
after the second defense embankment collapsed Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The second defense embankment had a 15-meter-long rupture at
the Machangba section at 6:40 p.m. Saturday. Some 2,000 PLA
soldiers rushed to the scene in an attempt to block the raging
water with sandbags, according to reports reaching here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The rush repair lasted for nearly two hours. However, the dam
collapsed at 10:30 p.m. and workers withdrew from the scene. More
than 2,000 local residents were evacuated before the embankment
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
At present, PLA soldiers and oilfield workers have piled sand
bags two meters high at the five-kilometer-long third defense
embankment, half of the planned height.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 oil workers and their family members in Zhaoyuan
Farm and another 5,600 people at Tailai Farm on the western bank
of the Nenjiang River are still trapped by floods. They have no
power, water or food. Available boats could only transport 1,000
people to safety.
</P>
<P>
Shen Liguo, a senior official of the provincial bureau of state
farms, is organizing a rush evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Floods have inundated 1,217 oil wells at the Daqing
Oilfield. Among them, 527 wells were forced to close, reducing the
output by 6,821 tons, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest oilfield, Daqing turned out 60.9 million
tons of oil in 1997, half of the country's total production.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the Heiyutao Reservoir, 10 kilometers from
Daqing City, rose to 151 meters today, approaching the danger
mark. The reservoir has a capacity of 120 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
If the reservoir is breached, floodwater will roar into the
Daqing Oilfield, causing disastrous losses, an oilfield official
said.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Leave Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign nationals have started
leaving Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Congo in hundreds,
reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
French diplomats said 87 French nationals along with 80 other
foreigners arrived in Paris on Sunday morning and that 700
foreigners had registered to leave.
</P>
<P>
They left Kinshasa on Saturday evening by barge, crossing the
Congo river to Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Republic
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign nationals had to cross the river to Brazzaville
because French planes were not allowed to land in Kinshasa, some
diplomats claimed.
</P>
<P>
Other diplomats said 180 Belgians left by plane from Kinshasa
Saturday and that a further flight organized by Belgium, the
former colonial power was planned for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. flew out 130 foreign nationals Friday, including
about 50 Americans, but some diplomats have remained.
</P>
<P>
The departure of foreign nationals happened after a blackout
in Kinshasa on Thursday and Friday and the rebels claimed they
controled the key Inga hydroelectric power dam near Matadi and
threatened to advance on a position 150 km southwest of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
However, the Democratic Congolese government dismissed rebels'
claim, saying the dam is still in the hands of troops loyal to
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Didier Mumengi, speaking on state
television, rejected rebel claims that they were poised to march
on the capital.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of volunteers, many of them admittedly the young
and the unemployed of Kinshasa, have signed up to fight the
rebels of Congo's ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge minority, who
rebelled on August 2, vowing to topple President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels who have their
bases in eastern Congo bordering Rwanda, but Kigali denies the
charge.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kinshasa remained calm Saturday with
little overt sign of extra military activity.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Trapped Siberian Tigers Move to Safer Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- By noon today, all the 52
Siberian tigers trapped by rain-fed floods in northeast China have
been escorted to an animal breeding center 253 km away from this
capital city of Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
They were evacuated from a Siberian tiger breeding center
located 400 m. on the northern bank of the Songhua River, whose
water level keeps rising today as the largest flood crest on the
Nenjiang River is expected to reach Harbin on August 19.
</P>
<P>
Embankments of the Songhua River, downstream Nenjiang, had
experienced a number of dangerous situations since August
11. Hundreds of armymen and local residents reinforced the
embankments night and night and succeeded in protecting Siberian
tigers from flood menace.
</P>
<P>
Before the arrival of these rare guests, animal keepers cleaned
and sterilized their new dens and prepared them with a sumptuous
feast.
</P>
<P>
They will be sent back to their original habitat after the
floods recede, said a leading keeper of the new breeding center.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is one of the most endangered animals, with
only about 300 left in the wild. The species has been listed as one
of the top ten endangered species in the world.
</P>
<P>
China, which set up a Siberian tiger breeding center in 1986,
now has bred more than 100 tigers. The center in northeastern
Harbin was established in 1996 in order to train the tigers born
in captivity to adapt to life in the wild before they are returned
to their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
These tigers' endangered situation has aroused the concern of
the whole city. The local government has so far contributed
300,000 yuan (36,000 U.S. dollars) of special funds, and still
more is yet to be donated by tiger lovers.

<P>
LUANDA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos and his Congolese and Namibian counterparts Luarent
Kabila and Sam Nujoma held a summit meeting here Sunday to
discuss the current crisis in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The joint communique issued after the meeting said leaders of
the three countries are greatly concerned about the intensifying
military activities in Congo (K), considering it as a serious
threat to the stability in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers of the three nations are to be sent to
Harare, Zimbabwe, to continue discussing the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi Banyamulenge minority soldiers have, since August 2,
rebelled in the eastern part of Congo, causing a lot of
casualties and material losses, and a surge of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels and
even invading the country, but the two countries denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting of leaders of the three countries
in Luanda. on July 14, the three leaders met for the first time
to discuss the tense situation in Congo (K), but none of them
foresaw what would have happened in Congo in such a scale of
clashes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Israel Will Not Accept Just Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"As long as millions of Palestinian men, women and children are
away from their homeland and the Israeli regime bans them from
returning home, realization of a genuine peace in the Middle East is
impossible," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed as essential the harmony and unity among all
Islamic countries to confront Israel.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran is for peace and calm in the region, but
adding that peace will be ensured only when all people obtain their
legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, El-Sorour, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day
official visit, stressed the need of comprehensive efforts by the
Muslim world to confront the Israeli expansionist strategies.
</P>
<P>
El-Sorour also voiced Amman's readiness to consolidate its
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Arab talks have been deadlocked for more than a year
due to Israel's intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Iran were severed in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war due to Jordan's support for Iraq, but they were resumed three
years later.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iran still disagree about the Mideast peace process.
Jordan has signed a peace treaty with Israel, which is regarded by
Iran as the arch enemy in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Khatami also expressed regret over the involvement of
some foreign forces in the war-torn neighboring Afghanistan, where
fighting between the Taliban militia and its rival Northern Alliance
have recently intensified.
</P>
<P>
He did not name the foreign forces, but Pakistan is widely
believed to be behind the student militia, Taliban, which has won
control over most of Afghanistan and imposed a strict version of
Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Iranian diplomats and correspondent were alleged captured
by the Taliban after it swept into the Mazar-e-Sharif, a stronghold
of the opposition in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran will not tolerate instability along its
borders. But, he said, Tehran will continue its efforts to secure
the release of Iranians through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
El-Sorour said that Jordan understands Iran's concern over the
worsening situation in Afghanistan, but he said he believes that,
with the efforts of regional countries, an independent and stable
government will set up in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Refutes Wrong Report on First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's President's Office has
refuted a New Vision report saying that the first lady Janet
Museveni called for talks with rebels of Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA).
</P>
<P>
A statement released Sunday afternoon by the President's
Office said the story wrongly reported on the first lady's
message made while visiting a World Vision center in the north,
Radio Uganda said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The release asserted it is a surprise to read that she had
called for talks with the LRA rebels because she does not have to
go to World Vision to call for talks.
</P>
<P>
It said the wife of the president talked a lot about the need
to cultivate love, friendship, understanding and cooperation
between the peoples of Uganda in order to overcome hatred,
suspicion and conflict.
</P>
<P>
She also said the government would do whatever it could to
bring about peace in northern Uganda where LRA rebels are active.
</P>
<P>
The first lady was quoted by the release as saying that
President Yoweri Museveni does not think it is fair to the people
of the north for government to talk peace with rebels who have
killed, maimed, and inflicted so much suffering on innocent
people including children.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Museveni wrote to Joseph Kony, mastermind of the
LRA rebels, to show the government did not rule out resolving the
security issue through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM Submits Resignation to King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Jordan's Royal Court Fayez
Tarawneh said Sunday said that Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali has
submitted his resignation to King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther
Haddadin on August 9 "obliged" the prime minister to make his own
resignation, Tarawneh was quoted by Jordan's official news agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh did not say if the king, who is in the United States
for cancer treatment, will approve the resignation.
</P>
<P>
Majali's move came amid surging calls by the opposition parties,
which had complained about the government's incompetence in dealing
with a string of domestic problems, for the resignation of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The calls surfaced following last month's water pollution incident
in western Amman.
</P>
<P>
Residents living there complained early last month that water
flowing out of their taps has odor and contains worms and larvae,
which forced the resignation of the water minister.
</P>
<P>
Majili has said that "if it was proven a person is responsible (for
the water pollution), even the prime minister himself, he should be
punished."
</P>
<P>
But he has ruled out the possiblity of resignation of the whole
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said last Thursday that he still has confidence in
Majali and his government.
</P>
<P>
The Majali government, which was appointed in March 1997 by the
king, adopted a reform package aimed at developing Jordan's economy
through measures such as privatization, alleviating poverty and
unemployment, and supervising parliament elections. But all these
plans have suffered setbacks.

BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Yangtze
River continued to rise and reached 45.13 meters at 2 a.m. today,
0.02 m higher than at 1 a.m., and water level is still rising

</P>
<P>
Sporadic fighting, which broke out when a group of armed

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Not to Tolerate Captivity of Nationals by Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Speaker of the Iranian Majlis
(Parliament) Hassan Rowhani warned Sunday that Tehran would not
tolerate the captivity of its nationals by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"Iran rules out nothing in order to secure the release of the
Iranians and holds Pakistan responsible for their safety," Rowhani
told a Majlis session, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"We known well where the (Iranian) hostages are being held and
would do all we can for return of our loved ones," Rowhani, who is
also the secretary of the Supreme Council of National Security, said.
</P>
<P>
Iran accuses the Taliban of detaining 11 Iranian diplomats, an IRNA
reporter and 35 drivers in Mazari-e-Sharif when its forces conquered
the stronghold of the Afghan opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has confirmed the captivity of 35 Iranian drivers, but
denied capturing any Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is believed to support the Taliban forces and Iran backs
the opposition headed by the ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, who was driven out of Kabul by the Taliban in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the day, a group of Majlis deputies issued a statement,
urging the government, the Foreign Ministry in particular, to step up
efforts to safeguard the prestige of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We seriously call on the government and foreign ministry to
intensify their activities, do their utmost and give up the pacifist
policy so as not to allow the country's credibility to be tarnished
anymore," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The deputies condemned Taliban's acts as illegal and against the
internationally and regionally accepted norms.

<TEXT>

<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed on
Sunday when the bus carrying them crashed into a valley from the
mountainous Haraz road north of Tehran, the state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus with 40 passengers on board was on its way from Tehran
to Gorgan, Iran's northern province of Golestan.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the accident is still unknown, the report said,
giving no details.
</P>
<P>
The Haraz road is one of the most dangerous roads in the region.
In January, avalanches killed more than 30 people and buried dozens

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Vow to Cooperate in Hunting Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Britain
and Ireland Sunday vowed to cooperate in hunting those responsible
for the blast which killed 28 people and injured 220 in the
Northern Irish town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed the two governments will work together and will
do everything possible in their power to hunt down those
responsible for this outrage," Reuters quoted British Prime
Minister Tony Blair as telling the press, alongside his Irish
counterpart Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the police chiefs of Ireland and Northern Ireland
would meet Monday to discuss measures which could lead to the
capture of the bombers and increase security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Northern Irish Secretary Mo Mowlam will also meet Irish Justice
Minister John O'Donoghue to discuss steps to strengthen security.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that our two governments are working so closely
together is itself a sign of our absolute and unshakeable
determination that we will carry on... ceaselessly working for the
future that those who perpetrated this outrage want to wreck,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important the guerrillas should not be allowed
to derail the province's peace process, designed to end 30 years
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, who earlier vowed to crush dissident republican
guerrillas who he said were to blame for Saturday's bombing,
stressed that police on both sides of the border had already
enjoyed successes in the fight against guerrillas and now need to
review what more can be done.
</P>
<P>
Ahern blamed an outfit called the "Real IRA," which is led by
republican hardliners who have vowed to continue their violent
campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland despite the
cease-fire declared by the mainstream IRA in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla group
and a key figure in the peace process, Blair said, "I will carry
on until my last breath working for peace in Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Adams is under increasing attack from Protestant politicians in
the province who say republican guerrillas should have been forced
to hand over their weapons as part of the peace deal, according to
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the end of British rule in Northern Ireland but
I also want to see a democratic settlement," Adams told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest count, victims of the blast, the worst
in 30 years of political and sectarian violence in Northern
Ireland, included at least 15 women out shopping and nine
children. A Spanish schoolboy and his female teacher also died.
</P>
<P>
Also, the bomb killed three generations of the same family -- a
65-year-old grandmother, her 30-year-old heavily pregnant daughter
and her 18-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
Police said the blast's impact was maximized by a misleading
telephone warning, which directed evacuees towards the car where
the explosives were planted.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said Protestant paramilitaries planned
to meet in secret Sunday to decide whether to break off their
cease-fire and seek revenge against Catholics for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's main Catholic and Protestant guerrilla
groups are observing cease-fires but dissident splinter groups
have let off a number of bombs in the past few months, causing
widespread damage but few serious injuries.

<HEADLINE> Embassies in Nigeria Tighten Security Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- American and European embassies
in Nigeria have adopted extra security measures to beef up their
security system in a bid to forestall acts of terrorism following
the bomb blasts in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Some embassies have now resorted to scrutinizing visitors who
daily come to the embassies for visas while others have beefed up
their security system by involving additional security operations
from Nigerian police, the Post Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Close circuit monitors have been installed in the American
embassy in Lagos to monitor all activities of visitors while
those who want to get into the embassy are seriously screened
with metal detector to ensure that such persons are not in
possession of any explosives or dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
Security at the entrance of the U.S. Information Service based
in Lagos have been overhauled as visitors now face serious
scrutiny before getting entry into the premise.
</P>
<P>
At the British embassy in Lagos, visitors are now subjected to
various security measures before being allowed into its premises
while those who have no genuine business around the embassy are
politely turned back.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that vehicles are not allowed to park close to
the embassies and commercial vehicles are directed to park a few
meters away before depositing their passengers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
These beefed-up security measures have been taken at the
embassies of western countries in the wake of bombings which
occurred last week in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, killing more than 250 people including 12 American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted a U.S. expert on anti-terrorism as
attributing the delay in apprehending the real culprits to the
porous security of the border in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
"African countries are loose in relation to the porous nature
of their borders," the expert said, adding that the free entry of
persons into these countries is fraught with the danger of
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the paper said, this is a situation that does
not augur well for the effective monitoring of terrorist attacks
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Research Unveils New Face of Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain has proportionately more
young people, fewer pensioners and a higher birth rate than its
main continental European counterparts, but this has much to do
with a host of social problems, according to a research published
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Britain has taken over from traditionally youthful countries
such as Italy, the heart of fashion, and France, the home of young
cosmopolitan chic, according to a Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
In previous decades, the British population was, along with
Sweden's, the oldest in Europe. Now it is more similar in
structure to other English-speaking countries such as America,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand than to its continental European
counterparts. It is now second only to Ireland in terms of the
percentage of the population under 14, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
While British politicians might claim it is evidence that the
"cool Britannia move" to rebrand the nation is in tune with an
increasingly youthful outlook, in fact, the trend has much to do
with social problems, including high rates of teenage pregnancy
and ill health in older people.
</P>
<P>
"In future the British population will be in the unusual
position of being more youthful than the European average," said
Dr David Coleman, a demography lecturer at Oxford University who
compiled the study for the Economic and Social Research Council.
</P>
<P>
"Birth rates are now among the highest in Europe, alongside
Ireland, France and some Scandinavian countries. Britain leads
western Europe in teenage births and one-parent families, and is
well to the front of the field in terms of divorce," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these issues must be regarded as problems. To an
extent which is rather alarming, Britain's distinctiveness in
European demography reflects Britain's disadvantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's teenage pregnancy rate is four times the west
European average and it has the highest proportion of children
growing up in lone-parent families -- at 15 percent, double the
European Union average.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the wider problems, he said, welfare policy,
housing demand and pension arrangements will all be affected, for
there will be a growing need for housing for young single-parent
families and a high social security bill.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, a relatively young population will be less
demanding on the National Health Service, but as it ages the costs
of healthcare will rise exponentially, he said, adding that people
will be increasingly dependent on private health insurance and
private pensions, as the state becomes unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
Also, the increasing youth of the population reflects
comparatively poor life expectancy. The number of years a British
man can expect to live has only just been keeping up with the
European average, while women's mortality rates have deteriorated,
partly because of a high breast cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, more children will mean more demand for school
places and, in the long term, threaten attempts to reduce class
sizes, a major goal of the present government.
</P>
<P>
Dr Geoffrey Hodgson, who specializes in economic and social
sciences at Cambridge University, said, "A young population can be
less employable than older people and become an underclass.
Education is the key if we are to turn this into good news for the
country."
</P>
<P>
The change in demographics is accompanied by a change in
cultural atmosphere, as Britain sheds conventional stereotypes and
becomes less constrained in attitude, according to social
commentators.
</P>
<P>
Peter York, a style consultant, said, "People of all ages are
now more adaptable. In social matters we are less conservative
than other European countries. If you look at levels of stodginess
and formality, France would win every time. We now talk about sex
openly. Restaurants, bars and shops have become more cosmopolitan
and young. There have been enormous changes at all levels."
</P>
<P>
With both the main political parties working to claim Britain's
new youth as their natural adherents, young people are
increasingly reaching senior positions that were once the preserve
of the middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
Immigration has been a key factor in Britain's changing
structure, adding more than 500,000 to the 58.5 million population
since the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Over 3.9 Million Americans on Probation or Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A record 3.9 million men and
women were on probation or parole in the United States at the end
of 1997, the Justice Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said that 110,000
people were added to the total last year, a 2.9 percent increase.
The average annual increase has been 3.0 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Each year has seen a record set because of increases in the
number of people moving through the criminal justice system since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, nearly one out of every 35 adults in the
United States was in prison, in jail or on probation or parole --
a total of 5.7 million adults, or nearly 2.9 percent of the
population, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Felony convictions accounted for 54 percent of the 3,261,888
adults on probation at yearend. Another 28 percent had been
convicted of misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol
accounted for 14 percent of the probationers and other offenses
for 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
There were 685,033 adults on parole, a conditional, supervised
release following a prison term. Virtually all of them, 96
percent, had been imprisoned on felony convictions.

SHANGHAI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The market indexes of both A
and B shares traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange continued their
downward trends while hitting a record low today. Trading was
affected by unfavorable mid-term achievement reports publicized by
many listed companies, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Composite Index on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
(SSE) ended at 1,070.41 points today, down approximately 100
points from the previous trading day. The figure created a new low
for A shares since September of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The indexes for real estate businesses fell the most, and 426
listed enterprises recorded a sharper drop today, accounting for
92.6 percent of the total number of listed companies in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that the poor mid-term achievement reports
unveiled by listed companies was the main reason for the new
low. However, serious floods on the Yangtze River also undermined
investor confidence with the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
The index of B shares, available for foreign citizens, dropped
to a record low, closing at 27.19 points today with a trading
volume of 20 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong-pil Approved as South Korean Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kim Jong-pil, acting prime
minister of South Korea, was approved Monday by the National
Assembly, or parliament, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead came as the opposition Grand National Party (GNP),
which holds the majority of seats in the parliament, withdrew its
opposition Monday in the wake of concessions made by the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling camp, grouped by the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) and the United Liberal Democrats (ULD), made
concessions on the appointment of heads of parliamentary
committees.
</P>
<P>
The GNP grabbed eight of 16 standing committee chairmanships,
including the powerful Legislation and Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Four went to the NCNP, three to the ULD and one to the New
Party by the People, a splinter of the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil was named acting prime minister in February by
President Kim Dae-jung, who took office on February 25.
</P>
<P>
The two Kims agreed to form a coalition last August to win the
1997 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The official approvement of Kim Jong-pil as prime minister is
expected to boost Kim's political influence in the ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the prime minister will have a larger say in
managing state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the parliamentary approval, the ULD said Kim's
assumption of the prime minister heralds a genuine coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
"At last we have become the center pillar of the coalition
government, along with President Kim's National Congress for New
Politics," said Kim Chang-young, a vice spokesman for the ULD
which was founded by Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The ULD expects the president will relegate control of the
cabinet to the prime minister in accordance with their coalition
agreement on power sharing through the introduction of the
parliamentary system of government.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1997 presidential campaign, the two Kims had agreed
to revise the constitution by the end of 1999 to adopt a
government in which the president deals with defense, security and
foreign affairs, while the prime minister takes care of home
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since Kim Jong-pil became prime minister, the ULD reportedly
plans to set up a joint committee with President Kim's NCNP, which
will deal with the operation of the coalition government and
outline its policies.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP promised to discuss with the ULD the setup of the
committee when the Assembly approved Kim Jong-pil as prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak to Hold Talks in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat is to arrive in Cairo
Tuesday to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the peace process, the Voice of Palestine said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the latest developments of the
peace process and the appropriate measures that the Arab states
will take to push forward the peace process, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting is part of consultations and coordinations
on the peace process between Arafat and Mubarak, in which Arafat
will raise again the issue of convening an urgent Arab summit to
discuss the stalled peace process, it said.
</P>
<P>
The current peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis
have entered into an impasse because of Israel's hardline policy,
and thus "the credibility of this Israel government" will also be
discussed in the Cairo meeting, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel began to talk directly, after the
lapse of more than a year, on July 19 on the major issue of
Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank, but no progress was
made.
</P>
<P>
Israel suggested in the talks that it pull back from 10 percent
of the West Bank, and designate the other 3 percent as a "nature
reserves," in which the Palestinians only have limited power.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected this Israeli undercut version of an
American initiative, saying Israel must accept the U.S. idea
calling on Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank
during the second stage troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
They refused to continue the current direct talks with Israel
nine days ago, pointing to that the Israeli side presented no "new
ideas" on troop redeployment during the talks.

GENEVA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB)
will discuss a settlement reached last week between major Swiss
banks and lawyers for claimants of Holocaust-era assets in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
The settlement will dominate the extraordinary meeting of the

<P>
However, the spokesman declined to say if any decision would be
taken at the meeting on whether the central bank should contribute

UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland's two biggest banks, which
made the deal with the claimants on August 12 in New York, have
said they would like other firms and the central bank to
contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The SNB has already donated 100 million Swiss francs (66.36

up by Swiss banks and industry last year to aid needy Holocaust
victims and their families.
</P>

NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government and
parliament Monday strongly condemned a bomb attack in Omagh,
Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the peace process will not
be impeded.
</P>
<P>
In separate messages to his British and Irish counterparts
Robin Cook and David Andrews, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides denounced the bombing as a "sinister act of violence."
</P>
<P>
"I wish to express my fervent hope that the peace process in
Northern Ireland will not be hindered by this tragic development
and that the perpetrators of this deplorable crime are brought to
justice," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
An explosion Saturday hit Omagh, 110 kilometers to the west of
Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland, killing 28 people and
injuring 200 others. The terrorist act has put to test a peace
agreement reached between the pro-Britain Protestants and
pro-Ireland Catholics.

<P>
In his telegrams to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Irish President Mary Mcaleese, Speaker of Cyprus' House of
Representatives Spyros Kyprianou said "we wholeheartedly condemn
this deplorable act of violence."

in expressing our earnest hope that the perpetrators are brought
to justice and that such hideous crimes will never be repeated."

HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Namibian and Angolan defense
ministers arrived here Monday to attend a meeting which will try
to find a solution to the deepening crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
DRC's President Laurent Kabila who doubles as defense minister
was also expected to fly here for the meeting which follows his
discussions in Luanda Sunday with his counterparts of Angola and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Zimbabwean government, the
meeting is a follow-up to the one attended by seven heads of
state from African countries two weeks ago in Zimbabwe's resort
of town Victoria Falls to find a possible solution to the Great
Lakes region crisis.
</P>
<P>
"There are no new developments yet, but the ministers want to
find a lasting solution to the crisis which seemingly is
deepening," said one government official.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila is desperate to crush an ethnic Tutsi-led
rebellion starting in the eastern town of Goma on August 2.
</P>
<P>
He has accused the Rwandan government of supporting the
rebellion which threatens to end his one-year rule. But Kigali
denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
Kabila seized power from late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May
last year with the help of Rwanda and the rebelling ethnic Tutsi
soldiers.

CHANGCHUN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 155,000 residents in
Tongyu County of northeast China's Jilin Province have been moved
to safety before the arrival of the worst flooding yet.

<P>
The two-day evacuation, which ended at 6 p.m. on August 11,
went smoothly and ensured basic living standards for the relocated
people, officials said.

Floods on three tributaries of the Nenjiang, a major river in

government to relocate the affected residents. Tongyu has a
population of 340,000.

<P>
In a similar development, severe flooding has destroyed two
railways in Baicheng in west Jilin, and is threatening the safety
of another two lines.
</P>
<P>
The two destroyed railways are the Siping-Qiqihar route and the
Baicheng-Arshan line. The two endangered lines are the
Changchun-Baicheng and the Tongliao-Ranghulu railways.
</P>

Sources said that traffic on the two destroyed railways is
unlikely to resume soon due to continued flooding and rapidly

CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has been
accused by the Palestinians of environmental violations and urged
to sign international agreements on protection of the seas and
rivers.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum submitted to the Cairo-based Arab League (AL) by
the permanent Palestinian mission Monday claimed that Israel has
been dumping hazardous waste in the Mediterranean Sea for years.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians presented the memo to the technical
secretariat of the AL's Arab Environment Ministers Council and
requested its circulation among other Arab missions as well as
regional and international bodies concerned, especially those
overlooking the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The memo said that as recently as the first half of this
August, Israel buried some 60,000 tons of industrial waste into
the sea at about 50 kilometers offshore. The hazardous material
came from a chemical plant in the Israel-controlled city of Haifa,
it added.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government continues to balk at signing up at a
time when official Israeli media owned up on August 8 to the
dumping incident earlier this month," it said.

The memo also cited a number of similar incidents of Israeli
environmental violation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agriculture Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' agriculture
sector growth dropped to a 20-year low of 7.2 percent during the
first half of 1998 due to the lingering effects of the El
Nino-caused drought on crop production.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to President Joseph Estrada, Agriculture
Secretary William Dar said the big setbacks suffered by the sector
during the first half of 1983, 1985 and 1988 paled in comparison
with this year's performance.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the effects of the El Nino on crop farms translated
into a 14.6-percent contraction in aggregate output this year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of gross value of output at current prices, the sector
earned 245 billion pesos (6.1 billion U.S. dollars), indicating a
1.9-percent reduction from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Data showed that unmilled rice and corn production plunged by
26.6 percent and 43.6 percent respectively. With the exception of
tobacco, abaca, mongo, onion and rubber, all other crops posted
output losses during the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The livestock and poultry subsectors, however, grew by 2.9
percent and 3.3 percent, thanks to improved production in hog and
chicken farms.
</P>
<P>
The fishery subsector was also down 0.5 percent because of the
low output of the municipal fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The data confirmed projections of a sagging agriculture sector
which has been hard-hit by the El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Economist Rolando Dy expected a 5-percent fall in the
agriculture sector in the third quarter this year and a
3.6-percent recovery for the sector in the last quarter because of
the late harvest.

LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal's England international
defender Tony Adams may be forced to quit soccer by pills at the
end of the season.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports here on Monday, Adams, 31, a
reformed alcoholic, said that he has to take anti-inflammatory
tablets to cope with an ankle injury and is worried about
permanent side-effects.
</P>
<P>
"If I find I have to take them before every game this season,
then I will have to give a lot of thought to carrying on next
season," said the World Cup player and Arsenal captain.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to play for at least another couple of seasons
and finish at the top. The appetite is very much there. But I
want a life after football and there have been worrying reports
of long-term side-effects from constant use of these tablets."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Distribution System Improves Amid Rising Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Because of years of market
reforms, a multi-layer distribution system has been formed in
Tianjin, a major port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Though prices declined and consumer demand was inadequate,
Tianjin's sales of consumer goods still totaled 28.1 billion yuan
(3.39 billion US dollars) in the first half of this year, 9.5
percent more than that for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Increased reforms in the distribution system have put an end to
the monopoly of state-owned enterprises in commerce, a municipal
official said.
</P>
<P>
As more companies from Japan, France, Hong Kong and other
countries and regions come to invest in Tianjin, competition has
increased among the state-owned, collective, private and
overseas-funded enterprises, something that has helped to
reactivate the market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that overseas-funded retail
businesses had 1.07 billion yuan (129 million US dollars) in
retail sales in the first six months of this year, a surge of 51.1
percent from a year ago. Meanwhile, private businesses experienced
a 32.6 percent increase in retail sales in the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
As investment in commercial infrastructure facilities
increases, Tianjin's market system has improved
steadily. Currently, Tianjin has set up a dozen national-level
wholesale markets in production materials and a larger number of
big wholesale markets in household appliances, clothing,
decoration materials, furniture, and daily necessities.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserves at 43 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves amounted to 43.91 billion U.S. dollars on Sunday, the
Central Bank of Korea (BOK) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 2.15 times over the 20.4 billion U.S. dollars
registered at the end of 1997 when the nation suffered a financial
crisis caused by corporate failures and bad financial institution
loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its usable foreign exchange reserves, excluding
foreign exchange holdings and currency deposits in South Korean
bank branches overseas, rose to 40.17 billion U.S. dollars, up
from the 8.8 billion billion recorded at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1996 the nation has seen its usable
foreign exchange reserves exceed the mark of 40 billion
U.S. dollars, a BOK spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increase mainly to domestic
banks' brisk repayment of foreign currency-denominated debt to the
central bank amid a continuing current account surplus.
</P>
<P>
The bank extended 23.2 billion U.S. dollars in emergent foreign
currency loans to domestic financial institutions late last year
in a bid to help them overcome a serious shortage of foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a high of 33.3 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
June 1997, South Korea's foreign exchange reserve plunged to 20.4
billion at the end of 1997 when the nation suffered its worst
foreign currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, after the country signed an agreement last December
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars, its foreign exchange reserves started to
rise gradually every month until it reached 43.9 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign exchange deposits in overseas
branches of South Korean banks dropped gradually from 11.3 billion
U.S. dollars last December to 3.5 billion as of August 15 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Discusses Book with Concerned Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- England coach Glenn Hoddle has
talked to his squad about the issues concerning the controversial
Paul Gascoigne affair.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has come under fire from his predecessors, former
internationals and the players' union after he described in a
book the details of Gascoigne's angry reaction to being left out
of the recent World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Three former bosses of England team Terry Venables, Graham
Taylor and Bobby Robson, each made it clear no amount of money
would have tempted them to betray the trust of their players.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, now manager at Watford, led the chorus of disapproval.
He said: "I was asked to do a similar sort of thing on the
European Championships in 1992 but for me it was the wrong thing
to do. I can't see how you can talk to people in confidence,
knowing you are going to write about it later."
</P>
<P>
Venables, now in charge at Crystal Palace, said: "I did a book
on tactics and players of the past and the future, but I have
never, ever gone into any detail in a private way on players at
all. It is Glenn's business if he wants to go down that road, but
I have never written a book like that and I never will. It's not
for me."
</P>
<P>
Robson, who took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World
Cup, said: "Glenn has to stand and fall on what he has said in
the book. Whether he was well-advised or ill-advised, I cannot
say. But he clearly wanted to say what he said. Whether his
decision is in the best interests of Glenn and Paul, I'm not
prepared to say."
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Paul Ince has called on Hoddle to make it clear to
the players that the Gascoigne incident was a one-off and private
conversations would remain confidential in the future.
</P>
<P>
The issue has already been discussed at meetings at a short
England training camp in the last 24 hours. Hoddle was due to
talk to the media at a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle's book about England's World Cup campaign, when his
team made a disappointing early exit in the second round, is
currently being serialised by a British newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The England manager caused a stir when he described how
Gascoigne smashed a bedside lamp and "went berserk" when told by
Hoddle that he had been left out of the World Cup squad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filipinos Protest Anti-Chinese Atrocities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- As Indonesia marked its
independence day Monday, more than 2,000 Chinese Filipinos and
members of some local religious groups held a rally here in
protest of the anti-Chinese atrocities in Indonesia in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "We want Justice!", the protesters, including
businessmen, students and priests, gathered outside the Indonesian
embassy in Makati city, the financial center of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the three-hour-long rally, they observed a
one-minute silence for the victims killed during the devastating
riots in Indonesia on May 13-15.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, five representatives from the protesters
delivered speeches, condemning the anti-Chinese violence and
demanding justice for riot victims.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the May riots in Indonesia,
thousands of Chinese businesses and homes were looted and many
were killed. Over 100 ethnic Chinese women were raped in the riots
and about 20 of them died.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting international pressure, the Indonesian
government has created a special committee to look into the
incident. But no suspects who masterminded the unprecedented riots
which targeted the ethnic Chinese have been arrested so far.
</P>
<P>
"We ask for a credible investigation committee to uncover the
truth about the May 1998 and other on-going racist violence in
Indonesia, to prosecute and punish all the military criminals and
their masterminds," said Jenny Chang, one of the representatives.
</P>
<P>
Chang urged the Indonesian government to fully compensate the
riot, looting, murder and rape victims and their families for
their losses.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Indonesian government to pass laws to
guarantee equal rights for all Indonesian citizens, including
those of the minorities in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other government and
financial institutions to require the above-mentioned conditions
before the release of any future loans or economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiangzhao, a protester in his 30s, said it is "unbelievable
that such atrocities took place in Indonesia when the world is
entering the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the Philippine Coalition Against
Atrocities in Indonesia, composed of representatives from various
quarters of the local Chinese-Filipino community.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the rally, the five representatives presented a
letter of protest to Indonesian Ambassador Abu Hartono.

<HEADLINE> Irish Republican Group Denies Links With Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of a small
Irish republican group linked to guerrillas accused of carrying
out Northern Ireland's Omagh bombing denied Monday that his
organization had anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
Francis Mackey, also a local councillor in Omagh, said his son
Sean, one of the five people arrested Monday, knew nothing about
Saturday's car bomb attack that killed 28 people and injured 220
in the small market town, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"Raiding my house at 7 a.m. and arresting my teenage son, who
they know had nothing to do with it, is nothing short of
harassment," said Mackey, a member of a group called the 32
Counties Sovereignty Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee rejects assertions by security sources and media
that it is the political mouthpiece of a hardline republican
guerrilla organization which styles itself the "Real IRA."
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted Mackey as saying that Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern and Northern Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan were wrong
to accuse his organization of involvement.
</P>
<P>
"I categorically reject that," Mackey told reporters, saying
that he did not know who planted the bomb.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed those of a statement issued earlier by the
32 County Sovereignty Committee. "We are a political movement and
not a military group. We reject any suggestion that our movement
was responsible in any way," the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources say the "Real IRA," which split from the
mainstream Irish Republican Army in protest when it decided to
declare a ceasefire last year, is led by a former IRA weapons
chief with a detailed knowledge of the IRA's hidden arms and
explosives caches.

<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian international Dan
Petrescu may leave Chelsea as Gianluca Vialli tries to balance
the budget after splashing out 12 million pounds (19.7 million
U.S. dollars) on players during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
Petrescu, who scored the winning goal in Romania's victory
over England in a World Cup group match this summer, was not
named in Chelsea's squad for its season opener against Conventry
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, which fielded nine foreign players in its starting
11,lost the game 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Vialli told the 30-year-old defender he was free to leave
Stamford Bridge, the Express newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sad,'' Petrescu was quoted as saying. "Chelsea want
to sell me. Vialli said I will not be playing in the first XI th
is year. If can find a club to go to, I will leave.''
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, which has an annual salary bill exceeding 23 million
pounds (37.4 million U.S. dollars), is expected to place a 2
million pound (3.25 million U.S. dollars) transfer fee on
Petrescu.

<HEADLINE> Defense Embankments Fortified to Protect Major Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 270,000 soldiers and
civilians are working around the clock to reinforce the second and
third defense embankments protecting the Daqing Oilfield, the
largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 9,000 people and 1,000 pieces of equipment are pouring
stone and sandbags into a breach in the second defense embankment
on the river's Xinzhan section. The breach is expected to be
plugged tonight. However, the swift current is making the rush
repairs difficult.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials directing the anti-flood fight on the spot
include Xu Youfang, the provincial secretary of the Communist
Party of China; Tian Fengshan, the provincial governor; and Liang
Guanglie, commander of the Shenyang Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
Breaches occurred on the Lahai, Pangtoupao and Machangba
sections of the Nenjiang River in the last three days, affecting
the normal production of China's leading oilfield whose annual
output accounts for half of the country's total. A nearby highway
is underwater forcing traffic to be suspended.
</P>
<P>
To date, water has affected the operation of more than 1,200
oil wells, 527 of which have been closed, said an oilfield
official.
</P>
<P>
A reservoir with a storage capacity of 120 million cubic meters
is in danger of collapsing, which would submerge three zones of
the Daqing Oilfield, which would reduce its output by one-fourth.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slips As Rouble Devalued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
nearly half a U.S. cent weaker Monday and delicately poised above
the 59 U.S. cents mark following news that Russia had effectively
devalued the rouble against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the day here at 59.13 U.S. cents from
59.60, after spending the session between 59.00 and 59.42 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer said the Australian dollar ended on a
softer note as the Japanese yen fell again against the U.S. dollar
and news filtered out that the Russian Central Bank had lowered
its target exchange rate for the rouble from about 6.3 to 9.5 to
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Global market participants fear that Russia, which is in
financial and economic turmoil, might begin offloading certain
commodities at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
Such activity in turn could lessen demand for Australian
commodities and undermine the Australian dollar, traditionally a
commodity-driven currency.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Investment Bank head of securities trading Jeremy Colless
said the news from Russia had caused the U.S. dollar and U.S.
bonds to be very well bid in dealing in the Asian time zone.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo trading, the U.S. 30 year Treasury bond yield hit a
record low of 5.51 percent as investors indulged in safe haven
buying of the securities following the Russian news.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, market participants now await the Reserve Bank
of Australia's monthly bulletin, which will include its quarterly
report on the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 84.49 Japanese yen, from
86.53, and 1.0704 German marks, from 1.0643.

<HEADLINE> UK Press Call for Crackdown on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) - British newspapers on Monday
issued a unanimous call for a sweeping crackdown on the suspected
republican dissident bombers who killed 28 people and wounded 220
at Omagh in the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted political leaders, including Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, as blaming the bomb blast on the "Real
IRA," which broke away from the mainstream Irish Republican Army
in protest when it decided to call a ceasefire last year.
</P>
<P>
The suspected bombers should be rounded up to protect the
Northern Ireland peace process, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
It is "time to crush the enemies of peace," the Daily Mail
said. "Murderers' cause must be condemned by all in Ulster," the
Express demanded.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph broadsheet and the Sun tabloid went so far
as to name the suspected leader of the "Real IRA." The Express
printed the man's picture on its front page, with his face
obscured. "This is the man behind the bomb maniacs," a caption
said.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian said: "Those outside (the peace process) are
pariahs, the also-rans of modern Irish history. They have no
analysis, no theory, no intelligible ends. The only response is
to form ranks against them."
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said the bomb attack posed the biggest
challenge, not only to the peace process but also to Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leaders were also asked to urge immediate
decommissioning of weapons, which pose a threat to the fragile
peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The Sinn Fein president and his ally Martin McGuinness
condemned the Omagh bombing in language stronger than any they
have used before when reacting to dissident republican violence.
But now they must match their words with deeds," the Times noted.
</P>
<P>
"With the blood of so many now on dissident republican hands,
there is a chance for Mr. Adams (Sinn Fein leader) to make the
formal, absolute and public break with violence and fundamentalism
that some believe he has already made privately," the paper
added.

CANBERRA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares shed more
than one percent Monday after a tumble on Tokyo's market, with
fears of further sell-offs following news that the Russian central
bank has devalued the rouble.
</P>
<P>
Investors were rattled by fears of a further shakeout on Wall
Street Monday night after Russia devalued its currency from about
6.3 roubles to the U.S. dollar to 9.5.

Troubled diversified resources giant BHP closed 18 cents
softer, Rio Tinto lost 28.6 cents, WMC pulled back, MIM eased

gold bullion was trading in Sydney 1.70 weaker at 282.80 U.S.
dollars an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Companies From Taiwan Invest More in Fujian Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Companies from Taiwan continued
to increase their investment in coastal Fujian Province on the
mainland in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian approved 289 projects funded by companies from Taiwan in
the first seven months, with contracted investment totaling 318
million U.S. dollars. The two figures were 13.3 percent and 21.8
percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the rise of investment in Fujian by
companies from Taiwan to the mainland province's continued effort
to improve its investment environment and to protecting the rights
and interests of investors from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In Fuzhou, the provincial capital, and Xiamen, a special
economic zone, for example, special centers have been established
to accept complaints of Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
In other places, associations of enterprises funded by
companies from Taiwan have been founded to help increase
government-enterprise communication.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that Fujian has approved some 5,300
projects funded by companies from Taiwan, with contracted and
paid-in investment from Taiwan totaling 9.95 billion U.S. dollars
and 6.52 billion U.S. dollars, respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expels Indian Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has ordered
the expulsion of more Indian scientists from the U.S. in response
to India's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The latest victims are those on short-term assignments to
Chicago's Enrico Fermi Institute and Argonne National Laboratory,
the Indian Express reported.
</P>
<P>
Compounding the expulsions, the Clinton administration has also
decided to hold back high-tech Indian defense and scientific
equipment sent to the U.S. for testing, the Bangalore Indian
Express reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the upbeat pronouncements on the
Indian-U.S. diplomatic front, sources here said the atmosphere is
beginning to sour over the aggravating U.S. actions, which is
occurring on the eve of the crucial fourth round of talks between
the two countries,
</P>
<P>
The equipment was sent to the Lockheed Martin facility in
Binghampton in upstate New York to test the U.S.-made Digital
Flight Control Computer.
</P>
<P>
Following India's nuclear tests in May and the sanctions
imposed by the U.S., the Clinton administration decided to block
the return of the Indian equipment despite requests from India,
claiming that it was sequestered under the Glenn Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials said the equipment was sent to the U.S. with
an import certificate and a re-export license. Other sources said
some equipment sent by the Indian Navy to the U.S. for repairs had
also been seized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10 Indian senior scientists, including
Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, R. Chidambaram, have
been denied visas to the U.S. following the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, according to Monday's Pioneer daily, the
Indian government has started exploring alternative venues for
high-level scientific cooperation so that vital areas of research
will not be effected by the U.S. actions.
</P>
<P>
The central government has already initiated discussions with
France and Russia after a series of meetings with scientists and
officials, the Pioneer said.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that the black list drawn up by the U.S. would not
be a major setback to India's efforts in keeping abreast of
developments in front-line scientific and technological research.
</P>
<P>
In another development, India agreed to restrict its giant
microwave radio telescope near Pune, in the southern state of
Maharashtra, to accommodate the commercial interest of global
telecommunications satellite operator Iridium LLC of the United
States, which is due to begin its world-wide mobile telephone
services next month.
</P>
<P>
Under a time-sharing agreement announced Sunday, the telescope
could scan the skies in the astronomically important 1612 MHZ band
for only six hours a day between midnight and 6 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Province's Light-Industry Sector Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The light-industry sector of
east China's Jiangsu Province, one of the country's economic
powerhouses, has improved month-by-month this year.
</P>
<P>
Light industry as a whole has reported 73.69 million yuan (8.88
million U.S. dollars) in profit this year, reversing a series of
losses in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency improvement has come as the Jiangsu provincial
authorities put greater importance on technical advances and
renovations. Many projects with high energy consumption and heavy
pollution have been closed down or merged.
</P>
<P>
Of the 103 light-industry enterprises in the Taihu River
Valley, for example, 44 completed pollution controls in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Though a positive turn has emerged, there are still a lot of
difficulties and contradictions ahead, a provincial official said
of the light-industry sector.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Voices Concern about Russian Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Monday expressed concern over the recent financial market
turbulence in Russia, but said that he believed the crisis is
still "reparable."
</P>
<P>
The financial development in Russia has given rise to concern,
a situation which is also linked to the economic crisis in Japan,
Indonesia and South Korea, Kohl told reporters in Bonn before a
leadership meeting of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
</P>
<P>
"But by concern, I also mean that this is, despite everything,
reparable," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's remarks came after Russia's battered financial markets
came under great pressure last week amid speculation of a rouble
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The German Finance Ministry has urged Russian decision makers
to implement economic reforms as soon as possible in order to
restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from Moscow said Russia's central bank Monday
raised the upper limit of the ruble's exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar to 9.5 rubles to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's government and the central bank have also
imposed a 90-day moratorium, starting Monday, on the repayment of
foreign loans. No residents will be barred from investing in ruble
assets to be repaid within one year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Businesses Urged to Get Ready for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian companies,
financial institutions and institutional investors should prepare
themselves for the advent of the Euro, the European Monetary
Union's (EMU) single currency, a Deutsche Bank official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Mahrdt, Deutsche Bank's country manager for Malaysia,
said that although it is easy to dismiss the EMU as something that
only affects Europe, it will actually affect everyone doing
business with Europe and investing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is to commence trading on January 1 next year. Between
now and January 1, 1999, when the initial 11 participating
countries switch to the Euro, Malaysian businesses will have to
complete the process of updating a wide variety of accounting,
treasury and cash management systems to deal with the Euro's
introduction, Mahrdt told reporters at a media briefing on the EMU
here.
</P>
<P>
The EMU will open up new investment and capital-raising
opportunities in Europe for Malaysia as it will create a new
financial market that will rival that of the United States in
terms of size, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, since the Euro is expected to be a strong
currency, it is likely to rival the U.S. dollar as a reserve
currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's regional head of custody, Richard
Ernesti, told reporters that converting legacy currencies, such as
the Deutsche mark or the franc, into Euros, and dealing with the
redenomination of debt and equity securities are both
time-consuming and complex from an information technology,
accounting and back-office perspective.
</P>
<P>
"While preparations for the EMU are a significant cost burden,
the elimination of currency risk and currency-related transaction
costs in the new Eurozone will lead to opportunities for Malaysian
corporates and financial institutions doing business with Europe,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The EMU will make doing business in Europe easier and less
expensive and, should over time, lead to increased trade with the
Eurozone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian banks are said to benefit from improved efficiencies
stemming from the reduction in the number of currencies in which
they have to transact, and reduced hedging costs.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, the leading bank in the Euro-region and one of
the largest in the world, offers a full range of investment and
corporate banking services in Malaysia. It has over 6,000
employees in 17 Asia- Pacific countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim to Have Taken Town in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- One rebel leader in the
Democratic Republic of Congo Monday claimed that they had taken
Songololo Town, closer to the last major town before Kinshasa, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, rebel commander Dieudonne Kabengele
said in western port city of Matadi that his front-line troops had
taken Songololo Town after a brief fight on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in Songololo. We took it after a brief fight.
This now consolidates our advance on KInshasa," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The alleged fall of Songololo, if confirmed, would bring the
rebels closer to Mbanza Ngungu, some 150 kilometers southwest of
capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials have rejected rebel claims that
they clashed with government forces near Mbanza Ngungu Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On his return to Kinshasa Sunday after his talks with the
presidents of Angola and Namibia, President Laurent Kabila told
state television that "we are here to stay. Whatever happens,
the aggressors will fail."
</P>
<P>
His Information Minister Didier Mumengi also said on state
radio that the government troops were preparing "mopping up"
operations, although the rebels claimed they were pushing toward
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi ethnic-led rebellion broke out on August 2 in
eastern town of Goma in the former Zaire. The rebel groups
launched the "Congolese Democratic Coalition" Monday, aiming to
overthrow Kabila's regime, after a meeting attended by some 20
political and military leaders in Goma, the headquarters of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila accused former allies Rwanda and Uganda of
invading and fighting alongside the rebels. The two countries
which helped him oust late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997
denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Northern Ireland Leaders to Back Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has urged political leaders in Northern Ireland to keep the peace
process on track in the face of the deadly bomb blast late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blair left the province on Monday to rejoin a family holiday in
France after making the announcement by telephone to political
leaders on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The leaders included First Minister designate David Trimble and
Martin McGuinness, a senior member of Sinn Fein, the political arm
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
"He has no doubt that the peace process is strong enough to
withstand this dreadful event" a spokesman for Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair visited a Belfast hospital on Sunday night and saw about
a dozen victims of the Omagh bomb blast, the province's worst
explosion in decades, which killed 28 people and injured 220
others.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals had difficulties in coping with all the
casualties, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said the patients had urged the prime
minister to push ahead with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually without exception they said, 'You've got to keep
going with the peace process'," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair described the hospital visit as "one of the most
harrowing experiences of his life but also one of the most
inspirational."

<HEADLINE> British Police Make First Arrests after N.Irish Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Police in Northern Ireland
arrested a number of men suspected in connection with the bomb
attack on the town of Omagh, security sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made in an early morning swoop on Monday in
and around Omagh, where a car bomb that police believe was planted
by dissident republican guerrillas on Saturday, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the Omagh blast which
killed 28 people and wounded 220 others, the most deadly in three
decades of sectarian and political violence in the British
province.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's police chief Ronnie Flanagan has pointed the
finger of suspicion at a breakaway republican group called the
"Real IRA (Irish Republican Army)", one of three republic splinter
organizations which remain implacably opposed to the Northern
Ireland peace deal signed in April.
</P>
<P>
News of the arrests came as police evacuated the government
buildings complex in Belfast, 80 kilometers east of Omagh, after a
security alert.

<HEADLINE> Global Hedge Fund Managers Urged to Accept IMF Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian deputy prime
minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday urged
international financial institutions and global hedge fund
managers to adopt the same practices imposed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"What we ask is that international financial institutions,
hedge funds and global investors accept the rules of the IMF, such
as transparency," he said while opening a five-day forum here.
</P>
<P>
"They have to accept the rules too. Why are poor countries
compelled to go along with the arrangements while rich countries
are absolved from them?" Anwar asked.
</P>
<P>
He said international financial institutions should not turn
their prescriptions, such as liberalization and privatization,
into a new theology that must be implemented at all costs without
understanding the complexities and peculiarities of each country.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who recently expressed disappointment that the IMF
practises double standards in disbursing funds to ailing
economies, said: "Disbursement to Mexico was fast, to Russia it
was very efficient, but negotiations with Indonesia had gone on
for too long and had been the most rigid and toughest."
</P>
<P>
About 200 Muslim community leaders, scholars and businessmen
from around the world are attending the forum which focuses on
issues facing the Muslim world.

<HEADLINE> 63 Banyamulenge Flown to Rwanda From Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-three Banyamulenge
including soldiers, who fled the ongoing fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and sought refuge in Zambia, have
been flown to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
They were flown to Rwanda on Saturday night through Ndola
Airport in central Zambia under tight security at their own
request, Times of Zambia said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted airport workers as saying that these
Banyamulenge were flown out under very tight security from
customs, immigration and police officials.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 737 plane from Rwanda arrived at Ndola Airport on
Saturday night to pick up these people who entered Zambia after
the rebellion staged by ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge erupted in
eastern Congo on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Earlier local reports said that more than one hundred
Banyamulenge soldiers had crossed the Zambian-Congolese border
and surrendered their arms to Zambian security forces.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers said they fled democratic Congo because President
Laurent Kabila wanted to disarm them and drive them out to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
They have been asking the Zambian authorities to send them to
Rwanda, which helped Kabila in his struggle to oust late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko but now is accused of backing the rebels in
former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, during his
three-day state visit to Zambia from August 5 to August 7, turned
down their application, saying they were not Rwandan nationals.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- India has banned the use and
sale of quinacrine drug for female sterilization or contraception,
a government notification said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The notification bans the import, manufacture, sale and
distribution of quinacrine in pellet form for use as a
contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
The ban follows an assurance given by the government to the
Indian Supreme court in March this year that it would ban the use
of quinacrine for contraceptive purposes.
</P>
<P>
The use of quinacrine as an anti-malarial drug had become
obsolete, but it was still being used as contraceptive in pellet
form in India.
</P>
<P>
Women activists have been campaigning against the use of the
drug for sterilization on the plea it is hazardous and that no
enough animal trials have been conducted.
</P>
<P>
The drug is said to be causing complications due to its
pharmacological effect or the error in the technique of insertion,
and it is also said to be causing fetal abnormalities and cancer
of uterus.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government said in a statement that anyone violating
the ban would be punished with prison terms of up to three years
or a fine of up to 5,000 rupees (125 U.S. dollars), or both.

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environmental protection
departments have expanded efforts to monitor hazardous wastes and
strengthen management of toxic chemicals as part of national flood
control efforts to prevent major pollution in flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The National Environmental Protection Agency issued an
emergency circular in early June and workers in the flood-ravaged
provinces such as Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang and Jilin
have formed inspection groups to monitor the safety of storage
facilities for toxic chemicals and materials.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, environmental protection workers in the central
China city of Wuhan discovered cyanide stored in a warehouse
inundated with flood water several meters deep. The workers spent
several hours moving the toxic material to a safe place.
</P>
<P>
Workers in Chongqing Municipality in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze have worked around-the-clock to closely monitor the flood
situation and water quality. They have also organized regular
checks of sewage water discharges and solid waste disposal, as
well as checks to ensure the readiness of pollution treatment
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection departments in the east China city of
Nanjing and Harbin in northernmost Heilongjiang Province have
prosecuted companies deliberately discharged untreated wastewater
and have ensured that hazardous materials and toxic chemicals have
been removed from areas threatened by surging floodwaters.

BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Trials of China's M30-G mobile
exchange system were completed in July and full-scale production
will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the successful trials indicate the country now has
the ability to design and produce mobile exchange systems.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the system, developed by the Xi'an Datang

Co. Ltd, offers stable operations and can easily be linked to
existing systems. The new system will also promote the development
and localization of GSM (global system mobile communications)
equipment.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunications sector has witnessed rapid
development in recent years and the country ranks third worldwide
in terms of total mobile phone subscribers, following the United
States and Japan. Nonetheless, major GSM equipment must still be
imported.

<HEADLINE> Congo's Friction With Uganda to Calm Down: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Temperature of the friction
between Democratic Congo (DRC) and Uganda will come down because
President Laurent Kabila will get to the truth, President Yoweri
Museveni's Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the half-hour talks, Hope said Kabila has been misinformed
and that is why he came to accuse Uganda of being behind the
rebellion in his country.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Uganda's alleged military involvement in
DRC's situation, Hope said anybody with common sense would think
it false because no country would attack another with two columns
of armored vehicles in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
To attack in this manner is to advertize to the whole world,
she said.
</P>
<P>
DRC is one of Uganda's most important trade partners. It
imports a lot from Uganda. There is no reason for Uganda to
attack such a neighbor and trade partner just in order to lose
it, she added.
</P>
<P>
As a neighbor of DRC, Uganda has been paying keen attention to
the situation in the country. President Museveni has met with
foreign representatives and leaders of some regional
organizations recently and security in DRC tops their agendas.
</P>
<P>
Since August 2, soldiers from Congo's ethnic Tutsi
Banyamulenge minority have been fighting to topple Kabila,
accusing him of mismanagement, corruption and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The fight erupted in capital city Kinshasa and the eastern
part of the country simultaneously. According to a BBC report
Monday morning, these soldiers have occupied Matadi, a river port
some 300 kms southwest of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the beginning of the unrest, Kabila has allegedly
accused Uganda of its role in formenting the rebellion. Recently a DRC
minister accused Uganda of sending two columns of armored vehicles
into the eastern part of Kabila's Congo, a charge which the Ugandan
government immediately denied.

BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has responded to the
message from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urging Iraq to
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, diplomatic sources

</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraqi

However, so far no detail about the Iraqi response is known.

"It was this message that the secretary-general also wanted to
reinforce that the Security Council's resolutions on this matter
is quite clear, and Iraq's obligation to comply with them has been
reaffirmed in the memorandum of understanding which the
secretary-general signed with Iraq on February 23," said Shah.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the Iraqi government announced suspension of
cooperation with UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting to
prolong sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is
free of chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Text of Russian Government and Central Bank Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of a
joint statement released Monday by the Russian government and the
Central Bank on the national currency.
</P>
<P>
A crisis broke out on world financial markets when the
Russian economy was at the start of a recovery. From October 1997
the Government and the Bank of Russia have been protecting the
main achievements of the economic policy of the recent years --
stable prices and a fixed ruble and, hence, the living standards
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The problem of servicing the national debt aggravated sharply
with the worsening of the foreign economic situation and because
of the unsatisfactory state of affairs with revenues of the
budget. Expenditures for the redemption of the earlier issued
state securities and the payment of interest on them have become
a heavy burden on the state budget with tax collection being
low. The Russian Government has to reduce the domestic state
debt, cutting expenditures under the federal budget and making
external borrowings. The Government's economic program was backed
in July by international financial organizations and leading
countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the crisis aggravating in Asia and a new fall of
world prices of oil have not permitted the restoration of the
confidence in Russian securities and, hence, the improvement of
the situation with the budget. The country's foreign currency
reserves continue shrinking and the banking system experiences
certain difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In this situation the Government and the Bank of Russia deem
it necessary to take a set of measures aimed at the normalization
of the financial and budget policy.
</P>
<P>
1. As of August 17, 1998, the Bank of Russia flouts the ruble
within new limits of the "currency corridor" fixed at the level
of from 6 to 9.5 rubles to the U.S. dollar. Interventions by the
Bank of Russia will be made to lessen sharp fluctuations in the
ruble rate. The Bank of Russia will be using the interest policy
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
2. State securities (treasury bills and federal loans bonds)
that are to be canceled up to December 31, 1999, inclusively,
will be exchanged for new securities. The technical parameters of
the exchange will be announced on Wednesday, August 19,
1998. Bidding in the market of treasury bills -- federal loan
bonds are suspended till the securities' exchange is completed.
</P>
<P>
3. Under the provisions of the regulations of the
International Monetary Fund, the Government and the Bank of
Russia introduce temporary restrictions for Russian residents on
large-scale foreign currency operations. A 90-day moratorium is
imposed as of August 17, 1998 on the repayment of credits
received from non-residents in the Russian Federation, on the
payment of insurance on credits insured by the mortgage of
securities. On the payments under fixed-term contracts in foreign
currency. Non-residents in the Russian Federation are prohibited
to invest funds into ruble assets with the time for repayment of
up to one year.
</P>
<P>
4. The Government and the Bank of Russia regard a stable
functioning of the banking system and the system of settlements
and payments in the Russian Federation as one of important
priorities. In this connection, the Government and the Bank of
Russia favor the setting up of a payments' tool by the biggest
Russian banks to maintain stability of interbank settlements. At
the same time the Bank of Russia is going to exert efforts to
consolidate the Russian banking system, drawing into this stable
Russian Banks and leading foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
5. To restore the financial market, the Russian Government
will shortly begin placing short-term treasury bills (for a term
of one or two weeks). A broader range of securities will be
issued for the population.
</P>
<P>
6. The Government and the Bank of Russia address to the
Federal Assembly a legislature initiative to tighten control over
the flow of currency abroad. At the same time the Government and
the Bank of Russia are going to take urgent actions in the area
within the bounds of their powers.
</P>
<P>
7. The Russian Government repeatedly suggests to the State
Duma to hold an extraordinary session before the end of August to
pass key draft laws helping to ensure the timely payment of
pensions and wages to workers in the state sector, to create
legislative procedures for banks' stabilization and to strengthen
the system of currency regulation and currency control.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese President to Visit Russia, Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will sign a number of
cooperation pacts with Russia and Belarus during Vietnamese
President Tran Duc Luong's forthcoming official visits to the two
countries, official reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, accompanied by representatives of some 40
leading Vietnamese firms, will visit Russia from August 25 to 29
and Belarus from August 29 to 31.
</P>
<P>
After the visits, Luong will fly to South Africa to attend the
12th summit of the non-aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Vietnam and Russia will sign two joint
communiques and other cooperation agreements on justice, oil, drug
control and settlement of payments.
</P>
<P>
Accords to be signed with belarus during Luong's visit will
focus on education and banking.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese official sources said the visits, the first by Luong
in his capacity as president since Russia and Belarus announced
their independence, demonstrate that Vietnam is determined to
"pursue a diverse and multilateral foreign policy," and "integrate
itself into the region and the world."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency last week, the
Vietnamese president said Vietnam is giving "strategic priority"
to the traditional friendship and comprehensive cooperation with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Vietnam and Russia amounted to 300
million U.S. dollars last year, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
By late 1997, Russian firms had been licensed to set up 54
joint ventures worth 196.4 million dollars. However, only 26 are
operating in the country with a total paid-in capital of 101
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Vietnam and Belarus amounted to 14.24 million
dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Asks Citizens to Leave Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has urged
its citizens in Pakistan to leave the country following Pakistan's
arrest and extradition of a suspect involved in the recent bomb
blasts in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The State Department has ordered the departure of all
personnel in non-emergency positions and families of employees at
Embassy Islamabad and the consulates in Karachi, Lahore and
Peshawar," the U.S. Embassy said in a notice issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Within the context of appropriate security precautions being
taken in a number of locations, the department warns against all
travel to Pakistan," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
"American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged to consider
carefully their security situation and, in light of the ordered
departure of all non-emergency official personnel, to consider
seriously departing Pakistan," it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan confirmed Sunday that it arrested an Arab national
named Mohammad Sadik Howaida on August 7 and has sent him to Kenya
after investigations showed that he has "involvement in the
terrorist acts" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Howaida arrived at the Karachi
international airport on August 7 hours after two powerful car
bombs exploded near U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, killing more than 200 people and injuring more
than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The Arab man was reportedly proceeding to Afghanistan, where
Osama Bin Ladin, an anti-American Saudi billionaire, is taking
refuge. American officials have tentatively linked the African
bombing to Osama who had vowed to take actions against U.S.
interests earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Stolen 19th Century Painting Recovered in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A 19th century painting worth
2 million New Zealand dollars (over 1 million U.S. dollars), which
was stolen from the Auckland Art Gallery on August 9, has been
recovered, although it is badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
The local TV station reported here Monday night that the man
who robbed the 124-year-old canvas with a sawnoff shotgun and a
crowbar is now detained by police and investigation into the case
will start soon.
</P>
<P>
The painting, "Still on Top," by French-born artist
Jacques-Joseph, also known as James Tissot, depicts three people
hoisting a flag and is 87 by 53 centimeters. It is one of New
Zealand's most expensive and popular European works and was
insured for 2 million New Zealand dollars, but overseas valuers
have put its worth at double that.
</P>
<P>
After the heist of the painting, insurers posted a 50,000 New
Zealand dollar reward for its return.
</P>
<P>
According to the TV station, it will take more than one year to
restore the painting.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM to Meet IMF Officials Over Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko is to meet with IMF officials later Monday on the
country's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference shortly after the announcement by the
government and the central bank to lower the ruble's exchange rate
from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar, Kiriyenko said
they would also discuss "actions in the new market realities."
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials, led by John Odling-Smee, chief of the
fund's Second European Department, arrived here Sunday night on
an emergency visit, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The IMF experts have arrived here in response to the revision
of the ruble exchange rate policy, Interfax quoted a source in
the IMF's Moscow office. Not all the steps announced by the
government and the central bank have been approved by the IMF,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko denied that the latest adjustment of the exchange
ceiling represents a devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
"No immediate decisions on changes in the ruble exchange rate
against the dollar have been made by the government, and it means
that no devaluation is taking place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure "simply means a new approach to the currency
policy," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kiriyenko as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, who again cut short his vacation, is
to return to the Kremlin to discuss the situation with Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told reporters that he did not rule out possible
reshuffle in the government.
</P>
<P>
He said changes in the government may be required in
connection with the new situation on the financial market,
stressing the possible reshuffle was "not an end in itself, and
will only be done by decision of the president."
</P>
<P>
Russia's financial markets tumbled after the government
announcement. The ruble fell 0.12 against the dollar in Monday
trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange to close at 6.43
rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government on Monday also announced a restructuring of
short-term debts by converting government GKO treasury bills into
new securities and an imposition of a 90-day moratorium on
payments of ruble-denominated foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the government and the central bank
said they will revise the parameters of the exchange rate policy
and techniques of rate setting as the original rate-setting
practice was no longer desirable.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the Russian Central Bank will set the
official exchange rate at the end of every day by the results of
exchange operations on the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation is expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, but would raise the prices of imports in Russia, which
depends heavily on foreign-produced goods, including more than
half the food sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous financial fluctuations that barely affected
the lives of ordinary Russians, the government's latest move would
make most residents feel the pinch in the face of price hikes and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government
actions are "above all to protect the citizens of Russia and
domestic manufacturers," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"The state has made its choice in their favor over the
players on the foreign exchange market and the market of
short-term government securities," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial and currency market had gone beyond the
normal frame in the past few days and the weather on them was made
by purely speculative operations.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, for his part, said the
devaluation would also help encourage investment in Russian
industry.
</P>
<P>
Many Russian banks are expected to go bankrupt in the
aftermath of the ruble devaluation as most are over-dependent on
now devalued ruble assets, but the government has promised to
pool the resources of leading banks to minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government and the Central Bank are also urging
parliament to tighten control over the exodus of currency
resources to other countries, Tass said.

<P>
HANOI, August 17 (xinhua) -- Vietnamese government is working
on an action program on environment based on strategies for
environment protection and sustainable development, an official
report said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's forest area is rapidly diminishing, covering only 28
percent of the country's area, and 70 percent of the natural
forests have been exploited to exhaustion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Both rural and urban areas suffer from pollution caused by poor
infrastructure, excessive use of chemicals and lack of proper
waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
Land around industrial areas is also destroyed by pollution,
causing reduction in the area of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Underground water is contaminated, posing a real risk of water
shortage in the upcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
The action program is to accelerate the all-round cooperation
among environment protection agencies to change the situation in
Vietnam, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Leaves Egypt After Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- John Garang, the leader of Sudan's
largest rebel group, left here Monday morning after promising
Egyptian leaders that he does not support the division of his
country, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Garang, who heads the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA),
arrived in Cairo last Tuesday for a conference of the Sudanese
opposition leaders to discuss ways of ending the 15-year civil war
in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the Christian and animists in the south from the Islamic north.
</P>
<P>
Fightings and consequent famines have claimed more than 1.5
million lives in the poverty-ridden African country.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference, at the request of Egyptian government,
followed the collapse of peace talks between Khartoum and the
opposition alliance in Ethiopia last week.
</P>
<P>
Egypt fears that the raging civil war in southern and eastern
Sudan can lead to a division of the country and affect control of
the Nile River, the water source for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Hosni Mubarak and other senior Egyptian
officials met Garang and leaders of other major Sudan opposition
factions.
</P>
<P>
Garang assured Mubarak that his SPLA did not seek the division
of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also reiterated its keenness to maintain Sudan's
territorial integrity and help seek a peaceful settlement to the
disputes between Sudanese government and opposition.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have been at odds over a border dispute and
accused each other of harboring its opposition with the aim to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Some Sudanese opposition leaders have said that Cairo's hosting
their gathering signaled a major shift in Egyptian hostile policy
toward Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Accord Reached on HK Container Terminal Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang expressed here Monday his welcome to a
commercial agreement between three major container companies in
Hong Kong on the detailed development arrangement for a new
container terminal.
</P>
<P>
A joint letter was handed to Tsang on August 14 by the chairmen
of the Asia Container Terminals, the Modern Terminals Limited and
the Hongkong International Terminals, confirming that they have
reached full agreement on all the commercial issues relating to
the joint development of Container Terminal 9 (CT9).
</P>
<P>
The government has concluded its negotiations with the
consortia on the basic terms of the land grants for CT9 sometime
ago, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"The confirmation by the consortia that they have reached full
agreement on all the outstanding commercial issues means that we
will be able to sign the land grants and hand over the site to the
consortia to begin construction once the documentation work is
completed," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said CT9 is a very important part of Hong Kong's port
development strategy to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness and
strengthen its position as an international container hub port.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of CT9 will create over 1,500 jobs. The
actual number will be more as there will be many new employment
opportunities created in those trades which operate around the
container terminal, such as container lorry drivers, container
depot operators and barge operators, etc.," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the difficulties we are facing at the moment, the
agreement on CT9 is a clear demonstration of these companies'
commitment to Hong Kong and their confidence in the long-term
prospect of our container port and economy," the financial
secretary noted.
</P>
<P>
The new terminal will have six berths and a design capacity to
handle 2.6 million twenty-foot equivalent units of containers a
year and will be able to cope with a forecast growth in demand of
the Hong Kong Container Port until the early 2000s.
</P>
<P>
Construction work will begin in late 1998/early 1999. The first
berth of the new terminal is expected to come into operation in
late 2001. The remaining berths will begin operation at five/six
months intervals thereafter.

<HEADLINE> People Of Central China Flood Diversion Area Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) --A total of 335,000 people in the
Jingjiang flood diversion area in central China's Hubei Province
have moved to safer areas for a possible diversion program to
discharge flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area stretches from Taipingkou to
Ouchikou on the southern bank of the Jingjiang (Yangtze) in
Hubei's Gong'an County. The 921.34-sq.km. area can store 5.4
billion cu.m. of water, with 500,000 people living there,
according to Chen Zhichao, head of the Administration for Projects
in Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Storage Area.
</P>
<P>
The projects are designed to lower the water level of the
Yangtze by opening the northern floodgate when the water from
upstream exceeds a safe discharge level and to take pressure off
Dongting Lake by using the southern floodgate to control water
flow.
</P>
<P>
The flood diversion facilities were first tested in 1954 when a
major flood occurred on the Yangtze and they played a vital role
in protecting the Jianghan Plain and city of Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
In the 1954 flood, the water level of the Yangtze at the Shashi
hydrology station dropped by 0.96 meters after 12.26 billion cu m
of flood waters were diverted through the floodgate.
</P>
<P>
The situation on this section of the Yangtze is still
serious. By 02:00 hours this morning, the water level of the
Yangtze at Shashi was 45.13 m. and rising, 2 m. above the danger
line.
</P>
<P>
To protect the main levee built along the Yangtze in Jingzhou,
the Jianghan Plain and Wuhan, the Hubei Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters issued an order on August 6 for using
Jingjiang flood diversion facilities and urging the evacuation of
residents inside the flood diversion area, meaning that 335,000
people will have to move.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council are
paying close attention to the evacuation of the residents. In
mid-August, the flood control and drought relief headquarters in
Hubei started to move residents, using 630 buses and 51 ferry
boats. By early August 7, some 200,000 residents had been moved.
</P>
<P>
More than 110,000 soldiers and civilians are working along the
cofferdams inside the Jingjiang flood diversion area.

<HEADLINE> Manila Intensifies Monitoring of Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said here Monday that the military is closely
monitoring foreign terrorist groups as a precautionary measure to
prevent any repetition of the recent terrorists' bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence gatherings have been intensified and more reports
and other information have been received by the intelligence
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although no suspected terrorists have slipped into the country,
he said, the government is not taking any chances, considering
that international terrorism strikes anywhere at the least
probable place.
</P>
<P>
"One newspaper claims that the prospect of a violent, terrorist
attack by any of the shadowy alien terrorist groups worldwide is
so remote in the Philippines. That was probably what the people of
Kenya and Tanzania thought before two car bombs killed more than
200 people in their respective capitals," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief assured that the government has taken
adequate countermeasures to protect diplomats, their families and
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the obligation of the government to safeguard
members of the diplomatic community, especially since they are
"the most vulnerable to the threats of international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"This is not to say that our concern is limited to protecting
diplomatic personnel," he said, adding that "too often, innocent
civilians have been killed in the name of some dubious terrorist
cause."
</P>
<P>
The police have beefed up their security of the American
Embassy in Manila following the car-bomb attacks in Kenya and
Tanzania early this month.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian police clamped a curfew on the West Bank
city of Jericho and searched house to house Sunday for escaped
prisoner Imad Awadallah, a senior Hamas militant accused of
killing bombmaker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat ordered a commission of inquiry to look into Awadallah's
escape.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday denied a
report in a German newspaper that quoted him as saying that "the
depth of withdrawal from the Golan Heights would be the depth of
security."
</P>
<P>
And later, Mordechai added that the newspaper distorted his
words, since he remains committed to the idea "that the more
Israeli security needs are respected, the more Israel would be
able to examine Syrian territorial demands."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security authorities Sunday approved a plan to stem
the rise in car thefts and other crimes across the 1949 cease fire
line (Green Line).
</P>
<P>
The plan, submitted by Internal Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani, would use both natural and artificial barriers to
prevent the illicit movement of people, stolen vehicles and goods
across the Green Line separating Israel from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Identifies Foreign Workers Unfit to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Medical examinations for
foreign workers have found about 3.7 percent of the foreign
workers in Malaysia medically unfit to work.
</P>
<P>
Out of 305,738 foreign workers who had gone through the
screening conducted by the Foreign Workers Medical Examination
Authority Agency (FOMEMA) since December 1 last year, 11,283 were
found to be medically unfit to work, accounting for 3.7 percent of
the total, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven HIV carriers were found among the medically unfit
workers while 7,442 were found to have hepatitis B, 1,998
transmitted diseases and 889 tuberculosis, Bernama quoted FOMEMA
Managing Director Mohammad Haniffa Abdulla as saying.
</P>
<P>
Medical examination is a must for foreign workers who want to
get their working permits in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Haniffa said the last two months were the busiest for FOMEMA,
as it had to screen some 150,000 foreign workers who wanted to
renew their working permits in view of the August 15 deadline set
by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said about 2,500 private clinics, 250 laboratories and X-ray
facilities had helped speed up the work.
</P>
<P>
"Our check is very thorough and if the foreign workers have
failed there is no way for employers to manipulate and employ
unfit workers," he said, adding, "All who were found unfit were
deported back as we don't want them to be around and spread the
diseases to our people."
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, there are about 2 million
foreign workers in Malaysia with half of them legal and half
illegal, mostly from Indonesia and Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires in Russia's Far
Eastern region of Khabarovsk are spreading and efforts to contain
the flames are hampered by lack of personnel and machinery.
</P>
<P>
About 15 fire sites were put out over the weekend, but the same
number of fires broke out in other places, the Itar-Tass news
reported in a dispatch from Khabarovsk.
</P>
<P>
Civil aviation has been paralyzed because the smoke reduced the
visibility way below the safety levels and flights in several areas
of the Taiga have been suspended for about a month.
</P>
<P>
Only two planes and one helicopter managed to take off in the
area of Sovetskaya Gavan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Be-12 fire-fighting plane managed 11 sorties and poured
dozens of tons of water onto the burning forests, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighting aircraft were grounded in other areas because
of poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
According to satellite data, about 500,000 hectares of
woodland have been affected by fires. Actual damages are still
difficult to estimate.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are praying that Mother Nature will bless
them with rains to improve the weather situation in the area which

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese guerrilla was killed
overnight in a gunbattle with the Israeli allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militia in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The National Broadcast Network radio reported Monday that the
fighting broke out when two guerrillas tried to infiltrated into
the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
One guerrilla was killed and another captured by the SLA
militiamen, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But it didn't say which group the two guerrillas belong to.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualty has brought to 25 the number of Lebanese
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon so far this year, with the
fatalities of Israeli soldiers and SLA members reaching nine and
18 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
areas from guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Stresses Justice as Safeguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has stressed the importance of achieving justice as the real
safeguard against terrorism, major local newspapers reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Feeling wronged leads to the desperate acts victimizing
innocent people," said Mubarak Sunday in an exclusive interview
with Samir Ragab, chief editor of the ruling party organ Mayo
weekly and the official daily newspaper Al Gomhuria.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the president reiterated Egypt's flat
rejection of all forms of terrorism, which only claim the lives of
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorist attacks that occurred in Kenya, Tanzania and
Northern Ireland attest to our repeated calls that the
international community must take concerted action against
terrorism and hold an international conference to tackle the
phenomenon," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Justice is the surest way for preempting terrorism, for
feelings of oppression always foment an uncontrollable state of
wrath," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The August 7 twin bomb explosions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
have claimed the lives of 247 people and left over 5,500 others
injured. Another huge bomb blast which rocked the center of the
Northern Irish town of Omagh on Saturday have killed at least 28
people.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Plans to Extend Cargo Tracking to Lake, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) plans to extend electronic cargo
tracking to road and lake transport in the next phase of the
implementation of the Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS).
</P>
<P>
The service, currently limited to sea and rail transport, is
expected to promote the regional trade through the use of ACIS by
transport service providers and clearing and forwarding agents.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha told a recent COMESA
consultative meeting in Kenya's Mombasa Port that ACIS was first
developed on a pilot basis by the shipping division of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, with funding from
the U.N. Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
By the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of COMESA member
states including Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania had begun
experimenting with the system.
</P>
<P>
However, the earlier attempts were unsuccessful due to ad-hoc
and inadequate funding, lack of training support and etc, the
East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was then that COMESA stepped in, providing institutional
support for the implementation of ACIS in eastern and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the ACIS project, covering Kenya, Burundi,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, was focused on the provision
of on-line information to providers of sea and rail transport
through the port and rail tracker modules respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said that the 19-member COMESA intended to enhance the
ACIS modules to other countries to include lake and road
transport tracking in the region.
</P>
<P>
ACIS will also provide performance indicators and other
statistics for policy makers and planners at sectoral or
macro-economic levels, through national and sub-regional
transport data bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the time the road tracker and lake tracker modules are in
place, ACIS is expected to provide, at the touch of a button,
information such as timetables and general tariff matters on
road, rail, sea or lake transport from any point in the
sub-region at the cost of a local phone call.

PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The extremists of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) showed that
they are ready to do everything to beat the peace process by staging
a bombing attack in Omagh in Northern Ireland. The 250-kilogram bomb
killed at least 28.
</P>
<P>
-- The military success of the Taliban guerrillas is worrying
Iran. Teheran has formally accused the United States of supporting
Taliban in order to ``create a hotbed of tension at the eastern
border of Iran'' and ``to distort the image of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 28 dead and 220 injured Saturday in the small town of
Omagh 80 kilometers west of Belfast which became the worst scene of
carnage Northern Ireland had ever seen in its 29 years of conflict.
The strength of the combustion was so powerful that many bodies of
the victims were torn apart and became unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
-- The political life of the United States is due to be suspended
on Monday during a televised testimony by President Bill Clinton on
his relations with Monica Lewinsky in front of a federal jury
consisting of 23 ordinary citizens. Novelist Jeremy Rifkin said the
testimony would be one of the most beautiful presentations in the
political life of the United States in this century.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Receives Bomb Suspect from Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
handed Kenya a suspect involved in the bombing of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the Kenya Criminal Investigation
Department (CID) confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the CID told Xinhua by phone that the
Kenya police are now interrogating the suspect and may issue a
press statement later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Mohammad Sadik Howaida, was
arrested soon after his arrival at Pakistan's Karachi airport
from Nairobi on August 7, the day when two almost simultaneous
bomb blasts killed 257 people in east Africa, according to an
earlier statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist
acts, he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It identified Howaida as an "Arab national" without
elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan it usually means someone
from anywhere in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Howaida was detained at the Karachi airport
because immigration officials noticed the mismatch of him and the
photograph in the passport he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
At least five suspects were detained by the joint team of the
CID and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last week.
None of them has been charged now.
</P>
<P>
"A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the bomb blast," Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said in a statement issued last week.
</P>
<P>
A 20-strong team led by one Kenyan police officer and an FBI
special agent has been set up over the blast probe.
</P>
<P>
The team also keeps close connections with the probing over
another bomb blast in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, killing 10
people within minutes after the Nairobi explosion.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses here claimed that they saw a covered van,
three Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car
bomb blew up, leveling the five-story Ufundi Co-op House and
extensively damaging the U.S. embassy next door.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group self-declared as the Islamic Army
for the Liberation of Holy Places has claimed the responsibility
for the bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Washington has posted a reward of two million U.S. Dollars for
information leading to the conviction of the bombers.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Cuts Short Vacation Over Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
cut short his vacation Monday to return to the Kremlin to meet
with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko amid worsening crisis in the
country's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the central bank lowered its target exchange
rate for the ruble from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government announced that it would
restructure its short-term debts by converting government GKO
treasury bills into new securities, imposing a 90-day moratorium
on payments of ruble-denominated foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the government and the central bank said
they will revise the parameters of the exchange rate policy and
techniques of rate setting as the original rate-setting practice
was no longer desirable.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the Russian Central Bank will set the
official exchange rate at the end of every day by the results of
exchange operations on the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation is expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, but would raise the prices of imports in Russia, which
depends heavily on foreign-produced goods, including more than
half the food sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous financial fluctuations that barely affected
the lives of ordinary Russians, the government's latest move
would make most residents feel the pinch in the face of price
hikes and inflation.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government
actions are "above all to protect the citizens of Russia and
domestic manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
"The state has made its choice in their favor over the
players on the foreign exchange market and the market of
short-term government securities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, for his part, said the
devaluation would also help encourage investment in the country's
industry.
</P>
<P>
Many Russian banks are expected to go bankrupt in the
aftermath of the ruble devaluation as most are over-dependent on
now devalued ruble assets, but the government has promised to
pool the resources of leading banks to minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government and the Central Bank are also
urging parliament to tighten control over the exodus of currency
resources to other countries, the Itar-Tass news agency said.

XI'AN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Damo (Vast Desert) Vegetable
Company in Yulin, northwest China's Shanxi Province, currently
supplies major hotels and foreign embassies in Beijing with
pollution-free off-season vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm, based in Beijing's

discounted prices. The agreement also calls for the demonstration
farm to provide Damo with advanced vegetable production technology
and improved seeds.
</P>
<P>
Yulin, located on the southern edge of the Muus Desert,
offers ample sunshine and pollution-free air which provide an
ideal environment for vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the farm said Damo, a venture which grows
vegetables on 213 hectares, was selected due to low production
costs in the region and Yulin's advantageous geographical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing demonstration farm employs over 200 people and
supplies vegetables to major luxury hotels and foreign embassies
in Beijing, as well as various overseas markets. The farm also
imports advanced technology and high quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
The farm also grows flowers and fruit trees and has established
production bases throughout China.

PANZHIHUA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- International bidding has
ensured the outstanding construction, technology and management of
the Ertan Hydropower Station scheduled for completion by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The station, the largest facility of its kind in China,
commenced partial operations last week. Ertan is China's first
large construction project to introduce international bidding for
major projects contracts involving sums ranging from hundreds of
thousands of yuan (8.3 yuan to one US dollar) to over two billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The project is located in Panzhihua, southwest China's Sichuan
Province. A consortium of five companies from Italy, France and
China has been selected for the dam project, with a second
consortium of companies from Germany and China winning the bid for
underground projects.
</P>
<P>
The successful bid process will not only enable China to import
design and production technology for the 550,000-kwh
turbogenerator, but will reduce the generator's projected per kwh
cost from 52 US dollars to 43 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology, equipment and management will reduce the
construction period by 21 months and yield economic benefits of
13.6 billion yuan. In addition, the early operation will enable
the station to pay three billion yuan in taxes well ahead of
schedule.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A South African Air Force
Boeing-707 plane has evacuated more than 90 refugees from
Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sowetan newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
These foreign nationals arrived in Pretoria Sunday, the paper

The evacuation was made following the tension mounting in
democratic Congo where rebel forces were said to be pushing
toward the capital of Kinshasa in a bid to overthrow President
Laurent Kabila's regime.
</P>
<P>
Kabila assumed the state power after his forces overthrew the
32-year-old Mobutu Sese Seko's rule in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the evacuated were 26 South Africans, 13 Germans, 13
Tanzanians, eight Israelis, seven Canadians, 15 Swiss citizens,
eight Iranians, and a number of people from Britain, Demark,
Sweden, Portugal, Turkey and the Central African Republic.
</P>

The rebels, who are soldiers of Congo's ethnic Tutsi minority
and disgruntled members of Kabila's military, said that they were
planning a final drive to capture Kinshasa in the few days. They
have taken several ports in the west and the river port of Matadi
and threatened to march on to Kinshasa from Mbanza Ngungu, a
military base 120 km southwest of the capital.

<HEADLINE> Schlumberger First With Complete Smart Card Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The France-based Schlumberger
Ltd has recently successfully launched a complete smart card
solution meeting the specifications of China's new nation-wide
financial chip-card project, believed to be the first company of
its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The smart payment card, named Qianflex (flexible currency) and
designed to provide China with a national chip--card standard to
modernize the country's banking system and to support its
transition towards an efficient cashless society, has been
specified by the People's Bank of China, according to a source of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
It delivers a complete solution which includes the smart cards,
Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals, Security Access Module (SAM), and
Personalization services. And the solution is expected to provide
the commercial banks of China with the ability to quickly and
easily implement their nation-wide off-line, debit transactions
systems and electronic purse.
</P>
<P>
As a member of a small group of international experts in smart
cards invited by the People's Bank of China to help draft China's
new chip-card specification, Schlumberger has been involved with
the payment card project from the early stages, while serving as a
consultant of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The newly established platform satisfies the application of IC
(integrated circuit) cards issued by commercial banks in China. It
thus ensures compatibility among these banks, as well as with the
EMV (Europay-Master-Card-Visa) standard for payment cards allowing
for the first time global interoperability for China's financial
cards.
</P>
<P>
Schlumberger is one of the international leaders in oilfield
services, natural resource management, transaction-based
technology and associated systems, and semiconductor test
equipment. Its revenue registered at 10.65 billion U.S. dollars
last year.

<HEADLINE> Customs Union Planned in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The east African region is
considering to establish a customs union so as to curb smuggling
and diversion of uncustomed goods.
</P>
<P>
The planned union will make it possible for importers of
land-locked Uganda to pay their taxes at the Kenyan port of
Mombasa, a leading African port at the Indian Ocean, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Uganda tax official said last week that the World
Bank has approved a study for the establishment of such a union.
Uganda heavily depends on Mombasa for its imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ocailap, the Ugandan Commissioner in charge of Tax
Policy at the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
Development, said the plan has been under discussion since April
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, its implementation would not be possible before
certain issues such as the convertibility of the Kenyan
Shillings, were sorted out.
</P>
<P>
Commodities such as oil fuel and cigarettes are most affected.
Industry estimates put Uganda's annual revenue losses through
cigarette smuggling at between 7.5 million U.S. Dollars and 10
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lower tax rates in both Kenya and Tanzania have led to
increased cigarette smuggling as smugglers are able to sell their
products at half the price of those who pay tax.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of uncustomed goods has been a regional problem
for years. Since the forming of the East African Cooperation,
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have been looking into ways of
tackling the problem jointly.

WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister

PANZHIHUA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ertan Hydro-electric
Power Station in the city of Panzhihua in Sichuan Province, the
country's largest to be completed this century, is expected to
produce 1.5 billion kwh of electricity this year.
</P>
<P>
The station will have six 550,000-kwh generators. The first
went online on August 12, and the second will begin production
later this year. The six can produce 17 billion kwh of electricity
a year, producing daily revenues of 20 million yuan (2.4 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Hydro-electric Power Development Co Ltd. signed a
contract with the Sichuan Provincial Power Company in 1995 for
14.6 billion kwh of power normally and 8.4 billion kwh at peak
periods.
</P>
<P>
An adjusted plan following the establishment of the Chongqing
municipality in March, 1997 stipulates that Sichuan will use 68.5
percent of the electricity and Chongqing will get the rest.
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual power output of both Sichuan and Chongqing is
552 kwh. Demand is expected to increase remarkably when
state-owned enterprises get out of their financial difficulties
within three years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Revises Ruble's Exchange Corridor, Suspends  Loans Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Central Bank on Monday
raised the upper limit of the ruble's exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar to 9.5 rubles to one dollar, Itar-Tass news agency
quoted the government's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the government and the central bank
said they will revise the parameters of the exchange rate policy
and techniques of rate setting as the original rate-setting
practice was no longer desirable.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the Russian Central Bank will set the
official exchange rate at the end of every day by the results of
exchange operations on the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to convert GKO treasury bills
into new securities. A 90-day moratorium is also imposed on
payments for financial credits received from Russian
non-residents, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
As the government scrambles to cope with the financial
crisis, President Boris Yeltsin will again cut short his vacation
and return to the Kremlin shortly to meet with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, the Interfax news agency quoted a presidential
spokesman as saying.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Sailing Record Shattered </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Bruno Peyron
skippered the Explorer to shatter the record for sailing across
the Pacific on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sailing aboard the 26.2-meter catamaran the Explorer, Peyron
and his international crew on Sunday crossed under the majestic
Golden Gate Bridge 14 days, 17 hours and 22 minutes after they
embarked from Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
The Explorer's time knocked nearly two days off the record
previously held by millionaire stock options trader Steve
Fossett, who in August 1995 crossed the Pacific with a crew of
three in 16 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Peyron and his crew's triumph on Sunday came as
Fossett, who was trying to become the first person to circle the
globe nonstop in a ballon, was forced to crash-land his balloon
in shark-infested waters in the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Causes of Yangtze Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A long period of heavy rains and
soil erosion are among the major reasons for the flooding on the
Yangtze River, and they still exist, analysts point out.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the water level on the Yangtze below the Shishou
section in Hubei Province had been above the danger mark for about
50 days and posed a serious threat to the embankments.
</P>
<P>
Rainstorms at the end of June around Dongting and Boyang lakes
were primarily responsible for pushing up water levels on a
more-than-800-kilometer stretch of the river. And more than a
month later, heavy rains are still hitting Sichuan Province on the
upper reaches, making the flood situation worse.
</P>
<P>
In addition, soil erosion caused by the random cutting of trees
and the damage done to vegetation on the upper reaches have made
the flooding worse.
</P>
<P>
The disaster is also a result of reduced flood diversion and
storage capacity. The area of eight major lakes along the Yangtze
is down by 33 percent, or over 5,500 square kilometers, from the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
When these are combined, even though the amount of
precipitation that has fallen this summer does not exceed that of
1954, the problem of the middle and lower reaches is considered
higher, experts say.

CANBERRA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimming sensation
Ian Thorpe will compete in six events at next month's Kuala
Lumpur Commonwealth Games, including the 200m butterfly he has
before never contested at a major international meet.
</P>
<P>
The addition of the 200m fly will give Thorpe six events in

both men's freestyle relays.

The 15-year-old Sydney schoolboy, who became Australia's
youngest male world swimming champion at January's Perth
championships, is not even ranked in the top 50 over the 200m
butterfly.

But his rapid improvement has prompted head coach Don Talbot

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Further Develop Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
undertake a program to develop the sugar industry to meet the
growing domestic demand for the product, according to the fifth
five-year (1998-2002) plan document.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, 15 existing sugar mills will be modernized
or expanded and rehabilitated, The Bangladesh Observer daily
reported Monday, quoting the document.
</P>
<P>
The total cane crushing capacity of the 15 sugar mills is
21,044 tons per day, and over 200,000 tons of cane can be produced
annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the expansion program, three new sugar mills
will be set up. Besides, the government has also opened the sugar
sector to private investment in a bid to expedite the industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's yearly demand for sugar is about 375,000 tons
against the production of 215,000 tons, and about 150,000 tons of
sugar are imported to meet the requirement every year.
</P>
<P>
The demand will increase to about 400,000 tons during
2000-2001, the document says, adding that the deficit will further
rise unless additional sugar production capacity is installed at
suitable locations of cane-growing regions.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Tourism Continues to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, Aguest 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's tourist industry
continued its downturn in the first three months this year as the
number of foreign tourists went down by 9.2 percent over the same
period of last year to 857,000 arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures issued by the Tourism Ministry show that
tourists from Germany, Russia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Poland and
Ukraine in the quarter slid by 13 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the decline was partly offset by rises from tourists
from France, Italy, Israel, Czech and Slovak, ranging from 12
percent to 25, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty five percent of foreign tourists came from European
countries, with half a million on vacations.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, over 1.58 million Romanians traveled
abroad, an increase of 27.5 percent from the same quarter last
year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Romania earned 0.52 billion U.S. dollars from tourism last
year, the lowest among the countries in central and east Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Sorin Frunzaverde blamed obsolete facilities
and bad service for the decline.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government would give priority to the
development of tourism and offer preferential policies to the
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the 16 overseas branches of his ministry to
conduct promotion in Europe, Northeast Asia and North America to
attract more tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Sunday issued an updated "worldwide caution" to U.S. travelers and
specifically warned "against all travel to Pakistan" because of
the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and threats
to U.S. interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department announced that it had ordered the
departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees
from the embassy at Islamabad. It also ordered U.S. personnel in
those categories out of consulates in Karachi, Lahore and
Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement that airports were
open and commercial flights were available. In addition, the U.S.
government was arranging additional flights for the departure.
</P>
<P>
"American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged to consider
carefully their security situation and, in light of the ordered
departure of all non-emergency official personnel, to consider
seriously departing Pakistan," the travel warning said.
</P>
<P>
The department issued a similar worldwide caution hours after
the August 7 embassy explosions referred only to the potential for
further threats, the updated version put out Sunday referred to
"subsequent threats."
</P>
<P>
The "worldwide caution" urged "U.S. citizens traveling or
residing abroad to exercise much greater than usual caution and
review security practices."
</P>
<P>
"Because of the possibility that U.S. embassy facilities in a
number of locations could be targeted, visitors should remain
alert to the changing situation and exercise extreme caution," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Sunday's warning, the department ordered family
members and non-emergency U.S. government personnel to leave Kenya
and Tanzania as well as Albania and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that embassy operations have been suspended
in Somalia, Sudan, Republic of Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic
Republic of Congo and Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
It also asked Americans in some other countries, where the
United States does not maintain diplomatic or consular posts and
no support services are available to them, to take "additional and
enhanced precautions."

BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Ministry would
delay the building of Bangkok's first subway as the signing of
three key deals was blocked, the Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has not yet allowed project owner, the
Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority (MRTA), to sign the three
contracts essential for the subway construction.

MRTA director Prapat Chongsanguan said his agency was waiting

(212.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The three contracts comprise a 6.3-billion-baht (157.5 million
dollars) deal to design and build subway depot; a 1.8-billion-baht
(45 million dollars) deal to design and install station elevators
and escalators; and a 400-million-baht (10 million dollars)
contract to oversee depot construction, installation of subway
tracks, a subway operating system, and the subway concession.
</P>
<P>
The contracts should have been signed in May so that the
project could be completed by 2000, as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The issue was sent to the cabinet secretariat last December but
cannot be forwarded to the cabinet for final approval until the

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The comprehensive bank reform
package announced by the Thai government last Friday has won
support from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Post reported Monday that opposition leader and former
prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has pledged full support to
the reform package, saying the measures were the only choice left
for the country.
</P>
<P>
In a rare statement in support of the Chuan Leekpai
administration, Chavalit said the public would have to put their
faith in the government as the country could no longer rely on
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He also said the opposition, led by his New Aspiration Party,
was ready to cooperate with the government on three executive
decrees, under which the government will issue bonds worth 300
billion baht (7.5 billion U.S. dollars) to help the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai thanked the opposition
leader for his promised support of the executive decrees, which
are expected to reach the Parliament on August 26.
</P>
<P>
The opposition whips are due to meet Monday to discuss the
decrees and find possible loopholes so that they can make
suggestions and ensure the implementation of the reform package
will create good results.
</P>
<P>
The government announced last Friday a comprehensive bank
reform package, under which seven more financial institutions
would be taken over by the government.
</P>
<P>
The package will totally change the landscape of the country's
banking sector through merger and selling.
</P>

NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
-- The United States is not only sending back more Indian
scientists in the country but is also holding back defense and
scientific equipment sent by India for testing.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Challenges faced by the agricultural sector are enormous in
the context of the globalization of the Indian economy.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Doctors in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Seamus Ryan is one of 84 foreign
doctors treating mostly foreigners and wealthy Chinese in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After working at the Sino-U.S. Beijing United Family Hospital
for more than a year, Ryan says his decision to practice medicine
in the Chinese capital was unthinkable to his friends back home in
Ireland. Some Irish saw his trip to China as strange as travelling
to the Moon.
</P>
<P>
The cost of seeing a foreign doctor in the Chinese capital is
much greater than seeing a Chinese doctor. In Ryan's hospital, for
example, it costs 7,000 to 10,000 US dollars to deliver a baby,
more than ten times the cost at other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
But, there are some 80,000 foreigners and people from Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao in Beijing every day, and, Ryan explains,
"They will need me, if they fall ill." Language problems are
perhaps the major factor for foreigners wanting to see a foreign
doctor, but they also need a familiar environment where they can
talk with doctors easily.
</P>
<P>
Foreign doctors have to pass exams to get a certificate to
practise medicine in China, which went into effect in 1993. A
deputy head of the Beijing Asia Emergency Assistance Center says
that the regulation of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau is
necessary and helps his hospital get better doctors.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A police-army joint team Sunday
discovered over 100 kilograms of high-powered explosives concealed
by Tamil rebels in a house in Kandy city in central Sri Lanka,
according to reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two rebel cadres who were occupying the house at the time of
the dawn operation swallowed cyanide capsules to escape capture.
One of them died on the spot while the other was in a critical
condition, the reports quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 boxes of high-powered explosives weighing nine
kilograms each were found in a secret compartment in the kitchen
of the house.
</P>
<P>
The team also unearthed some detonators and seized a van used
by the two rebel cadres from Batticalao in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The house belonging to a Sinhalese was shared by a Burgher
family and the two rebels.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the raid was conducted on information
that the Tamil rebels were planning a series of major attacks from
this hide-out.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the country.

<HEADLINE> Per Capita National Income Increases in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's per capita national
income was 255 U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended
in March, increasing by 2.7 percent over the previous year,
according to a latest official annual report on economic status
available here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, per capita consumption also increased to 191
dollars, up 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar plans to attain 278 dollars or a 4.2 percent growth for
its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in the present 1998-99
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Due to impact of the Asian financial turmoil, Myanmar was
unable to achieve the economic targets in 1997-98 set for such
sectors as agriculture, processing and manufacturing, forestry,
energy and mining except for the sectors of posts and
telecommunications, construction, transport and livestock and
fishery.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP registered a 4.6 percent increase in 1997-98
against the target of 6.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Krung Thai Bank Plans to Sell Shares to Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Krung Thai Bank (KTB) plans to
sell 20 percent of its shares to foreign investors two years after
its merger with First Bangkok City Bank (FBCB) and Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC), according to KTB President Sirin Nimmanahaeminda.
</P>
<P>
The move had been prompted by the Thai government's
comprehensive financial-sector reform package announced on Friday,
which requires that KTB be privatized in two year and sell some
shares to foreign investors after integrating with the two ailing
banks.
</P>
<P>
However, this will depend on KTB's potential and the economic
situation in the next years, The Nation newspaper Monday quoted
Sirin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's reform package, FBCB will be taken over
by KTB while BBC will become a non-banking financial institution
or an asset-management company. At the same time, BBC's good
assets, along with its deposits and other liabilities, will go to
KTB.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, KTB will become the strongest commercial bank
in Thailand with assets topping 1,300 billion baht (35 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Set to Testify in Lewinsky Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
spent hours on Sunday with lawyers to prepare for his grand jury
testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, news reports increased on the weekend quoting
unidentified sources as saying that Clinton might be ready to
testify that he had an "inappropriate relationship" with Monica
Lewinsky, reversing his denial last January that he had sexual
relations with her.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky reportedly has testified that she had a sexual affair
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, said in a
statement issued by the White House on Sunday, "There is
apparently an enormous amount of groundless speculation about the
president's testimony tomorrow. The truth is the truth. Period.
And that's how the president will testify."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was scheduled to give sworn testimony on Monday about
his relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
before special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's legal team.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to testify from the White House on Monday at 1 p.m.
EDT (1700 GMT) before independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr has been investigating Clinton for years over a variety
of matters including the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
White House officials indicated it was likely Clinton would
make a televised address after testifying but said there would be
no decision on this before Monday, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> hke081709 -Thailand May Cut Power Generation Due To Over Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (Egat) may suspend the operation of some of
its power plants due to excessive production capacity and the drop
in national demand, The Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Plants may be necessary from 2001 through 2005 when generating
capacity reserves are forecast to soar to 60-68 percent against
the normal level of only 25 percent of the installed capacity, the
newspaper quoted Egat senior officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many independent and small power producers have postponed
electricity sales to Egat and many power station projects have
been put off, but the remaining reserves are still considered very
high.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, electricity generating reserves are expected to be
9,600 megawatts, representing 60 percent of Egat's total planned
installed capacity of 16,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
To match the desired reserve scale, reserves in 2001 should be
reduced by at least 4,600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The plants that are expected to suspend operation are fired by
fuel oil.

A Myanmar delegation, led by Minister of Agriculture and

<HEADLINE> Philippines Lowers Revenue Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
agreed to scale down its revenue target for 1998 by 12 percent to
466.08 billion pesos (about 11.1 billion U.S. dollars) from the
531.3 billion pesos (12.65 billion dollars) set earlier.
</P>
<P>
Lower tax collections, particularly by the Bureau of Customs,
prompted the government to take the move, Business World reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in imports due to the continued fluctuation of the
peso, as well as the expected slower growth in exports made the
Bureau of Customs cut its projected collections by 33 percent to
78.3 billion pesos (1.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reduced revenues mean that the government will have to cut
its planned spending for the period by 4 percent to 506.08 billion
pesos (12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the lower expenditure program, and the adoption of
certain belt-tightening measures such as the 25-percent mandatory
cut on budget items, the Philippine government will still incur an
overall fiscal deficit of at least 40 billion pesos (952 million
dollars) for the year, according to Finance Department estimates.
</P>
<P>
This deficit is seen leading to an increase in the consolidated
public sector deficit to 74.57 billion pesos (1.78 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The economic managers of the Joseph Estrada administration
cited as reasons for the revenue losses the lingering effects of
the currency crisis as well as the growing accounts payable of the
government and the alleged window-dressing of the previous
administration.

KIEV, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine absorbed 517.7 million
U.S. dollars in the first half of 1998, an increase of 54.3
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian State Committee for Statistics Sunday attributed
the rapid growth to a series of government measures designed to
encourage foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ukraine marked three economic zones in
Donetsk and adopted a preferential tax policy for foreign-invested
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years since independence, Ukraine has
received a total of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
investment. Foreign investors often complained about the country's
poor investment environment, loophole-fraught legal system and
rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
The United States topped the list of major investors with 430
U.S. dollars. The Netherlands came second with 230 million

<HEADLINE> Fire Continues to Ravage Italian Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires continued to rage
through parts of Italy Sunday with some 300 conflagrations being
reported to fire-fighting authorities over the last 24 hours
alone.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that record-high temperatures and strong
winds were largely to blame for the dramatic situation with the
regions of Calabria, Lazio and Umbria currently providing the
greatest source for concern.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighters said that in Catanzaro in Calabria, a huge fire
to the north of the city was threatening suburban dwellings and a
hospital, while some ten smaller fires were simultaneously raging
on.
</P>
<P>
In Umbra, some 50 hectares of forest were consumed by flames
Sunday and fire fighters were still battling to stop the blaze
from advancing any further.
</P>
<P>
But reports of serious fires were pouring in from all over the
country, from Sicily, Sardinia and Campania in the south to
Abruzzo in central Italy and the Marches and Liguria in the north.
</P>
<P>
It has been a particularly disastrous year of fire with almost
68,000 hectares of forest and woodland ending up in flames in July
alone, compared to 32,000 hectares the previous July.
</P>
<P>
As much as 90 percent of the fires are believed to be produced
by human. Suspected culprits include farmers trying to expand
arable land, building speculators clearing land for construction,
and even friends and colleagues of fire-fighters who get lavish
bonuses for every blaze they put out.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the emergency, Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano signed a decree on August 6 earmarking 20 billion lire
(11 million dollars) for the regions of Calabria, Sicily and
Sardinia.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier on Meeting with Clinton, Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Romano Prodi said
his talks in New York next month with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair will focus on peace,
employment and problems of the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed Sunday by the public television Rai, Prodi said he
and leaders of other countries have been talking for months about
meeting systematically to discuss the issues to "help each other
to solve the problems of the world: peace, employment,
international balances and also the problems of the poorest
countries."
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled for September 21.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very careful in preparing statements, no
pre-eminence for the United States, no issues closed off within
Europe, great openness towards Brazil, which will be present, and
to all the new democracies emerging around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the type of climate he and his government can expect
form the September meeting, Prodi said he hopes it will be
favorable because he and his aides have been busy preparing to do
everything to further the fight against unemployment and bolster
the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Events in Asia have struck the European economy and especially
the Italian economy. Now we are thinking of remedying this, and
the international dialogue we have opened in these days is aimed
precisely at giving an international response to international
problems. Our response as a single country is not enough."

<HEADLINE> IMF Supports Higher Interest Rates in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) backs the move of the Philippine central bank to temporarily
jack up overnight interest rates to defend the peso from continued
speculative attacks, local newspaper Today reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly a courageous step and necessary, and the
outcome so far is very positive," IMF representative to the
country Henri Lorie was quoted as saying over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea for how long should the Philippine central
bank's higher overnight rates remain but we should not recommend
lowering the rates too rapidly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lorie's statement came a few hours before the Monetary Board,
the monetary policy maker of the central bank, decided to maintain
the higher overnight rates, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted central bank governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that the Monetary Board arrived at a conclusion that "we
should not yet reduce our overnight rates back to pre-August 10
level."
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the central bank hiked its overnight borrowing and
lending rates by two percentage points to 15 percent and 17
percent respectively when the peso fell to a fresh seven-month low
of 44.79 pesos per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, the peso was subjected to further
speculative attacks. Instead of intervening in the foreign
exchange market, the central bank raised again the overnight
borrowing and lending rates by two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The higher interest rates were designed to help stabilize the
peso by making investments in peso-denominated debt instruments
more attractive than the greenback and reducing the peso liquidity
in the market.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists said the central bank's higher
overnight rates will push up the interest rates of commercial
banks and finally dampen the country's economic growth.

TAIYUAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The major economic indicators of

this year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product of Shanxi was 69.2 billion yuan in

<HEADLINE> Davenport Beats Hingis to Win Acura Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The world second-ranked
Lindsay Davenport of the United States beat the top-ranked
Martina Hingis of Switzerland 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 to win the Acura
Classic tournament Sunday in Manhattan Beach, Carlifornia of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Davenport broke Hingis in the third game of the final set.
After saving a break point in the eighth game, Davenport hit a
backhand winner on a long rally to claim her second victory over
Hingis this year and the 79,000 U.S. dollars first prize.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who extended her winning streak to 11 matches,
will move within 444 points of Hingis in the WTA rankings
released Monday. She could end Hingis' 17-month reign at the top
spot with a victory at the U.S. Open, although she never has won
a Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Davenport claimed her fourth title of the
year,17th overall and fifth in her home state. She won the Bank
of the West Classic in Stanford two weeks ago and the Toshiba
Tennis Classic last week in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she handed Hingis her second loss of the year
with a victory in the final of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo in
February.
</P>
<P>
With the defeat, Hingis remains without a title since the
Italian Open in early May. Her season record fell to 45-8 after
she lost just five matches all of last year.

CANBERRA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Northern Ireland peace process was in tatters Sunday
after a car comb ripped through the center of the town of Omagh,
killing at least 28 people and injuring more than 200.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The tax reform package unveiled last week has given the
Australian federal government a six-point bounce back into
contention, with gains at Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party's
expense, but it is still trailing the opposition party the
Australian Labor Party, a poll conducted over the past two days
has found.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Owen Wraps up Liverpool Win in English Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Michael Owen mania hit the south
coast at the English premier league on Sunday when the teenage
superstar sealed the points for Liverpool in his first game since
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The country's most talked about player struck from eight yards
after 73 minutes to get the Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier
managerial partnership off to a flying start.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old proved his predatory instincts by pouncing
when the ball ricocheted around the Southampton area after keeper
Paul Jones flapped at Steve Staunton's long throw.
</P>
<P>
But Saints were unhappy that the goal had been allowed. They
were down to 10 men at the time because referee Paul Alcock had
refused to let Jason Dodd back on the pitch after he was treated
for an injury.
</P>
<P>
The winner was no less than Liverpool deserved, though, after
dominating a largely poor match.
</P>
<P>
Southampton had gone ahead after 36 minutes, when Norwegian
frontman Egil Ostenstad powered home a header from Stuart
Ripley's cross.
</P>
<P>
But Owen was not to be kept out of proceedings for long and
within two minutes he had helped put the Anfield giants on level
terms.
</P>
<P>
The England star picked up the ball on the left and floated a
perfect cross into the box for strike partner Karl Heinz Riedle
to nod in the equaliser.
</P>
<P>
The goals came out of the blue to illuminate a dour first
half, which failed to live up to an explosive opening.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ince came close to opening the scoring after just 16
seconds, unleashing a rasping 30 yard drive which a sprawling
Jones turned around the post.
</P>
<P>
And after three minutes Jones again had to be at his sharpest
to deny Owen from close range.
</P>
<P>
It took 24 minutes for Saints to have their first real chance.
New signing Mark Hughes took the ball around Brad Friedel, but
the angle was too tight and his shot could only find the side
netting.
</P>
<P>
Once Liverpool went ahead Saints tried in desperation to
salvage a point, but Friedel saved well from former Blackburn
youngster James Beattie.
</P>
<P>
Then, with little more than a minute to go, substitute Matt Le
Tissier spun in the area but dragged his snap-shot just wide of
the post.
</P>
<P>
In the first division Crystal Palace, managed by former
England boss Terry Venables, were still looking for their first
win of the season after crumbling 3-1 at Birmingham.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Denies Sampras No. 1 Ranking </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- American Pete Sampras Sunday
was denied in his quest to regain the world No. 1 ranking as
Australian Patrick Rafter beat him in the final of the 2.45
million U.S. dollars ATP Championship in Ohio, the United States.
</P>
<P>
All Sampras had to do to end Chilean Marcelo Rios' one-week
reign as the top-ranked player was to win this event. But
Rafter,the fifth seed, broke Sampras for the only time in the
ninth game of the final set and served out the 1-6, 7-6 (7-2),
6-4 victory. Rafter claimed his second straight Super 9 title and
the first prize of 361,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who will defend his U.S. Open title later this month,
lost his serve twice in the one-sided first set, but recovered to
overcome 17 aces as he extended his winning streak to 10 matches
and win for only the second time in 10 meetings with Sampras.
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's triumph, the 25-year-old Rafter became the
first Australian male to win four titles in one year since Rod
Laver in 1975, and the second player to win back-to-back Super 9
titles this year.
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked third in the world, Rafter captured his
sixth career ATP Tour title. In addition to his victory last
week, Rafter has claimed tournament titles in India and the
Netherlands this year.
</P>
<P>
Rois will hang on to the top ranking despite losing his
second round match on Tuesday and firing his coach. Sampras
dropped out of the top spot on the ATP Tour rankings after losing
Andre Agassi of the United States in the quarterfinals in Toronto
last week.
